I do not intend to oppose the proposed salary for the commissioner, but I would point out that the inspectors will have very important work to do. For such a position we want a man of the calibre of one of the best accountants to be obtained, and a man of that kind cannot very well begot under £1,000 a year. These officers may be taken from the civil service, but at the same time there ought to be the fullest possible discretion in making the appointments. While I am in favour of exhausting the civil service, I do think that in this sort of appointment, if exactly the man or the whole of the men which we want cannot be obtained from the service, the Executive ought to have the freest possible hand. Each of the inspectors will really be the commissioner for the particular State to a large extent,although objection has been raised to the term sub-commissioner. I do not know whether there will be any opportunity,should it be found difficult to get men at the price, to bring the matter before Parliament again and have the salary altered elsewhere; but I would ask the Minister to consider whether a salary of £1,000 would not be better than £800.Amendment agreed to ; clause, as further amended, agreed to.Clause 6 -) The commissioner or any inspector may be suspended from his office by the Governor-General for inability incapacity misbehaviour or incompetence bub shall not be removed from office except as hereinafter provided.","N/A","PUBLIC SERVICE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[10]/interjection/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Whether a man is permanently incapable becomes sometimes a very difficult question. A man may be practically incapable, and yet not permanently incapable. It may be certified perhaps that in two or three years the officer -may recover his vigour and capacity, and it could not be said then that he was permanently incapable ; while for the purpose of the duties of his office he would be permanently incapable. I do not -know whether questions cf law could not be raised in this matter even against the Government. Suppose a man is, under these words, deprived of his office by the Government, under a certificate that lie would be incapable for two or three years.

66,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"DEAKIN, Alfred","009MD","N/A","Protectionist","N/A",2069,"- The purpose of this amendment is to meet a difficulty to which attention was called during the discussion of the Bill. It was pointed out that if we permanently fixed the salary of an officer, and afterwards desired to increase- that salary, the question might be raised whether, having once fixed it, we should have the power to raise it, and it was urged that in nearly every case it was not the salary of the officer but that attached to the office that it was desired to fix. It was mentioned that in post-offices, where the business is . not growing, there are positions which may be worth £150, or £200, or £250 per year, and are never likely to be worth more, and that a man would have to leave those positions and take up one to which a higher salary was attached in order to gain promotion. _ The salary of the office is fixed, and no increase of salary could be .given to him whilst he occupied a particular office. In order that there might be no confusion in regard to that, the words occupying any particular office are now introduced, so that the salary of the officer is fixed only whilst he occupies a particular office. If the officer is promoted, as he ma} be, to a much higher position, then the fixture of -, salary no longer obtains, so far as he is concerned. This amendment limits the general power of this clause, so that the salary of an- . officer is fixed only while he occupies a particular office, and the provision is a very de- sizable one in the interests of the officers themselves. The question asked by the honorable member for Bland is whether this provision will conflict with the provisions of clause 21. As far as the increases of salary are concerned - the regular increases that are given on the recommendation of the commissioner - it might. That is to say, that if the salary attached to a certain post office is fixed at £140 a year, and a man acting as postmaster obtains that £140, in order to secure the next increase that would be given, it would be necessary for him to be moved to a position in which he could earn £160, or if any alteration had taken place in the circumstances the post-office might be reclassified. I should take it that under this clause either one of these courses would probably be followed. It is possible for us to fix the value of an office, and yet place no limitation that would exclude an officer from coming under the operation of clause 21. It applies to all cases where there can be a fixture of the salary, and, as a matter of practical effect, it applies only to the post-offices and places of that sort where the offices have a fixed value.","N/A","PUBLIC SERVICE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[20]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I believe a number of persons are clinging, to the belief that -.under: this Bill they will, get the exceptional advantages they secured under the Acts of the different States. It cannot be- too clearly understood .that the Commonwealth service will be administered on . rules which; apply equally to every man, no matter- from what State he -comes, and .that had . better be understood as soon as . possible. On the other hand the words in the Constitution Act reserving, all accruing rights are words susceptible perhaps of legal interpretation by-and-by, in a sense opposite to that- in which I employ it-; but these are difficulties which will have to be worked out. The sooner it is understood throughout the whole service of the Commonwealth that once a. man becomes an officer of the Commonwealth lie is under a uniform .law, and: does not carry with him exceptional , advantages gained in the particular, part- of the continent from which he comes, the better it will be for. the service, and I think for-the Ministry. .Mi-. ISAACS (Indi.) - I should be very sorry if the words of- the honorable and learned member for East Sydney went out without any qualification. I think the Constitution secures- to every State officer in any department who has been transferred . to the Commonwealth all his existing, and . accruing, rights; and if in one State he happens to get a higher salary at the- time of the transfer than is provided for officers under- this Bill, he still retains that- higher salary. That must-be- understood, it seems to rue* .others wise we do not give effect to the provisions of the Constitution securing to transferred officers- theft existing and accruing rights.. If an officer changes his position under the Public Service Act oi  the Commonwealth, then of course he takes his new position with all the surrounding circumstances, but as long as- his position- is not changed, it is impossible to say that he is to fall into line with others who come into the Commonwealth -with lower- salaries. Whatever an officers rights may be in- a State, those lights come undiminished1 into the Commonwealth. But. if men in- the general division of the States have these rights preserved as appertaining to the general division, can get further privileges, come under different rules, with new- rights of- advancement under the Public Service Act,- then I do not see that they can say that their rights are infringed when they voluntarily come under an altogether different regime. That is the distinction:.: With regard to the officers who have been referred to, it seems to me that there is one consideration that ought to be borne in mind. There are officers in the general division, who have come over- from the States. Sub-clause -(6) of clause 21 provides that every such officer shall be - entitled, upon reaching the age of 21 years, to a salary of £110 per. annum, provided that he has- been employed for not less than three years in the public service, and shows by passing. the prescribed examination that- he is- capable of doing the work. All, therefore, that we. require are three things - age; length, of service, and capability. Now, there are a . number of officers who under the State laws have already proved  their capability, by reason of having passed, the clerical examination in the States. Having proved that upon one occasion, the Government ought not to require, them to prove it again.","N/A","PUBLIC SERVICE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[31]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I quite agree that an examination -should beheld in- all cases where men have - not proved their capability. But where they have shown their fitness by passing the- clerical examination in a State, I do not think they should be required to submit to a new examination. I suggest to the Government that they should make it perfectly clear that an officer must either show- that lie has passed the clerical examination in the State, or must submit to this- examination.Mr. HIGGINS.(Northern Melbourne).I wish to ask the Attorney -General a question which was referred- to the other night by the honorable member for Bourke. I am afraid that after all that has been said, an officer who is getting £132 per year in the- general division, and has passed an examination for- the clerical division, must be at a- great loss to understand the position which he really occupies. He wants to know whether, if he is transferred to the clerical division after this Bill comes into operation, he will get £110 or £132.

That is a question, surely, that ought to be answered. If I had to depend on the Constitution, I would not have the least difficulty in answering it.

Sub-clause (4) clearly points to the circumstance of a number of men who are at present in the general division, and who are hereafter to be favoured with a new and special method by which, if they qualify themselves, they can pass into the clerical division. The whole of the provisions in regard to that follow one after another in relation, it seems to me, to that particular class of person. For that particular class of person there is no escape if they desire it from the provision of subclause (4). But in cases such as the honorable and learned member speaks of, in which an officer has passed a State examination and has qualified for the transfer, I do not think, under any circumstances, that he would come within the sweep of that sub-clause. He has qualified himself already, and clause 61 supplies the only link necessary to make his position quite clear. In clause 61 we provide that -Any officer of a department transferred to the Commonwealth and any person in the public .railway or other services of a State so transferred, who has qualified to take any other position in the service of a State prior to such transfer shall, in the service of the Commonwealth, retain all the rights to promotion or transfer lie possessed in the service of the State at the time of such transfer.That confers a right first of all to be transferred to the clerical division, and there will be no vacancies declared in that division until the men in the various States, who have existing and accruing rights in the shape of having passed examinations, have been dealt with. These men will be entitled to priority without any competitive examination ; and being entitled to that priority, they take their new positions on the same terms that they previously enjoyed, and I am inclined to think that they carry with them their present salaries.","N/A","PUBLIC SERVICE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[33]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In a matter of this sort we ought to try to make the position for the officers as easy as possible, because a man, years after tin examination which he has passed, might he thoroughly efficient, and yet be unable to pass a prescribed technical examination, however simple. It is well known thatSuch cases have occurred, and it would be very hard to subject an officer to another examination in the federal service if he has already passed one in the State service of a sufficiently high standard. Perhaps the Government may be able to consider whether they cannot deal with this matter. I think that the Attorney-General might consider the point.

If legislation is passed in the future, and there are offices with head offices abroad which have practically located themselves here, and have practically become numbered among our Australian institutions by giving every possible safeguard to the public in the form of putting up deposits and showing that they have assets sufficient to provide for every possible claim, they should be treated, so far as our business is concerned, on exactly the same footing as the purely Australian societies. I think that for present purposes we shall be proceeding on safe lines if we restrict our operations to the mutual offices, leaving the Government to do justice by introducing legislation as soon as possible to any of those stable foreign institutions whose fame is world-wide.Mr.REID (East Sydney). - I indorse what has been stated by the honorable member for Wentworth. I would most strongly object to this limitation to Australian societies if I did riot take the same view as the honorable member - that at present the societies which have not their head offices here, are not under a sufficiently regulating law, whilst our own societies are to a certain extent. Our own societies, from the very fact that their head offices are here, carry on business under better conditions for us than do societies whose head offices are in foreign countries, and, therefore, in the absence of any law relating to such societies, I think we might accept this proposal, but on the distinct understanding that when other societies which have offices abroad are placed under a proper law which will safeguard the people who do business with them in Australia, they will be brought in on the same terms.","N/A","PUBLIC SERVICE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[50]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

But it might be held that the term Australian Mutual Office did not apply to an assurance office carrying on business wholly in Tasmania or wholly in Victoria. I think that a better expression would be -  A Mutual Office having its head office in Australia. There would also be great difficulty in interpreting the expression  Mutual Office. There are many so-called mutual offices which are worked on non-mutual principles - proprietary offices such as the honorable member for Wentworth has referred to. It is not the intention that offices such as those should be prescribed, but only offices whose operations are carried on solely upon the mutual benefit principle.Mr. REID(East Sydney). - I wish to say a word or two upon a matter which has not .yet been referred to. I wish to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the clause which we are now considering will leave the public servants of the Commonwealth in a position of danger such as has proved a great source of loss to the various State Governments. The .Bill provides that officers must retire at a certain age, or that under exceptional circumstances they may be allowed to remain on a year or two longer, so that where an officer has not been transferred from a State service, bringing with him pension rights, he may be suddenly deprived of his income. Although his life will be assured, that gives him no provision for subsistence, and in the States it was the experience that so many distressing cases arose under those circumstances that the Government Estimates were filled with special allowances to old officers who were practically out in the streets, and for whose support members were called upon to vote from motives of sheer humanity. The Bill, . as introduced, contained a provision under which officers would purchase annuities to take effect upon the event of their retiring at a certain age, but the Government have substituted for a provision for an annuity coupled with life assurance, a provision for life assurance only, so that the Common- . wealth Government may in the future find its finances exposed to derangements on account of grants to public servants which the experience of the States should have led us to provide against. It is too late now to go into the matter at any length, but 1 wish to express my very great regret that the Government have dealt with the matter in such a way that no substantial good will accrue to the public from this provision. A provision for life assurance is a good thing for the wives and children of the public servants, and we are all very glad to see that something has been done in that direction ; but the Commonwealth Government will be exposed, as the States Governments were exposed, to the risk of having to provide for old officers who may be sent out into the world without means of subsistence.","N/A","PUBLIC SERVICE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[53]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Of course, if the Government under these words can prescribe those other benefits, then the words are rather misleading, to say the least of them.

That is to say, the person whose life is assured, if there be a right to an annuity, will have to pay a great deal more. The matter is left in a most misleading way for the public servant.

They can bring political pressure to bear even after the determination of the Governor-General, so that by adopting the proposal which I have submitted we should not be * giving any more liberty to civil servants than they at present enjoy. The answer to the honorable and learned member for Indi is that whenever an appeal is made against the Governor-Generals decision. a commissioner would say - I cannot re-open the matter, the appeal is decided. But other appeals, which would not come under that objection, would still be open to the public service. Without some such provision we shall still allow civil servants, who have grievances by reason qf any executive determination to come, as they hitherto have done, to Members of Parliament, and the whole trouble we are trying to prevent will still be open.

This is perhaps the simplest Bill that has been, or is likely to be, brought before us. It provides for the recognition throughout the Commonwealth of the laws, the public Acts and records, and judicial proceedings of the States. As such it is practically an Evidence Bill, and is introduced under the specific power conferred by section 51 of the Constitution, sub-section (25), which empowers the Parliament to legislate in this direction. In this one particular we are authorized to determine in part, at all events, the procedure of State courts, and hence this measure relates to the whole of the proposed federal courts of the Commonwealth, from the High Court downwards. Generally speaking, we should have no power to deal with State courts, but in this measure they also are introduced. As honorable members will see, the Bill embraces clauses which have been taken from the English and State Acts, and, in one case, I think, from an Act of the United States. We provide for judicial notice of certain documents, of certain signatures, and of other matters. The measure is one purely for consideration in committee, because, beyond the fact that the clauses are collected together for a common purpose, they necessarily embrace separate subjects or separate stages and matters of procedure, and under these circumstances I should . be detaining the House if I were now to speak upon points which, if debated at all, will require to be discussed in detail in committee. The marginal notes will help to indicate in most cases the sources from which these clauses have been derived. The measure, though very short and comparatively simple, will be found extremely useful, especially as it provides for a uniform recognition of laws and records throughout the whole of the Commonwealth, by courts of the Commonwealth or courts of the State.","Second Reading","STATE LAWS AND RECORDS RECOGNITION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
291,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"ISAACS, Isaac","KJI","Indi","N/A","N/A",2090,"- This will no doubt be a very useful measure in many respects, but, although it is true the clauses are taken in very many instances from existing sections in other Acts, it seems to me that very grave doubts will exist as to whether some of these sections, as they at present stand, are constitutional. The Attorney-General has pointed out that this Bill comes under a particular power - and that is perfectly true - which authorizes the Commonwealth to pass legislation to secure the recognition throughout the Commonwealth of the laws, public acts and records, and judicial proceedings of the States. That is the extent of the power given by theConstitution, but this Bill will be found to deal with many private acts, documents, and records. It seems to me, therefore, at first sight, that it trenches upon State territory, and exceeds the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament. In other respects the clauses are adopted from some of the existing sections in terms which, although perhaps not intended to be so, are departures from the original, and which, as far as I can see at present, leave behind the original intention of the section. For instance, it is quite right to say that in one State where a public record is evidence that record should be judicially noticed in another State or proved in a particular way, and that a copy certified to in a particular way shall be evidence of that public record. That is what is done under existing Acts, but this Bill goes so far, in some cases, as to make a copy of such records evidence  whether the original would be evidence or not. In that respect some words have been omitted from the existing sections, which keep strictly to the point- I have mentioned. I have no doubt that this has been done by inadvertence, but when we come  to debate the matter in committee some light may be thrown upon it.","Second Reading","STATE LAWS AND RECORDS RECOGNITION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Though possibly it is not a measure which possesses many attractions to . the general public, it is undoubtedly a measure of the greatest consequence to the mercantile community ; and I desire to gratefully acknowledge the various suggestions which I have received in regard to it from representative commercial men. The Government feel that it is essential in connexion with the adoption of a uniform Tariff that there shall be a uniform system of administration, for a uniform Tariff might be rendered practically worthless by the absence of uniformity in administration. Uniformity of administration depends upon uniformity of legislation, which at the present time is, of course, conspicuous by its absence. It will be necessary that we shall at the earliest possible date put upon our statute book laws dealing generally with these questions. Various laws will be required for the purpose, but the chief of them is the Bill with which I am now dealing. I have seen it stated that the measure is an exact copy of the Victorian legislation ; but I can assure honorable members that it is nothing of the sort.","N/A","CUSTOMS BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

298,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"KINGSTON, Charles","KEW","N/A","N/A","N/A",2091,"- What harm would be done if it were ? At the same time, it would be strange indeed to find all the wisdom of Customs legislation concentrated in the measure adopted by one of the half-dozen States included in the Commonwealth. That cannot be said of the Customs regulation legislation of Victoria, so far as I know. For the purpose of framing uniform legislation, recourse has . been had to the Customs laws of the different States - to the New South Wales Acts equally with the Victorian Acts ; and Canada has not been forgotten, nor has the legislation of New Zealand, and of the United Kingdom. The Government have . been singularly fortunate in being able to command in connexion with this measure the services of the chief Customs officials of the various Australian States. It is to them that any credit for the form of the legislation which we propose to adopt will attach, and we cheerfully assume all the responsibility for whatever faults the measure may possess. In Dr. Wollaston, the Collector of Customs of Victoria ; in Mr. Lockyer, of New South Wales ; in Mr. - Irving, of Queensland ; in Mr. Stevens, of South Australia ; in Mr. Mason, of WesternAustralia ; and in Mr. Bernard, of Tas- mania, we have found gentlemen capable of giving us the sagest advice. They met , in conference for the purpose of deliberating upon the subject, and the -duty of framing the measure has been discharged  by them with an intelligence and industry which I am delighted to acknowledge. I -have thought it well in dealing with this matter not to slavishly - copy any of .the existing systems. These systems have been handed down to us from  time to time without much modification of the form which they originally possessed. In some instances they have struck us as cumbersome ; in others we have found provisions which there is little or no necessity to apply to the circumstances of to-day ; and we have done what we could to make the Bill as clear and readable as possible, so that Parliament may place in the hands of the community a measure which will not require legal assistance for its interpretation, but will be intelligible to the ordinary lay mind. We feel it necessary, as a matter of principle, to provide in the fullest imaginable way, consistent with fairness, for the protection of the revenue ; but at the same time we have endeavoured to avoid, as far as possible, unnecessary harassing of the mercantile community. We feel that the security of the revenue and the protection of the honest merchants who form the great bulk of our mercantile community, against the devious ways which lax legislation might permit, and which might subject them to unfair competition, are proper objects to pursue; but where those objects are attained, we desire, so far as we can, to avoid unnecessary interference with the ordinary commercial operations of the community. We feel also that the Bill is one which can be more properly dealt with in committee, and one in respect to which no long second reading speech is necessary. Having done our best, we present it for consideration in committee, not with any slavish attachment to line or letter, because we happen to be responsible for its present form, but, despite the jocular criticisms which have been heard from the other side of the chamber, with the intention of welcoming any real amendment which may be suggested, in order that we may do the best we can in respect to a measure which is undoubtedly not a party measure. AVe wish to place on the statute-book a measure under which all can work, and which, in due course, will be a suitable accompaniment to that uniform Tariff which we hope shortly to introduce, and in respect of which it is most likely there will be more room for differences of opinion than exists in respect to this measure. The Bill contains, to be precise, 263 clauses and three schedules ; but, for the comfort of honorable members, I should like to mention that the clauses are very short, and the Bill more condensed, and, I hope, more intelligible than the legislation of the States which deals with similar matters. It is intended that it shall commence upon a day to be fixed by proclamation. That is provided by clause 2, and honorable members can well understand that there will be no unnecessary delay in bringing it into force. It should, of course, precede the final adoption of the uniform Tariff, however much we may and will labour to bring that into force at the earliest possible date. The fourth clause is the interpretation clause, and honorable members will note that a large definition is there given to the term Answer questions and produce documents  - obligations which in various clauses of the measure are cast upon persons in connexion with Customs transactions. For the security of the revenue, it is highly desirable that the Customs authorities shall be in a position to obtain all necessary information as regards the value of goods and a variety of other matters. This information can be secured in two ways - by questioning, and by insisting upon the production of documents. It is to this end that these obligations are cast upon persons transacting Customs business, and the extended meaning which is given to the term is practically this: - That, as regards answering questions, the party questioned shall impart to the best of his knowledge all information which the Customs authorities have a right to know ; and as regards the production of documents, he shall similarly produce whatever documents are required relating to the goods in question. The  Customs  for the purposes of the measure is defined as the Department of Trade and Customs. The next clause to which I wish to call attention is clause 5, which enables me to avoid the necessity of providing time and again, in connexion with offences against the measure, that in the case of any contravention of the clause, on the conviction of the offender he shall be subject to this, that, and the other penalty.","N/A","CUSTOMS BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/speech[2]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Clause 5 makes the matter perfectly plain -The penalties referred to at the foot of sections indicate that any contravention of the section, whether by act or omission, shall be an offence against this Act, punishable upon conviction by a penalty not exceeding (except as hereinafter provided) the penalty mentioned.When in the light of a clause of that sort we find, as we do on various occasions at the foot of a clause, a specified penalty, we shall know perfectly well what it means, and there is no need for the idle repetition to which I previously referred. It is quite as effectual and more clear, and it saves time, and strikes the eye as we want the eye to be struck, giving as it does the gist of the provision. The second part of the Bill deals with the administration of the Department of Customs. Probably it will interest honorable members to know that the Department of Customs, as at present constituted, is responsible for the collection of between £7,000,000 and £8,000,000, and that there are between 1,100 and 1,200 persons employed in the department, or, to be precise, 1,133 persons, while the total expenditure, including cost of collection,  salaries, and everything else, does not amount, though it very closely approximates, to £250,000. The first clause of Part 2, relating to administration, simply declares that the Customs Acts shall be administered by the Minister of State for the Commonwealth administering the Customs.Of course, so far as Ministerial heads are concerned, they come and go. But we make the provision we have already made, so far as this House is concerned, for permanent heads, and on the excellence of the selection of the permanent head of the Customs department much depends. There must be one central controlling head to secure that uniformity which is so highly desirable in all federal matters. Provision is made for the appointment of this permanent controlling head in clause 7, which declares that there shall be a Comptroller-General of Customs, who, under the Minister, shall be the permanent head of the Customs, and shall have chief control of the Customs throughout the Commonwealth. Here 1 would like to inform honorable members that, subject of course to parliamentary approval, a selection has been made of the gentleman who will first occupy this highly responsible position. When I mention the name of Dr. Wollaston as the gentleman who, subject to the conditions I have previously mentioned, will receive this appointment, I believe I mention the name of a gentleman whose appointment will be as acceptable to all who know him, and all who are accustomed to Customs affairs, and have the interests of the department and of the public of Australia at heart, as I know it is to the other collectors of the different States which constitute the Commonwealth. He is a gentleman who will bring to bear in connexion with his duties a ripe experience, a keen intelligence, and, it seems to me, all those qualities that should be possessed by a gentleman appointed to a high and important post of the character to which I refer. Here I would like to say that in different clauses reference is made to the Minister, but we hold that. in matters requiring expert knowledge and permanent uniform control, the Minister .should interfere as little as may be necessary - absolutely necessary. While, of course, the Minister should retain the power which must accompany responsibility to Parliament, he should not at the same time unnecessarily interfere with the permanent head. I do not think that in connexion with Customs matters the charge has ever been made, or, if made at all, sustained, that there has been any political influence. It seems to me such influence would be impossible under the provisions contained in the Bill, and any amendment necessary to prevent it the Government will welcome, so long as the true constitutional position is secured - that those who are responsible to this House should have the necessary power to protect themselves in the proper execution of their duties.","N/A","CUSTOMS BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/speech[3]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It did not succeed, and I venture to say that in Australian politics it has hardly ever succeeded. I am pleased to think that, as regards the administration of public affairs, Australia holds a place - and properly so - in the respect of the civilized world for the honest discharge by the public Ministers of all Hie duties which properly attach to their offices. In clause 8 it is provided that there shall be a .Collector of Customs in each State, called in the clause the, chief officer, subject to the Comptroller. The system of the administration has been built up on this : The Minister controlling all, and responsible to Parliament ; subject to the Minister, the Comptroller; and, subject to the Comptroller, a chief officer or Collector of Customs for each State. In clauses 15, 17, 20, and 21 there are various provisions made for the appointment of ports, wharfs, boarding stations and places for the examination of goods, and for the licensing of carriages and lighters for the conveyance of goods, subject to the Comptroller of Customs. These provisions are usual and, of course, are necessary for the protection of the revenue. Clause 28, which is also to be found in Part 2, relating to administration, declares that the working days and hours in the Customs department shall be as prescribed by regulation. Except when working overtime, as permitted by the collector, cargoes shall only be received, loaded, worked, or discharged from any ship on working days, and during working hours. There is further provision that when overtime is permitted, overtime charges shall be made. So much as regards Part 2 of the Bill, relating to administration. Part 3 is of a general character, and, to my mind, gives a birds-eye view of the scheme which is properly the foundation OfCustoms Acts, and which may be shortly stated. For the protection of the revenue, imported goods shall, for a certain time be subjected to the control of the Customs, liable to examination by the Customs, for. the purpose of ascertaining their nature, and whether they are dutiable or not, and what the amount of duty may be. These goods are to be dealt with by entries, which are practically memorandums exchanged between all the parties interested in the goods and the Customs authorities, and in certain cases the goods are to be subject to securities, where securities are deemed necessary to be taken by the Customs authorities for the protection of the revenue? These four principles are practically embodied in Part 3 of the Bill - control, examination, entries, and securities. As to control, it is of course in the highest degree important to define when that commences and when it ends, and in clause 30 we find that attempted. It is declared that as regards all goods imported, they shall be subject to the control of the Customs from the time of actual importation until delivery for home consumption, or until exportation to parts beyond the seas, whichever first happens : in other words, until the duties are paid, or until the goods are sent beyond the Commonwealth. If the duties are paid the Customs are no more concerned with the goods ; if the goods have gone beyond the Commonwealth, they cease to be imports. As to goods under drawback, the control of the Customs commences from the time of the claim for the drawback until exportation into parts beyond the seas. If a merchant desires drawback in respect of particular goods the moment he makes the claim in respect of these goods, the Customs control commences to operate. The Customs authorities have a right to see that those goods shall not be dealt with except in a specified way, and they have the right to examine them, and to see that they are properly entered, and further to take security, if necessary, not only for their proper export, but in order to see that they are not reintroduced. The third provision is as to goods subject to export duty. As regards export duty we have thought it well to make the Bill complete as Bills of this sort are generally made complete, utterly irrespective of whether or not we or any one else will ever contemplate the imposition of an export duty. In this respect, the control commences from the time the goods are brought to a port or place for export, and continues until the payment of the duty.","N/A","CUSTOMS BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/speech[3]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

At the same time it is desirable to make the Bill complete in the first instance, in case it should ever enter the head of this or any. other Government to impose anything in the shape of an export duty.. I hope and believe that the grouping in. Part 3 of these general clauses relating to Customs- control, examination, entries, and securities generally, will enable honorable members to appreciate - as I can assure them it has enabled those who have been connected with the preparation of , this Bill, to appreciate - the chief underlying principles declaratory of the precautions which are necessary for the security of the Customs revenue. It is declared that when goods are subject to control they shall be liable to examination. It is also declared that entries may be made and passed, and there is a further provision for taking securities for compliance with- the Act, and a declaration that in regard to a matter in which a good many of us at one time or another have been interested - though of course Inter-State matters will not be of the same importance in the future that they are to-day -passengers baggage may be imported or exported subject to any prescribed conditions without entry. Clauses 44 and 45 have been inserted at the suggestions of the Customs authorities, and provide for. a simple and general form of Customs, security, and endeavour to dispense, so far as is possible, with the varied and cumbrous forms of Customs securities which are at present in use. Part 3 gives a general purview of the provisions of the Bill.Part 4 deals with importations, and declares that the importation of certain goods shall be prohibited . Honorable members generally are no doubt familiar with the usual provisions in this respect relating to the infringement of copyright, false money, obscene works, oleomargarine, butterine, &c. Then there is a general power over all goods which have any false warranty on them, and all goods the importation of which may be prohibited by proclamation. Exhausted tea is also a prohibited import, as is another class r f goods which of course it is more easy to provide against in the words of a statute than it may be to practically enforce - the importation is prohibited of all goods manufactured or produced, wholly or in part, by prison labour, or which have been made within or in connexion with any prison, gaol, or penitentiary.

318,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"KINGSTON, Charles","KEW","N/A","N/A","N/A",2095,"- I am obliged to the honorable member for Corio for the information. After defining what goods are to be prohibited from importation, the duties of the shipmaster are declared. He is not to bring his ship into any place other than a port. He is to bring-to when hailed by the Customs. Even if he is not hailed lie has to bring-to at the proper boarding station. He is liable to be hoarded by the Customs authorities. The Customs authorities have full power of search. It is also the shipmasters duty to report the cargo, the merchant makes entries in respect of the goods, and the goods are unshipped, landed, and examined in a specified way. They may be landed and entered for various purposes - for home consumption, which is the simplest form of duty that is paid. Precautions are taken to prevent goods being smuggled in the course of transshipment. They may be landed also for warehousing, the duty not being paid, the goods becoming in the ordinary acceptation of the term bonded goods. If bonded they may be bonded in a general warehouse to be used for warehousing goods generally ; in a private warehouse to be used only for warehousing goods, the property of the licensee : in a machinery warehouse, to be used only for warehousing machinery and similar heavy or bulky goods ; or in a manufacturing warehouse, to be used for warehousing goods for use in any manufacture, trade, or process, and for carrying on in such warehouse an} manufacture,, trade, or process which the Minister may b} Gazette notice declare that it is desirable to encourage. There are already in different States manufacturing warehouses in operation. It is proposed that the power of establishing these warehouses shall be extended and made uniform throughout the States. If established and utilized, facilities will be given for the use of the imported goods in connexion with any local manufacture, which venture to hope and believe will be useful in the extension of Australian industry. Anyway, a large power is taken for the necessary purposes. Then there are provisions for the proper taking of the accounts of the goods before they are warehoused, and for giving a receipt to the party interested. It is provided that the duty of the licensee of a warehouse is to keep the goods secure, and to enable the Customs authorities at all times . to have access to them. Of course the fullest power is secured to the collector to do everything, at all times in connexion with the examination of goods should he think it necessary. There is a further provision that as regards warehoused goods the3 may be cleared for home consumption, or exported to parts beyond the seas, or removed for warehousing elsewhere. Division 2 of this part, comprising clauses 1.01 to 104, provides for the establishment of Kings warehouses, which are more particularly under the control and ownership of the Customs authorities, and in which goods seized or unclaimed are stored if not otherwise provided for. So much for the importation and warehousing, of goods. Part 6 deals with the exportation of goods. The system is first to declare that certain goods are prohibited exports. This is but a small list, referring chiefly to aims, explosives, military and naval stores, which by proclamation may be  prohibited from being exported to any particular place, and provision is made for giving effect to the proclamation. Then the mode of exporting goods is provided for - the outward manifest, the export entry, the certificate of clearance, the duty of the- master to bring-to at the boarding station, and the power of the officer to require satisfactory explanations as regards goods on the ship, which it is possible may not be entered. Heavy responsibilities are cast on the master in this last-named connexion, so that all goods intended for export, except passengers baggage, must be included in the outward manifest, and it is specially the duty of the master to take care that no bonded goods shipped for export shall be relanded. Part 7 deals with the question of ships stores. Honorable members know that at present the rule is that stores, which are consumed within a particular State, pay duty. But, on the other hand, stores, which are carried in the ship from one State to another, do not pay duty, because it is held that the stores are not consumed within the bounds of any particular State. By intercolonial free-trade the area of Customs control will be increased, and in this connexion the position is this : That as regards stores consumed between Adelaide and Melbourne, they have to be free as they are to-day, and, if so free, similar freedom must be extended to goods between Adelaide and Port Augusta, which are not free. There must be uniformity of practice. There is nothing to justify giving- stores free for consumption between Adelaide and Melbourne, and refusing that freedom between Adelaide and Port Augusta. Instead of having trade between the States with different Tariffs, we have trade in one Commonwealth, and under these circumstances it appears to the Government that the proper course - seeing that the stores are practically consumed within Australia - -is to provide for the payment of duty on- those stores for the benefit of the Australian revenue. That will be the natural effect of the Bill, and special reference is made to the matter in Part 7.","N/A","CUSTOMS BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/speech[4]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The area and ambit of the Customs control is now extended. When the consumption of goods under the Commonwealth was within- the ambit of the State control, duty was charged on the goods, and now that that control is extended it seems to me that similar results must follow. At least it is absolutely impossible to adopt one course of treatment favouring the oversea ship, and another to the disadvantage of the Australian trader.

Part 8 of the Bill refers to the payment and computation of duties generally, and clause 124 declares that no goods the property of the Commonwealth shall be liable to any duty of customs. Honorable members will recollect that the terms of the Commonwealth Constitution prevent the Commonwealth from levying any taxes on the property of the State. It is also declared that all import duties shall be paid at the rate in force when the goods are entered for home [133] consumption, and that where duties are imposed according to weight, or. measure the weight or measurement of. the goods shall be ascertained according to the standard weights and. measures by law established. For the encouragement of honesty, we have inserted, clause 129, which, provides that whenever goods are sold or prepared for sale as, or are reputed to be, of a size or quantity greater than their actual ; size or- quantity, duties shall be charged ; according to the first mentioned size or- quantity. Then there are the usual provisions which it is unnecessary for me to refer to in detail; Clause 145 adopts the provisions which are generally found in Customs Acts, that if after any agreement is. made for. the sale or- delivery of goods, duty paid, any. alteration takes place in the Tariff before they are delivered for home consumption, the seller, shall be allowed, after payment of any increased -duty, to add the difference to the agreed price. Oil the other hand, in- the event of the duty being decreased, the purchaser may- on. his part avail himself of the reduction. Clause 147 refers to ad valorem duties. I know that a good 1 many of my honorable Mends opposite will hardly view any provision relating to duties of that description with particular favour. It is declared that the value of goods for the purpose- of computing duty shall be taken to be the fair market value of the goods in the principal markets of the country whence they were exported and free on board at the port of export, with 10 per cent, added. The 10 per cent, is the usual provision made for the purpose of covering freight and charges.","N/A","CUSTOMS BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/speech[6]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Provision is made for the production of the genuine invoices, and power is given to deal with special cases. Clauses are also inserted for the purpose of permitting a remission of duty in the case of goods being damaged. Further provision is made, under clause 158, for the settlement of disputes as to duty. In Part 9 drawbacks are provided for. Part 10 deals with the costal trade, which is mostly to be governed by regulation. Part 11 deals with agents, and Part 12 relates to the powers of officers, which are large, but not unusual. The second division of Part 12 refers to the protection of officers. Part 13 contains penal provisions, and provides for forfeiture in certain cases. There are provisions in clause 214 with regard to the forfeiture of ships, and in clause 215 with reference to the forfeiture of goods. In clause 217 various penalties are provided for, and chief amongst these is the penalty to be inflicted upon persons who may engage in smuggling.  Smuggling is defined as the illegal importation or introduction of goods, and in clause 218 officers are cautioned against collusive seizures and entrapping people who would not otherwise be guilty of an offence against the Act. Clause 220 deals with offences generally, and clause 222 declares that anyone who aids and abets in the commission of an offence shall be deemed as guilty as the man who commits it, and also that an attempt to commit an offence shall be equally punishable with the commission of the offence itself. Honorable members will possibly discover the fact that the penalties provided at the foot of the clauses are not specially severe ; and in this connexion I would like to draw their attention to clause 226, which practically embodies the usual Customs practice of penalizing to the extent of three times the value of any goods which are found to have been wrongly dealt with. It is provided that if the penalty for any specified offence shall be less than three times the value of any goods in respect of which an offence has been committed, the maximum penalty shall be thrice the value of the goods. Clause 227 is one of some importance, and is, perhaps, new ; but it is framed having reference to this aspect of the case. There are two sorts of Customs offences ; one class of cases involving gross moral wrong - attempts to defraud - and the other being cases in which we may not be able to prove any attempt to defraud, but in winch the liability to loss of revenue is equally great.

I have not had much Customs experience - and there are very few cases which come under ones notice at any time which are breaches of the Act - but the great percentage of the cases in which it is not the fault of the party benefited by the slip, but of some unfortunate junior or other employeee, is striking. So that what we say is this :  Where we cannot prove fraud, we shall, for the protection of the revenue at least, impress upon people the necessity of being careful, and where people are not careful they will, have to pay the penalty. Where we can prove fraud they will pay double the penalty provided for carelessness. As regards this question of slips, they are of various characters ; but there is a certain amount of uniformity amongst them, and the mistake is generally against His Majestys revenue, and never against the individual who has the careless or reckless clerk. I do not wish honorable members to think that I am suggesting any general im : propriety of conduct on the part of our mercantile community, because I consider that we have every reason to be proud of it, and I have no doubt that, if the Customs slips in Australia were compared with the Customs slips in other Countries, Australian merchants would have no reason to be ashamed. But, I say, let us insist upon care being taken in the making out of entries, in the declaration of values, and in this, that, and the other matter in which the Customs are concerned. If persons are not sufficiently careful, let them take the consequences, to a moderate extent, so that others may be warned to be more careful. But where it is not carelessness, but fraud, that is charged and proved, let those who are convicted pay a penalty which bears some proportion to the offence of which they have been guilty.","N/A","CUSTOMS BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/speech[6]/continue[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I want especially to refer to clauses 238 and 239 as regards the protection afforded to witnesses on behalf of the prosecution, and as to the liability of a defendant to be examined. Clause 238 enacts that -No witness on behalf of the Minister or col lector in any Customs prosecution shall be compelled to disclose the fact that he received or gave any information or the nature thereof, nor the name of the person who gave such information, and no officer appearing as a witness shall be compelled to produce any reports made or received by him confidentially in his official capacity or containing confidential information.That is really an embodiment of the existing practice, and I trust that honorable members will consent to it, because it seems to me to be an essential provision. Clause 239 declares that -In every Customs prosecution the defendant- shall be competent to give evidence.And it provides also that -In every Customs prosecution, except for an indictable offence, the defendant shall be compelled to give evidence, and if called as a witness for the prosecution, shall be liable to cross-examination as a witness adverse to the prosecution.I think that we should not disregard any reasonable provision for getting at the truth in matters of this kind.

Under that Act all expenditure has to cease on that day. According to the Constitution no money can be drawn from the Treasury except under appropriations made by law, .and, therefore, honorable members will realize that it is imperative at the earliest possible moment that the Treasurer should be put in a proper position to expend the money necessary for carrying on the affairs of the Commonwealth. The Government are therefore now asking for Supply for the period of three months. I regret to say it is utterly impossible at the present time, or for some little time to come, to put before the House the full Estimates of the proposed expenditure of the present financial year. When we are dealing with State affairs, it is somewhat difficult to get all the necessary information ; but when we have to get information from the whole of the six States, and to put it into proper form, it takes some little time. Under these circumstances, I am not prepared at the present time to put before the committee the full Estimates for the whole year. But in the schedule which is circulated I have given sufficient details to enable honorable members to deal with any question which can arise. In the first place, we have followed, as far as it is possible, the Supply already granted. In those cases, I have not given an)7 further information than simply to say, in the case of the first vote, for instance,  The Senate, salaries, contingencies. Honorable members must take my assurance that in those cases we are following the Supply exactly which has already been authorized by Parliament. In other cases it has become necessary to make further appointments, and these are mentioned under the departments in which they have to be paid. For the House of Representatives, there have been provided salaries, including that of the clerk of the House of Representatives at £900 per year, and a junior clerk at £60 per annum, other salaries having been already voted, and those mentioned not having been provided for in the Act which has been passed. In connexion with the next item -  Parliamentary Debates, it has been found necessary to appoint an extra reporter at £500 per annum, and a sessional typist at £18 per month. In connexion with the Library, the Refreshment room, the water power for Parliament House, Parliamentary gardens, and the Federal Executive, the Estimates are the same as we have already adopted. Under the heading  Administrative, there is an additional, messenger, but, as a matter of fact, he is not a new officer, he having been on the temporary stuff and being now transferred to the permanent staff. Under the heading Miscellaneous, it has been found necessary to vote a further expenditure in connexion with the opening of Parliament and the Royal reception of £2,000, and to re-vote a sum of £500. In the Attorney-Generals department a chief clerk and assistant parliamentary draftsman have been provided for, together with a clerk at £80 per annum, and a messenger at £120 per annum. In the department of the Minister for Home Affairs, we have provided, in addition to what we have already voted, a secretary at £750, a chief clerk at £500, three clerks at £200, a messenger at ±80, with five caretakers for this and other departments. We have also had to provide for some necessary repairs to public buildings, fittings, and furniture, amounting, with regard to the new departments, to £1,300; and with regard to the Post-office, the Customs department, and the Defence department, to £9,300, this expenditure being for repairs which it will be necessary to do curing the current three months. Then we have also provided for the Public Service Commissioners branch, which will have to be established as rapidly as possible, a secretary at £600, six clerks at from £100 to £200 per annum, two messengers at £1 04 per annum, and one at £52 per annum, with a caretaker at £52. It is necessary also to have a small staff in connexion with the Electoral-office, consisting of a chief officer at £450 per annum, and a clerk at £150 per annum. We must also vote a sum of £12,000 in connexion with the Federal Parliament elections. We voted some £20,000 ppreviously, but we were not able to expend the whole amount before the 30th June, and this is simply a re-vote to enable us to complete the expenditure during the next few months. In the Treasurers department, I find I am bound to increase the staff by one clerk at £210 per annum, and a junior messenger at £52. The Government Printer requires, for the purpose of the necessary printing in connexion with Parliament, and for providing some machinery, the sum of £10,500.  The Minister of Trade and Customs had no provision made for him in the way of a central office on the other Estimates we submitted ; and it is now proposed to appoint a Comptroller-General of Customs at £1,200 per annum, that being practically the salary which the gentleman who is to be appointed is receiving at the present time. There has also to be a secretary at £750 per annum.","In Committee :","SUPPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We have provided in this department for three clerks, one at £300 per annum, another at £250, and one at £200, with a- messenger at £130. Then, the other expenditure in the Department of the Minister for Trades and Customs is the transferred expenditure, which, as I have mentioned, has been based on what we have been expending during the past year, and which expenditure has been indorsed by Parliament. The Minister for Defence requires a secretary at a salary of £900 per annum, which is \ he present salary of the gentleman who will be transferred to that position.","In Committee :","SUPPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The gentleman isCaptain Collins, the head of the Defence department of Victoria. The Minister ci: Defence requires a chief accountant, at £600 per annum, a chief clerk at £540, five clerks at varying salaries, two messengers, and a junior messenger. Then, it is necessary to re-vote a portion of the amount for the military and naval demonstration which we could not expend before the 30th June, and also to vote the expenditure for holding demonstrations in Adelaide, Hobart, and Perth. In the Postmaster-Generals branch, it is proposed to have a secretary at £1,000 per annum, an assistant secretary at £600 per annum, together with six clerks and three messengers : the other expenditure being the necessary transferred expenditure. Now, the new expenditure - or, as it is called the other expenditure - is shown in a column separate from the ordinary transferred expenditure, in order that honorable members may see the amount it is proposed to expend under this particular heading, and the total would appear to be £52,532. But, as a matter of fact, a portion of that can hardly be regarded as the current expenditure. £2,500, as I have already mentioned, is for the celebrations in connexion with the opening of Parliament ; £12,000 is a re-vote of electoral expenditure, and there is £9,000 in connexion with the demonstrations. If we take that amount, £23,500, from the amount shown as the apparent new expenditure, honorable members will see that the total new expenditure asked for is £29,000. , In addition to that, there are the permanent appropriations for the Governor-General, Ministers, and honorable members - three months proportion - representing £16,600, so that the total new expenditure asked for for the three months is £45,600. With regard to the various officers mentioned here, some have been practically selected. Many have not been dealt with, but they will have to be dealt with during the three months, and I can give the assurance to honorable members that it is intended to take the whole of them from the State services. Thus, while we are expending a certain amount of money for these services, we are taking officers from the various State services, and thereby enabling the States to make a considerable saving in their expenditure. It will be seen, therefore, that the whole of the new expenditure is not all new expenditure to the States, because they have the opportunity of making considerable savings by not filling up the . positions of the officers who are transferred, or by filling them up by transferring other officers. Thus, while the whole of the salaries will not be saved, a very large proportion of them undoubtedly will. That is the policy which -Parliament, I take it, would desire and which the -Government intend to carry out. Wherever it is possible we will make appointments from the existing public services of the States, and thereby enable the States to meet their portion of the new expenditure.","In Committee :","SUPPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

There are a number of more or less unsatisfactory pension laws in the different States. Perhaps in some of the States the law does not give the public servant enough for what he pays - though I do not think that is likely - whilst in other States the public servant gets a great deal more than he ought to for the contribution he has to pay. Taking the case of New South Wales, I am sorry that I have to speak in a derogatory sense, because our pension system is greatly to our discredit, owing to its having proved very unsatisfactory. We have made two attempts to establish it on a proper basis, but the rate of contribution to the fund is absolutely insufficient to provide for the benefits which are secured to the officers, and when the matter is cleared up, the result practically will be that the State will have to pay an amount at least equal to half the principal. In that sense the Commonwealth is, in spite of itself, engrafting a pension system upon itself. Referring to this particular instance, the Auditor-General may come from New South Wales with some pension rights, and the Commonwealth, from the day he begins to serve us, will have to stand in the shoes of New South Wales in reference to his pension. He will pay his 4 per cent., as in New South Wales, to the Treasury of theCommonwealth, but he will get his pension from the Commonwealth. I admit that the question is a difficult one, but I believe that the Government will be compelled to take it up, because of the number of officers who will be taken over, and the number of pension systems with which we shall have to deal.","N/A","AUDIT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[1]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Constitution Act provides that every Appropriation Act for the ordinary annual services must be separate from every other provision. Section 54 of the Constitution says -The proposed law which appropriates revenue or moneys for the ordinary annual services of the Government shall deal only with such appropriations.Section 83 of the Constitution says -Nomoney shall be drawn from the Treasurer of the Commonwealth except under appropriation made by law.The clause of the Bill which is under discussion is intended to satisfy section83 of the Constitution.","N/A","AUDIT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[20]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

But the Bill goes beyond that. With a view of preventing any difficulty hereafter, I ask whether it is contemplated that the Senate may amend clause 36, because if it is an appropriation for the ordinary annual services, that Chamber has no right to amend it. These are interesting problems at the beginning of our constitutional career, but it is always well to look ahead and see where we are going.

There is no doubt that this will be a permanent appropriation clause, when the contingency arises for which it provides, but so long as we confine it to the ordinary annual services, by making the provision clearer, then I do not see that the Senate, unless it disapproves of the clause altogether, will have any occasion to amend it.

549,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"DEAKIN, Alfred","009MD","Ballarat","Protectionist","Attorney-General",2114,". - I was about to take very much the view which the leader of the Opposition would have taken if he had completed the outline he gave as to the interpretation to be put upon this clause. I think that the argument of the honorable and learned member for Indi is perfectly tenable, and that it is one which merits consideration. At the same time I do not think it is by any means final. I take it that the proposed law which appropriates revenue or moneys referred to in section 54 of the Constitution is what we all know as the annual Appropriation Act, providing for the services of the year all the sums of money, including those which have been previously advanced by way of Supply, and making provision for the definite payment of definite sums. To this certain protection is accorded. That is a very speCial measure each session, and it is surrounded with special protection and subject to special procedure. I do not think the provision in section 83, that no money shall be drawn from the Treasury of the Commonwealth except under an appropriation made by law, covers identically the same ground. The special provisions made in regard to the annual appropriation of the year do not necessarily cover all appropriations at all their stages, though at last they are all collected there. When honorable members look at the clause before them, they -will realize the gulf which separates it from the annual appropriation, with its elaborate schedules, its precise grants of money for specific purposes, at the conclusion of the parliamentary session, or at all events finally allotted as the expression of the will of Parliament in regard to the maintenance of the ordinary annual services of the year. What is this? This is an Enabling Appropriation Act. It is an appropriation of a different class and- character from that which is specially referred to in section 54. This is, to use a word which I think the leader of the Opposition employed just now, an emergency appropriation, provided in advance, the amounts for which are not specified, although certain limitations arc imposed as conditions upon which this grant of power is made, as being exercised only in certain exceptional emergencies. But there is not and cannot be more than the general limitations here set down. There can be no specific amounts, no specific votes at this stage. Any sums expended under the authority conveyed by this section require to be again authorized by the Appropriation Act referred to in section 54. These sums are temporarily advanced, and temporarily expended, and will need to be authorized by the vote of Parliament afterwards.","N/A","AUDIT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[22]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
