In giving notice of my intention to move the adjournment of the House to discuss the present excessive and crushing rates of ocean freights on Australias exportable products, I thought I was doing my duty in taking what seemed to me the best opportunity available to draw public attention to a very serious and urgent matter. In addition to giving you, Mr. Speaker, and the members of the Ministry, notice of my intention to take this action, I thought it only courteous to make a similar intimation to the Chairman of the . Overseas Shipping Companies and to the press, and I was a little surprised to read in a Melbourne newspaper yesterday a telegram from its , Sydney correspondent stating that resentment is expressed by the representatives of the owners of overseas shipping at the report from Melbourne that Mr. Jowet, M.H.R., intends to move the adjournment of the House to discuss the excessive and crushing rates of ocean freights now being charged upon the exportable products of Australia.  I do not feel in the slightest degree hurt or discouraged by the resentment thus expressed, especially since the paragraph in which the words I have read appear is headed  Overseas freights reduced from today, and contains details of some reductions that have been made. If the Overseas Shipping Committee will make substantial reductions in freights every time that I incur their resentment, I shall be prepared to continue to incur it daily for the rest, of the year. This motion of adjournment is not to be regarded as reflecting in the remotest degree upon the Government or upon any member of it; because for some considerable time past Ministers have done everything possible to bring about a reduction of freights. There has been correspondence on the subject between the Pastoralists Association and the Government.. The latter replied, on the 16th March, to a communication sent to them by the association, and, on the4th April, Mr. Deane, the Secretary to the Prime Minister, wrote","Oversea Freights","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In my opinion, the reductions which have been announced during the past few days, and of which a great deal has been made, are totally inadequate, as I think honorable members will agree when I have given them a brief summary of the overseas freights ruling before the war compared with those of the latest date. In order that no injustice , may be done to the overseas shipping authorities, I have arranged that, should they make further reductions this afternoon, before I have finished my speech which is not unlikely, remembering their promptness of the last few days I shall announce them to the House.

One accompaniment of the war was an enormous increase in the prices of commodities, an increase which continued without ceasing until about twelve months ago. This, of course, was due to many causes, one very potent cause, in my opinion, especially since the war ended, being the enormous increase in the paper currencies of the world.","Oversea Freights","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/para[3]","N/A","N/A"

Somewhere about July or August of last year prices and I am speaking solely of wholesale prices probably reached their maximum, and the world is now faced with the inevitable reaction. I refer to the lower prices which the producers, and to a lesser extent the manufacturers of commodities, are now receiving.I do not propose to deal with the somewhat more complex and difficult matter of the increase of retail prices which has resulted from  passing on  by various distributors.

I shall give instances as I go along, showing how already, in certain directions, production has become unprofitable on account of the high costs of production, including excessive charges for transportation. I need not deal further with that point just now, except to remind honorable members of our enormous liabilities abroad, and of the colossal requirements of our people in the way of imported commodities, which cannot be produced here, but which we, so long as our present state of civilization is maintained, will continue to demand. I refer, however, particularly to our obligations abroad, and contend that the only way in which these outside obligations can be met, and our imports paid for, is by the exportation of our own primary and secondary products. If we reach a stage at which it does not pay to produce and export, the financial and industrial position of the people of Australia will, indeed, be very serious.

I find that the freight on rabbit skins has increased 200 per cent., and on frozen rabbits 205 per cent. In other words, the freight on the products of the men who earn a living by trapping rabbits has been trebled.

Exporters have asked for a rate of 130s. per ton meanwhile, in order to make business possible. The shipping companies suggest the reduction be gradual, though when increases were being made they were not made on a gradual scale; but the request for a rate of 130s. meanwhile shows the exporters of this section are prepared to recognise a gradual reduction. At 130s. the rate would still be 136 per cent, above the prewar rate. At 130s. it is believed business could be done, and this would mean employment for some hundreds, if not thousands, of trappers and others, as well as being a source of revenue to the country. Perhaps more important still is that, through the cessation of trapping, rabbits will largely increase, and by next year prove a greater menace than ever to many landowners. Not only has trapping ceased for the export carcase, but rabbit skins have fallen to such a price that trappers have discontinued trapping for the skin also.","Oversea Freights","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/quote[3]/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

I have based my calculation on . the reduction to 105s., and that shows an increase in the freight of 250 per cent, from the rate ruling in May, 1914. Only last week a deputation of fruitgrowers waited upon us, and told us that the freight on cased goods was now £6 per ton as compared with 30s. or 35s. before the war, and also that refrigerated space for fresh fruit was costing them 8s. per case as against 2s. 9d. to 3s. before the war. One deputation assured us that they are so disheartened by the prospects that in their district many of them will not prune their apricot and pear trees this year, although they will lightly prune their peach trees.  As time is limited I must leave this subject, and pass on to the question of wool, which in respect of total value and volume of output is one of the most important of all the Australian products. The present freights charged on wool are more than double those charged before the war. Owing to the chaotic condition of the wool markets of the world it is impossible for anybody to say what relation present prices for wool bear to those ruling before the war; so much of the wool is unsaleable that it is idle to say that it is worth a. certain price if a buyer cannot be found. At all events, there are some kinds of wool, not of the best quality, which are now worth much less than they were before the war. Every practical farmer knows that, however good your sheep may be, and however much you look after them, the actual value of a pound of wool is very largely determined by the district in which it is grown, the nature , of the soil, and the season. Sometimes the richest land is so infested with trefoil burr and seed that it grows what from the manufacturing point of view is the most inferior wool. Nobody should say that a man ought to grow better wool if the best quality pays ; every man grows as good a class of wool as he possibly can. I have some startling information brought Co my attention only this morning. Fortunately, publicity was given to the fact that I intended to move the adjournment of the House today upon this subject, and, as a consequence, I had already received voluntarily a great deal of information from most reliable people. Further communications came to hand this morning from an undoubtedly reliable source. Sixty bales of scoured and fellmongered wool, shipped in November last per s.s. Ulysses, according to the account sales just to hand, were sold in London at an average price of 41/4d per lb. Quite apart from the price paid for the sheepskins, it cost the shipper of these 60 bales, in fellmongering, scouring, and in freight, 63/4d. per lb.; so that he sold the wool at 21/2d. per lb. less than it cost him to fellmonger it and ship, it.","Oversea Freights","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In spite of the fact that some Australian woolgrowers are receiving practically nothing for their wool, it is impossible for any one in the world to buy clothes at a reasonable price.  The increased freight on sheepskins is apparently one of the most crushing of all. Before the war, the rate was 75s. per ton; it is now 297s. per ton, an increase of 296 per cent. Sheepskins are not included in the reductions recently announced. It is certainly highly desirable to have our own sheepskins fellmongered before export, providing that the sheep farmer gets the worlds parity for them; but, from the example I have just given, it is quite apparent that, at present prices, they cannot be fellmongered locally. Furthermore, obviously the. sheep farmer must look to the sheepskin exporter to obtain some recompense for the trouble of treating the skins, and for the cost he incurs in sending them to market.

As a matter of fact, we have offered big parcels of freight provided the rate is reduced, but there are no takers. The position, as you know, particularly with hides and sheepskins, is that vast quantities are practically valueless, for the reason that excessive freight rates prohibit export.

While I regret that the honorable member for Grampians (Mr. Jowett) has not been able to conclude his remarks, I think he has placed sufficient facts before the Chamber to enable honorable members to discuss the matter intelligently. It is a question which affects the whole community very seriously. Australia depends upon the sale of its products overseas for the income upon which its people live. The honorable member claims that freights are exorbitant, and that they prevent the exportation of goods that would otherwise find a ready sale. He has quote.d sheepskins and fruit, and given us the impression that what he has said in regard to these two items applies to all commodities. At any rate, it applies to rabbits, because the honorable member emphasized that point. I propose to deal with the question without reflecting in any way upon the shipping companies who are engaged in this trade along with the Commonwealth Line. I have expressed my own view on the matter very plainly on many  occasions, and the extent to which my views have been supported in the press is perfectly well known to every honorable member. This position, however, is an almost negligible factor when it comes to determining the rate of freight from Australia to the United Kingdom or other parts of the world. I shall deal with the matter, as far as I can in the very limited time at my disposal, by a reference, to figures. The honorable member for Grampians (Mr. Jowett) has sought to show, both by direct statement and by inference, that, as the prices of the commodities which Australia produces fall, so ought freights to fall. That contention, however, will not bear examination for a moment. In order to judge what should be the rates for carrying goods from here to the markets of the world, we must have regard to the cost of running the vessels upon which those goods are placed. We have to consider what is the relative cost of taking goods from here to England now as compared with the cost in 1914.. The value of the goods carried is material only in so far as it affects the producer. It is not a ground upon which to found a charge of exploitation against the shipowner.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","HUGHES, William Morris","DQC","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","On Tusday last I received a reply to the effect that the association had decided that the reduction made in the case of New Zealand should apply to Australia.  Every honorable member who has applied to me, either directly or through my office, knows that I. have not wasted a moment in making application, nor has my application lacked emphasis or force, The position, however, has to be looked at from the standpoint of the shipowner. I shall not refer to the Commonwealth Line. I shall say nothing at all about it. It speaks for itself. I cannot rise to deal with a question of this kind as if I were a petty hucksterer wishing to advertise my particular wares at the expense of any one else. This is a great national question, and I want to deal with it on that basis. I think I may say, however, that it may be taken for granted that the existence of the Commonwealth Line has not been the means of increasing freight. Let us consider what are the charges incidental to the running of a vessel now as compared with 1914. Taking as an example the operating expenses of a recent round voyage as compared with prewar rates on the same steamer in 1914, the percentages of increase are as follow: Port charges, 137 per cent. ; cargo charges, 165 per cent.; coal, 172 per cent. ; wages, 166 per cent. ; other running expenses, 255 per cent. The aggregate operating expenses of the same steamer in connexion with a recent round voyage as compared with 1914, just prior to the war, show an increase of 197 per cent., or £3 today for every £1 during the prewar period of 1914. As against this, the earnings of the same steamer show an increase of only 165 per cent, as compared with the earnings in 1914 just prior to the war. It will therefore be seen by honorable members that, from the shipowners point of view, their running expenses have gone up to a very much, greater extent than is counterbalanced by the freights. The honorable member for Grampians has to face that position. I need not remind him of what he will know: that today the ports of Britain are crowded with vessels. I am no defender of combines. It is alleged that there is no combine, so that we need not attack that which does not exist; but Britain is surrounded by competitors who, if they destroy her mercantile supremacy, will inflict upon us here infinitely more harm than even a combine could do. I have always been an opponent of combines. I am now, and I have erected what in my opinion is the only effective means of dealing with this particular combine ; but I am not condemning that combine from the standpoint of British shipping. Where the charges are high they must show us that they are justified by their running expenses. Nothing less than that will satisfy us. If they do that, then of what avail is it to say,  We want a reduction They, too, like us, must live. I come now to the cost of provisioning the vessels. The British Chamber of Commerce has compiled official statistics which I commend to the attention of honorable members. These official statistics show that on nine voyages made by steamers during the year 191314 the cost of provisions totalled £1,984, whilst for the year 191920 the cost was £7,667. In running, exclusive of management and depreciation, it cost £46,165 in the year 191314, and £77,505 in 191920. Thus the total cost of running and provisioning covering nine voyages in 191314 was £48,149, as against £185,172 for nine voyages in 191920. On the earning side the increase may be taken as 165 per cent, in 1920 over 1913, while the increase, adding provisions and running costs together, was 285 per cent. We must judge by comparison whether as a matter of fact we are paying more than what is fair. Ma. McWilliams. When the combine supplied these figures They were not supplied by the combine. They are official statistics compiled by the British Chamber of Commerce. Let me now deal with freights. From the Argentine to the United Kingdom the rate for frozen beef is 11/4d. per lb., and from Australia to the United Kingdom17/8d. per lb. Seeing that the mileage from Australia to the United Kingdom is nearly twice as great as that from the Argentine, it cannot be said, comparatively speaking, that the Australian rate is excessive, or that it puts us out of the running in our competition with the meat of the Argentine. The shipowners are not to blame because the price of frozen beef is low, or because the wool market is disorganized. A steamer trading between the Argentine and the United Kingdom will make two and a half voyages to one made by a steamer trading between Australia and the United Kingdom, so that the Australian rate to be the equivalent of the Argentine rate would have to exceed it by l1/4d. per lb. I merely mention the fact that Australia has a Commonwealth Line of Government steamers, while the Argentine has not. The freight to Java on general cargo is 75s. and on flour 50s. It cannot be said that there has been no reduction in freight to the East. Recently all lines reduced the rate on flour by 33 per cent. It was 75s. The grain rate to the United Kingdom was in 1920 for wheat, 120s., and is now 57s. 6d. ; for barley, 140s., and is now 68s. ; and for oats, 160s., and is now 88s. According to the AuditorGenerals report for 1920, the ascertained profits to 13th September, 1919, on all the overseas voyages of the controlled shipping lines was £261,347, and the loss on coastal trade £301,189, a net deficiency of £39,842. The Shipping Control Committees expenditure for the half year was £7,356, and the net loss for the period £212,554. The AuditorGeneral says that on the 23rd August, 1920, it was reported that, with the exception of one vessel, all the ships requisitioned had been handed back to their respective owners. On 31st March, 1920, the profit on oversea voyages was £260,461, and the loss on coastal voyages £371,208, the net loss for the half year being £110,747. Archibald Kurd, writing in the London Daily Telegraph, says that the extent to which rates have been recently reduced may be shown as follows :","Oversea Freights","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

The Prime Minister replied that a comparison, of running expenses showed that their profits were not so great today as in 1914. The question, however, is, Were their profits too high in 1914? They were then making undue profits, and it is no defence to say that because their working expenses are now larger their profits are not so great. They were too heavy in 1914, and are too big now. It is general knowledge that the shipping companies have been making enormous profits. .

I do not know of anything more important to the great bulk of our producers than the question we are now discussing; and I dare say that there is not an honorable member but who is desirous of seeing an end of the present state of affairs, and some tangible remedy found. Some years ago the Western Australian Labour Government chartered a line of steamers, which was called a Stateowned; line, to trade with the northern parts of that State; and there are irrefutable figures to show that one result of this venture was a great reduction in freights to the primary producers. At that time hardly any one outside of the Government concerned had a good word for that line of steamers, although the result of its creation was what I have stated. Then, in Queensland lately, the Government have chartered vessels to carry produce to and from the north ; and there, again, we find a reduction in freights, very gratifying to the primary producers of that State. In my opinion, it is along these lines that the remedy lies. I admit that it is not ah easy problem to solve, but if we desire results, we must get down to  tintacks. It would, of course, be useless or impossible to get another section of private enterprise to step in and compete with the present companies, for we all know what the inevitable result would be a reformation of the happy family.

If the Commonwealth is not big enough to fight the Combine on the freight question, it is time we went out of the business, and allowed somebody to come in who is big enough. Having regard to the slump which. has come in meat and hides, and. is coming in wheat, unless we can get our produce conveyed to Europe at something like a reasonable price, much lower than it is today, ruin must come to the producers. This matter is not one which affects this party or that. It affects not only the primary producers, but the whole financial stability of the Commonwealth. As the mover of the motion has said, . the only thing which enabled Australia to pay interest on her bills during the last five or six years was her export trade in those things taken out of and off the land. Although some honorable members speak harshly of the wool growers, it is nothing less than financial disaster that there should be, as stated by the honorable member for Grampians {Mr. Jowett), something like 4,000,000 bales of wool carried over, and representing from £70,000,000 to £80,000,000. Instead of that amount being distributed in Australia, much of it will be represented by overdrafts bearing interest at 7 per cent. That is a serious position. Everything we are producing today is low in price; except wheat and milk, there is no primary product that is being sold at a price which covers the cost of production. We cannot allow the high freights to continue. A freight charge of 8s. per bushel case of apples is nothing more or less than piracy and highsea robbery. The black flag with the skull and crossbones is what the Shipping Combine should be flying. The only hope we have is the competition of the Commonwealth Line of steamers, and if that line is to work by arrangement with the Combine, the primary producers will be at the mercy of Tiberius.

I am pleased that the question of freights has been raised by a member of the Country party. The farmers are always fond of a little bit of Socialism if it suits them, but they do not care to give much to the poor unfortunates in my electorate. The honorable member for Franklin (Mr. McWilliams) has complained of a freight charge of 8s. for a case of apples. There is not enough refrigerated space in the Commonwealth Line of steamers to carry all the Australian fruit to the Old World, so that if the whole of the Commonwealth freight were made available, most of the fruit would still have to be handled by the Combine. The honorable member said that the Commonwealth Line should lower its freights. If that were done, and my fruit went to England for 6s. per case, and the honorable member were charged by the Combine 8s. per case, he would grumble. The only satisfactory solution, therefore, is for the Commonwealth to carry the whole of the fruit. We cannot build the requisite number of ships in time. We must charter sufficient ships to carry the whole of the Australian produce to Great Britain. After we have done that, and lowered the freights, the Inchcape Combine will come into competition and reduce their freights still lower in order to beat us. And the producers will, thereupon, rush their goods into the. ships of the Combine, the chartered ships will go to the wall, and the whole undertaking will then be pointed to as another instance of the failure of State enterprise!

On the contrary, it helps to defeat the particular trade I have mentioned.

The Prime Minister told me yesterday that my education as a mathematician had been neglected, but the facts as they present themselves to me are that wool was conveyed to the United Kingdom in 1914 for less than half the cost today. The Prime Minister  told us that he bought the Commonwealth steamers because he was farseeing enough to realize that there would be a general combination of shipping throughout the world which would so manipulate freights as to bring injury to the primary producers of Australia. To that sentiment the Corner party said  Hear, hear ! ; in fact, they tendered him a dinner, and some of them helped to subscribe £25,000 for him for what he had done. The honorable member for Grampians (Mr. Jowett) is a member of the Pastoralists Union, one of the biggest Combines in Australia, and he does exactly what the other fellow is doing. When the other man puts the screw on he seeks to have his freights reduced. When I saw the announcement in the press that the honorable member intended to move the adjournment of the House today, I realized at once that it meant nothing, and that the motion would go the way of all other adjournment motions; it would end in smoke.  Mr.riley He would not take a vote upon it? There is no danger of that. The Country party will watch him very carefully to see that he does not .call for a division.","Oversea Freights","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[8]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I was sorry to hear the honorable member for Franklin (Mr. Mowilliams) say what he did in reference to the evidence asked for and obtained by the Select. Committee appointed to inquire into the sea carriage of goods. He was Chairman of that Committee, and I was a member of it; but if he had attended to his duties as he should have done and I leave it to him to say that he did I am sure he would have realized that the exhaustive information the Committee obtained did not bear out in the slightest degree what he has said in the House today,  I am pleased that the honorable member for Grampians (Mr. Jowett) has introduced the discussion; but, although I listened to the honorable member carefully, I failed to hear him suggest a remedy. No one who followed him has suggested any. I cannot see how we can bring the overseas shipping combine to their knees, and no one has suggested how it can be done, but. as the honorable member for Grampians is very largely interested in wool, it has occurred to me that there is a way in which his industry could be protected to a considerable extent. Before the drought Australia had 93,000,000 sheep, Russia 72,000,000, the United States of America 48,000,000, and Argentine 43,000,000. Two Australian sheep will produce the value of woo] that can be produced by three sheep in Russia. It is clearly evident that we have a control of a vast quantity of the raw material for the woollen manufacturing industry; and why should we not manufacture it here so that the manufactured .article could bear the cost of Freight overseas ? Tt could do it far more easily than can our raw material. Mr. Stirling Taylor, Director of the Bureau of Commerce and Industry, writing on the 26th February, 1920, said","Oversea Freights","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If each of the S0,000 woolgrowers supplying wool to the Central Wool Committee contributed £200, a sum of £16,000,000 could be raised for the purpose of dealing with our wool clip. Of course, the contribution would not be on a flat rate. Each individual would subscribe according to the number of sheep he held. If we complain of the difficulty of getting our products shipped at anything like the prewar rate, we must try some means of achieving that object. I recommend the honorable member for Grampians to investigate the scheme T have put forward, and see whether it could not be adopted. It might he possible in this way to do away with the threats that the flocks of sheep of Australia will be largely depleted unless some alteration is made!

I am personally indebted to the honorable member for Grampians (Mr. Jowett) for having brought this matter before the House this afternoon. Even if no definite solution of the difficulty has been propounded by honorable members who have spoken, the time devoted to the debate has not been lost, since it will serve at least to demonstrate to the House the disability under which Australia labours in marketing her primary products in competition with other parts of the world. In dealing with another . big question the Tariff which is before the. House, honorable members will have an opportunity either to increase or to lighten the burdens now resting on our already overburdened producers. The costs that are heaping up un the Shipping Combine, and which, as the Prime Minister has been able to show, are very great, have also been piling up on other industries; but while the Shipping Combine is able to pass on such increased costs, there are primary industries in Australia which are quite unable to do so. If the export of those commodities to which the honorable member for Grampians (Mr. Jowett) has referred is made unprofitable because of the increased cost of production and the charges which are laid upon them, they will simply go out of production, because it will become utterly impossible for us to compete with other countries. Honorable members will have read the statement made by President Harding, as published in this mornings newspapers, in which he wisely recognises that primary production is the principal and fundamental thing for the United States of America. He regards most seriously the fact that primary production there is costing so much that Russia, the Argentine, and other countries can export their produce to America and outdo the local producers. He has, therefore, decided to give the primary industries the benefit of heavy protective duties as a natural corollary to the heavy Protection given to the manufactured products of the country. The fact that one section of industry was protected, while the other was not, brought him to the conclusion which is reported in the press this morning.  I do not regard as likely to be effective the remedy suggested by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr. Mathews) for the matters complained of by the honorable member for Grampians; The fleet of vessels which we now have lias had no appreciable effect on the situation, and, if our ships of the future are to cost us what we are paying for them today, we shall not be able to compete, in the matter of ship construction with other countries.","Oversea Freights","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[10]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I find that there are certain; honorable members, as well as people who are not honorable in this Australia of ours, who are prepared to advocate the manufacture of certain things in the Commonwealth, no matter what they cost, as long as some one elBe will pay for them. Possibly there will be an opportunity to, increase our fleet either by chartering or purchasing additional vessels, but the evidence wo have in regard to the little fleet now owned by the Commonwealth rather inclines us to the belief that they ave in the Shipping Combine. A great many people in Australia, provided we got a big fleet, would sympathize with the Combine as long as shipping construction could go on in Australia. Some people do not seem to care what a primary producer has to pay for a plough as long as that plough is made in Australia. Their chief consideration is that everything should be manufactured here. The fact that in their desire to give effect to that. principle they may render it more difficult for our farmers to compete with the primary producers of the Argentine is of no concern to some Australians; they care not whether Australia goes out of primary production, and consequently is deprived of the means of obtaining more money from abroad. I am glad, however, that this question has been brought up, because the discussion will aid some people to recognise the position in which Australia is gradually being placed in competition with other countries. We are face to face with a most serious problem, and if things continue as at present, we shall come to a deadend before we get much further forward.
