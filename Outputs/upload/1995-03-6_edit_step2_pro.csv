I refer to the latest bulletin of the Business Council of Australia which, on the result of a survey of firms, states:Export values are expected to slow from 16 per cent to 7 per cent per annum . . . Import values are expected to grow from 9 per cent per annum to 13 per cent per annum.I ask the minister: in the light of six out of the last seven current account deficits being over $2 billion, what is the government doing about this frightening forecast of even greater deterioration in our balance of payments? Is the governments only answer that which it tried in the late 1980s of forcing up interest rates to dampen demand? Hasnt the government learned any lessons from that experience?","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[1]/question[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I am not sure on what it is based, how comprehensive it is or how seriously the particular figures of Senator Hill should be taken. Our own estimate, as I have said in the last week or so in this place, is that we fully expect exports to pick up in the context of world recovery, in the context of better commodity prices and in the context of a continued effective penetration by Australian business of the regional market, in particular, which is continuing to expand at a dramatic rate. There is no particular reason to anticipate that there will be any serious downturn in exports. In fact, in respect of the period ahead, our confidence is very strong.Of course, it is the case that imports can be expected to surge in the context of the present recovery and very strong growth that we are experiencing and, in particular, the very strong demand for capital goods. That is to be expected. But, of course, that is building a substantial and solid base for a productive future and ought, as a result, to be regarded as a cause for optimism about the future and our future capacity to penetrate those markets, rather than just focusing wholly on the short-term pessimism with which Senator Hill is so comfortable.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[1]/answer[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Actually, we on this side are particularly uncomfortable with what is happening in the country. But what we are asking is that the government take note of the messengers. It happened in the late 1980s when the messengers were telling the government that its policy was going to lead to a terrible recession. It ignored those messengers. Now the Business Council is saying to you that in fact its assessment, on the basis of what its member firms are saying to it, is much more pessimistic.

Of course we will take notice of that, and of course we will continue with an economic policy which is not wholly premised on what monetary policy and what interest rates might be able to contribute to the necessary breaking of the economy. Of course we will concentrate very heavily on the fiscal side of the equation. That is what this budget is all about; we have made that perfectly clear.We do have to do something about improving the savings base in this country.

Most of it comprises photocopies of acts of parliament and meat regulations. Fundamentally, the union has raised about half a dozen allegations. I believe that that was substantially what the union told the Senate committee last Friday—the members of the committee who were there would be able to confirm that. As I say, most of the paper that I have is photocopies of acts of parliament or regulations, but there are half a dozen or so allegations in that paper, most of which have been canvassed publicly before.I gave a series of public undertakings to the union before receiving those documents that any allegations that were brought forward by the union would be rigorously pursued, and I am now in the process of doing that. In this regard, my office has formally written to the Australian Government Solicitor expressing my wish to obtain expert independent legal advice on the implications of the matters that have been raised in the paperwork that has been given to me by the CPSU. The Australian Government Solicitor has been asked to examine the documents and then advise me on what steps, if any, should be taken. Depending on that advice, I may ask that the documents be referred to other agencies for appropriate action.I have informed the Australian Government Solicitor that the compliance legal and evaluation unit of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service is available to assist in the examination of the documents. I might add for the information of honourable senators that that compliance unit of AQIS routinely handles quite a large number of complaints that are made from time to time to do with things, for example, like substituting mutton for lamb—a practice not confined to the meat industry, I might add.

I refer to comments last week by President Clinton that the success of the Uruguay Round world trade deal in cutting farm export subsidies `should not be undermined by any effort unilaterally to reduce subsidies at home and that he views the EEP as an important part of our ability to meet and match international competition. Considering the tremendous damage done to Australian primary industry by US subsidy programs—for example, the 90 per cent reduction in our sugar import quotas over the past 14 years and the $2.4 billion losses because of the subsidy trade war in the wheat industry—I ask: in view of the Uruguay Round agreements, is the US required to tariffy all its import quotas such as presently affect our beef and sugar industries? Does the government believe the US will introduce more subsidies before the start of the Uruguay Round? In what ways does the government believe it can influence the forthcoming US farm bill in view of President Clintons recent words?","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[3]/question/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
11,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator McMULLAN","5I4","ACT","ALP","N/A",1362,"—I thank Senator Boswell for his question. I think it is the first opposition trade question I have had for some time. I am not aware of any fresh remarks made last week by President Clinton, but I am aware of comments he has made. I think we are referring to the same comments—I will not quibble about the timing. It is a cause of concern for Australia that, while we welcome the progress that has been made—I know Senator Boswell does and we all do—in the Uruguay Round, there is no sense in which Australia or any of the other Cairns Group countries believe that what was achieved is anything like sufficient. It was a useful first step. It is nothing like sufficient to say that we now have fair agricultural trading rules.We have terribly unfair, distorted agricultural trading rules internationally which are particularly bad for Australia and for the other free traders in agriculture, particularly those in the Cairns Group. So we will continue to focus on the issues that you raised. I will start from the last issue you raised and work up.The most important issue on which we will be focusing in 1995—and Senator Collins and I are working closely together on this with the industry—is the farm bill. The biggest decisions that will be made in the United States this year by Congress in determining the shape and nature of agricultural trade globally, but particularly to the United States and by the United States in other markets, will be in the farm bill.We have convened a committee with representatives of all the major interested commodity groups and with Senator Collins and me. We are working on a coordinated strategy. I very much appreciate the cooperation of the commodity groups in that they have taken a series of delegations—the most publicised of which was the dairy one—to Washington. Senator Collins is going this month and I will be going subsequently. The ambassador, as you know, has been making fairly high profile representations on this matter. That is our No. 1 focus for this year.Senator Boswell asked whether there will be more subsidies before 1 July. We expect there will be more subsidised exports under existing programs. The thing we have most sought to do is achieve a circumstance where there will be no further announcements of dairy export subsidies before 1 July, following on that most unwelcome round that was recently declared, about which we spoke earlier, Senator Boswell, and about which the industry made representations. As a result of our representations and those of the industry, we think there is a high probability that there will be no more. Mr Rowley and others from the dairy industry have not been able to obtain categorical assurances that there will be no further allocations. My personal view is that the industry in the United States would like them. I suspect that for budget and administrative reasons the odds are that there will not be any, but I can give no guarantee.Under EEP there is continuing pressure in the United States to proceed on export enhancement programs and to move it after the Uruguay Round to a market support program. That would be a concern, but at least the size of it will be constrained by the Uruguay Round agreements. Each year the extent to which there are subsidies available will be constrained by the limits negotiated from now until the end of the century through the Uruguay Round—not sufficient limits, but a very good start. So, over the years, as ABARE and other assessments have made clear, there will be improved access for Australian products to those global markets.

12,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator FORSHAW",656,"NSW","ALP","N/A",1363,"—My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. I draw the ministers attention to a story on the front page of todays Sydney Morning Herald which claims that within the next year two million Australian drivers will have to pay up to $350 each to convert their car airconditioners so that they can use non-ozone depleting refrigerants instead of CFCs.

13,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator FAULKNER","5K4","NSW","ALP","N/A",1363,"—I have seen the article to which Senator Forshaw refers in his question. It seems to me, unfortunately, that the article has been crafted to cause very unnecessary alarm. Let me first say that the headline of the article to which Senator Forshaw refers—that is, that two million Australians will have to pay up to $350 each within the next year to convert their car airconditioners—is categorically incorrect.It is well known that the manufacture and import of CFCs, apart from those needed for essential uses, will cease on 31 December 1995. This is consistent with the requirements of the Montreal protocol. CFCs have already been phased out in many industry sectors, including aerosols and refrigeration. The car airconditioning sector has in fact been one of the last to change.The Sydney Morning Herald article implies that all car owners will have to convert their car airconditioners in the next year. This is untrue. People with systems operating well can keep using them as long as they want to. There is no legal requirement for car airconditioners to be changed over to an alternative refrigerant by the end of the year. I stress that people do not have to rush out and convert their airconditioning equipment. But in the future when people need to have their equipment serviced, they might find that CFC is becoming either unavailable or very expensive. That is why the EPA is advising car owners to replace their car airconditioner gas with one of the new ozone-benign alternatives at the next major service. If they have it converted as part of routine servicing I have been advised that this will cost no more than $100 extra. This is because most parts are changed in a major service due to normal wear and tear.The Environment Protection Agency will conduct a public awareness campaign and a program to assist auto mechanics to provide accurate information to car owners. Australias actions in phasing out CFCs are part of a global commitment under the Montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer. The phase-out of all ozone depleting substances has the support of Commonwealth, state and territory governments. It has the support of industry and it has the support of the community. There are already signs that the Montreal protocol controls are starting to slow the rate of stratospheric ozone destruction. I am sure that will please all Australians.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[4]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Given that we are constantly told that only waste material, not suitable for sawn timber, is used for woodchips, can the minister assure the Senate that there are markets for the more than 25 per cent increase in sawn timber which this expansion would imply—in other words, an additional 275,000 tonnes of sawn timber?

It is true that the New South Wales government and New South Wales representatives on that particular working group have not supported the publication of the work that has been done to date by the so-called Janis working group.I can say that, for the Commonwealths part, we are very committed to seeing the establishment of a forest reserve system. We are very committed, as I have said in the past, to seeing a forest reserve system that is comprehensive, adequate and representative. I can say that we have been concerned about the lack of progress between the states and the government, that is, the Janis group, which has been developing the criteria for the comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system.In view of the difficulty in achieving agreement through the mechanism that is envisaged in the national forest policy statement, the Commonwealth does intend to develop its own position on CAR criteria to stimulate the policy debate and to move it forward. In fact, my own department has done substantial work to provide a basis for discussion on the CAR criteria within the Commonwealth by the development of a draft working paper.I can say as far as the Commonwealth is concerned—and I believe this is a principle that is shared by state governments—that a CAR reserve system will form an integral part of regional forest agreements. These agreements to be negotiated between the Commonwealth and the states will be aimed at striking a balance between a range of economic and environmental obligations that both tiers of government have regarding the management and protection of forests.As I said in answer to Senator Bells supplementary question, I can confirm with you, Senator, that we are committed as we progress this work to the development of a very balanced approach—to balance the interests of both conservation and those who work in the forestry sector.

It is true that the government is very keen to ensure that maximum opportunities exist for goods to be shipped into and out of Western Australia during this time of difficulty with both the Eyre Highway and the railway link cut or severely restricted. In the last two or three days representations have been made to me as customs minister by industry and the finance minister, Mr Beazley, in particular on what we can do to assist.As a consequence, a special arrangement has been made to allow international carriers to be used for shipping supplies into and out of Western Australia. Normally, when the Department of Transport and Communications allows foreign vessels to carry domestic cargo, there is a 10 per cent limit of the vessels deadweight tonnage before the vessel is regarded by customs to be on a domestic voyage. This means that there is scope for vessels on an international voyage to carry some domestic cargo without becoming liable for excise duty on the fuel used.Whilst other forms of transport are not available to Western Australia, the government has agreed to waive the 10 per cent rule in assessing duty liable. The waiver applies only where the department of transport has issued a single voyage permit allowing foreign vessels to carry domestic cargo into and out of Western Australia and where an Australian ship is not available. This will hopefully alleviate some of the isolation that Western Australia is currently experiencing and assist in minimising disruption to commercial activity.I am advised that it is possible that it may still be some time before the transcontinental railway link is re-established. These special arrangements will be available only whilst the transcontinental railway link is non-operational.

How can the minister claim this when the ABAs preliminary advice is that Australis pay TV did not purchase the rights prior to gazettal of the free to air list and that the anti-siphoning provisions therefore still apply?","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[9]/question[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The last Australian overseas cricket competition had no pay TV but it was not telecast because Channel 9 and the other networks decided it was not commercially viable to do so, which they are entitled to do.In the main, in the past when Australian teams have travelled to the West Indies, apart from the last occasion, I cannot recall a time when there has been television coverage. That is a great pity. The ultimate decision is a commercial decision for the networks. This is a one-off because of the claim, which may ultimately be validated because the final decision of the Broadcasting Authority has not yet been brought in, that this might be an exception to the anti-siphoning provision because of Australiss claim that it bought the rights before the anti-siphoning rules came in. If it did, then there is no way that the Commonwealth would or should retrospectively acquire them or take them away from it if they were bought in accordance with the law.Other networks have shown some interest in free to air rights.

When I was Minister for Administrative Services, I had representations from senators from all sides, none of them saying, `Please, sir, can I travel a bit more? I am not travelling enough. I do not remember any senator ever saying that—let alone the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I think it would be the worlds most unlikely suggestion that he would be desperately in search of another trip somewhere.Senators were frustrated that they were continually advised that they had these frequent flier entitlements, accumulated by fares paid for by the taxpayers, which they could use to fund the proper discharge of their parliamentary duties, but the existing rules did not allow them to use them. I had representations from the opposition and from the government; I am not sure whether I had any from the minor parties, but the position consistently applies equally to all the parties.Therefore, we started a review as to how we could use this benefit—instead of just handing this right purchased by the taxpayers back to the airlines—without exposing it to any misuse. That matter was not resolved by the time I finished being Minister for Administrative Services, but I understand that the new minister, as of 1 January, has put in place an arrangement to which, on the basis of formal advice from both the Attorney-Generals Department and the Remuneration Tribunal, there is no impediment. On the face of it, and as far as I can see from the study which I have done, it will actually save the taxpayers money.

Trips that would otherwise have been funded by taxpayers under existing Remuneration Tribunal entitlements will be funded by frequent flier points made available by the airlines. The use is intended to be very heavily regulated and proscribed so that it is for government purposes—for parliamentary and official purposes—in accordance with entitlements set down by the independent Remuneration Tribunal and the Parliamentary Entitlements Act. In fact, it is designed to save the taxpayers money, and I think that it will. We will be continuing to monitor it to ensure that it does.Rather than criticising the government for using frequent flier points, thus saving the taxpayers money, it should be realised that we would have been open to some criticism if we failed to do it. We have sought to proceed very cautiously because it is open to misunderstanding, which has been proved by the publicity on Sunday.

The Inspector-General has been involved in investigating it. One of the difficulties he has pointed out to us in terms of security at Salisbury is the absolute disparate nature of the buildings and their closeness to car parks, which makes security a nightmare. Most of these problems will be solved by the new consolidation program, of which Senator Chapman would be aware.I have looked at some of the issues, such as the computers. It was found that in many cases computer parts were taken by the employees on the basis that they were trade-ins for new computers and that the people who credited them for the trade-in did not want to take them. Nevertheless, the Inspector-General has found that security has been a problem at Salisbury for 40 years. Forty years of problems have not been properly reported up the chain. When there was a crackdown in 1992 by management—it was long overdue, because management was complicit in some of these practices—again, there was not proper compliance. Hence, we had the Inspector-Generals investigation and the various recommendations to tighten up security that are currently being implemented.Senator Chapman asks whether this issue warrants an independent inquiry. I am quite satisfied with the extent and breadth of the inquiries of the Inspector-General and the conclusions he has come up with. I have not yet seen anything that warrants a further inquiry. It warrants the strongest possible action to make sure that past practices, not all of which are outright theft—a lot of it is seen as freebies for friends, management, visitors or whatever—","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[11]/answer/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

The Minister for Transport announced on 4 May 1994 that the development of Sydneys new airport at Badgerys Creek will be accelerated with the construction of a runway capable of handling major scheduled aircraft operations. It is planned that a new 2,900-metre runway suitable for the use of large jet aircraft will be commissioned in 1998-99. This runway will be suitable for all domestic operations and international medium-haul operations for destinations such as Tokyo, Seoul, Bangkok, Hong Kong and Honolulu.The decision last year to construct the 2,900-metre runway has made Badgerys Creek a very real alternative to KSA. The new Sydney West airport will help meet the rapidly growing demand for scheduled air services to the Sydney region and assist in the economic development of the western Sydney region. The airport will provide the capacity to alleviate any peak period congestion at KSA.Work has recently been completed on a review of the airport master plan and preparation of a new concept design, cost estimates and implementation program for the development. The results of this work are now being incorporated into an evaluation of alternative arrangements for the construction and future operations of the new airport.The Commonwealth is working with the New South Wales government on the provision of adequate land transport links to the new airport to ensure that passengers and freight can be moved efficiently. An EIS on options for the national highway between Prestons and Cecil Park, for which the Minister for Transport has pledged $200 million, has commenced and work is already under way on an engineering study to identify a rail corridor to Sydney West airport.Sydney West airport will be curfew free and offer 24-hour operations.

Their reporting of the effect of that accreditation process is most interesting information.The Senate will remember that at the time of the introduction of accreditation a number of senators were concerned about an evaluation process. I certainly remember that the Democrats, and Senator Lees in particular, were concerned that an evaluation process be established. Coopers Lybrand was chosen as the consultant to do that evaluation and it is halfway through a two-stage process. A draft report gives very encouraging signs about the accreditation process in terms of the other issues that interest Senator Boswell in particu lar.First of all, the people participating report that they can now see measured improvement in the quality of care that their centres provide and, secondly, they have found it a very fruitful, interesting and constructive exercise to have participated in the accreditation process.

It is a two-stage process, as I say.

I will be looking forward to the final report, as no doubt you will be, Senator.On all the evidence so far, the fear that it would be a very expensive exercise is not borne out at all. That is contrary, I might say, to what Senator Alston advised us in the run-up to the election, that the coalition was opposed to this totally unnecessary, ineffective, expensive compulsory accreditation system.

The key role by overseas bidders is usually in having an already developed piece of equipment and commitments for technology transfer that go with it.It is an interesting question inasmuch as I do not think I have yet had drawn to my attention a complaint about the dumping of defence equipment in Australia below what you might regard as market price.

Existing Commonwealth legislation fails to meet our obligations under the Basel convention and last week the government decided to amend the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1989.The amendments will ensure that Australian exports of hazardous wastes are managed in an environmentally sound manner. Currently, the act regulates only imports and exports of hazardous wastes that have no value—that is, wastes intended for final disposal. The amendments will extend regulation to trade in hazardous wastes destined for recycling and recovery operations. These changes will provide greater certainty to industry and meet our international obligations under the Basel convention.Most of Australias trading partners have become parties to the Basel convention. They have asked Australia to notify them of proposed exports of hazardous wastes, as is required by the convention. The amendments to the act will enable the government to ensure that this is done.In proceeding to amend the act, the government has consulted very extensively with both industry and NGOs. A policy reference group has been formed to give continuing advice. An expert technical group is being formed to advise the government on difficult and substantive questions—such as how to define a hazardous waste in law, how to distinguish between products and wastes, and what level of contamination by hazardous constituents renders a waste hazardous. This takes into account concerns that have been raised by industry that appropriate consultation should be undertaken before the act is amended.Signatories to the Basel convention generally agree that hazardous waste should be treated at home whenever possible. Australian policy is that such wastes should be exported for final disposal only under exceptional circumstances, and this policy will now be explicit in the act.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[16]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I refer to the case being brought before the High Court seeking a declaration that section 329A of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, which makes it an offence to advocate an informal vote, is invalid. Is the government committed to defending the validity of section 329A? Is it the opinion of the governments legal advisers that the section is valid, despite the High Courts reasoning in throwing out the governments proposal to ban electronic political advertising? If so, are these the same advisers who led the government into its latest debacle before the High Court over the powers of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission?

Three months ago I asked questions at the arts estimates committee relating to a computer art display which involved depictions of excessive violence and child sex abuse. The answer arrived late last week, with the minister expressing his concern over the work, which was funded by a $25,000 grant from the Visions of Australia committee. I ask: when did the minister write to the chair of the committee seeking a full explanation of the grant; when does he expect a reply; and when will the minister extend his investigations to include the other taxpayer-funded activities of the Australian Network for Art and Technology?","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[18]/question[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Fortunately, Senator Boswell has asked a question about which I have some brief. When I was minister for the arts I knew something about the particular coalition network that you are talking about, but I was not aware of the Visions of Australia grant which was made subsequently.As you correctly say, the minister has expressed his concern that work of the type you describe was included in an exhibition which received Visions of Australia funding. I cannot give you the date on which he wrote to the chair. Obviously, I cannot give you the date when he expects to get a reply because that is, to some extent, out of his hands. But I will seek to get the detailed information you ask for.I think both the Visions of Australia program and the Australian Network for Art and Technology are very worthwhile initiatives. I do not want to see a particular example undermine the important principle of the Visions of Australia program, which tours visual arts, or the Network for Art and Technology, which is where the modern art works which are to be the content of the so-called information superhighway might be generated and are likely to develop in the multimedia area. I do not want to see those things undermined by what does seem to have been a cause of concern which the minister has raised. I will get the detail that Senator Boswell has raised from the minister and forward it to him as soon as possible.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[18]/answer[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

81,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CROWLEY","ZF4","SA","ALP","N/A",1374,"—On Tuesday, 28 February, Senator Sandy Macdonald asked me a question on oversupply of general practitioners. I undertook to provide further information on the number of general practitioners in Australia and, because it is mainly in tabular form, I seek leave to have the figures incorporated in Hansard .Leave granted.The document read as follows —Non Specialist Medical Workforce Numbers 1993-94Full-time Part-time Casual Total FTERecognised GPs 12738 2717 859 16314 13416Others (non VR etc) 1487 1488 4502 7477 1866Total NS 14225 4205 5361 23791 15282FTE = full-time equivalent; NS = non specialistThe RACGP recommends a ratio of 1 FTE GP to 1500 people as an optimum.For historical reasons, most workforce data is amalgamated to combine both GPs and other non specialists. As illustrated in the above table, non specialist medical practitioners are predominantly GPs.Although there is no agreed ideal doctor:patient, using 1 FTE non specialist (FTENS) for 1500 people, the best estimate is that Australia had an oversupply of approximately 3000 FTENS in 1993-94.Using this ratio, Australia needed 11 887 FTE NSs in 1993-94. Australia had an oversupply of 3395 FTE NSs.The table below shows the net supply of FTE NSs in regions of Australia using a doctor:patient ratio of 1:1500Net Full-time Equivalent Non Specialist Supply using an optimum doctor:patient ratio of 1:15001993-94capital city—3037other urban—470total urban—3507rural major—237rural other—242remote major—22remote other—85total rural/remote—112Total Australia—3395NB: a positive number is an excess over raw requirements, a negative number is a deficit.The above figures show that, generally, there is an oversupply of non specialists in urban areas and an under supply in most rural and remote regions.However, these figures are amalgamated national figures and may obscure the supply situation in particular areas. The supply of doctors is usually best understood by examining smaller, discrete areas. For example, even though there is a general oversupply of GPs in capital cities, this conceals the fact that there are some shortages in some areas in capital cities and a substantial oversupply in other parts. National ratios show overall trends and should be used with caution.GENERAL PRACTICE RURAL INCENTIVES PROGRAM—STATISTICS OVERVIEWFigures as at 9 February 1995Total funding available for GPRIP in 1994-95: $15.3m(subsequent years indexed for inflation)Relocation grantstotal no. of applicants—232No. of approved relocations—104applications rejected—66*applications pending/withdrawn—16applications on hold/being assessed—46Training grantsTotal no. of applicants—72no. of approved training grants—31applications rejected—14*applications withdrawn—0applications on hold/being assessed—27Remote area grantsfunding allocation 1994-95—$2.5mtotal no. of grants available—50grants approved—24applications rejected—0*applications pending—9*Only a very small number of applications have been rejected by the Department where applicants have not met the guidelines eg have not been registered as a medical practitioner in Australia.

82,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CROWLEY","ZF4","SA","ALP","N/A",1375,"—On Wednesday, 1 March Senator OChee asked me a question about magnetic resonance imaging. I would like to provide the Senate with some more information. The governments policy for promoting the provision of MRI services to Australians is based on the results of a comprehensive national assessment program. This assessment program was established as a joint Commonwealth-state initiative and conducted under the auspices of the National Health Technology Advisory Panel over the period 1986 to 1990. The resulting policy for funding MRI services responds to the concerns of the Commonwealth and state governments that complex and high cost technologies like MRI are introduced in a planned and cost-effective way. Accordingly, the policy targets subsidies to a set number of publicly owned MRI units via a grants program to states. Based on NHTAPs recommendations, a national supply target of 18 MRI units has been set to meet the needs of private, or non-compensable, patients and Medicare hospital patients mainly for neurological and neurosurgical applications.Under the MRI program, the Commonwealth provides grants to the states for the purchase of MRI units and about 80 per cent of recurrent costs. State governments are responsible for locating the Medicare-funded units within major neurological centres and choosing the physical location of units. State governments provide the remaining 20 per cent of recurrent costs and are also able to purchase services from privately owned units. MRI is available at the designated units free of charge to private, or non-compensable, patients, hospital outpatients and Medicare hospital in-patients on the basis of a referral by a specialist. In 1994-95 the Commonwealths contribution to the cost of the MRI program will be $21.5 million.In Queensland, Medicare-funded units are located at the Royal Brisbane and the Princess Alexandra hospitals in Brisbane and at the Townsville Hospital. The Queensland government decided on the location of these units. Under the MRI program, states are able to purchase services from privately owned units. This provision enables states to ensure that patients who, for medical reasons, are unable to travel to the Medicare-funded units have access to MRI services. In the Northern Territory the state government purchases services from a private sector facility in Darwin in order to provide patients with access to MRI services.A targeted grants program is considered a better funding approach than Medicare rebates for providing Australians with access to clinically appropriate and quality MRI services which are affordable to patients and the community while constraining the proliferation of a complex and potentially expensive technology.To ensure the governments policy for funding MRI services responds to developments in the technology of MRI and its clinical use, the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) has asked the Australian Health Technology Advisory Committee, AHTAC—NHTAPs successor body—to undertake a comprehensive review of MRI in Australia. AHTAC advice is being sought on a number of issues, including the accepted clinical role of MRI in the light of these developments and Australias resulting needs for MRI services, including the number of units, their locational requirements and other measures to promote quality, appropriate and cost-effective use of the technology. AHTAC will be considering the matter of the review at its April 1995 meeting.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[21]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
83,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CRANE","UW4","(Western Australia)","LP","N/A",1376,"—I move:That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins), to a question without notice asked by Senator Burns this day, relating to the meat industry.One has to express some sorrow that this saga is continuing because it could have well and truly been dealt with some time ago. I say that with regard to this matter, the unfortunate allegations made by Mr Ford relating to certain things in the meat industry and also the sad death of a child in Adelaide.The reason I say that this issue could have well and truly been dealt with some time ago is that, if we look at the records of what has happened, we find that a letter which was written by 140 AQIS officers dates back to November of last year. If we had seen quick and decisive action at that time by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) through AQIS, a lot of this could have well been avoided.Having said that, one must also severely criticise what Mr Ford and the representatives from the CPSU did in front of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee last Friday. Mr Ford said publicly a number of things, including that if he had indemnity he would come clean and put the matters on the table. He had that indemnity last Friday, and he failed to do that. In terms of what he did put down, he mentioned there are about eight cases—I did not even know there were a number of cases—and he named two, Radburn and Lake Cargelligo.It appears from the information collected—and this is once again where I am critical of Senator Collins, because he said that all these things were being referred to other departments or other institutions to be looked at—in terms of the Radburn case that was dealt with some 12 months or so ago, that in fact Mr Radburn has been found guilty of dealing with misrepresentation, not substitution. There is a very distinct difference. Why couldnt Senator Collins come into this place and put that information down on the table?In terms of Lake Cargelligo—and once again hardly any information was given to us in regard to that—surely it would appear that that particular case was not continued with some 18 months or so ago, because there was sufficient evidence to back it up. These allegations are extremely damaging to the meat industry and are very unfortunate for domestic consumption and our capacity to operate internationally. The minister has not dealt with these issues in a succinct, decisive and quick manner.I re-emphasise the point that they were first highlighted to AQIS last November. I believe this campaign by Mr Ford and the CPSU is to stall the quality assurance programs that are being developed in the meat industry. Once again, it is incumbent upon this minister to come into this place and to put down quite clearly that the reforms in AQIS, the reforms in the development of quality assurance in the meat industry, and the responsibility of looking after the product is put fairly and squarely in the hands of those who have the commercial interests and who handle and look after the product.In relation to AQIS, over the years we have seen the proliferation of inspectors, the cost of those inspectors, the inefficiency that has occurred, the serious meat substitutions that occurred some years ago and the problems with a number of chemical contaminations and what have you that were not being properly assessed and not being properly done. When Mr Ford makes allegations that meat with 12 times the allowable limit of chemical residues has been put onto the domestic market without giving one skerrick of evidence as to what the situation is, it is incumbent upon the responsible minister to take direct action immediately. Why didnt the minister come in here today in answer to a dorothy dixer and say straight out that the full force of the law will be brought against these people who perpetrate such unfounded allegations on the meat industry?","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[22]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
84,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BROWNHILL","RD4","(New South Wales-","NP","Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia)",1377,"—I also join with Senator Crane in asking the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) why he did not come into the chamber today and tell us that he had looked at all the allegations that were made to our committee on Friday by Mr Ford. We were told at that committee meeting that we were not going to have the benefit of all the supposed substantiation of all those allegations because they had all been given to the minister.For the minister to be asked a dorothy dixer about all the accusations made by Mr Ford and then not to tell the Senate what his feelings of them are means that it is a rather sad day for the chamber. So many allegations about the meat industry were made by Mr Ford, and for what purpose? Senator Crane suggested that it may be because Mr Fords union does not want quality assurance to come in. It might be because he is frightened that if quality assurance comes in some of his members will lose their jobs. He basically said that to our inquiry on Friday.The allegations that have been made have been very bad for the meat industry and have jeopardised our overseas trade. When allegations were made about the 1982 substitution scandals, for example, there were more meat inspectors on the meat chain at that stage than there has ever been. Basically, Mr Ford was saying to our committee that we cannot move to quality assurance because we have to have plenty of people on the chain to look after things.Allegations have been made which need to be cleaned up quickly. It is a great pity the minister did not come in here today and tell us that he had come to some understanding of it. He will prosecute or go ahead with some of those allegations to find out where they lead. But he left everything up in the air.At the same time Mr Ford was making allegations to our committee on Friday, the Commonwealth and state governments agreed to adopt mandatory codes of practice for health and hygiene in all slaughtering and meat processing establishments in Australia. The minister is not cleaning up one thing but starting off something else already. He could have done so much more today by telling us what conclusions he has come to with regard to the allegations that have been made, clear them up once and for all and either throw them out or, if somebody has done any wrongdoing, make sure they are prosecuted and something is done about it.Question resolved in the affirmative.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[23]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
85,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CHAPMAN","FF4","(South Australia)","LP","N/A",1378,"—I move:That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), to a question without notice asked by Senator Chapman this day, relating to security at the Defence Science and Technology Organisation office at Salisbury.Last week I revealed that Defence Science and Technology Organisation employees in the scientific and engineering servicing department had stolen gold-plating supplies over a period extending for many years. As part of that theft, files were fraudulently altered to hide the theft. There is concern that at least one senior official had removed several files containing valuable metals. I have also learnt that even the Australian Protective Service security officials assigned to the DSTO were on the take. It appears that nine Australian Protective Service officials were presented with their service badges dipped in gold and given to them upon their retirement. When the practice was made public last week, the defence departments own spokesman, Brigadier Adrian DHage, labelled the practice as part of `a long-standing culture with the DSTO.The minister is aware that this unacceptable practice has been identified as far back as 1991, but to date little has been done to stamp it out. Today we learn that not only are the DSTO employees stealing the gold supplies but theft also appears to have been rampant in the guidance weapons division and the avionics technology division. I have here the result of a missing asset items list dated 22 December 1994 which has some 146 pieces of equipment listed as having vanished without a trace.

89,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CHAPMAN","FF4","(South Australia)","LP","N/A",1378,"—Perhaps a forklift has gone missing as well. The list continues: several typewriters, a boring machine, a drilling machine, a fax machine, a laser, several welders and even an entire vacuum encapsulation plant. About the only thing that is not on the missing assets list is a partridge in a pear tree. The minister said today in answering the question that he believed the existing investigation by the Inspector-General of Defence was adequate. I remind him, as I said earlier, that it has been known since 1991 that this unacceptable practice had been going on. Yet nothing had been done, until I raised the matter in parliament last week publicly, to take any action against those employees involved in this activity. Needless to say, I suspect that the list I have incorporated in Hansard today is only the tip of the iceberg. If an independent inquiry were launched, which the minister seems intent on resisting, we would find that much more has walked out the doors of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation.The concern I have with this apparent practice of DSTO is that we are talking about one of Australias most highly sensitive defence institutions. The DSTO has the responsibility of developing sophisticated weapons guidance systems, tactical electronics warfare components, defence communications and cryptographic research. It is disappointing that four years ago the minister failed to take effective, immediate steps to stamp out these abhorrent practices, which have come to be regarded as a part of the culture at DSTO for many years. The public has a right to expect that their defence institutions are properly managed and secure, but the evidence to date suggests this is far from the case. One wonders what information may have been on the computers which disappeared from the guidance weapons division and the avionics division at Salisbury.I am not convinced that the existing inquiry is adequate. This represents a serious threat to Australias national security. The fact that computers and disk drives have mysteriously vanished from DSTO is a primary concern and should be the subject of an independent inquiry—at least independent from the minister and independent from the defence department. The potential for a cover-up within the department is certainly a major concern. It is frightening that these dishonest practices can be passed off as part of DSTO culture. What else is part of its culture—selling defence secrets to our potential enemies? With the dishonesty exhibited in this situation, this is highly likely. Without an open and frank inquiry, we simply do not know the answer to these questions.Question resolved in the affirmative.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[24]/speech/talk.start[4]/para","N/A","N/A"

92,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator KNOWLES","TH4","(Western Australia)","LP","N/A",1382,"—Okay, from what you have heard I have said so far. What I listed at question time, Senator Evans, was the whole list of 143 breaches committed by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet in terms of simple things such as failure to remit income tax instalment, failure to issue group certificates, failure to pay superannuation productivity benefits and casual staff wages paid from petty cash. If people in the private sector had actually done that, they would be subject to prosecution and, as I said before, hefty penalties.The situation remains constant that this Prime Minister (Mr Keating) can consistently skirt around all of these things. It does not matter whether or not it is his own personal income tax return that he fails to lodge, whether it is that of his piggery or anything else. It matters not to this Prime Minister. In the Auditor-Generals report, under the `Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, it states:This section details the results of the ANAO audit into irregularities concerning minor expenditure, including the payment of wages from petty cash to casual staff, at the Lodge and Kirribilli House (the Official Establishments) and the action taken to rectify the irregularities.Surely these irregularities should not be occurring in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The report continues:This matter was raised in the press in August 1994 where it was alleged that the payment of wages from petty cash was highly irregular and in contravention of section 70AH of the Audit Act 1901 .As I say, that is not the only thing that has been found to be irregular. The report also states:Casual staff are employed to assist with catering for large functions, as well as to fill vacancies pending permanent filling of positions. Before mid-1994, casual staff were paid wages from petty cash, no employee declaration forms were completed, no tax was paid on their behalf or group certificates issued, and no employer superannuation contribution payments were made.This is simply and utterly not acceptable, coming as it does from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and from institutions such as the Lodge and Kirribilli House. We need to be reminded that it was those staff members at the Lodge who were dismissed without any reason whatsoever. If that too had happened in the private sector, then there would have been very serious questions asked. But for some reason this Prime Minister seems to be able to get away with all of these things and get off scot-free.The report notes that the investigation revealed that the press reports were accurate. The report states that the departments administrative procedural manual included in its definition of petty cash expenditure:. . . expenditure not exceeding $100 in respect of any single purchase or service. Cash payments to casual employees or cash payments for supplies for the Official Establishments are exempt from this definition.The report goes on to say:This definition conflicted with the requirements of section 70AH of the Audit Act, which prohibits payments to employees in cash unless otherwise determined by the Minister for Finance. Such a determination had not been obtained.The issue is that this Prime Minister seems to be able to go about things willy-nilly. At the end of the day, he has to be held responsible for something. The buck has to stop somewhere. Presumably the Prime Minister is ultimately responsible for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Where does the buck stop? Is this man prepared to take any responsibility? The report goes on to say:The ANAO noted that during 1993-94 there had been nineteen petty cash reimbursements totalling about $43 000 for the Lodge and Kirribilli House. Casual staff wages included in these reimbursements totalled almost $10 000 in nearly 80 transactions.This is not just a one-off thing. People might say that he may not have known that this was going on, but this was happening in the residences in which he lives and he attends the functions in those residences. Surely he should be aware of what is going on. The report also notes that two casuals had their days wages retrospectively approved. The report further states:The ANAOs examination also identified that there were no receipts for some household requisites. The ANAO recommended that receipts be obtained for all individual purchases from petty cash which exceeded $20.The Department agreed with the recommendations and advised that the recommendation has been implemented to the extent that it is cost-effective to do so.Who decides whether it is cost effective or not?Question resolved in the affirmative.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[25]/speech/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
93,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ELLISON","9X5","(Western Australia)","LP","N/A",1383,"—I move:That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Evans) this day, to a question without notice asked by Senator Ellison on 2 March, relating to the detention of Mr Eric Robert Bowra in the United Arab Emirates.Up until last Friday, Robert Bowra was a prisoner in the United Arab Emirates. Mr Bowra had been imprisoned as a result of a collision between two boats. He was driving one boat which he was using to exhibit to the United Arab Emirates navy. He was doing that in the course of his employment. If this had happened in Australia he would not have been charged with any offence under our law. Nonetheless, we must respect the law of foreign countries. Under the law of the United Arab Emirates, he was accordingly convicted and sentenced to a term of 12 months imprisonment. That was reduced on 5 February 1995 to six months. However, notwithstanding the order of the court that he serve only six months, which expired on 6 February, he served another month before his release last Friday.I want to place on record my congratulations for the efforts of Mr Philip Nixon, a business associate of Mr Bowra, who worked untiringly to secure his release and also pay tribute to the Bowra family and in particular Jenny Bowra, Rob Bowras wife, who travelled to the United Arab Emirates in an effort to free her husband. This has been a trying time for the family. They have suffered personally, emotionally and financially. As I understand it, the business that Mr Bowra is involved in has suffered irretrievably and the human cost has been gigantic.This serves as a lesson to the government that there are Australian citizens who travel to remote parts of the world in an effort to promote exports for this country and that, from time to time, through no fault of their own they may run foul of foreign laws. It is in that context that I put it to the government in the strongest terms that it has to stand by our citizens who go abroad and run into strife in these sorts of circumstances.It is not unreasonable for any Australian to expect its government to stand by them in times of strife overseas. This was not your normal situation of a drug runner or someone who had committed a heinous crime overseas. It has to be distinguished greatly from that sort of situation. I say to the government and the people of Australia: let us learn from this lesson and ensure that in future this sort of situation does not happen again. This man was imprisoned whilst he had been granted bail. He was not released, even though a court order had granted him bail. He was kept beyond his sentence for a whole month and not released. I would submit that this is a clear instance where the government could use its full weight and make communications at the highest level.Whilst I acknowledge that Senator Evans did write to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the United Arab Emirates, I put it to the government that this could have been done at an earlier stage. I note that on the Today program on Channel 9, Peter Harvey, who is travelling with the Prime Minister, said that the Prime Minister was going to make representations in the United Arab Emirates in an endeavour to gain the release of this man. Of course, Mr Bowra was released last Friday. Either Mr Harvey got his facts wrong or he just was not aware of the situation. Maybe the Prime Minister had misled him or perhaps even the Prime Minister was not aware of the situation.Nonetheless, this has been a most serious case. I believe it is one that we must learn from. The government must set in plan a future program for the effective assistance of Australian nationals who get into this sort of strife overseas.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[26]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Australian government made its position very clear at the outset: while there are limitations to what we can do for ordinary Australian citizens who get in strife with the law in other countries in circumstances where that law is apparently being applied properly by its own standards, where it becomes apparent that there is something questionable about the application of that countrys law we will respond very quickly with appropriate representations. That is what happened in this instance.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[27]/speech/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

It is always a matter of making a judgment in these cases as to whether or not your representations are going to be productive or whether they will simply be counterproductive in all the circumstances of the case. That is a matter which you just have to make case by case judgments about.I believe we did everything possible in the circumstances of this matter to move it forward with results that I think are now evident. I am not sure at the end of the day what was the most influential factor—whether the ministerial representations did make any difference or whether it was simply a matter of the law of Abu Dhabi working itself out.Throughout all of this, Australia continues to offer in these sorts of cases, whether or not we make extra representations, what consular advice and assistance we can to prisoners, whoever they are and whatever the state of play may be with the law of the country inquestion and its observance in that case. We did that in the form of basic consular assistance with Mr Bowra right from the beginning.As to the Prime Ministers willingness to take this matter up, there were only very limited options available to him not least because he was only stopping in Dubai, not in Abu Dhabi. There is a completely different legal system basically in operation in the two emirates. He was nonetheless going to ask the ambassador to convey his concern about the situation to the authorities in Abu Dhabi when our ambassador met them tomorrow.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[27]/speech/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

There is only so much we can do for Australian citizens who get themselves in strife overseas. There seems to be a belief around the place that governments are absolutely omnipotent in terms of our capacity not only to be aware of all these situations and every one of their ins and outs but also to make a difference as to the way in which people are dealt with. Our hands are remarkably tied in these situations. There are very limited things we can do. Often when we do seek to make representations in circumstances where a matter of sensitivity is involved, it can be counterproductive unless those representations are extremely carefully handled.I became officially aware only this morning when a cable arrived—Senator Ellison might have heard earlier than that—that he had been released. By this stage, the Prime Minister was well on his way from Singapore to Dubai, and Mr Harvey had no doubt already filed his account of what was going to happen from Singapore. To be critical of the Prime Minister—as Senator Ellison was—the Prime Ministers staff or the government for not keeping people up to speed in that respect is, again, very unfair in all the circumstances. We were doing our best to keep track of a situation that clearly did need some attention. We gave it that attention.

These forests should be protected by the commitments of the Commonwealth and State Governments under the NFPS.These forests include:Coolangubra Wilderness and other areas of the S.E. Forests of NSW along with rainforest and other N.E. areas of NSW including Wingham, Mistake, Richmond Range, Chaelundi, North Washpool, Barrington and Dorrigo.The Southern Highlands, Great Western Tiers and Tarkine Wilderness of Tasmania.The Karri and Jarrah forests of S.W. Western Australia.The Errinundra Plateau and other areas of the East Gippsland forests of Victoria.The rainforests of the Proserpine region of Queensland.We request that the Government act urgently to protect our precious forests by utilising the Commonwealths legal and constitutional powers, including:Refusal of export woodchip licencesPowers to control corporationsProtection of areas listed on the register of the National EstateProtection and effective funding of areas identified for their World Heritage values.Genuine and effective action by the Government to protect these and other old growth and wilderness forests is critical. A comprehensive plantation strategy rather than exploiting native forests is the way forward for a truly environmentally responsible timber industry. We further request that the Government take effective action without further delay.To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembledThe petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth:That the ancient and irreplaceable native forests in the South West of Western Australia are being destroyed by logging for woodchipping, that many species in these forests are in danger of extinction, and that Federal Government intervention is urgently needed to protect our natural heritage.Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate, in parliament assembled, should call on the Federal Government to:1.immediately use its powers to protect Hawke, Sharpe, Giblett and Rocky blocks and all other high conservation value and old growth forests in the South West of Western Australia,2.refuse to renew woodchip export licences unless it is guaranteed that the wood comes from tree crops, agroforestry or plantations and,3.take steps to ensure the rapid transfer of the wood products industry from all native forests and on to plantations, tree crops and agroforestry.To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. We the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully submit that:The Federal Minister for Immigration, Senator Bolkus reverse a decision refusing entry to Australia for Dana Nance, the Romanian adopted daughter of South Australian parents, Graham and Jennifer Nance and, that the Minister use his powers under Section 35(1) of the Migration Act 1958 in the public interest to personally intervene and allow Dana Nance to become an Australian citizen.Your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:1.We are opposed to the sex guide endorsed by Ms Lawrence, Minister for Health in the Keating Government, and published in the December issue of Cleo.2.We believe that the sex guide encourages dangerous sexual practices which could have serious medical and moral effects.We call on Ms Lawrence to withdraw her endorsement of this sex guide and for the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, to indicate his disapproval.And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.To the Honourable President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned shows:Australias old growth forest and wilderness areas are being diminished as a result of continued logging. The Federal Government has granted new woodchip export licences despite its agreement for a moratorium on logging in high conservation areas.Your petitioners ask that the Senate should:apply conditions retrospectively to woodchip licences in order to meet Commonwealth obligations, andexclude from licences, woodchip derived from old growth forests and wilderness.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/petition.grp/proctext/interject/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

127,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MARGETTS","DX5","(Western Australia)","GWA","N/A",1393,"—Pursuant to contingent notice of motion, I move:That so much of standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Margetts moving a motion to provide for the conduct of business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion No. 1316 standing in the name of Senator Margetts for this day relating to the transportation of plutonium waste.Why is this debate urgent? I think we should start with a quick re-statement of the hazards. This material is some of the most radioactive waste ever produced. A person standing one metre away from an unshielded glass block of plutonium waste would receive a fatal dose of radiation in one minute. An accident along the route—for example, an on-board fire—could be catastrophic. The first shipment will contain 28 glass blocks of plutonium waste. There are 3,000 such glass blocks waiting to be returned to Japan. Returning them all could take up to 100 shipments. How many will pass by Australia?Why is this urgent? Many countries along the possible routes have, by now, either condemned or expressed concern at the shipment. They include Argentina, Indonesia, Ecuador, Brazil, South Africa, Chile, Fiji, the Philippines, the Caribbean community—CARICOM—Aruba and Dutch Antilles, Jamaica, Dominican Republic, British Virgin Islands, Honduras, Ethiopia, US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Martinique, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru and six members of the United States House of Representatives. Australia has not.It has not opposed the 1992 Akatsuki Maru shipment despite widespread regional and international opposition. One of the favoured routes for this waste shipment is across the Indian Ocean and through the Tasman Sea. This route is highly likely for the exact reason that Australia has not opposed the shipment. We may then become the favourite route for future shipments. Waiting to win or lose this game of Russian roulette is not good enough. The next chamber is unlikely to be empty.It is urgent because the question has to be asked: why wont the Australian government express its concern, given the obvious dangers involved and the fact that this could be the first of many such highly hazardous shipments? One of the reasons is obviously that we are compromised by our uranium sales to Japan. The bilateral agreement under which we sell uranium to Japan specifies those parts of the Japanese nuclear program in which Australian uranium can be used. This constitutes Australian approval of the program.Under the 1982 agreement, it was agreed that the Japanese could send spent fuel containing Australian uranium to France and the United Kingdom to be reprocessed, and then take back the plutonium that was separated. This reprocessing contract between the French and the Japanese also specifies that the high level waste created by the reprocessing of spent fuel has to be returned to Japan. It is exactly this type of waste that may now pass close to Australia. (Quorum formed)It is urgent because, whilst the current wastes do not arise from the reprocessing of Australian uranium, in a future shipment they could. Regardless, it is clear that by supporting the Japanese nuclear program—which includes the reprocessing of spent fuel and the creation of extremely hazardous plutonium wastes—Australia is complicit in this waste shipment and in others which may follow.","N/A","PLUTONIUM SHIPMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/sso/speech[1]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

The waste has resulted from the reprocessing of Japanese nuclear fuel in France to recover plutonium and uranium for recycling in Japans nuclear energy program. The waste contains no usable plutonium or uranium and is not significant from a nuclear non-proliferation perspective.

142,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator HILL","BH4","(South Australia-","LP","Leader of the Opposition)",1395,"—Senator Margetts does not really expect a full debate on this matter at the moment. It is a technique, and a useful one, to lift the profile of a particular issue, and she has taken the half an hour opportunity to do so. She knows, as well as any other senator, that these matters can be debated in general business. The Greens get two seventy-sixths of the time available, and I do not think they have had an item of general business for some time, although I might be mistaken on that. But that is the correct time for debate of these matters.On behalf of the opposition, we think the matters that are the subject of the substance of the issue, as far as they relate to the international transport of radioactive materials, are a worthy subject for consideration by this chamber. It may not be that it is of immediacy if, as the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht) says, this particular transport is not crossing Australias 200-mile limit.However, I think there is a public concern at the moment as to the need for assurances on the proper safe handling of radioactive material. There is also, I think, some public confusion as to the status of this material. Senator Schacht said it is in a vitrified form—and, presumably, it is put in that form for better safety in travel. I am not sure exactly how that works if the plutonium then has to be recovered from it in order to be burnt in the reactors in Japan. But certainly the public are entitled to know that, and they are entitled to know exactly what safety assurances the Australian government can give.So at an appropriate time it would seem to me to be a very sensible subject for this chamber to consider. It would give us the opportunity to listen to the governments assurances as to how it does protect Australias interests in these matters. Even if it is not appropriate on this occasion, I am sure that there will be an occasion in the future when such a shipment does intrude upon Australias zone, and that will be of direct interest to the Australian people.Later on in the amended motion of Senator Margetts, she raises the whole issue of the nuclear fuel cycle and reiterates the opposition of the Greens to that. I think in some ways that is a bit unfortunate because it tends to blur the issue. That debate is one that has been had many times over the years; the debate that I have not heard many times is the one concerning international transport of these materials.Chances are that we will find there will be an increasing number of these transports as nuclear fuel is reprocessed and moved back to source reactors. Also, there are the obligations that were mentioned by Senator Schacht to take back the waste from such reprocessing. The safety of such transport is obviously a matter of concern to the international community and a matter of concern to the Australian community. The Australian people would want to be assured that the Australian government is satisfied—and they would want to know the basis on which it was satisfied—that the transport of that waste is not something that is dangerous.I personally look forward to the opportunity for that debate to take place. We in the coalition have, I guess, demonstrated our bona fides in this debate by raising issues of concern about the transport of low level waste within Australia and whether it is being transported in a safe way, a way that gives confidence to the Australian people, and also whether it is being stored in a safe way. Our criticism of the Australian government for failing to put in place its permanent repository for this low level waste, waste that is already in Australia, is well known. We are looking for the Senate, through its committee process, to have a look again at the issue of low level waste in Australia and the storage of that waste.But this motion by Senator Margetts relates to high level radioactive material being transported across the world in shipping. I think the safety regime that has been developed by the international community is something that should be debated at an appropriate time in this place.","N/A","PLUTONIUM SHIPMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/sso/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
143,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COULTER","TF4","(South Australia)","AD","N/A",1396,"—We, the Australian Democrats, support the suspension of orders because we think this is a very important issue. After having heard both Senator Schacht and Senator Hill, I am rather alarmed at their evident lack of understanding of the very important aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle which underlie this motion. For the edification of those two senators, I point out that the fuel which is used in a nuclear reactor consists of uranium 235 and uranium 238. The uranium 235 is the less common element. It is the one which is fissionable. The process of enrichment increases the concentration up to a point where that fuel can be used. But, inevitably, a lot of uranium 238 is carried into the nuclear reactor. It is that uranium 238 which is then transmuted in the reactor into plutonium 239 and higher isotopes of plutonium.When the fuel comes out of the reactor, a very wide range of radioactive materials is present. There are present some very short half-life, very intense radioactive substances; mid-term radioactive substances, like strontium 90 and caesium 137 with half-lives of 28 and 30 years respectively; very long-lived isotopes, such as plutonium 239 with a half-life of 24,000 years; and higher isotopes which have variable half-lives but generally very long half-lives.The practice of treating this material is to leave it in cooling ponds for anything from three or four months up to several years while those short half-life materials decay. Then it is sent off, if it can be, for reprocessing. In the reprocessing we attempt to remove the remaining uranium 235 and plutonium 239, which can be used as fuels either for nuclear power stations or indeed for weapons, and we attempt to sequester the medium-term materials—the strontium 90, caesium 137 and that class of things with half-lives measured in tens of years—and the longer half-life materials, like the higher isotopes of plutonium, americium and a whole range of others which have very long half-lives. It is that material which is then perhaps placed in glass. In this case the French have placed it in glass. It is an attempt to render that material safer.I think that is the real point at issue: how safe is this material with these very long half-lives which is being transported more than halfway round the world, from France to Japan? I think there is considerable evidence that it is not particularly safe. I say to Senator Hill that there is no intention to extract it back out of the glass and use it as fuel at all. It is sequestered because it poses a danger, and there is an attempt here to put it into a material which makes it safe.However, some work in Adelaide which goes back a number years shows that these radioactive elements which are alpha remitters—that is, they emit very high energy particles—being contained in glass in fact leads to the quite rapid breakdown of this glass and the release of the radioactive elements. It was precisely this sort of observation that led to people at the Australian National University looking at the process of incorporating these in a rock-like material—the so-called synroc process. But, unfortunately, synroc is subject to exactly the same breakdown process.","N/A","PLUTONIUM SHIPMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/sso/speech[4]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

147,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CHAMARETTE","SN5","(Western Australia)","GWA","N/A",1397,"—I rise to complete some of the points that Senator Margetts was unable to make regarding the urgency of this debate and the reasons for it to be held and to also reply to some of the comments that have been made previously, possibly in ignorance. Firstly, Senator Schacht assured the Senate that material in the vitrified form is safer material. I presume he meant that we therefore do not have an urgent or important matter before us. I repeat something that Senator Margetts said: a person standing one metre away from an unshielded glass block of plutonium waste—or the vitrified waste, as Senator Schacht called it—would receive a fatal dose of radiation in one minute. An accident along the route involving, say, an on board fire could be catastrophic.Senator Schacht also reassured us that the ship in question would not be going through our territorial waters but would stay in international waters. But the question that makes this issue very important is: who will be liable for costs of rescue in the eventuality of an accident or misadventure? The reason for the urgency of debate of this matter is the fact that the ships route is currently being decided—whether it is to go via Cape Horn or across the Indian Ocean and through the Tasman Sea. This latter route would bring the ship, if not into our territorial waters, clearly within the vicinity. In the same way we could be held responsible for rescuing people in misadventure, we could be liable for the operations that might be involved in the case of an accident.It is very important that this parliament understand that this issue is going on and make a statement about it. It would have been highly desirable to get a formal motion from the Senate but, in the absence of that, it is imperative to raise the issue. While we are grateful for the five minutes that we are each being allowed to debate this matter, this issue is clearly much more important than that time allows. It is urgent because, even though the current wastes do not arise from the reprocessing of Australian uranium, a future shipment well could. It is really important that we realise that by supporting the Japanese nuclear program, which includes the reprocessing of spent fuel and creation of extremely hazardous plutonium waste, Australia is complicit in this waste shipment and in the others which may follow. We believe that there will be an alternation of wastes with actual plutonium being sent.Could we oppose the shipment? That would be very difficult. The consent which Australia gave Japan in 1982 to use our uranium was advanced generic consent—that is, it was blanket consent, not case by case. It is unclear how Australia could rescind that consent, especially since the details of how this could be done are contained in so-called administrative arrangements which are secret. The government claims to have regular consultations with the Japanese government concerning the bilateral agreement, but the details of these consultations are available again to only a select few. It is very important that these be raised.Even if it were legally possible to rescind Australias consent to these shipments, or any other aspect of the Japanese nuclear program, commercial reality would be likely to stand in the way. Japan is Australias biggest export market for uranium. If we were to oppose the Japanese nuclear program now, the Japanese would probably go elsewhere for supplies—especially given the glut of cheap uranium on world markets. With the Australian uranium industry already operating at well below capacity, such a loss would probably be fatal. So do not hold your breath: once again, the profits of uranium companies will receive higher priority than Australias environment and the health of its people.Senator Hill implied that that was not relevant, but it clearly is. Ironically, the government claims that by selling uranium we are having a positive influence on the international nuclear industry. But this episode clearly reveals that the opposite is true. Uranium sales compromise our ability to speak freely on nuclear matters as our stance on a given issue must take commercial considerations into account. Thus, despite the clear threat that this shipment of plutonium waste could pose to the Australian environment and population, the federal government still stands shamefully mute. It is urgent that a full debate on this issue take place. It is regrettable that at this point a mere superficial garnering of the arguments is able to be presented to show to the Senate that it is a matter of great urgency. It would have been good to continue with the motion that my colleague Senator Margetts presented.Question put:That the motion ( Senator Margettss ) be agreed to.","N/A","PLUTONIUM SHIPMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/sso/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The government opposes this motion on the grounds that it will serve no useful purpose in terms of service delivery to the Austudy clients and will only divert resources away from the program areas servicing these clients.We note that Senator Tierney had the opportunity to raise, and raised, many of these issues in a dialogue with the department and with me, as the minister representing DEET, at the recent Senate additional estimates hearing on 16 February 1995. The issues raised by Senator Tierney are matters that the department has in hand and, as he is aware, has made and continues to make substantial progress on. There is no benefit to be gained from referring these questions to a committee. At the same time it needs to be acknowledged that Austudy joins a long list of programs referred to committees. These include: early childhood matters, prisons, truancy in schools, education accountability, the joint public accounts inquiry into tied grants and the review of the Australian National Training Authority, to name but a few.Question resolved in the affirmative.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/debate.sub1[1]/debate.sub2/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

176,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MICHAEL BAUME","LE4","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A",1400,"—by leave—I move:That the Senate take note of the document.There is very little new in this report. It deals with all the audit reports over the 1993-94 financial year. However, I take this opportunity in passing to commend the Auditor-General and his office for their continuing and determined examination of financial results of Australian governmental agencies, federal governmental agencies. I also commend them for their attempts, when denied access by at least one minister, to have appropriate examination of those agencies. This matter is now before the Senate in a bill, which the opposition is seeking to amend, to improve the capacity of the Auditor-General to examine matters which he should properly be examining and where the present law is clearly inadequate in the sense that it does not provide him with opportunities to examine some bodies of the Commonwealth government which are obviously politically sensitive.This report by the Auditor-General reveals that 467 audit reports were issued and only about 39 per cent were qualified. The main reasons for issuing the qualified audit reports were significant inadequacies in systems and controls relating mainly to problems in accounting for and control over assets and the maintenance of adequate financial records, uncertainty resulting from moves to privatise certain entities and breaches of Commonwealth law by departments. For example, the Audit Act requires any instances, with minor exceptions, of non-compliance with the constitution or any law of the Commonwealth to be reported in the audit report. These related mainly to breaches of the Audit Act in respect of the certification of payments and systems supporting the functions.The report indicates that, while the number of qualified audit reports issued represented an increase from 1992-93—up from 30 to 39, an increase of almost one-third—the analysis the Auditor-General has done indicates that this increase does not in itself project unfavourably on the standard of financial administration by Commonwealth entities. The Auditor-General says that overall the results of the 1993-94 financial statement audits identified a general improvement in the standard of financial management of Commonwealth entities, with audits disclosing that the majority of entities have in place effective control structures which can be relied on to produce accurate and reliable financial statements. As the Auditor-General points out, this was at a time when entities were faced with the need to table their annual reports by October 1994.For departments and authorities this represented an advance of two months from the previous deadline of 31 December. This chamber is often full of comments about how inadequate various departmental measures are. I commend the departments and agencies that have responded so well to this shortened deadline. The fact that this has been done and that there is better and quicker reporting is largely the result of the pressure this chamber has brought upon the governmental agencies and the government. To that extent it is quite proper that this chamber maintain that pressure, particularly as evident through the Senate estimates committee process.One of the things that disturbs me is that that process has at present been disrupted by the failure of some ministers offices to convey to the Senate estimates committees answers to questions which have been on notice since last November and which the agencies themselves assert have been provided to the ministers office, in some instances as long ago as January, but which have still not come to the relevant Senate estimates committees. To an extent some of these are small questions which are not of major moment in determining the estimates. In other cases, they are very important and appear to indicate an extraordinary reluctance on the part of ministers to face up to their responsibilities.That underlines the important role this chamber, the Senate, fills in making certain that Commonwealth expenditures are properly accounted for. To this extent it is worth noting that the Auditor-General has reported in this report that the audits did, nevertheless, identify deficiencies in the control structure of a number of entities. He has provided a table of details of the more important matters raised with the department and other entities where improvements should be made in their control structure. I do not want to go through all of them; I will just mention a few. For example, it was stated in regard to Film Australia:While improvements were evident, the companys systems and controls were found to be deficient in a number of key areas.In regard to the Commonwealth superannuation administration:Significant deficiencies existed in systems and procedures for the collection, recording and monitoring of contributions to the Commonwealth superannuation scheme and the public sector superannuation scheme.It was stated in regard to the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service:Although a number of elements of the control structures were considered to be strong, deficiencies in controls of the IT environment and systems meant the overall control structure could not be relied upon to support reliable accounting systems and effective internal controls.In regard to the Department of Social Security the Auditor-General mentioned that `continuing shortcomings exist in the recording, reporting and stocktaking of assets, the management of debts and the execution of certain internal controls and checks.The Auditor-General also makes a key finding that the Department of Defence did not maintain reliable records of the valuation of administrative assets at military establishments, computer software, intangible assets and accumulated depreciation on combat-related hardware during 1993-94. In addition, combat-related hardware, shown in the financial statements at $3.2 billion, was unable to be confirmed due to deficiencies in the valuation of that portion of the item valued manually and because the automated valuation method that applied to the balance of the item was not supplied for audit assessment.I do not know the significance of that, apart from the fact that it clearly relates to a very large amount of money. I do not know to what extent you can put a proper value on these assets, particularly combat-related hardware. It does seem that there is a need for this matter to be resolved, and I would hope that the Department of Defence will enthusiastically pursue that matter. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.Leave granted; debate adjourned.","N/A","DOCUMENTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/debate.sub1/debate.sub2/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Some examples of those are:1.Provisions amending qualification conditions for the sole parent pension which could have the effect of compelling spouses to return to violent domestic situations in order to avoid loss of payment. Civil liberties issues also arise in relation to what may be seen as excessive intrusion into the lives of claimants and their associates when claims are investigated whether in the context of violent spouses or generally.2.Empowerment of the Secretary of the Department of Social Security to require a person to attend a particular place for a particular purpose as a condition of payment of jobsearch and newstart allowances opens up the prospect for vexatious and unreasonable exercises of discretion. Whilst it may be reasonable to compel a recently arrived migrant to attend certain nominated English classes, it may not be reasonable to require a resident of Melbourne to attend a training course in Sydney. There do not appear to be any inbuilt safeguards which would guard against the exercise of this discretion in a way that may be oppressive for clients.3.There is generalised concern regarding the expansion of non-reviewable decisions provided for by this legislation. This arises in the context of both decisions by the Minister not to approve applications for exemption from deeming provisions and also decisions by the Employment Secretary not to approve participation by a person in a specified vocational training course or labour market program. The Parliament should exercise reticence in considering any widening of the range of non-reviewable decisions affecting clients under legislation as complex as the Social Security Act 1991.4.This legislation seeks to empower the Secretary of the Department of Social Security to collect information from not only clients but also third parties when assessing entitlement to Seniors Health Cards. The term third parties is not defined and no provision is made for the card applicant to be advised of the information obtained from third parties. Issues of privacy and confidentiality need to be addressed.5.Provisions in this legislation also seek to empower the Secretary of the Department of Social Security to delegate the power to determine whether disclosure of information regarding clients should, in the public interest, be disclosed to other Commonwealth Departments or Authorities. Furthermore, such information could be disclosed not only to the Secretary or Head of that other Department or Authority but also to the staff of those outside organisations. These provisions warrant close scrutiny in order to address the issues of privacy and confidentiality which inevitably arise. It is essential that the integrity of client information held by Departments such as that of Social Security be upheld rather than weakened.6.The potential for maladministration within the Department in relation to debt recovery and the assessment of overpayments arises as a result of provisions which in effect dispense with the need for a Departmental determination as to whether a client is `payable or not. Under this legislation once a client ceases to be `qualified according to the statutory criteria, they would also cease to be payable thus giving rise to overpayments. This is at odds with both common sense a series of AAT decisions which affirm the principle that the client remains `payable until the Department makes a positive determination to the contrary. As a result clients confidence in the system may well be undermined, quite apart from the laxity in administration that may be fostered within the Department.Possible Witnesses:Representatives of organisations such as the Welfare Rights Centre; Council on the Ageing; the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission; DEET, the Australian Federal Police and other organisations likely to have reason to seek disclosure of information from the Department of Social Security regarding social security clients.Committee to which Bill is to be referred:Senate Community Affairs Committee.Possible hearing date(s):Referral to the Committee is sought prior to the second reading speech stage in the Senate. A hearing organised as soon as practicable thereafter is desirable.Possible reporting date:As most clauses within this legislation are either backdated or have commencement dates of Royal Assent, a reporting date as soon as practicable is desirable.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/debate.sub1/debate.sub2/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

184,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator REID","VI4","(Australian Capital Territory)","LP","N/A",1404,"—I move:That the Senate take note of the report.I know there are a number of other senators who wish to comment upon the report, so I shall keep my remarks to just some of the matters in which I took a particular interest. I did not go to either Christmas Island or Cocos Island, and other senators are more familiar with those areas.Coming to the last point first, I refer to recommendation 26, which states:The Committee recommends that the requirement for Export Clearance Numbers for supplies sent from mainland Australia to the external Territories be abolished, without any change to their Australian duty-free status.I would recommend to the Commonwealth that that matter be expedited and dealt with. The committee does deal with these external territories and, in particular, of course, that matter which is most important to them because of their isolation—transport. The report is timely because of the fact that the Norfolk Island shipping, as it is presently organised, will shut down at the end of this year, and there seems to be considerable uncertainty in the Western Australian area of shipping to Cocos Island and Christmas Island as well.After looking at a number of options in relation to Norfolk Island, the committee came to the view that the Commonwealth should provide a capital ships grant for the purchase of a vessel to service that island, even though the vessel may not be precisely the size that is required to qualify for such a grant at the present time. It was the view of the committee that some modifications should be made to enable the grant to be applicable to a ship suitable for this service and that that would meet the needs of the islands.I think all of us recognise that it might be nice to have a large harbour, a marina and all of these things at Norfolk Island but, in view of the size of the population, it would be somewhat difficult to come to this place and suggest that expenditure of that nature be embarked upon by the Commonwealth. Even if that was attractive to the Norfolk Island government and the people of Norfolk Island, one would doubt the ability of a population the size of the island to service the debt involved in that sort of infrastructure itself. We were presented with a proposition which I think most of us felt reasonably met the needs and would enable the transport of goods to continue to Norfolk Island, as it must do.It is difficult to fully service an island of that size the way one might like to with such a small population. I believe that the integrity of the island, its government and the lifestyle that most people there seem to want should be maintained and that any intervention of the Commonwealth should leave the island pretty much as it is at the present time. I would not see an interventionist role for the Commonwealth government. We have recommended an inquiry on background and funding with some reluctance on my part. I feel that there is a risk that, in doing that, it might be seen as being interventionist in the islands affairs. I would not want that to end up by changing significantly the way the island functions, the way it does business and the way it lives at the present time because it is my belief that most of the people there want it to be the way that it is.We looked to an extent at the air services to the island and, although there are some difficulties with Norfolk, there are no specific recommendations for action by the Commonwealth that the committee has recommended. It is a bit of a chicken and egg situation—the number of aircraft determine the number of tourists who can visit an island. Then again, if you want to preserve the integrity of the island without having too many people there, you are not going to get the light aircraft in. I think we recognised the difficulties that they are faced with.We also had the experience of watching the unloading of ships at the present time. It looked pretty hairy to me, but it was not a particularly rough day. I gather on other occasions it might be far more exciting than it was the day that we were there. At present, from fairly old boats servicing the island, the union purchase method of unloading is used of shifting goods into these flat-bottomed whale boats, bringing them into shore and then taking it off again. It basically is fairly dangerous. We also heard of the controversy as to whether container ships would be desirable. We heard evidence for and against the use of containers for the island. I think, on balance, I would take the view that a more secure means of transporting goods there would be more desirable in the end.I think in view of the time that is available for discussing this matter this afternoon, it is perhaps not a matter that I should continue with at any greater length. I think the committee would feel as I do that we were indebted to those who have serviced the committee: Joanne Towner earlier on and then Meg Crooks; Susan Johnston, as the inquiries secretary; Di Singleton; and Robyn Barter, who were respectively the past and present administrative officers to the committee.I hope the government will look at our recommendations promptly because, at least as far as Norfolk Island is concerned, I do believe it is necessary to get on with making a decision so that there is no risk of there being any delay in the supply of goods later in the year when the present shipping arrangements will change. It is a difficult matter, but the island must have a service of some kind. I believe what we have recommended enables it to have such a service. There was one dissenting report from Senator Coates that he will speak to. I disagree with the approach he takes to the matters he has raised. I need not say any more about that because he will speak for himself. I commend the report to the Senate and the government.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1[3]/debate.sub2/speech[1]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
185,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COLSTON","PF4","(Queensland)","ALP","N/A",1405,"—I am pleased to be associated with the report of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories. The committee has reported extensively on the reference which it was given in relation to freight difficulties experienced by Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Island and Norfolk Island. The terms of reference are reproduced in the report. To fulfil its duties responsibly, the committee travelled to the three territories to become familiar with them and to hold public hearings. In this respect, the committee visited Christmas Island once, Cocos (Keeling) Island twice and Norfolk Island twice. Public hearings were also conducted in Brisbane, Canberra and Perth.The committee has made 26 recommendations in relation to its terms of reference. Before canvassing any of these recommendations, I intend to mention some matters about the three territories and their inhabitants. Because of their isolation, it would be possible to neglect the needs of these territories. Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Island are directly represented in the federal parliament by senators for the Northern Territory and by the House of Representatives member for the Northern Territory. Even so, because few members of the national parliament visit the territories, it would be easy for the majority of members of the parliament to be unaware of the needs of these two islands.The same may also be said for Norfolk Island. However, that island has no direct representative link with the federal parliament. It has its own legislature, but its only link to the federal government of the day is via the administrator of Norfolk Island or through the minister for territories or his or her parliamentary secretary. Some of the Norfolk Island residents are enrolled in the electorate of Canberra, but others who can establish a link with another mainland electorate are entitled to be enrolled there. There is no person in the federal parliament who has a direct representative duty to highlight the needs of the Norfolk Islanders and their island government. This lack of direct representation may have to be addressed in the future.Beyond these factors, however, which could lead to a case of out of sight out of mind, it should be remembered that all three islands—Christmas, Cocos (Keeling) and Norfolk—are Australian territories and are predominantly peopled by Australian citizens. These citizens deserve similar services to those available to their fellow citizens on the Australian mainland. In many respects, this is not the case. If the federal government wishes to fulfil its responsibilities to all Australians, irrespective of where they live, it must be prepared to provide resources for all the territories.As the title of the report, which has been presented to the Senate today, suggests, it deals principally with problems of freight to and from these island territories. As with many other services, the problems which exist with freight would simply not be endured by mainland communities. None has a river system or a harbour which allows safe loading and unloading of goods transported by sea. Some mainland communities can rely on road transport for the delivery of bulky goods. No such system exists for the three island communities. Apart from the bulk phosphate loading on Christmas Island, goods are loaded and unloaded in conditions which are unsafe for workers and precarious for the goods being transported.The report entitled Delivering the goods outlines some options for improving the passage of goods and having goods arrive at these territories at a reasonable cost. I do not intend to canvass these recommendations as they are outlined fully in the report, except to make a plea to the government not to place the recommendations in the too hard basket.Port facilities on Norfolk Island have been a concern raised with the federal government since about the time of Federation. It has never been a responsible attitude to put off making improvements to the islands port facilities. It would be irresponsible to do so now. Norfolk Islanders deserve a regular shipping service and adequate port facilities. The current port at Cascade is a dangerous place to work because of an overhanging and dangerously unstable cliff. Those who are working at Cascade are playing a Norfolk Island game of Russian roulette. It is only a matter of time before someone loses their life because of falling boulders from the cliff. The Norfolk Island stevedores and those who collect and transport goods which have been unloaded deserve far better working conditions.The report also addresses the issue of air transport to the three territories. Each territory is serviced by Ansett. Christmas Island also receives services from Sampati Air, which operates out of Indonesia, and Norfolk Island has regular Air New Zealand flights from Auckland as well as some less regular flights from some other islands. These air links are vital to the economic well being of each of the islands. The committee has not seen it necessary to make a formal recommendation in relation to air services.A matter of some concern to the committee and which is featured in the report was a proposed cost increase in the postage rate for mail deliveries from the Australian mainland to Norfolk Island. The island has its own postal service. During the course of the inquiry, I gained the impression that Australia Post resented having to cooperate with the territory postal service, although there was no direct evidence to support my suspicion.Whatever is the case, the residents of Norfolk Island, who I again stress are predominantly Australian citizens, deserve similar postal services and at similar affordable rates as other like communities on the mainland receive. While Norfolk Island conducts its own postal service, it may set its postal rates as it sees fit. The citizens of Norfolk Island have the opportunity at the elections for their assembly to voice their disapproval if the rates are set too high.The rates charged by Australia Post for parcel post impact on all Norfolk Island residents because the postal charges are added to the cost of goods purchased on the mainland. While the Norfolk Island government claims that it does not want to be subsidised by Australia Post, it does deserve reasonable rates and it should expect efforts to be made by Australia Post to negotiate more favourable rates for the carriage of mail to Norfolk Island. It is a fact that subsidised rates are not unknown for Australia Post parcel post rates on the Australian mainland and if reasonable rates, subsidised or otherwise, are not set for the carriage of parcels to Norfolk Island more goods could be purchased in New Zealand and sent to Norfolk Island at New Zealand postal rates. Businesses on the Australian mainland would be adversely affected if that occurred.Of the 26 recommendations in the report, I support all but one—recommendation 15 for which I have only lukewarm support. This recommendation suggests that an investigation be made about the prospects of establishing a coconut oil producing industry on Cocos (Keeling) Island to provide fuel for the islands use. While the proposal has superficial merit, I am yet to be convinced that the energy needed to extract the oil would be less than the energy which would be produced by the end product. Despite my less than enthusiastic support for that recommendation, however, I urge the government to examine all the recommendations carefully and where funds are necessary for their implementation, at least some of those funds be provided in the 1995 federal budget.Finally, I will express some words of thanks. Firstly, I mention the chairman of the committee, Mr Bob Chynoweth MP, for the sterling way in which he conducted this wide ranging and important inquiry. I also thank the deputy chair, Senator Reid, for her detailed interest and assistance to Mr Chynoweth.Of course, committee reports like this are not produced without the assistance of a dedicated staff. Those members of the staff should be justly proud of the publication which has resulted. The former secretary of the committee, Joanne Towner, heeded a call to move to a different committee before the inquiry concluded. Meg Crooks took over from Joanne. It is difficult to understand how such a first class report has resulted when Meg did not have the benefit of a visit to the three territories.Susan Johnston was with the committee for the whole of the inquiry and for a short time was acting secretary. Her detailed knowledge of the issues and evidence was readily apparent when the committee was considering its report. Until Di Singleton left to take up other duties she dealt efficiently with those many administrative tasks which surround inquiries like this. She was ably followed by Robyn Barter who joined the committee in August 1994. I must also mention Margaret Gibson who gave the committee invaluable assistance when public hearings were held on Norfolk Island. This was an interesting and at times demanding inquiry and I have been pleased to have been part of it. Not only do I commend the report to the Senate but I commend it to the government as well.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1[3]/debate.sub2/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
186,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator IAN MACDONALD","YW4","(Queensland)","LP","N/A",1408,"—I commend the report of the Joint Committee on the National Capital and External Territories to the Senate and the recommendations to the government. I would like to congratulate the chair of the committee, Mr Bob Chynoweth, on the sterling job that he did. I would also like to congratulate my colleague Senator Margaret Reid, the deputy chairman, particularly in relation to her work on Norfolk Island.I join other senators in very sincerely thanking the former committee secretary, Mrs Joanne Towner, for the sterling work she did. I also thank Susan Johnston who, as Senator Colston said, has been with the committee right through and Di Singleton who did tremendous work for the committee. I also thank Meg Crooks and Robyn Barter who came into the inquiry part way through. The staff have certainly made a major contribution to the writing and tabling of this report and really do deserve our thanks. Some of them looked after us in very difficult circumstances. They even shepherded us into a building when a cyclone was about to hit during our second visit to Cocos Island.We should also thank all of those people who gave evidence before the committee. The committee travelled to each island twice. We almost became personal friends with a number of people on the various islands. We were aware that many of those people gave up quite a bit to give evidence. Some of them were even courageous in giving evidence in a small community. Their views may not always have been shared by other members of those quite small communities. As I said, on the second occasion that we were on Cocos Island people from Christmas Island who came over to give evidence were, like the committee, caught by the cyclone. It was very inconvenient for them as they could not get off the island. We should acknowledge their role in giving evidence.There is no doubt that there are real problems with freight on all three islands as they all have very difficult access. This is mainly due to the sheer nature of the coastline on both Norfolk Island and Christmas Island and the difficulties with reefs and moving sands and environmental problems on Cocos Island. The wave action on Christmas Island, which unfortunately I did not see but which we saw photos of, is really quite amazing. One wonders how they get any freight in there at all for many parts of the year. In fact, several weeks—even months—go by at a time when it is impossible to get any sea freight in.There are obviously very real problems. There are only small populations on each of the islands. In each case, there are only very small economic bases, but the solutions are big money items. There has to be some solutions. The type of freight access to those islands cannot continue as it is. But solutions could be very expensive. It is something that the government will obviously have to think about before any money is spent on those solutions.I want to indicate at this time that Senator Tambling, who is the coalitions shadow minister for the external territories, did want to make a contribution to this debate on the report but time will not allow him to speak. I do indicate that he will speak later as there are some comments he wishes to make.Some of the recommendations of the committee deserve some attention by the Senate. I refer to the decision by the committee in the case of each island—Cocos, Christmas and Norfolk—to conduct inquiries by the ABS on the cost of living for those islands vis-a-vis the rest of Australia. A lot of submissions put to us suggested that the cost of living is very high. But some suggestions were made that there were countervailing conditions that perhaps overcame some of that apparent very high cost of living on those islands. It is important that, before decisions are made, we get some idea of just what the cost of living in those communities is in comparison with other parts of Australia, particularly remote mainland Australia.There have been recommendations to look at new shipping services to Christmas and Cocos islands and perhaps even Norfolk Island. A lot of evidence was given on the part that cabotage played in connection with the cost of getting goods into and out of those islands. The committee with the wisdom of Solomon decided eventually to recommend that, when tenders were called, they be called on two bases—the first where the status quo remained and whereby Christmas and Cocos islands were considered to be part of the coasting trade of Australia and the second where they be granted exemption from cabotage provisions. The tenderers themselves could in the best way possible indicate to us which they preferred. I think that was a good way to do it.There were recommendations that there be consultations with the Christmas Island workers in relation to the upgrade of the main mooring system. That is quite obvious. There were some important recommendations regarding some environmental problems on Christmas Island due to the storing of drums. There was a recommendation to get rid of those by having bulk storage on Christmas Island in the future. The suggestion of tenders being called for the operation of stevedoring and freight handling on Christmas Island with port facilities being leased by the Commonwealth was a good one and deserves government consideration.I refer to Cocos Island. The recommendation that the Cocos Island Cooperative Society be reconstituted under Australian law is an important one. There is a real problem there, in that there is a conflict of interest. Most of the board members of the cooperative society are also councillors on Cocos Islands shire council. There are laws in the Western Australian Local Government Act, under which that island now operates, which do have very severe penalties for conflicts of interest. I really think that has to be looked at.My colleague Senator Colston mentioned recommendation 15 which refers to coconut oil extraction. Whilst I agree that we should not spend a great deal of money on that, I do think it is worth looking at a little further. Obviously, Cocos Island has a helluva lot of coconut trees on it. It is by far the major feature of Cocos Island. If something could be done, it would be of interest.There is a question about quarantine on both Cocos and Christmas islands. The committee makes recommendations about that. It must be very seriously looked at. The committee rejected almost out of hand the proposal for the inter-island ring road, and I think that is very sensible. It would be foolish to spend any more money on that.I share Senator Reids reservations about inquiries into Norfolk Island. It is fair to say that Norfolk Islanders are split on whether they should have closer ties with Australia or whether the existing ties should be removed a bit and made even a little bit more remote. But I would be very cautious about any involvement of the government of Australia which brings Norfolk Islanders into a situation vis-a-vis Australia which they really do not want to be involved in. I share the reservations outlined very clearly and concisely by Senator Reid in her contribution.Finally, I draw the attention of the government to recommendation 26, which recommends the abolition of the requirement for export clearance numbers. It seems from the evidence that that was a bit of bureaucratic nonsense which really achieved nothing. It made it much more expensive to get goods to and from those islands. I conclude with a commendation of this particular report and the recommendations.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1[3]/debate.sub2/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
187,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COATES","LF4","(Tasmania)","ALP","N/A",1409,"—I support most of the report and was happy to do that. I draw attention to the fact that I put a one-page dissent in the report which mentions some disagreements I have. My comments in the report read:I express general dissent from the flavour of all those comments . . . which claim that the provision of shipping and associated services would be better provided by private enterprise and that it would be inappropriate for the Government to be directly involved in such services.In respect of all the external territories, it is accepted that their small size and their remoteness make real competition or multiple services highly unlikely. I believe that it is therefore entirely appropriate for the Government to be responsible for and to provide such essential services.I then go on to mention some specific clauses which emphasise the differences I have with the precise recommendations and conclusions in the report. For instance, I point out that if there is to be a monopoly, it should be a public monopoly. Also, given that Senator Colston mentioned the Australia Post matter, in respect of the second part of that recommendation, I say that Australia Post should be supported in placing Norfolk Island in a category of its own with rates similar to interstate rates of comparable distance. I think there is a reasonable compromise that can be reached on the question of postal services to Norfolk Island.I have not got time to go into any more detail on the recommendations of the report. I should say that I disagree with some of the personal remarks made by the committee chair earlier today in the House of Representatives, particularly the remarks relating to Norfolk Island.I found the inquiry an enjoyable one. I found the discovering of these three quite different island communities a fascinating experience. It was a privilege to visit each of these islands and to get to know in a small way their particular problems and the way in which they survive in their quite different circumstances. It is fascinating to make the comparisons between the Cocos, Christmas and Norfolk islands.In conclusion, I would like to mention the committee staff, who I think have been mentioned by each of the other senators. In particular, the committee has a great debt to Susan Johnston, who had the main carriage of looking after this inquiry. She did an excellent job in that role. Apart from the reservations that I have expressed in my dissent, I draw the report to the attention of the Senate and of the government, and I hope that it gets some early attention by the government. It is important that the matters not be left for some years. I think urgent attention to some of these recommendations is needed, and they should be given that.Debate (on motion by Senator Panizza ) adjourned.(Quorum formed)","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1[3]/debate.sub2/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

190,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator VANSTONE","7E4","(South Australia)","LP","N/A",1410,"—I will not take up much time of the committee on this matter. The coalition wanted a number of matters to be addressed by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. Those matters have been addressed reasonably well, with the exception of one. The one that has not been dealt with reasonably well—the amendments to the Acts Interpretation Act—is going to be removed from this bill by the government. The removal of this is an example of a couple of things. It is an example of the proper review process taking place resulting in some sort of change. That is not to say that, in the end, these amendments will not come back and we will not agree with them. However, but for the review process and but for sending this off to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, this bill would be proceeding with the changes to the Acts Interpretation Act in it now.You might ask why it should not proceed with those changes in it now. What has happened between the time this bill was last before this chamber and now that makes the government change its mind? To my knowledge, there is nothing—I would be happy to hear if there is—which suggests that the government knows now what it did not know then. In other words, the government was just trying it on and, having got caught out, it has decided to withdraw the amendments it wanted to make.The parliament has had some difficulty in passing legislation that has, in the end, passed the constitutional hoops that legislation is required to go through when put before the scrutiny of the High Court. This has happened in a number of cases—far too many, I would say—in the last 12 to 18 months. By and large, bills produced by this government have ended up being struck down for invalidity.One problem that the government struck—in the Lim case in particular, but perhaps in the Herald and Weekly Times case as well—is the main reading of a clause being so wide as to be outside Commonwealth power. The suggestion is that there should be some sort of codification of the tests of severability that the High Court might go through and that the amendments the government was planning on were a proper codification of that. That is a fair way of putting what was put to us at the Senate committee.It was also put to us—I do not think I am disparaging any committee member improperly by saying that I am not sure we realised it at the time—that a similar clause is now before the High Court in a matter where the judgment will come up by the end of April. We will then know whether the government can get away with doing what it wants to do in amending the Acts Interpretation Act. I am not sure that we all realised it at the time because there was a discussion whereby questions were being asked and answers were being given.Mr Orr from the department commented on the Herald and Weekly Times case and the industrial relations legislation. He said, `Similar clauses in the Industrial Relations Act are coming up quite soon. It was easy to see how one could roll together both references to the Industrial Relations Act. That is probably what happened. The penny dropped a little later.The government has a case coming up in the High Court to be resolved by the end of April and, notwithstanding the fact that similar clauses are in doubt, has thought it might run a bit through the parliament again. I would be very pleased to hear that the rendition I am giving is not correct; it would be the best news I have heard in a long time. It sounds like the government, knowing that some of its legislation is at risk, is prepared to have another crack at it in a much broader sense. Instead of putting a clause of similar effect in one act, it is trying to create a similar effect through the Acts Interpretation Act, which will therefore affect all other legislation.Why would a government do that? The only reason I can think that the government has withdrawn it is that it is suffering some embarrassment over the Brandy decision. It is just another run of things that the government has been advised is constitutionally okay but which has ended up not being okay. But for good and proper reasons being put together in relation to cabinet advice, I am at a loss to see why any cabinet should rely on the advice as to the constitutionality of a bill that is provided by the Attorney-Generals Department.I do not say that because every time we have to be right. One thing about the constitution is that it is not possible to be right every time. That is why we have the High Court, the number of judges that we have and why lawyers and law students spend hours pouring over one judgment as opposed to another. It is very difficult to produce some pieces of legislation and say with absolute certainty that they will be judged to be constitutional. However, quite frankly, the track record of this government is appalling.I understand that when A-Gs in a sense goes commercial and other departments are allowed to seek out advice from private solicitors, which is a good thing—there might be some teething problems at the beginning while other departments learn to negotiate price, for example, with private firms in a way that they have not needed to until now—they will be restricted in where they go for their constitutional advice. The monopoly will be with A-Gs. On its record, one wonders why. It is worth making that point.We support the amendments. We think they should be withdrawn until the position is clarified by the judgment that is coming up. The two points I wanted to make is that the government is simply trying this on. It knew the doubt that exists over this, yet it was going to run another piece of legislation through without telling anybody about the doubt about it.If we had proceeded without referring this matter to a committee, it would probably have argued with great force the constitutionality of the changes it wants to make. It may end up being right, but the government knows that a minister in here would not have mentioned the pending case in the High Court. It is only by the review process, whereby our bills are referred to committees, that that ever saw the light of day in this chamber. This is another example of it being a good thing. They are basically the two points I want to make. I will not waste anybody elses time by saying any more.","N/A","LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1994 [1995]","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The fact that this bill was referred by the Australian Democrats to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has meant that these issues have been raised.I came in here at the time Senator Vanstone was asking why these issues are now being faced up to by the government and why the government has made this decision to withdraw the proposed amendments to the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. I suggest to Senator Vanstone that the government read the numbers after that committee hearing and realised that it was not going to get those proposals through the Senate. So, rather than face a Senate-led revolt on yet another piece of legislation and have either the opposition or the Australian Democrats move them for it, it decided to go ahead with its amendments instead.","N/A","LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1994 [1995]","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The amendment to the Acts Interpretation Act was to insert a new reading-down provision—proposed section 15AAA—into the Acts Interpretation Act.Some concerns about this amendment were raised at the Senate committee hearing on 10 February. Subsequently, on 14 February, argument was heard in the High Court inre Munro ex parte Wagner on the constitutional validity of a similar provision to the one proposed as section 15AAA—namely, section 17A of the Industrial Relations Act 1988. Judgment on the issues argued at the hearing is expected soon. In light of this, the government considers that the most prudent course of action is to await the views of the High Court on the validity of section 17A of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 before deciding whether to proceed to enact a similar provision of the general application of the Commonwealth statutes.Amendments agreed to.","N/A","LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1994 [1995]","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
193,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MARGETTS","DX5","(Western Australia)","GWA","N/A",1412,"—I move:Schedule 2, page 34, at end of Schedule, add the following amendment:Sex Discrimination Act 198450. Section 40:Add at the end:`(7)Nothing in Division 1 or 2, as applying by reference to section 6, affects anything done by a person, after the disallowance of regulation 16, in compliance with paragraph 67(b) of the Austudy Regulations as that paragraph was in force on 31 December 1994.`(8)In subsection (7), regulation 16 means regulation 16 of the Austudy Regulations (Amendment) contained in Statutory Rules 1994 No. 409 and disallowed by the Senate on 9 February 1995..The amendment that the Greens are moving to the Law and Justice Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1994 is the one circulated in my name. This is an omnibus bill to enable married students under the age of 22 to retain Austudy. Austudy regulation SR 1994 No. 409 repealed paragraph 67(b) of the main Austudy regulations. The intention was to terminate the independent living allowance for married students. A grandfather regulation protected married students already in receipt of an allowance.On 9 February 1995, the Senate disallowed the amendment. Paragraph 67(b) will therefore revive from that date, as if it had never been repealed, subsection 48(7) of the Acts Interpretations Act 1901. However, it is claimed by the government that it cannot pay the allowance because to do so would be unlawful under section 6 of part 2 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 relating to discrimination on the ground of marital status. The proposed amendment removes the risk of such illegality by providing that nothing in those provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act affects actions by a person to implement paragraph 67(b) of the Austudy regulations.The government has clearly been unjustified and unjust in its cynical moves to take Austudy off young married people. The government has tried hard to prevent the Greens, the Australian Democrats and the opposition from stopping its unfair changes from going ahead through a tangled regulatory framework for Austudy and the coincidental expiry of the exemption of married students from the Sex Discrimination Act. The Greens believe that an amendment to the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) will lead us out of this quagmire and deliver justice to young married students at the same time. Our simple amendment extends the exemption of Austudy regulation 67(b) from the Sex Discrimination Act.I recapitulate the main points of this issue. The government has decided to take Austudy off young married independent students under the age of 22 by saying that an exemption to the Sex Discrimination Act has expired so that it is illegal to act to grant Austudy to married students and not students in de facto relationships. However, the government is not prepared to give Austudy to students in de facto relationships under the age of 22, so it is taking the amoral stance of taking it off all young married students.Including the governments weak efforts, no-one can justify taking independence allowance off a married student and, by doing so, claim that they are not independent. Marriage in any society, including our own, is one of the first indications of independence. People should not be refused an allowance because they are independent and happen to be married. This is discrimination in itself.If the government believes people are getting married, which is a pretty big step, to receive Austudy, I have not seen it giving us any evidence of that. It should find another way of abolishing fraud than abolishing a whole category of Austudy and disadvantaging all those young students with genuine marriages.If students are getting married to get an allowance this surely would tell the government of their desperation to support themselves while they gain their higher qualifications. This is a sign that they are willing to deal with the poverty associated with studying which Austudy maintains. They would be financially better off on the dole. I will read examples of some of the difficulties faced by students who have contacted the Greens, pleading for us to do something to stop the government from taking Austudy off them. Many of the students who have contacted me questioned whether they can return to study this year without any kind of financial support. This student states:I am 21 and studying medicine and my husband is 23 and doing his masters of Engineering so he is already ineligible for Austudy. The new changes mean my only option is to quit Medicine for the year and go on the dole while looking for work.Another states:My only option is to get part time work while studying that pays more than $70 per week. I dont need to point out to you how far below the poverty line this puts me—this is a denial of the means to fulfil basic human needs such as food and shelter.Another states:It is offensive to me that the Government obviously doesnt consider my marriage to be legal and honourable. I can think of no sane person who would undertake the enormous commitment of marriage for the $120 per week that Austudy used to supply.Another states:In a few years time my income will be up to $100,000 per annum. However, this is conditional on support to continue my studies this year without malnutrition. It is extremely short-sighted and totally unjust that we are denied the right to continue our higher education. If Australia wants to become the clever country we had better start supporting our students and not starving them.This is one from the parents viewpoint. One parent states:My daughter, a university student, will turn 20 this year and will marry in July yet the Austudy changes mean she will be treated as if living off my wifes income until she reaches the age of 22. It seems incongruous to me that my daughter and her fiance are being penalised because they have decided to uphold their strong Christian values, with both families blessings, and they would be entitled to many more Government benefits, if they hadnt.These letters say it all. The government could have been fairer and prevented students from experiencing a lot of pain if they had simply extended the exemption for married students from the Sex Discrimination Act. This is not a lot of money. I understand that it affects only some 2,000 students, so the usual economic rationalist arguments have no place here. Again, we see a situation where the government has not done its job properly by neglecting students in this case and so the Greens, the opposition and the Democrats have to tidy up the mess that remains.","N/A","LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1994 [1995]","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/debate.sub1/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

197,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator HILL","BH4","(South Australia-","LP","Leader of the Opposition)",1414,"—by leave—I might just say something that could help the governments consideration overnight. I thought it might be helpful to say that, in the short time the opposition has had to consider the matter, it does seem to us to be a way to restore fairness and justice. We believe that married students should be treated as independent. We, in our recall of the Sex Discrimination Act debate, actually believed it was primarily aimed at avoiding married peoples being discriminated against for that fact. It seems to be somewhat twisted logic for the government now to be arguing the opposite.There is a background to this that deals with the grandfathering provision included in the governments regulation. Although the government was to act so that in the future this benefit would be removed from married students under the age of 22, it was intending to grandfather those who were currently receiving benefits. Since then, we certainly—perhaps the minor parties as well—have been having some dealings with the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) to facilitate a grandfathering clause being included. But that solves only half the problem because we say that not only should those who are currently receiving benefits have their position preserved but that it should also apply to those who have not been receiving that benefit but who marry and should therefore clearly, in the eyes of all sensible people, be treated as independent of their parents in terms of assets tests and income tests, notwithstanding that they might be less than 22 years of age.Therefore, we have urged the government to look at a method of restoring the original position. We have said that we see there are two ways open in which that could be done. The first is to seek an additional exemption under the Sex Discrimination Act and the other is to seek an amendment to the Sex Discrimination Act. The Greens have, without any communication with us, astutely picked up that option as being open under this legal omnibus bill and therefore are taking this opportunity to seek to amend the Sex Discrimination Act.Although that might be somewhat unusual in that, as the ministers representative said, the Sex Discrimination Act was not being amended by the governments bill, the advice that we have received to date is that that does not provide a procedural barrier and that it is within the competence of the chamber to introduce an amendment to a new bill under the umbrella of an omnibus bill that the government has brought to this place.The ministers representative will no doubt go away and take good advice overnight. As we understand it at the moment, it is within the province of this chamber to act in this way. If it is, then we think it is an amendment that would achieve the objectives that we have been seeking to achieve and that we sought to achieve by our original notice of disallowance. Therefore, we would be inclined to support the amendments before the chamber. I thought if I put that on the record at this stage it might help the government overnight.","N/A","LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1994 [1995]","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/debate.sub1/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The full title of this particular bill that we are looking at is `an Act to amend various acts relating to law and justice, and for related purposes. It deals with AAT matters, the Acts Interpretation Act, Federal Court arbitration, et cetera. It contains in proposed section 15AAA of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 the provision virtually to destroy the High Courts jurisdiction to rule on the constitutionality of legislation. The Sex Discrimination Act falls within the Attorney-Generals portfolio. Therefore, I would support the words of Senator Hill in this case, that it definitely falls within the ambit of this omnibus bill. Therefore, there is no real reason why amendments cannot be dealt with in this particular bill.","N/A","LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1994 [1995]","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/debate.sub1/speech[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
199,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BELL","7U4","(Tasmania)","AD","N/A",1415,"—by leave—Just to assist in the process, which Senator Hill described as a process of thinking overnight, as to what advice the government might seek, I think it may be appropriate to remind the government that Senator Margettss amendment would be seen to be appropriate because the government has failed to come up with an adequate definition of `independence with regard to receipt of Austudy. It is the independence rate which the government had previously attempted to define as being available under certain situations.One of those situations had been an age qualification. The qualification had been the age of 25 and it has been progressively reduced each year to the stage where it is now over 22. What is very important here is that the government should perhaps consider coming up with a more adequate definition of `independence than age. After all, age is really not adequate in any sense of the word in describing students actual situations and competencies.We have a number of other moments of life, rites of passage they may or may not be, after which people become, in effect, adults; and probably the most significant of those remaining is the acquisition of the right to vote, which is an age qualification, as is the capacity to enter into a contract or to acquire debt or, for that matter, to consent to sexual intercourse. There are many age based measures upon which legal decisions of our society are made, but there are also traditions, mores and values that are held.The concept of people who are married being still dependent on their parents is foreign in our society and is defied by commonsense and practice. It is because of that that such indignation is being expressed to the regulation which has been proposed by the government. I am trying to remind the governments advisers that it is that indignation that has driven a lot of what is seen here, not so much people who are concerned about the dollars and cents of the matter, although that is significant, but rather the denial of the very fact of what marriage represents—it is the step to establish an independent family unit; it is the leaving of the family nest; it is so much of what we have come to understand as being the basis of our society.To deny all those actualities or that reality is to come up with bureaucratic nonsense. So it is in seeking to remove that that I think Senator Margetts rightly brings this amendment before us, and that is why we would support it—it recognises real life much more adequately than the other proposals we have had. If the government were able to display initiative and imagination and come up with a proper definition of `independence, we would all be better off and we would be able to make sense of Austudy regulations and the Sex Discrimination Act. So I would hope that in the time the government has now it can see the sense of properly defining what an independent person is so that such a person can properly receive the independent rate of Austudy.Question resolved in the affirmative.","N/A","LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1994 [1995]","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/debate.sub1/speech[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

204,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator TIERNEY","O15","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A",1416,"—The Communications and the Arts Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 [1995] is an omnibus amendment bill which makes amendments to six acts in the Communications and the Arts portfolio. The most contentious of these are amendments removing ministerial approval requirements for contracts above $20 million taken out by the ABC and SBS. I would like to foreshadow at this point that the coalition will be moving an amendment to this aspect of the bill in the committee stage.The bill also implements a new apparatus licensing system, following a public inquiry by the Spectrum Management Agency. The bill introduces transferable apparatus licences for particular pieces of equipment which are currently not directly transferable. The bill also seeks to make two non-contentious changes to the operation of the Australian Film and Television School. Also included in the bill are a number of non-contentious amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. The local content provisions which currently apply only to satellite licences are extended to all subscription services. The bill clarifies the circumstances in which the ABA can deem that a drama program made wholly or substantially in Australia is non-Australian.The coalition supports these amendments that are outlined in the bill. However, we have a number of concerns about the proposed amendment which would remove the requirement of the ABC and SBS to obtain ministerial approval before entering into contracts or lease back arrangements worth more than $20 million. The bill is expected to have no financial impact coming from these changes.In the committee stage, the coalition will move an amendment to the bill requiring that the ABC and SBS notify the Minister for Communications and the Arts at least 14 days in advance of an intention to enter into such contracts. The government claims that the responsibility for these decisions should rest with the respective boards of the ABC and SBS. It has also claimed that these national broadcasters—given that they are statutory independent bodies—should be able to make decisions on their financial management without any government scrutiny. It is claimed that the minister will not have access to the detailed commercial information needed to make an informed decision about the appropriateness of these contracts or arrangements.The ABC has said that, under the current system, it seeks ministerial approval on 30 to 40 occasions each year. The ABC argues that this provision is out of date, as the prudential supervision is now set at the macro level by way of corporate plans. It claims that the minister is unlikely to veto a board decision, as he could be seen to be interfering with the ABC board. SBS has sought ministerial approval on contracts worth more than $20 million only once in the past year.In considering our position on this aspect of the bill, the coalition has weighed the arguments of the national broadcaster with other issues of national interest. Both ABC and SBS finances come from parliamentary appropriations, and ministerial scrutiny is, therefore, highly desirable. Friends of the ABC are opposed to the removal of ministerial approval provisions, saying that the ABC belongs to the taxpayer and not to the ABC board.The public concern about the management and operation of the ABC requires very careful consideration by this parliament. There must be a certain level of accountability and ministerial scrutiny. We have seen evidence of the need for this in past months in the Senate Select Committee on ABC Management and Operations, which is inquiring into the administration of the ABC under the chairmanship of David Hill. The public debate has centred on ABC decisions that have related to non-core activities. We have looked at a range of ABC enterprises—the BNA wire service, Australian Television International and movements into pay television—and we have heard evidence that the tendency to become involved in commercial ventures has significant risks attached to it.As taxpayers money is involved with the ABC, there is obviously a need for scrutiny of its charter and non-charter activities. This involves not only the normal ways that it spends its recurrent funding but also the ways that it spends its capital funding, because we found from the evidence on the record before the committee that it is actually constructing a building related to pay TV operations in the middle of facilities for the core activity operations. This raises a number of issues and is a good reason why I believe there is a need for the minister to have some sort of prudential supervision over, or knowledge of—and that is all that we are requiring in the amendments that we have foreshadowed—what the ABC is doing.The ABC and SBS should really let the minister know when they are moving in these directions. We do not think it is unreasonable to give the minister that sort of advice 14 days in advance. For this reason, my colleague Senator Alston has circulated amendments to subsection 71 of the ABC Act 1983 and subsection 67(1) of the SBS Act 1991.The coalition amendments require that both the ABC and SBS notify the minister of the need to enter contracts worth more than $20 million at least 14 days in advance and retain a proper level of accountability. This will ensure the balance that is necessary in the proper running of the ABC and SBS, which are both using public money. In principle, the opposition does not believe that we can move from a position of ministerial scrutiny—when the minister is reviewing quite a number of contracts every year—to a position when he does not review anything. The government has mentioned previously the need for this change, because it claims the minister cannot be expected to exercise that level of scrutiny or have the knowledge that is needed in these sorts of commercial arrangements. We believe that the amendment will force the minister to have proper overview.It is no accident that the present level of concern about the ABC and its management is really happening under the stewardship of Minister Lee. David Hill has now left the ABC. His last effort was the hosting of Lateline last week. Mr Hill did not give a vote of confidence in this minister. David Hill gave the minister a major parting shot, saying that the growing perception and reality is that ABC board appointments are as a result of political affiliation. This minister and the ABC are responsible for the boards loss of independence by undertaking this process. If there is a perception that the board is not completely independent, then there is a greater need to ensure that there is some scrutiny by this parliament—indeed some scrutiny by the minister.This minister needs to have scrutiny in a number of areas not only those relating to the ABC and its management and operations. We also have before us examples, such as the West Indies cricket fiasco and the media rules policy—and that at the moment is an absolute mess, with one eleventh hour remission on the West Indies test series tonight and with us not knowing what will happen in the future. Therefore, we need a minister who is a bit more hands-on with what is happening in the communications area, whether it be cross-media rules or the management and operations of the ABC and SBS.On these amendments to the ABC and SBS now before the Senate, the coalition seeks to have the minister keep his responsibilities over these two bodies where large sums of money, such as $20 million and over, are being expended. We are balancing ministerial responsibility and accountability with the level of independence of the ABC and SBS.","N/A","COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1994 [1995]","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This would represent an unprecedented level of intervention in the day-to-day operations of the ABC and SBS affairs.

She either did not understand or chose not to understand—and I suspect it was the latter. She spent some time talking about independence of the ABC and how, suddenly, this was going to remove the independence of the ABC. I find it quite amazing that Senator Crowley would say that, given that the current regime we have been operating under required the minister to look at all these changes in capital expenditure and, presumably, understand what they were all about and then make some sort of a decision. With the current regime we have had an independent ABC for quite a number of years. We have possibly, rightly, moved from that position now. But to claim that we are trying to bring in some draconian type of measure here is nonsense.I point out to the minister that the bottom line of both amendments contain the words `notify the minister. That is all it says. Senator Crowley totally misconstrued my comments relating to Minister Lee. This had nothing to do with the legislation. The legislation says must `notify the minister. The minister then presumably has to do something with that. My only concern about this minister at this time is that he does not do anything about any matter at all. If the ABC did notify the minister of these sorts of changes, I do not think Senator Crowley should have any fears at all because he does not do anything about anything. So he will not interfere with the ABCs capital works program or decisions because he does not interfere. He lets the ABC do what it likes, the SBS do what it likes, and sits on his hands and does not say anything. He lets Mr Keating say a lot of things, but he does not say anything at all. Senator Crowley should not have any fears that this change is going to create any problems in that way at all.What we thought, really, and why we are moving this amendment—and I would just hope that the minor parties would support this—is that we want to move from the position where there is considerable scrutiny of what happens in capital works projects. The government says, `This is no longer appropriate because we have looked at the corporate objectives of the organisation and the way in which it implements those at a more macro-economic level. Nowadays, with these corporations that are independent we tend not to get down into all the nitty-gritty detail. That is welcomed, and we accept that.But we think there still needs to be some sort of level of prudential scrutiny of what these independent boards do, particularly in line with what I said previously about our concerns with whether the boards are truly independent if a number of political appointees are on them. Therefore, I do not think it is unreasonable at all for us to suggest that, if the ABC is undertaking a major piece of capital works, it lets the minister know. That will be followed by a 14-day period, and then the ABC moves on. I re-emphasise for the minister: the amendment says `notify. All the ABC will have to do is notify. The ABC spends over half a billion dollars a year. I do not think it is unreasonable that when it is undertaking major capital works it notifies the minister of what it is doing.","N/A","COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1994 [1995]","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
219,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CROWLEY","ZF4","(South Australia-","ALP","Minister for Family Services)",1420,"—Firstly, I point out that I decided at the time not to stand up on a point of order when Senator Tierney ascribed intent and motive, which he knows is unparliamentary. That is usually done in the defence of people who have nothing to say. Secondly, Senator Tierney says that I misunderstand him about the minister. I do not. I can actually draw distinctions. Even if points are put by people like Senator Tierney in a confused argument, I can draw distinctions. Thirdly, Senator Tierney does not seem to understand what would happen if, as the words of his amendment say, the minister is to be notified 14 days before the ABC enters into a contract. It would be very hard to work out when that 14 days would be. We could never be absolutely sure when a contract is to be signed. But what is the minister to do once notified? Give it a tick? Say `whoopee-do or make some comment—positive or negative?If the minister is to do nothing, the amendment is unnecessary. If the minister is to do something, it clearly cuts across the independence of the board of either the ABC or the SBS. Make up your mind, Senator. Are you for independence, as you say, or are you for ministerial interference? If the minister is to be notified, what is he to do? Hang the notifications around the wall and smile? What do those opposite expect the minister would do if notified? While they may think it is funny to score points off the current minister—tedious is the best I can describe them as—they certainly do not explain what Senator Tierney and his party think the minister would have to do if notified.So, if the minister is to do nothing, there is no need for the amendment. If the amendment is to do something, it cuts across the independence. Neither of those arguments have been persuasively put one way or the other by Senator Tierney in his presentation. Certainly nothing he has said has persuaded me or the government to change our minds.","N/A","COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1994 [1995]","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
220,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator TIERNEY","O15","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A",1420,"—Of course, in relation to these various contracts we are asking the government to be notified of, it will vary depending on circumstances of particular contracts. As the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) said, the minister will have to do nothing or do something. In 98 per cent of the cases, I suspect the minister would do nothing because what the ABC or SBS has decided has been an appropriate decision that has been carried out in a proper way.With being part of the government, Senator Crowley would realise that from time to time governments receive nasty surprises from various organisations under their purview. If there were some misallocation of money, if money were spent in an improper way—we heard examples in parliament in question time today of how money and resources can easily go astray in public organisations—if things were not quite up to scratch, if the department were clearly doing the wrong thing, one would think that is a circumstance where a minister should intervene and that it would be to a ministers advantage.This amendment does not say the minister has any draconian powers. The ABC has to only advise him of what it is doing. Then presumably he, as the minister for communications with the ABC being part of his portfolio, would discuss things with the managing director. Possibly through the process of persuasion the board might reconsider the decision if the minister has a vital point to make.It is a pity that Senator Crowley has not heard any of my contribution so far because I have explained the situations when a minister may have to act, which we say would be very rarely. I will repeat what I said because Senator Crowley was not listening. Ninety-eight per cent of the time the minister probably would not have to do anything, which covers Senator Crowleys point about doing nothing.But two per cent of the time there might be some problem, and the minister may advise the managing director that he is not too happy with what the board is doing. That would not destroy the independence of the board. I am sure that Minister Lee, as did his predecessors—it is on the public record, in the newspapers, in many books and in this parliamentary record, about how this has been done—would discuss a whole range of matters with the Managing Director of the ABC. The ABC has of course been independent for 60 years. These things have been discussed, and quite properly the minister, as the representative of cabinet in this area, does have some influence over things if they are not going properly. But, as I said, 98 per cent of time this discretion will probably not be exercised.","N/A","COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1994 [1995]","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We think that is a better way of dealing with this than putting into this legislation an amendment which would apply to just the ABC and SBS. We would rather see it across-the-board. We would rather see all statutory authorities and GBEs treated in the same manner rather than having in relation to large financial decisions the ABC and SBS treated in a different manner like this.If there is a problem with that, if someone can perceive a problem with the statutory authorities which do national broadcasting—they are different from all other statutory authorities and GBEs—I think the place to put that would be under the new accountability legislation, when that comes up.

And of course there is always the Auditor-General, who also carries out those sorts of functions on behalf of the government.But I put to Senator Bourne, who, along with me, is a member of the Senate Select Committee on ABC Management and Operations and is its deputy chair, that when we were trying to find out why there were so many problems with the new ventures that the ABC was undertaking, we were looking for checks and balances as to why certain decisions were made, why the ABC started undertaking certain activities and why on some of these matters it was not pulled up more quickly, and the only answer we got from the ABC, which Senator Bourne might recall, was that the Auditor-General scrutinises and oversees the finances of the ABC. But when we pressed representatives further for other sorts of mechanisms, they could not come up with them. That is why I thought we really need this amendment. What we are talking about here is not whether the ABC is adding up the dollars correctly, but perhaps the qualitative nature of the way in which money is spent.You can spend money on projects and account for the finance in a perfectly valid way. That is that side of it. The other side of it is, `Was it really wise to spend that sort of money in that way? Was it wise to build that great big Taj Mahal? That monument to some ABC managing director or chairman that they might have put up, in terms of the resource needs of the ABC or the SBS and of the audience, may not have been a wise way of spending the money, given that they have such scarce resources. That is why I believe that the minister deserves at least the courtesy that, when they undertake these large capital projects, before they sign contracts they at least notify the minister so that perhaps in counselling them he might make his own comments about the wisdom or otherwise of those decisions.Amendments negatived.Bill agreed to.Bill reported without amendment; report adopted.","N/A","COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1994 [1995]","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

233,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator SHORT","DJ4","(Victoria)","LP","N/A",1422,"—The Financial Management and Accountability Bill, the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill, the Auditor-General Bill and the Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill are a package of bills which replace and repeal the Audit Act 1901. These bills represent the long overdue overhaul and improvement of the legal framework which encompasses the accountability of public finances at the Commonwealth level. Indeed, no legislation could be more important to the parliament than this package of legislation and I believe that there will be no more important package of legislation presented, certainly not in the life of this parliament.At the outset, I express my concern and disappointment that this legislation is in fact being debated today. As I understand it, the coalition sought to have its consideration deferred until tomorrow for the very simple and proper reason that there has been a Senate committee looking at it. That committee reported only today—indeed, in the last hour. So we are going into the second reading debate without senators, including some of those speaking in the second reading debate, having had the opportunity to consider the report of that committee. I put in a protest to the government on this.If we are serious and fair dinkum about having proper parliamentary consideration of legislation—particularly vital legislation of this nature, which goes to the whole core of accountability of government, the role of the parliament and the executive and the like, and given that this package of legislation has been six years in the making—it would have been much more in accord with the proper processes of parliamentary procedure for it at least to have been deferred until tomorrow before it came up for debate.These bills are the outcome of the 1989 report No. 296 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts entitled The Auditor-General: Ally of the People and Parliament—Reform of the Australian Audit Office . That very carefully considered and very highly reputable report recommended, amongst other things, that the Audit Act be repealed and replaced with more modern and flexible financial management.This legislation was supposed to be introduced in the 1992 autumn sittings, that is, three years ago. It was deferred then as a low priority item by the government, despite its obvious importance. It was then proposed for the 1993 autumn sittings. Again it was postponed, and the bills first appeared in late June last year. It is planned that the new arrangements will take effect on 1 July this year. If they do—if the government does meet that starting point deadline, as hopefully it now will—it will be six long years after initially being recommended that the package is finally put into place. To quote the then Auditor-General from the 1991-92 annual report of the Australian National Audit Office:In my report some three years ago—and he is saying this in 1991-92—I reported with some enthusiasm government support for the JCPAs recommendation that a new act be developed setting a new direction for my office. That enthusiasm has waned somewhat. Some four years after the JCPA recommended its development, the reality of a new act would still seem to be in the future. I hope that the parliament will be put in a position soon where it will be able to put the Auditor-Generals act in place by July 1993. However, the Government has recently reduced the priority given to the passage of the legislation, which may leave the Office without the support it needs in the contemporary environment.So said the Auditor-General in the 1991 annual report. He was then at pains to comment on the issue again in his 1992 annual report:During the year, however, it became more obvious to me that the changes in the Australian National Audit Office had to be more fundamental and far reaching. It became clear to me that I could no longer afford to wait for the government to act to implement the recommendations made by the JCPA in its report 296 of March 1989.The 1993-94 annual report contained the following references to the matter in what became Mr John Taylors last report on the issue before his retirement. In that 1993-94 annual report he said:1993-94 saw the introduction of a package of legislation to replace the Audit Act 1901. Five years after it was first recommended by the JCPA, three Bills, including the Auditor-General Bill, were introduced in the House of Representatives by the Government. In a welcome initiative the Government at the same time referred those bills to the JCPA for review.The next few months represent a crucial period for the Australian National Audit Office with the expected passage of the legislation to replace the Audit Act 1901. I am greatly encouraged, in particular, by the JCPAs support for providing the Auditor-General with the authority to set its own terms and conditions of the staff of the Audit Office and for the establishment of an Audit Committee of the Parliament. With these important building blocks, the prospect of a long-term improvement in the Australian National Audit Offices funding position, and the continuing commitment and professionalism of all the staff of the ANAO, I am cautiously optimistic that the Audit Office will continue to provide the Parliament, the Executive and the community with a valued service well into the future.He concluded:It is now up to the Parliament to decide what it, rather than the Government or its agencies, wants from the Auditor-General and the Australian National Audit Office.That is exactly what the coalition parties will be pushing for in the Senate in the debate both at the second reading stage and, more particularly, the committee stage of these bills. We will be moving a number of amendments. They have been formally circulated in my name on behalf of the coalition. They are all designed to enhance the role and responsibilities of the Auditor-General and, through him, the accountability of government to the people and to the parliament.My colleague Senator Gibson, who is a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and who will be dealing with these bills for the coalition not only in the second reading stage but also in the committee stage, will outline in more detail the proposals and the considerations of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which deliberations have been important in framing the recommendations and amendments that we will be moving.In its 1989 report, the key report, No. 296, entitled The Auditor-General: Ally of the people and the parliament, the Public Accounts Committee set out clearly why it considered new audit legislation was necessary. It gave the following reasons: that it was necessary to establish the Audit Committee of Parliament; to identify the Auditor-General more clearly as an officer of the parliament—and that is a key point; to establish the procedures for appointing future auditors-general and to change procedures for their removal; to change the term of appointment of future auditors-general; to define the Auditor-Generals authority to settle the terms and conditions of employment of the Australian Audit Office staff; to extend the Auditor-Generals power to delegate his authority to settle the terms and conditions of employment of Australian Audit Office staff; to extend the Auditor-Generals powers to delegate his authority; to affirm that the Auditor-General is the external auditor of all Commonwealth bodies and organisations in which the Commonwealth has a controlling interest; to affirm the Auditor-Generals authority to initiate efficiency audits of all Commonwealth instrumentalities; to place beyond doubt the Auditor-Generals authority to contract audits to whom he or she considers appropriate; to simplify statements of the Auditor-Generals authority in relation to regularity and performance audits; to rename the Australian Audit Office; to reaffirm the role of the independent auditor of the Australian Audit Office in the light of these legislative changes; and, most importantly, to provide the Australian Audit Office with a clearer definition of its role in government.The coalition wholeheartedly endorses the approach and recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee and so, as I have already noted, did the Auditor-General. We have been very supportive of the thrust of this package of bills, which is the governments very belated response to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts report of 1989. A `disgrace is the only word that can accurately describe the delay that has occurred in the development of these bills and their presentation to the parliament. We are very fortunate indeed that we have not had some serious problems arise over financial accountability and the auditors role in the ensuing years while that hiatus has occurred.We do regret very much, however, whilst being supportive of the thrust of this package of bills, that the government has not been prepared to embrace more fully the Public Accounts Committees proposals. The amendments that I have circulated on behalf of the coalition are aimed at addressing those deficiencies. We believe that there are four serious shortcomings in the legislation as proposed by the government. They deal with the following four issues: firstly, the appointment of the Auditor-General; secondly, the mandate of the Audit Office; thirdly, the question of an Audit Committee of Parliament and, fourthly, the terms and conditions of employment at the Audit Office.In each of these cases the government has failed to respond adequately to the original Public Accounts Committee report and also to the follow-up report on this legislative package, that report being No. 331 of the Public Accounts Committee of September 1994. That report reiterated and identified these very same shortcomings as they exist in the current Audit Act arrangements and as will be the case in the governments preferred bills.The appointment of the Auditor-General surely should be above party politics. The occupant of this highly respected and critically important position should have the support of both the government and the opposition and the endorsement of the parliaments audit committee.","N/A","FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY BILL 1994 COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITIES AND COMPANIES BILL 1994 AUDITOR-GENERAL BILL 1994","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

This is required in order to enhance the Auditor-Generals perception of independence and of his relationship with the parliament. The Auditor-Generals mandate should be clear. It should include all taxpayer instrumentalities and agencies. That should be included in the statute and not be subject to ministerial fiat or regulation. The coalitions amendments adequately protect commercial government business enterprises, as vetted by the audit committee, while at the same time ensuring an easier avenue for proper accountability of taxpayer funds.The audit committee concept is a long overdue measure to enhance the relationship between the Auditor-General and the parliament. The coalitions amendments propose that this role be carried out by the new Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit. This new committee would oversee the Auditor-General, guide the Auditor-General and review the work of the Auditor-General. It would play a fundamentally important role in the parliament in guaranteeing the utmost accountability of taxpayer funds, and that surely is the ultimate responsibility of any parliament.The final point of contention is over the terms and conditions of staff at the audit office. This is a fundamental bone of contention. It is, in our view, essential that the Auditor-General not be thwarted by the government of the day through the imposition of rigid and inappropriate Public Service conditions. He needs flexibility in dealing with his staff. His office, and especially his staff, need to be fully independent of any control by government. My colleagues, and in particular Senator Gibson, will be further elaborating on these issues in the second reading debate and in the committee stage.The final subject I wish to address, and which is essential to the coverage of the Auditor-General, is the inclusion of the National Media Liaison Service, more commonly known as aNiMaLS, in his audit mandate. aNiMaLS is, of course, nothing other than the governments propaganda wing, or at least that is what it has become. It should never have been that, but that is what it has become during the life of this government.Last year the audit office commenced a routine efficiency audit of government information and advertising. In October 1994, the audit office sought an interview with aNiMaLS `for the purpose of continuing with the audit. aNiMaLS refused and referred the matter to the Minister for Administrative Services. On 5 December last year, after a request from the acting Auditor-General for assistance, the minister replied that `the review you propose is ultra vires the Audit Act.That opinion was supported then by the Attorney-Generals Department.The Auditor-General in Audit Report No. 17, 1994-95 entitled National Media Liaison Service—a loophole in accountability? summarised the position as follows. He said:NMLS is therefore not subject to the normal accountability mechanisms in place over Government programs. As a consequence, although NMLS is fully funded by the taxpayer and its stated roles and functions are predominantly administrative in nature, its operations are not subject to the scrutiny normally associated with the expenditure of public monies.In effect, $1.5 million of taxpayer funds are absolved of any accountability; those funds being used, as I say, for the blatant purpose of political propaganda by this government. Of course, there can be no excuse for its exclusion from normal accountability procedures and avenues. The Auditor-General concluded his report No. 17 with this warning:All those who play a role in administrative decision making exercise public power and that action, especially where public money is involved, should be open to public scrutiny. The Auditor-General Bill before Parliament does not provide explicitly that the performance audit mandate of the Auditor-General extends to activities such as those of NMLS. I understand, however, that it is intended that this will be addressed by regulation only and therefore not be a central tenet in the provisions of the legislation. The accountability arrangements for all activities that involve the use of taxpayers funds should be enshrined as a central tenet of the provisions of any new Auditor-General Act.The coalition agrees totally with that view, and we will be pursuing that very strongly in the further consideration of this bill. As I say, the coalition supports the bill. We regret that it has not gone far enough to meet the Public Accounts Committees recommendations. We hope that, as a result of this debate, those concerns will be met.","N/A","FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY BILL 1994 COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITIES AND COMPANIES BILL 1994 AUDITOR-GENERAL BILL 1994","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
236,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator KERNOT","XW4","(Queensland-","AD","Leader of the Australian Democrats)",1426,"—We are debating four bills which, collectively, are probably the most important legislative package on government accountability that this parliament will consider. Before us are the three bills proposed to replace the Audit Act 1901, as well as a bill of miscellaneous amendments. It was appropriate that the Audit Act, which established the office of the Auditor-General and the basic rules governing government money, was the first act of the new federal parliament in 1901. But, having said that, it is extraordinary that it has taken 94 years for the act to be finally revised and updated.The Democrats wish to place on the record our strong support for the need for the package of bills. While the bills are not perfect, they go some significant way, in our view, to implementing a key plank of the accountability package which the Democrats negotiated with the government following the resignation of Mrs Ros Kelly in March last year. These bills will strengthen the statutory independence of the Auditor-General and, if amended as we have sought, they will establish an appropriate link between the Auditor-General and the parliament through an audit committee of the parliament.This package of bills, as we have said, has been a long time coming. It was first recommended 18 years ago by the Coombs Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration. The recommendations of that royal commission on financial management were then largely ignored by successive governments, Labor and coalition.Five years ago, the Public Accounts Committee conducted a detailed inquiry of the office of the Auditor-General and found that the office was suffering from defective legislation, inadequate funding and unnecessary interference from the executive arm of government. The Public Accounts Committees call for urgent action was ignored for many years, despite repeated calls from the Auditor-General for a stronger statement of his role as a servant of the parliament and for adequate funding arrangements for him to carry on his duties.Instead, I think it is fair to say, the government chose to make it progressively harder for the audit office to function. Between 1992 and 1994, the parlous finances of the office forced a reduction in staff from 650 to 350 employees. I do not think that is just the normal downsizing. I think it has to do with lack of money. This has meant that many reporting functions which could have been done have not been done.On top of that, the audit office faced a cumulative loss of a further $23 million over 15 years as a result of a badly negotiated lease with its head tenant, the ALP. While a commission of inquiry cleared the government and the ALP of any wrongdoing with the lease, it has pointed out that, unless the financial obligations under the lease are met by government, the audit offices capacity to undertake its statutory obligations will be affected.In March 1994, following the resignation of Mrs Kelly, the Democrats extracted from the government an agreement to an accountability package which guaranteed a stronger role for the Auditor-General. Since last March, these bills have been extensively redrafted and now promise to establish a very strong financial accountability regime for the government, departments and Commonwealth agencies and authorities.Establishing a strong legislative mandate for a well resourced Auditor-General is a key priority for the Democrats. This can only benefit good government. Not just will it improve accountability, but it will also lead to more efficient government. It is worth pointing out that performance audits by the Auditor-General have, even in just the last few years, identified potential savings to the government of hundreds of millions of dollars.Certainly these bills we are debating look a whole lot better than the draft bill I saw a year ago. I think we should commend the government and Minister Beazley on their preparedness, since the March accountability statement, to entertain further strengthening of the financial accountability of government. Having said that, I still believe that we need to go a little further to develop the proper role of parliament in keeping the executive arm of government fully accountable. In the committee stage, the Democrats and the opposition will be moving various amendments which we believe will improve these bills. I hope that the government will match its rhetoric with an even stronger legislative commitment to keep itself financially honest.We have four bills before us. I will briefly deal with each of them and highlight what, in our view, still needs to be done. Politically, the most important bill is the Auditor-General Bill. This will establish the office of the Auditor-General, its mandate, its powers and its responsibilities. The government has agreed to expand the authority of the Auditor-General to give it the automatic right to audit all government bodies for financial statement audits and all bodies, except GBEs, on performance audits. This is a great improvement on the existing position, but still does not go far enough.The Democrats believe that the public has a right to know that government owned enterprises can be subject to performance audits. GBEs often like to think that they can operate like private sector companies. Private sector companies are responsible to their shareholders for their performance. Such mechanisms do not exist for GBEs, which are wholly government owned. For these reasons we will be supporting a further extension of the Auditor-Generals mandate on efficiency audits. In our view, the Auditor-General should also have the right to audit all organisations run with government money. The recent case of the National Media Liaison Service, where a $1.5 million government agency was excluded from performance audits, should never recur.We will be moving amendments to ensure that the Auditor-Generals right to audit other government bodies should not be constrained and this right to report on those activities should not be fettered unless the Auditor-General believes that it would not be in the public interest to report on matters. Most importantly, the bill must make clear that the Auditor-Generals primary role is to assist parliament in making sure the executive arm of government is accountable to it. We seek to achieve this in several ways.Firstly, we propose to give the parliament a say in the development of the budget and audit priorities of the audit office through the establishment in law of an audit committee of parliament. This would follow the practice of both the British and Canadian parliaments, which have established such committees. In following the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee, the Democrats propose that the role of the audit committee be performed by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts with an extended list of duties and its membership extended to include minority party representation. Senator Short said that he hoped that the appointment of the Auditor-General would be something agreed to by the government and the opposition. I think he would recognise that considering we had a say in the original accountable package we would have an interest in this appointment as well.Secondly, we propose that the parliament should have a say in the appointment of the Auditor-General. We have proposed the adoption of the model used in the New South Wales parliament of giving the extended Public Accounts Committee the right to investigate and, if necessary, veto the nomination of an Auditor-General.The second key piece of legislation is the Financial Management and Accountability Bill. In practical terms this is probably the most far reaching of the three bills. It dramatically changes the way in which Commonwealth government funds are to be held by agencies and it establishes a range of new responsibilities. The Democrats support the broad thrust of the legislation, as expressed in clause 45, that will require chief executives to manage the affairs of their agencies in a way that promotes the efficient, effective and ethical use of public moneys.In the course of hearings on this bill, the Privacy Commissioner and the ombudsman have raised some concerns about elements of the bill. The Privacy Commissioner is concerned that clause 36 of the bill allows the finance machine to reward informants. In our view, this enactment runs contrary to the advice of the Senate whistleblowers committee and the Elliott House Committee on Fraud. We intend to move to delete this provision.The ombudsman remains concerned that the proposed finance regulations underpinning the bill will establish an overly complex system for the determination of compensation to the victims of government maladministration. We have looked at this and we share some of those concerns. We seek a commitment from the government that the proposed regulatory scheme will be the subject of close consultation with the Democrats and a public inquiry before being enacted.The third major bill is the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill. This bill establishes an accountability regime for government business enterprises, statutory authorities, and government owned companies. We will support this bill as it seeks to establish proper lines of accountability to the government for the financial performance of these enterprises, authorities and companies. However, as I indicated earlier, we will be seeking to improve the further line of accountability from government business enterprises to the parliament by expanding the mandate of the Auditor-General over performance audits.We will also be seeking to amend the CAC bill to correct a possible unintended consequence. Clause 28 of the bill allows the relevant minister to issue instructions to Commonwealth authorities. In the case of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, this section effectively repeals section 8 of the ABC Act, which guarantees the independence of the ABC in all matters. The Democrats believe that the ABC Act, which allows the government to propose policy to the board and for the board to consider the governments proposal, provides a reasonable compromise between the need for the ABC to be accountable and also independent. We will be moving to exclude the ABC from the operation of clause 28.The fourth bill deals with various miscellaneous and transitional amendments and we will be moving only one amendment to set a maximum time within which regulations to govern the auditing of security and intelligence agencies will be enacted. In summary, the package of bills before us tonight will help us keep the government honest. We support that principle. However, it must be taken further. Financial accountability is not just about agencies being accountable to the government and the executive; it is about the executive being accountable to the parliament and through the parliament to the public at large.We always have to keep pulling back to maintain that position. It is hard and we all understand why governments try to get away with as much as they can until we tell them they cannot. We are telling them on this one that they cannot get away with it and we need them to go further. While we recognise the package of bills represents a significant move towards the goal of the executive ultimately being accountable through parliament to the public at large, the Democrats amendments will go even further and are necessary to achieve that particular goal.","N/A","FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY BILL 1994 COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITIES AND COMPANIES BILL 1994 AUDITOR-GENERAL BILL 1994","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
237,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator GIBSON","BX5","(Tasmania)","LP","N/A",1429,"—I rise to support my colleague Senator Short, who spoke on behalf of the coalition in relation to this package of bills. I will very briefly go back over the history of the legislation. Report No. 296 of the Public Accounts Committee entitled Auditor-General: Ally of the People and Parliament , which was tabled in April 1989, was a key document in relation to this legislation. As Senator Short said, it took the government until autumn of last year before it agreed to look at that report and bring forward a draft amendment to the Audit Act 1901.On 29 June last year the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) introduced into the other place the Financial Management and Accountability Bill 1994, the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1994 and the Auditor-General Bill 1994 and immediately referred them to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts which was to report on them. The next day the Senate asked the public accounts committee to report on the government notice of motion to establish an audit committee of the parliament, following a draft resolution that was brought forward here in the Senate.In September of last year report No. 331 of the public accounts committee, which was tabled on 22 September, basically reviewed the legislation before us. The essential drive of that report was to further strengthen the links between the Auditor-General and the parliament and to reinforce the supremacy of the parliament in our system of government.We are dealing with three bills cognately. I wish to take the opportunity of speaking on the details of the Auditor-General Bill, which I believe is very important. I also stress that the other bills, particularly the FMA bill and the CAC bill, are very important. We in the opposition welcome them and think they are a very good addition to the legislation.I return to the Auditor-General Bill. I believe we are really talking about constitutional legislation and how the parliament itself properly discharges its constitutional responsibility to the people; that is, it brings the executive and the administrative arms under the surveillance of the parliament. The bill is about reporting to the parliament. In his second reading speech in the other place on 7 December last year—this is on the revised bills which he tabled on that day—Minister Beazley commended the public accounts committee for the quality of its analysis and its recommendations, the great majority of which the government accepts.The Auditor-General Bill establishes the offices of the Auditor-General and the independent auditor. It describes their powers and responsibilities and establishes the Australian National Audit Office as a statutory agency. We welcome that. The bill lists the Auditor-Generals functions, which include auditing the financial statements of all Commonwealth agencies, authorities, companies and any relevant subsidiaries. The Auditor-General is also empowered to conduct performance audits of Commonwealth agencies, authorities, companies and subsidiaries, with the exception of those that are government business enterprises, or GBEs. In the present bill, the Auditor-General has a limited mandate to conduct performance audits of GBEs.The bill also details the Auditor-Generals wide powers to obtain information and access premises. It establishes the audit office as a statutory agency. It establishes the office of the independent auditor and outlines a method of appointing, remunerating and removing both the Auditor-General and the independent auditor.I acknowledge that the current bill is a significant improvement over the 1994 draft bill, in that it moves closer to parliament. But there are still major matters which require amendment to fulfil the expectation we as parliamentarians have of making the Auditor-General and his office fully answerable to the parliament and not just to the executive.There are four matters that still require correction. Those matters are: firstly, the mandate to carry out performance audits; secondly, the appointment of the Auditor-General; thirdly, the Audit Committee of Parliament; and, finally, the terms and conditions of the appointment of audit staff.I refer to the performance audit mandate. Clauses 13 to 15 of the Auditor-General Bill allow the Auditor-General to conduct performance audits of Commonwealth organisations. However, the clauses allow the Auditor-General to conduct performance audits only of those Commonwealth authorities and wholly owned Commonwealth companies that are GBEs at the request of the responsible minister or both houses of parliament by resolution.The public accounts committee believed that this represented a limitation on parliaments capacity to make an informed assessment about the efficiency with which taxpayers money is being used by GBEs. The committee believed it important that there be an easier mechanism by which parliament could directly request the Auditor-General to conduct performance audits. The committee concluded that the most efficient way of doing this was to delegate the parliaments authority to request a performance audit of a GBE to one of its committees. In fact, the public accounts committee recommended that an audit committee of parliament, in whatever form, be able to directly request the Auditor-General to conduct a performance audit of a GBE without the need to go through the responsible minister or both houses.I note that, under the Commonwealths amendments successfully incorporated into the bill, Commonwealth companies not wholly owned by the Commonwealth that are GBEs, such as Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank, will not be subject to performance audits under any circumstance. In the amendments to be moved by the opposition, we have proposed that the Auditor-General be able at any time to conduct a performance audit of a Commonwealth authority or company that is a GBE other than a GBE accepted by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, as defined later, as a GBE with significant private sector financial involvement or any of its subsidiaries. I note that the Australian Democrats have suggested almost identically worded amendments.I move on to the appointment of the Auditor-General. Schedule 1 of the Auditor-General Bill requires the Auditor-General to be appointed on recommendation of the minister. The minister is required to consult the finance minister, a nominee of the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives, the chairperson of the public accounts committee and the chairperson of an audit committee. The public accounts committee believed that it was important that the parliament be given a greater role in the appointment process. In the committees view it would be preferable if these parliamentary representatives were given the power to approve the nomination and not just be consulted. The power of approval should also be extended to include the Audit Committee of Parliament, however it is constituted.The public accounts committee recommended that the parliament have the right to approve the nomination of the Auditor-General and also the independent auditor. It recommended that the minister must seek the approval of the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives or his or her nominee, the public accounts committee and an audit committee of parliament.In the amendments to be moved by the opposition, we will be proposing a similar amendment to that put forward by the public accounts committee. Instead of referring to two separate committees, we are referring to the amalgamation of both, as also mentioned by Senator Kernot on behalf of the Democrats. It would be called the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit.The government believes that the Auditor-General appointment is really an executive decision after consultation with the opposition and the public accounts committee. But we urge the government to recognise that the Auditor-Generals appointment should really be by the parliament. I refer to the UK example. Under section 1(i) of the National Audit Act 1983, the chairman of the public accounts committee basically has the right of veto in that parliament. In the state of New South Wales, under section 28A of the Public Finance and Audit Act, the public accounts committee of that parliament has the right of veto. It is the same for the ombudsman and the ICAC commissioner.I refer to the situation in the USA. A document of the GAO office reads:Congress participates in the selection of the Comptroller-General—who is the equivalent of our Auditor-General—by providing a list of proposed candidates from which the President may choose and by confirming the appointment. The appointment process reinforces the non-partisan nature of the agency and helps protect this independence.We in the opposition and the Democrats support that proposition very strongly.The third matter I wish to refer to is the Audit Committee of Parliament. On 30 June 1994 the Senate referred a government notice of motion to establish an audit committee of parliament to the public accounts committee for inquiry. The public accounts committee considered that the audit committee should be given statutory recognition and that, for reasons of efficiency and effectiveness, the functions of an audit committee should be conducted by the public accounts committee itself. The committee came to this conclusion firstly because it had a long history of liaison with the Auditor-General. This has given members of that committee a strong understanding of the issues affecting the Auditor-General and his office. I remind the Senate that the government actually has the majority of members on this public accounts committee.Secondly, it has a statutory obligation to examine reports of the Auditor-General. Members have developed a detailed insight into the Auditor-Generals level of activity and the efficiency with which it is carried out. Thirdly, it already acts informally as a conduit for parliamentarians to indicate aspects of public administration that they would like the Auditor-General to examine. Finally, senators and members already have difficulty in meeting their commitments, and creating another parliamentary committee will only increase the demands on their time. Significantly, a number of former presiding officers have stated that they believe it is inappropriate for the presiding officers to participate in an audit committee as the government proposes.The public accounts committee recommended that the Public Accounts Committee Act 1951 be amended to allow the public accounts committee to conduct the functions of an audit committee. The JCPA also believed it important that its function as an audit committee should be clearly distinct from its traditional functions. To clarify the distinction, the JCPA recommended that it should convene as an audit committee of parliament when performing audit committee functions. Furthermore, it believed that it is important that minority parties and independents be represented on the committee, and it believed that this could be most appropriately done by amending the Public Accounts Committee Act to increase the membership of the public accounts committee by one, to make it a membership of 16, and reserving that extra position for a representative of any minority groups or independents in the parliament. The opposition has proposed similar amendments to that recommended by the public accounts committee. But, instead of following the public accounts committee recommendation, we propose setting up a sectional committee to undertake this audit function.The fourth matter relates to the terms and conditions of audit office staff. Clause 35 of the Auditor-General Bill establishes the audit office as a statutory office, which, as I said before, we in the opposition strongly welcome. But clause 37 states that the staff of the office are to be appointed or employed under the Public Service Act 1922, which effectively denies the Auditor-General the power to set the terms and conditions of audit office staff.The Auditor-General is in a unique position in the public sector, given his or her vital role in strengthening the accountability of the executive to parliament and in improving public sector efficiency. The Auditor-Generals capacity to undertake these functions would be enhanced if he or she had greater flexibility to negotiate competitive remuneration packages. However, this should be balanced with the requirement to protect the basic terms and conditions of the audit office staff.I note that we already have examples like the Australian Federal Police Act 1979, which empowers the commissioner of police to determine terms and conditions of his staff, but subject to ministerial guidelines. The Federal Airports Corporation has similar guidelines. The public accounts committee took evidence about overseas examples. In the audit office in the UK, the Comptroller-General has freedom to employ staff under the conditions he wishes. In fact, the Comptroller-General stressed that it was important for him to have his senior staff swapping with the private sector all the time so that they were kept up to speed with latest advances in auditing. The same applies in New South Wales and also in the USA. I cite the situation of the General Accounting Office in the USA:The Comptroller General and the Deputy Comptroller General are appointed by the President, but all other employees are hired on the basis of skill and experience. GAO administers its own personnel system, separate from the system that governs employees of the executive branch.The public accounts committee recommended that the Auditor-General be able to set the terms and conditions of the audit office staff, with the proviso that the terms and conditions be consistent with the government industrial relations and employment policies. The opposition concurs with that recommendation and agrees with the Democrats in general principle terms that there should be an amendment along those lines.So with those important but substantive matters, we welcome this package of bills. It contains very important reforms for the parliament. It is the parliament that we are talking about here, not the executive. If the government considers the amendments which we and the Democrats are proposing, I believe that parliament will end up with an Audit Act and associated acts of which we all can be proud. And the parliament will be able to fulfil its constitutional duty for the people of Australia.","N/A","FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY BILL 1994 COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITIES AND COMPANIES BILL 1994 AUDITOR-GENERAL BILL 1994","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
238,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator WATSON","VJ4","(Tasmania)","LP","N/A",1432,"—The Audit Act was one of the earliest bills passed by the new federal parliament in 1901. I think that demonstrates the priority and the importance that the Australian parliament gave to audit issues then. I need not remind the Senate that accountability is the cornerstone of democracy. In fact, the parliament relies on reports of the Auditor-General as a source of apolitical, independent and objective advice. In circumstances where the Auditor-Generals capacity is limited by resource or other constraints—and my colleagues have referred to some of those constraints in the earlier debate—this Senate is deprived of information on the performance of the public sector.In 1989, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts presented its report No. 296 to parliament. This was the first comprehensive government or parliamentary inquiry into the Australian audit office. I remind you that in the intervening 88 years, the purpose and the conduct of audits have changed quite dramatically. I admit that government has responded positively to that report. However, I wish to draw to the Senates attention some significant shortcomings, most of which have been addressed by my colleague Senator Short in foreshadowing four amendments that will be moved by the coalition. So I urge everybody in the Senate to endorse those amendments because of the important accountability issues that they address.In June 1994, the Australian National Audit Office responded through its report, Parliaments Right to Know —which related to legislation to replace the Audit Act 1901—to the package of three bills of government legislation that followed JCPA report No. 296. As a former vice-chair of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I sat on that inquiry and I certainly shared the Auditor-Generals concern that the governments response fell short of what was required for the National Audit Office to meet the challenges of today. According to the Auditor-General, those challenges are greater than in 1989 when the joint committee reported on the Australian National Audit Office and the 1901 Audit Act as amended.In the interest of accountability, I believe the Auditor-General should have unfettered authority to undertake performance audits of all Commonwealth owned and controlled agencies and authorities. Over the years, the Senate has had to battle the executive over the mandate of the audit office in relation to statutory authorities. Honourable senators will recall decisive victories of this Senate over the executive in relation to the restoration of audit responsibilities. I draw the Senates attention to the victories by this Senate over the executive in response to the scope of the mandate of the Australian National Audit Office. The victories related to the Australian Wool Corporation, the Australian Wool Realisation Commission and the Australian National Rail Corporation. Frequently, the Australian National Audit Office contracts certain work to private firms but, overall, it retains the control of the work. Parliament does not have problems with this particular approach, but it is necessary to maintain the mandate of the audit office.In 1987, the Auditor-Generals mandate covered all Commonwealth bodies of whatever legal form. There were no restrictions on the Auditor-Generals authority to undertake performance audits in government business enterprises. I remind the Senate that the present package of bills represents a deterioration of the position as it existed then, which was even prior to JCPA report No. 296. So the risks facing the public sector since then have increased quite significantly.I concur with the Auditor-Generals comments that the governments proposals `miss the opportunity to set the standard of public accountability and model arrangements for the operation of the Australian National Audit Office which would serve the parliament, the government and the community well into the 21st century. And if this package of bills passes without amendment, ultimately the parliament and the community will be the losers.Debate interrupted.","N/A","FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY BILL 1994 COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITIES AND COMPANIES BILL 1994 AUDITOR-GENERAL BILL 1994","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

On the same evening, there was a presentation by Keith and Rohanne Mason of something that I think is worth repeating and for which I will do what I can to promote.Keith and Rohanne Mason are members of the Fairfield Lions club and have developed, as they call it, a special project for special people, which is a word processing program for the physically challenged put out by the Fairfield Lions club. The program, which is called the Jenny Word Processor, is very much the work of Keith and Rohanne Mason.The reason for it being called the Jenny Word Processor is that it has been developed for, in particular, Jenny Graham. This woman has cerebral palsy and, until she had access to a computer, she had not been able to communicate with other people. The computer that she had broke down. I am somewhat truncating the story. Keith Mason developed a program for people with cerebral palsy that enables them to communicate, many for the first time in their lives.The program is operated by using not a keyboard but a mouse or device that can be used by a person who does not have the normal hand movements of a person who can operate a keyboard. By using the mouse or pointing device, such people can use a keyboard as if it were on the screen and point to the things to be used to create documents. This was not developed in a very short time. Over 2,500 hours of Keith Masons time have gone into the production of this program. Rohanne Mason typed in 70,000 words and symbols to enable it to be used. It has enabled Jenny Graham and others to access a program which they can use to communicate with the world in a way that has not been available to them partly because of the quality of the program but also because of the price and the way that it is available to them.I have details of the minimum technical requirements required for the computer concerned. It requires a 100 per cent IBM compatible 386 or higher computer and some other things. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the description of the computer which is suitable for the program.Leave granted.The description read as follows —Minimum Technical Requirements:100% IMB compatible 386 or higher.4Mb RAM memory.2.5Mb of hard disk space.VGA screen preferred.Microsoft Windows 3.1 or later.A mouse or other pointing device.Optional: Sound Card with Monologue text-to-speech software.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/debate.sub1[1]/speech/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"
241,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator REID","VI4","(Australian Capital Territory)","LP","N/A",1433,"—I have done this because it is likely that in a community like ours there are computers of this kind available which people no longer have any use for because they have upgraded to larger or more modern machines. If what I have referred to were made available to people with cerebral palsy, it would give them access to this program and a means of communication that they would not otherwise have had. I hope that anyone who reads this and has such a machine considers making it available. Such people could do so by letting me or a Lions club near them know. The program would otherwise probably cost in excess of $5,000. But this program is available through Lions clubs for $255. In most instances, the Lions clubs raise the funds to make the computer available.The program has been considerably enhanced by the generosity of the Commonwealth Bank in supporting the project and producing the disks. Mr President, if you or others would like to see it, I have a video that describes what I have been talking about.I want to quickly mention Nicole, who got access to this machine. She had never been able to make sounds to communicate. She was 34 when she obtained access to Keith Masons program, the Jenny Word Processor. The first thing she wrote on her screen after she learned how to use it was `Nicole loves Mum. It is beyond the comprehension of those of us who are sitting here to imagine that one could be 34 and not have had the means to say that until that age. This program was made available to her to communicate with the world for the first time.I have more information about the program and the incredible people, Keith and Rohanne Mason, who have devoted so much of their lives to producing it. They had the skills and the will to do so.I hope it will be possible for this program to be made available to all those who suffer from cerebral palsy. I believe that it is superior to the access that many of them have at present and would make a very great difference to their lives. As I said, not being able to communicate is something that most of us cannot comprehend. But many in our community have been forced to live without being able to do so. Now that the means to communicate is available, we should do all that we can to see that it is made available to those who will benefit from it.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/debate.sub1[1]/speech/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
242,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator HERRON","VW4","(Queensland)","LP","N/A",1434,"—Last Monday, and again on Thursday, I spoke about the matter of CARE Australia and the attack on CARE Australia by Channel 9s Sunday program. Channel 9 made another attack yesterday. It would not be covered by any sub judice rules, because it is further material, so I do not feel constrained in any way to attack Channel 9.It has come to my notice that the lies that Channel 9 perpetrated in the original attack have been exposed for what they are. CARE made an initial approach to Channel 9 because of an approach that Channel 9 started making to former employees of the CARE Australia program. Former employees were incensed about this. They rang CARE to let it know that this was going on. That was the first that CARE knew of any investigation. CARE took the approach that it would be best to let Channel 9 know that it was aware of this. On 3 February, CARE Australia contacted Peter Hiscock of the Sunday program after hearing rumours that it was preparing the program. Mr Hiscock promised to come in for a chat and give CARE Australia a chance to respond to the criticisms. It was told not to worry; that was 3 February.On 9 February, CARE Australia again contacted Mr Peter Hiscock. CARE mentioned concerns with the way the program was being put together. If an interview was required with Malcolm Fraser and Ian Harris, it would be preferable that it be live. Mr Hiscock replied that a live interview may be difficult but that he would pursue the issue. On 16 February, CARE Australia wrote to Mr Hiscock in that context and expressed the position that it preferred a live interview. On 21 February, CARE Australia again told Sunday that it preferred a live interview. On 22 February, Malcolm Fraser spoke to Stephen Rice of the Sunday program and again reiterated that it wanted a live program.Mr President, you and I know that editing occurs and that those who want the truth in a program go live. In the four years I was president of my party in Queensland, I always insisted on that, and the television programs respected that wish. I went live on every occasion that I appeared on television. Channel 9 said that it would certainly look into it, but that was as far as it went.Channel 9 would not come into CARE, despite repeated requests. At one stage, it said that it would come in after it had completed its research. But it then came to CARE Australia and handed in a list of questions which were replied to the following day. In fact, they were replied to within 24 hours, except for the last question, which was answered on 24 February.What do Channel 9 and the Sunday program really think they are going to do? What will be the outcome? As anybody who is ever on a committee with me will know, my first question is always: what will be the outcome of what you are hoping to achieve? That has not been answered in this instance. Are they trying to destroy the CARE Australia program? Are they trying to destroy the other non-government organisations in this country? That will be the effect.CARE Australia has now had to enter into a damage control program because there are many people out there who are concerned about this. There are many people out there who would want an excuse not to contribute funds. It has damaged all the volunteer workers, such as myself. We start to wonder whether there is something in it.I certainly have no doubts whatsoever that there is nothing in it. I spent a few days there before I went overseas. I had nothing to do with CARE Australia before I went. I researched it both before and after. I am absolutely confident in the personnel and the management structures that exist there.But what is Channel 9 hoping to achieve? Is it trying to stop volunteers from going into aid programs? There are 1.3 million volunteers in Australia who collect funds for all sorts of agencies in this country. The sad part is that, on average, only $4.6 per capita is collected in this country for aid. That compares with Norways $32 per head, Switzerlands $22 per head and Swedens $21 per head. So we do not have a proud record. Channel 9 is going to push it even further down by the action it has taken.CARE Australia has a very proud record. It was formed in only 1987. It was approached by the United Nations because of what it has achieved. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees asked CARE to be a lead agency in certain programs. The lead agency is the agency that takes primary control of the various non-government organisations. CARE Australia has been the lead agency in Cambodia, Somalia, Bosnia, northern Iraq with the Kurds, and Rwanda. That is what CARE Australia has achieved in six years. I am very proud of what it did for our country.The starving and dying people were grateful for everything we did in treating them. What has Ross Coulthart done? I ask the reporter, Ross Coulthart, who attacked CARE Australia, how many peoples lives he has saved. Has he ever got out of his airconditioned studio and actually delivered care to anybody? Yet he was the one who persistently questioned the CARE Australia officials on that program. What has Channel 9 done to save the lives of refugees? Rwanda has been described as the worst humanitarian disaster in history. Also, within Rwanda itself has been the greatest slaughter in memory. Two million people out of a population of seven million were killed in a matter of four years. The situation there is unimaginable.You can imagine my anger when I see the attacks made on the wonderful organisation that CARE Australia represents, the volunteers who work for CARE Australia and the employed staff of CARE Australia. I am going to pursue this as each bit of information comes forward so that I can bring it home to Channel 9 that it must consider the outcome of what it has set out to do. I cannot see any way out other than that there will be an extraordinary damage to the aid organisations of this country.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
243,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator KNOWLES","TH4","(Western Australia)","LP","N/A",1436,"—I rise tonight to speak on behalf of Australias amateur radio operators, of which there are about 18,000. Many of these operators are retired service men and women who pursue the activity with absolute diligence and zest.On 5 December last year, the Wireless Institute of Australia, which is the representative body of radio amateurs, was informed by the Spectrum Management Agency of significant changes to the prices of radio licences, although this information was embargoed until 14 December. Initial advice is that licences will rise from $37, the cost of all licences in the past, to as much as $71. This is a preliminary figure, though, and there have been some indications that the final cost may be another $10 upward of that price.The result of this announcement is that amateur radio operators feel that the federal government has done them a grave injustice by pushing up their costs by almost 100 per cent and setting them up as easy revenue targets. My concern, and the concern which I wish to express tonight, is that the government has failed to recognise the valuable contribution these radio amateurs make to community life.Radio amateurs are well studied and qualified to practise their hobby. They learn and are examined in the areas of radio theory, regulations, and morse code. They access radio channels defined by the international agreement made by the international telecommunications unit in Geneva. They are regularly in contact with other Australian amateur radio operators and they can also talk with NASA astronauts as they fly overhead. They can speak with fishermen all over the world and contact stations in the Antarctic. Their hobby is, of course, far reaching and fascinating.On a more practical note, they hold field days which are used to train radio operators for emergencies. These days see stations set up to simulate emergency conditions from alternative power supplies. This is particularly significant. You, Mr President, and I both come from Western Australia where only recently Cyclone Bobby went through the mid-west of the state. I think it is significant to note that these amateur radio operators play a huge role in times of crisis such as that which was experienced in Western Australia only a few days ago.Following on from this, they are well trained to take on a vital role in emergencies such as earthquakes and bushfires as well. For example, notice of Cyclone Tracy was first provided by an amateur operator, who then maintained a link outside Darwin for three days until other services were arranged. Even when NASAs space shuttle flight communication was lost between the shuttle and official ground stations, Australian radio amateurs came to the rescue to facilitate communication between the shuttle and the United States government.In addition, astronauts regularly include amateur radio links in their flights for the purposes of recreation. The Russian space station MIR has a permanent amateur station installed and regularly makes contact with Australian radio amateurs. This is often used to delight school children, who may participate in a question and answer session with Russian and American astronauts with the assistance of an amateur operator. In fact, when it comes to space and satellite communication, Australia has one of the highest participation rates of any country and its amateur operators are regularly invited to conferences and seminars all over the world to assist in the planning of future satellites.It is these aspects of the far reaching role of amateur radio operators on which I wish to elaborate. Portable radio is an effective means of communication and, combined with the vast flexible network across Australia, radio is a powerful mechanism for emergency communication. Furthermore, it is operated by people who are skilled and trained in electronics and technology and who are knowledgeable about antenna location and operating methods.When emergencies arise, these are the people backing up authorities and they do so at absolutely no cost to the community. They are, in fact, precluded by radio regulations from receiving financial reward for their hard work, which is tireless and unselfish. In return, the federal government says, `Thanks very much for donating your time, expertise and equipment to the cause. Lets increase your fees by 100 per cent. I think that is totally and utterly unfair for the job they are doing within the community in, as I mentioned before, times of crisis as well as for recreational purposes.They have also played a significant role in war times and their equipment can be u0sed by the defence forces with or without notice if it is needed for an emergency military communication. With the outbreak of World War II, amateur radio operators answered the call for skilled radio personnel, who were desperately needed to operate and maintain military radio equipment and to teach each other how to perform these tasks. They formed the very backbone of defence communication in those years, which we are presently commemorating in the Australia Remembers campaign.In fact, their efforts are commemorated right here in the Canberra War Memorial where a makeshift transmitter/receiver made from a kerosene tin is displayed. This device, referred to as `Winnie the war winner, was used by Australian troops trapped in Portuguese Timor by the Japanese advance in the Pacific and, upon their making contact with Darwin, a successful rescue mission ensued. Even during the Gulf War, amateur radio operators conveyed military intelligence from Kuwait to United Nations forces in a clandestine operation. Clearly there is a need for these operators and it is foolish of the government to make it increasingly more expensive and difficult for them to exist.Amateur radio operators have also played a key part in important social and cultural events and are particularly keen to involve young people in their activities. At the World Jamboree held in Perth recently, amateur radio operators donated their time to link scouts up with operators all around the world. Many of the scouts also have their own club stations and these are linked up in the annual event Jamboree on the Air, or JOTA, where scouts and guides all over the planet will be talking to each other, typing messages and seeing each other through the technologies linked to amateur radio such as amateur television, amateur radio computer networks, satellites, short wave and local voice communication.Following on from what I said earlier regarding interaction between school children and astronauts, amateur radio stations have been established in a number of primary and high schools as part of their curriculum. By using computer linked Packet Radio and hosting Packet Radio bulletin board stations, students can send and receive messages to other schools and amateur stations all around the world. For many, this is an essential insight into a career in radio communications, electronics, broadcasting, engineering or computing.Radio also provides a vital communication link for the elderly and for people who suffer from some form of personal handicap. Modern radio equipment can be used by blind people, people who are wheelchair bound and by people who have lost their ability to speak. Aged people can use radio to maintain a bond of friendship without having to leave their home. In all of these areas, the radio amateur operator is playing an important social role.They are responsible citizens who willingly lend themselves to military exercises and emergency operations and who give their time to assist our young people by encouraging them to be interested and interactive in amateur radio—an area which may previously have been out of bounds. It is my fear that as the price of their licences creeps up and up at the hands of the federal government their role will be greatly diminished over time.Many operators, particularly the elderly, can ill-afford the steep price rises which are currently under consideration by the Spectrum Management Agency. Surely if the government could show it had the decency to acknowledge the value of the contributions made to society by amateur radio operators it would put a freeze on prices and engage in more substantial negotiations with the Wireless Institute of Australia before reviewing prices in the future.But all that the government is showing at the moment is a mean spirit which has led to an inexplicable and unjustified price hike which threatens a very successful and highly respected community service. I certainly encourage the government to relook at this and, in view of the work that these radio amateur operators do throughout the length and breath of this country, to reconsider such a price hike in their licence fees.Senate adjourned at 7.43 p.m.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/debate.sub1[3]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The stamp is, therefore, on sale at the time of the Queens Birthday public holiday in all States and Territories except Western Australia. The 1994 Queens Birthday commemorative stamp was withdrawn from sale on 31 August 1994.(3)(a)&(b) All commemorative and special issue stamps remain on sale for a period of four months.Definitive stamps, released in the full range of denominations from 1c to $20, remain on sale for a much longer period. The definitives from 1c to $2 are generally replaced in a three-year cycle, which means they remain on sale for about three years.High value definitives are replaced less often. The current high value definitives are $5, $10 (released in 1989) and $20 (released in 1990). The $5 definitive will be replaced in 1996. There are no plans at this stage to replace the $10 and $20 definitives.(4) The Queens Birthday commemorative stamp is circulated widely throughout Australia Posts retail network.Distributing Post Offices, in all States and Territories, receive an initial issue of philatelic stock, which they then release to Post Offices, Licensed Post Offices/Post Office Agencies in their area, in accordance with orders received.General stock, which is used for basic postal requirements, is in most cases sent direct to Post Offices and Licensed Post Offices/Post Office Agencies from Australia Posts Sprintpak Division in Melbourne. As actual stock despatched depends on the timing of the order received, it is possible that, if an outlet did not requisition base rate stamps at the time of the release of a new issue, that office would not receive general stock of that issue. However, if a customer specifically requests a commemorative or special issue stamp, such as the Queens Birthday stamp, it is usually possible to meet such a request from the offices philatelic allocation. If the outlets philatelic stock is sold, or if the outlet does not hold philatelic stock, staff will order stamps for customers if requested to do so.(5) Australia Post is able to extend the circulation period for commemorative stamps if there is sufficient public demand to do so.(6) Australia Post is unaware of any unmet pubic demand for the Queens Birthday commemorative stamp. That is to say, sufficient stamps are produced to satisfy public requirements. It is aware, however, of at least one complainant who found that the stamp was unavailable at three post offices in NSW. As explained by Australia Post in its response to the complainant, staff will order particular stamps for customers if requested to do so.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[2]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

263,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Senator Robert Ray","UI4","TAS","ALP","N/A",1440,"—The answer to the honourable senators question is as follows:(1) In early 1992, Defence was first alerted to potential problem of corrosion following Royal Australian Navy experience with the Seahawk helicopter in the Gulf War. While there are significant differences between the Blackhawk and Seahawk helicopters, there is commonality with the airframes and many parts. Although the Seahawk is marinised to minimise the effects of saltwater corrosion, it is still susceptible to corrosion. Therefore, any occurrence or indication of corrosion in the Seahawk was more than likely to occur in the Blackhawks when operating in a maritime environment.Cracking was first identified in 5 Aviation Regiment in Townsville in July 1994.(2) During 1992-93, in response to the information about corrosion in Seahawks, the RAAF commenced a study which resulted in the rewriting of the corrosion protection manual.In June 1994, an interim corrosion prevention servicing was introduced by Army. This included more frequent washing and inspections (every 14 days). This is about to be replaced with a new schedule which uses improved water displacing and corrosion prevention products. In addition, a proposal to enhance aircraft wash facilities and hangars at Townsville is being developed.Some corrosion repair work is now being carried out during the 500 hour service although corrosion has had only a limited effect on Blackhawk availability to date.In regard to cracking, Blackhawks are now subjected to vibration analysis every 100 hours. To rectify any existing cracking, Sikorsky has developed a repair technique, and is preparing an Engineering Change Proposal to correct the problem. As well, the RAAF is conducting flight trials at Aeronautical Research Development Unit (ARDU). If the Sikorsky and ARDU findings complement each other, the first aircraft may be modified in August 1995.(3)(a) The primary reason that so many Blackhawk aircraft are unserviceable is the lack of repair parts. Some parts are in short supply due to unforseen reduced operating lives imposed by Sikorsky following its on-site review of ADF operating conditions for Blackhawks. Orders have been placed for the spares however because of the unexpected turnover rate of the spares, the replenishment pipeline is longer than desirable and in some cases 18-24 months.(b) ASTA participates in Blackhawk maintenance in two main areas. In February 1992, ASTA commenced a three year contract with Army for deeper maintenance of Blackhawks in Townsville. It has done this effectively, marginally exceeded the contractual requirement, and has managed to reduce the servicing backlog. The only impediment to ASTAs ability to service the military requirement is the low availability of repair parts provided by the RAAF. The Army is satisfied with ASTAs performance in regard to Blackhawk.In May 1994, ASTA commenced a three year contract with the RAAF to provide Sikorsky propriety spares. The RAAF is satisfied with ASTAs performance in that spares are being provided within the Sikorsky provisioning lead times. ASTA has been helpful and done as well as can be expected.(4) No.(5)(a) No. All Blackhawks maintenance conducted by ASTA is done to a high standard in accordance with the appropriate technical manuals, and within budget.(b) The Blackhawk contract was not competed for under the Commercial Support Program.(c) No.(6) The Blackhawk External Stores Support System with fuel tanks was fitted to enable the aircraft to conduct long range, and high loiter time, tasks including strategic and operational deployments, counter terrorist tasks, and rescues at sea.The Blackhawk cannot perform all the tasks that the Chinook will be able to, particularly in respect of load capacity. That is, the Blackhawk load capacity is extremely limited when the support system is fitted with full fuel tanks.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[4]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

265,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Senator Gareth Evans","VD4","WA","ALP","N/A",1442,"—The answer to the honourable senators question is as follows:(1) The shipment in question involves a cargo of vitrified radioactive waste from France to Japan which left the French port of Cherbourg on 23 February 1995. The waste material was derived from the reprocessing of Japanese nuclear fuel in France. It does not contain usable plutonium or uranium and is not significant in non-proliferation terms. The waste has been incorporated in a stable vitreous form and placed in a steel transportation cask which provides highly effective radiation shielding. The packaging measures are in accordance with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) regulations for the safe transport of suchmaterial. The ship carrying the waste has been constructed and equipped to fully comply with the latest internationally-accepted standards of safety laid down in 1993 by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) for ships carrying such cargoes. In view of these standards, the Government is satisfied with the measures taken for the radiological protection and safety of the shipment.Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which reflects relevant international law, foreign ships enjoy freedom of navigation in the exclusive economic zone of a coastal state and the right of innocent passage through the territorial sea of a coastal state, subject to the conditions laid down in the Convention. Australia, as a party to the Convention, would observe and enforce the terms of that Convention. However, the Australian Government has been informed by the countries involved in the shipment; namely Japan, France and Britain, that the intended route would not under normal circumstances require the ship to enter or to transit the territorial sea of other countries. The only circumstances in which the ship might conceivably enter or transit the Australian territorial sea would be if an emergency arose in which Australian assistance was requested. Such a request would be very unlikely, however, given the special construction and equipment of the vessel involved. If there were an emergency during the shipment and the vessel sought Australias assistance the Government would consider such a request in accordance with the international law applicable to ships in distress.(2) No. The Government does not expect to be informed of the planned route for the vessel although it anticipates that the route selected will become known in the course of the voyage.(3) As stated in response to question 1, the present shipment does not involve plutonium in any significant measure. Nor is the term plutonium waste appropriate to describe the residue of radioactive fission products which constitute the present waste shipment.The Governments position on the shipment of plutonium was set out comprehensively at the time of the shipment in December 1992 of plutonium from Europe to Japan, including in my answer in the Senate on 11 November 1992 to Senator Reynolds Question on Notice No. 2424.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[5]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
