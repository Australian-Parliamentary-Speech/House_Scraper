I aim not a sufficiently sound constitutionalist to be able to express a definite opinion as to whether the position they have assumed is in accordance with the traditions of parliamentary government ; but it certainly seems to me to be an extraordinary one for any Ministry to take up. I know of no precedent for it, and cannot remember to have heard or read1 of anything in any way approaching the present situation, when the Government, after a recess of six months, during which they have had every opportunity not only to formulate a programme for submission to Parliament and to the country, but to consider and ascertain their position in regard to the carrying on of business, has called Parliament together, and put before it the miserable apology for a programme which this Government put into the mouth of His Excellency the Governor-General yesterday.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Prime Minister amused himself during the recess with taking up a purely negative attitude, and the position of the Government on the present occasion is quite in consonance with all that has gone before. It seems to me that there were two courses open to this Government - two courses which would have been open to any set of gentlemen occupying the Treasury benches under present conditions. They had first the opportunity to go on with the non-contentious measures which the Prime Minister has time and again outlined as the measures which the Government intended to propose this session. The adoption of such a course could have been easily understood, and the Opposition have given no indication of a lack of sympathy with such a proposal. We must all recognise that, owing to the disputes between the political parties in this Chamber, a large number of measures which are essential to the successful working of the Constitution have not yet become law. The Prime Minister has on several occasions. drawn attention to this state of things, and every member of the House has at one period or another adverted to the need of getting these measures passed. The other course open to the Government was this : If they had discovered, as the brevity of the Governor-Generals speech indicates that they had, that they were in a minority in the House, their obvious duty was to resign. If they are in a minority they should not attempt to continue to hold the reins of power, even to the extent of directing the allocation and arrangement of the electoral boundaries.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[1]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I think that must be plain on the face of it. I ask whether the urgency of the measures referred to has been in any way interfered with by the mere accidental circumstance that the Government have discovered that they no longer have a majority ? I contend that the interests of the people of Australia are just as much bound up in the passage of these necessary measures to-day as they were when the Prime Minister delivered his speech at Hawthorn. Surely the fact that the Government no longer possess a majority does not affect the necessity for these measures? Therefore, the situation, so far as they are concerned, has not become changed in the slightest degree. The Prime Minister called attention to the grave necessity for new Standing Orders, and it seems to me that he should have been just as anxious to see them brought into effect, if necessary, bv some one else as by the Government of which he is the head.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[1]/continue[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

He also then referred to the Navigation Bill, the proposal for the establishment of Federal quarantine arrangements, and a number of other measures, as urgently necessary in the interests of the people of the Commonwealth ; whereas he now considers that they should be allowed to remain in abeyance for an indefinite time - until, if he can secure his own way, he has had an opportunity to make an altogether impossible appeal to the people.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[1]/continue[10]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

He addressed the farmers, to whom he represented the enormities of Socialism, especially the kind of Socialism with which the Labour Party was associated. It is true that he made an important reservation - which would afford a means of escape in the event of his changing his opinion - to the effect that he was quite at one with those who had used the resources of the State to the fullest possible degree to advance and encourage private enterprise which would operate to the advantage of the public. That is one of those large and general statements which afford excellent means of escape to those who do not know quite how far they are going, or how far it may be necessary to retrace their steps in the future.

However, they again proceeded to work, and notwithstanding all the warnings uttered by the Prime Minister they began to ask for more and more Socialism at the hands of the State Government. Then, again, a little later in this interesting campaign, the Prime Minister went to Adelaide and warned the people there of the terrible ruin and disaster that would overtake the community if the Labour Party were not scotched - if the tiger were not killed in its younger days. The people of Adelaide were so impressed with the right honorable gentlemans remarks, and so carried away by enthusiasm in favour of his principles, that they immediately returned eleven members in favour of Socialism out of the twelve representatives of the metropolitan districts. If the Prime Minister had only gone to the country districts there is little doubt that the Socialists would have gained a still greater victory.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[1]/continue[13]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I also find that the right honorable gentleman himself dabbled in Socialism in New South Wales. In 1896, whilst he was in power as Premier, he issued, through the authority of the present Postmaster-General, a publication entitled New South Wales, the mother State of the Australias. This publication was intended for distribution at the Chicago Exhibition, and it gave an outline of the capabilities of New South Wales, of what she had accomplished, and of the occupations in which her people were engaged. It was published by the Government Printer, and issued by the present Postmaster-General. In this publication we find the authorized statement that the tobacco monopoly had assumed such proportions in New South Wales that the only position tenable was the nationalization of the industry. That statement was put forward with the direct authority of the Government, of which the Prime Minister was the head.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[1]/continue[21]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Nothing short of that will prove efficient. It is all very well to point to the efforts which have been made in the United States ; but to what have they amounted? They have failed miserably. All the acumen that the various State Legislatures and the Federal Congress in America has brought to bear has been of no avail in restraining the evil effects of these trusts. The latter have simply snapped their fingers at the laws and law makers. For two years there has been an injunction in force against the great beef trust in Chicago. What effect has it had? The trust has simply snapped its fingers at the law, and has gone upon its way rejoicing. There is no possible means of restraining these trusts unless the State is prepared, when the evil becomes apparent, to take over the industry concerned, and to run it upon business lines.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[1]/continue[37]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

During the eight years preceding January last, the members of the party in the New South Wales Legislature had a plank in their platform - plank No. 17 - providing for the nationalization of land, and the means of production, distribution, and exchange. Last January, however, they transferred the leading idea of that plank from amongst the proposals for immediate realization to the position of an objective.

And yet the people of England, through the municipalities, have been doing these things for some years. Except in regard to great monopolies, which can be better administered by the central government, the development of the socialistic ideal will certainly come through the municipal organizations, and in that way will be of greater advantage than would any proposals on a larger scale. The Prime Minister has invited the discussion of the principles of Socialism, and I should like to know from him at a later stage how far he feels the Federal Parliament could go in the direction of socialistic enterprise.

From the Federal stand-point, the High Court is not only a necessary adjunct of Parliament, but an essential feature of the whole Federal structure, and it should be the duty of the Ministry of the day, whatever its constitution may be, to do nothing to derogate from the position that that Court occupies in the public mind. I, for one, desire to say at once that I have no quarrel with the Attorney-General or with the Government because of any action which may have been considered necessary, with a view to insure economy. It was the duty of the Government to do whatever may have been necessary in that regard, and I express no opinion, in the absence of details, as to whether the action of the Attorney-General in that connexion was or was not justified. But, even if the action of the Attorney-General were justified to the fullest extent, the fact that he has dragged the High Court into a public controversy is still a matter to which we have a right to take exception.

Section n of the Judiciary Act, which was passed in 1903, says that there shall be a district registry of the High Court in every State except the State in which the principal seat of the Court is situated - that is, that there shall be a district registry in each of the five States other than Victoria. The principal seat of theCourt has been determined by proclamation in Victoria, and therefore there must be a district registry in each of the other States. Section 12 of the Act says that sittings of the High Court shall be held from time to time, as may be required, at the principal seat of the Court, and at each place at which there is a district registry. Therefore, it is as clear as it is possible to be, that Parliament laid it down in no uncertain language that the High Court was expected to go to the various States, and to bring the machinery of the law as close as possible to suitors, so that litigation might be cheapened to them.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[1]/continue[78]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

One of the main arguments put forward for the establishment of the High Court, and one which weighed with me as a citizen of New South Wales when the subject was under discussion, was that the Privy Council was distant and expensive to reach, whereas the High Court would be practically at the door of every Australian citizen, so that by appeal to it finality could be reached in the most expeditious fashion. I contend that, not only is it against the letter of the law, but distinctly opposed to the spirit which influenced the creation of the High Court, to attempt in the slightest degree to prevent the Court from going on circuit. But, while we find that it is proposed to do away with the circuits to the other States, the Prime Minister has been careful to inform the people of Sydney that there shall be no interference with the sittings of the Court there. I quite agree with the right honorable gentleman that the High Court should visit Sydney ; but his statement seemed to me not to go far enough. It is true that at the present time the great proportion of the cases brought before the Court arise in Sydney.

The use of the word concession is in itself objectionable. To put the Justices of the High Court in the position of receiving anything by way of concession is to put them in a position which I do not think they should have to occupy. It is laid down in the Judiciary Act that they shall receive certain salaries, and such expenses as may be determined by the Executive Council. The use of the word  concession  in regard to the allowance, whatever it be, and the statement that the allowance shall be subject to revision when circumstances require it, are unworthy of the Administration, and the language which has been used is such as it is improper to use in connexion with the High Court. I trust that before very long we shall have an opportunity to read the whole of the correspondence relating to this matter, when, no doubt, we shall be able to arrive at a clearer perception as to who is in the right.

It does not affect the question under discussion, so far as I am concerned, whether the High Court goes in my direction or not. I believe that we shall always have as members of the Court men who will be able to, and will feel themselves, bound to, carry out the law, and it will be our fault if the law is not as we desire it to be. I do not think that any honorable member on this side of the Chamber will dissent from the position that it is our duty, if the law requires alteration, to awaken the people to the need for the alteration, and to have it made at the earliest possible moment. There is one other matter in regard to which the Government should, in my view, have made a declaration before this, and that is the continuation of the sugar bounty. The Prime Minister went to Queensland, and travelled through a portion of the sugar districts there, making some inquiry on the subject. I give him all credit for what he did in that direction. But the peculiar circumstances of the sugar industry are such as to require that the people engaged in the industry shall know for a considerable time beforehand what its future conditions are likely to be. They have to plant their cane about eighteen months before it is ready for cutting, and the initial cost of planting is very large in proportion to the total expense in connexion with the three crops of cane which are obtained, and as in some districts more than three crops are obtained from one planting, that increases the proportional cost of the planting. From one planting the growers get three or more cuttings of cane, and consequently their expenditure in the year in which they plant is heavier than in the succeeding years during which the crop lasts. For that reason it was necessary that they should have a declaration as to the attitude of the Government in regard to the sugar bounty at an earlier date. Surely it was a fair thing for them to ask to be informed a reasonable time ahead how far they could go in preparing their land and planting their cane. I do not wish to occupy time by discussing the question whether the bounty should be continued. That may be the subject of another discussion. But, in my view, the Government have failed in their duty in not making an earlier declaration as to their attitude in regard to the sugar bounty.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[1]/continue[86]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

244,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"REID, George","F4P","N/A","N/A","N/A",41,"- That is not the question. I think that we all owe a certain duty to our positions in public life, irrespective of how we are treated by others. That is altogether an immaterial issue. The material question is this - and my honorable friends and the public must gather the meaning of the situation very soon - the Ministry feel that the time has arrived when they cannot retreat from office with honour. Somebody has asked,  Why did you not resign ? If the Ministry had resigned their offices behind Parliament after administering the affairs of Australia for six months, should we not have been justly censured for running away from our responsibilities ; and would that not have been a perfectly fair charge to level against us? What answer would I have, if with the aid of my honorable friend the Minister of Trade and Customs, and my other colleagues, I had controlled the public affairs of Australia for half a year, and had then surrendered my high position and my serious responsibilities, and run away from Parliament? Such a course would be a course of dishonour, and I am prepared to undergo any humiliation rather than submit to that. I have come here with my colleagues prepared to answer for our administration of public affairs during the period that Parliament had no control over us. That is one good answer to the suggestion which has been made by one honorable member. In the next place, is there a member of this House who has any doubt that in acting as we have done we have adopted the right course? Is there any honorable member who, under the circumstances, would have expected us to come to this House, and to proceed with the plan that we had outlined .only a few days ago, as if nothing had occurred since the delivery of my speech at Hawthorn last week. Before I say any more, I wish to thank my honorable and learned friend, the member for Ballarat, and those who have followed him, for their generous and consistent support during the last few months that we were assembled in Parliament. The strain imposed upon us at that time - even with the loyal, frank assistance and co-operation which they gave to us - perhaps nobody will ever truly appreciate. Even with that ardent and loyal support we were only in a majority of two, and the strain imposed upon the Government under those circumstances was no light one. I have also to acknowledge that on more than one occasion several honorable members of the Opposition, as well as several others who sit below the Opposition benches, showed a most generous disposition towards the Ministry in time of difficulty, by assisting to maintain a quorum for the despatch of public business. I wish, therefore, to acknowledge that during the last session we had absolutely nothing of which to complain. We were treated in the most loyal way by the honorable and learned member for Ballarat and his friends, as well as by some honorable members who are numbered amongst our strongest opponents, and I left that session with no sense of grievance. I must admit that when I took office I did hope that one or two gentlemen who were not supporting, us might possibly throw in their lot with us. I took the responsibility, with my friends, of forming the present Administration with that narrow majority, and I was prepared to continue my heavy responsibilities under those conditions. But whilst there was no doubt an understanding, which had been committed to writing, and published to the world, between the honorable and learned member for Ballarat and myself, there, is a difference, I think, between the understandings arrived at between public men and contracts between trades- men. In the case of a contract between business men, if any breach occurs, or if any failure or misunderstanding arises, there is an easy remedy obtainable in the law courts under the heading of a question of damages. But between men of honour these written agreements have really no force. If the spirit of an agreement goes out of it, the agreement is gone. The spirit of the agreement to which I refer was loyal, friendly support. Even with that we were in a desperate condition, but I might perhaps not have occupied so strange a position before the House and the country if I had had some knowledge of what was to be said at Ballarat upon Saturday night last. If I had known that the honorable and learned member for Ballarat had been in communication with his friends - if I had known upon Saturday morning that that speech was to be delivered - I might perhaps have occupied a different position. But up till that very day mv old relations of loyal, frank, cordial, friendly intercourse with the honorable and learned member continued. Upon Wednesday afternoon last week, before I left for Geelong I had the honour of a long and friendly interview _ with him. Upon the occasion that I visited Geelong I made the announcement that I was prepared, during the two or three years that I remained in public life, to sink the fight upon the Tariff-An Honorable Member. - The newspapers did not report that.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[2]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I do not propose to remain here and pass the last years of my life in the bitterness of political struggle. Every man desires te* have a few years of quietness and peace, and I said that I was prepared to devote the two or three years that I proposed to give to this painful struggle in public affairs to a cause which I thought a still greater one than that with which I had been so long associated. Presuming upon the continuance of the frank, loyal, and, I must add, delightful intercourse which I had from first to last enjoyed with the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, I looked upon his support - whether it was given to me for one month, two months, or ten months - as a great honour; and I am happy to say that there was no sort of breach or strain - personal or otherwise - between him and myself when the speech at Ballarat was delivered. The Government had framed the outlines of the ordinary vice-regal speech, in pursuance of my address to the electors at Hawthorn, which was only delivered a few nights ago. The draft of the speech to be submitted to the Governor-General was1 prepared, and the Cabinet was summoned to meet last Monday in order to settle it As my colleagues are aware, I had ready to submit to them the outlines of His Excellencys speech, which would have followed upon the lines of the address which I delivered at Hawthorn, and would have included a number of other questions to which I had not time to refer. When, however, I read the. speech, of the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, as it was reported in the public press of Australia, I felt that a situation had arisen - of course I had not then consulted my colleagues - which compelled me to seriously consider the position of the Government. Until last Monday morning I had not the remotest suspicion, or visionary conjecture, that the state of things which existed last session had been altered in the slightest possible degree.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[2]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We met in Cabinet, and we had at once to consider the situation which had arisen. We have unanimously arrived at the conclusion that the speech delivered last Saturday by the honorable and learned member for Ballarat was not that of a frank and loyal supporter of the_ Government, and that the basis of our existence as a coalition Ministry was put in a position of the gravest possible difficulty. T think that every one will admit that. I think that if my honorable friends opposite occupied our places they would have had to view the matter as we did. It was a question of resigning, of running away from Parliament, and that we felt to be degrading, humiliating, and impossible. Had we adopted that course, we should have been under the imputation that there was something that we feared to face - that there was some charge from which we had to run away. I say that these are dishonorable imputations, from which every man desires to keep free ; and we have kept free from them by meeting this House. I say frankly that in meeting the House and submitting our proposals, the significance of which nobody can overlook, we were guided by something more tangible than feelings; we were guided by the positive declaration of the honorable and learned member for Ballarat. If there were any basis of principle upon which that honorable member could have joined with my honorable friend at the head of the Opposition benches, there would seem, perhaps, a very easy solution of all these troubles by the friend and supporter of yesterday, becoming the friend and supporter, or the principal, in a new arrangement of political parties. My honorable and learned friend might have suddenly reappeared in spite of that infirmity of his health which compelled my right honorable and learned friend the Treasurer, to take his place in this coalition Government. Stricken down with illness, the right honorable gentleman was forced into this Ministry as a substitute for the honorable and learned member for Ballarat.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[2]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

He might have recollected that another old friend of a quarter of a century, and one of the leading, most honorable, and distinguished members of the Protectionist Party in Australia, was sitting in the office of the Department of Trade and Customs.

257,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"REID, George","F4P","N/A","N/A","N/A",44,"- I am sure the honorable and learned member will. I am simply stating matters as they present themselves to me, and I say that we must pay some attention to the public utterances of public . men. The public utterances of the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, during the past few months, have been clear and notorious. They have clearly denounced the labour system of parliamentary caucus, and the methods of political organization by the labour leagues outside They have pointed to the destruction of party government by these methods. They have pointed to the fact that so long as three parties existed in this Parliament its usefulness was absolutely nothing. These are public utterances. Public men may change their alliances with a change of wind, but they cannot vary their solemn declarations to the people of Australia with the same facility. In the month of January, 1904, when the honorable and learned member for Ballarat occupied the position of Prime Minister, he acknowledged in public that the position created by having three parties of almost equal strength in the House was an intolerable one. Although Prime Minister, he felt it deeply and keenly, and, taking the public into his confidence, he said that this Parliament and these three elevens could not possibly go on. It was jocularly remarked at the time that there were two  ladies  from which he might make a selection. In one sense that was true, and in another it was not. The honorable and learned member, for reasons which he has embodied in an express written understanding with myself, was not at liberty to join a labour alliance. I wish now to refer to the memorandum which was drawn up and submitted to both parties - his and mine - but which was never agreed to. Whatever the result of the memorandum was, however, it contains a statement which must remain true, as coming from the honorable and learned member and myself. That statement is as follows : -That the existence of three parties in the Federal Legislature of nearly equal strength has thrown public affairs into confusion ; makes . parliamentary government on constitutional lines impossible, and calls for some immediate remedy.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[2]/continue[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Amongst all the possibilities of political legerdemain that is one thing which could not happen, and I had a right to think so when I and my colleagues mapped out the course that we should pursue. I shall give my reasons. In the first place, the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, in his conferences with me, had arrived at this declaration, which was published to the Commonwealth -Unfortunately the party now in office - the Labour Party - quite apart from any questions relating to its programme, maintains the control of its minority by its majority -That reference was to the labour caucus.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[2]/continue[10]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

263,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"REID, George","F4P","N/A","N/A","N/A",45,"- I take the lightest word uttered by the honorable and learned member for Ballarat as being used with its whole force. When the honorable and learned member makes such a statement we accept it implicitly. I shall turn from this matter, and come to statements made by the honorable and learned member at other times. We have first of all a statement made by him on the 9th May, 1904, whilst the Watson Government was in office. Here is the statement -I am perfectly certain that a mind as clear as that of Mr. Watsons, fully recognises what has been termed the practically impossible position of parties in Parliament. It is three months since I took occasion to call attention to the matter in the most open manner that was then possible. I pointed out then that there were three parties in existence, and that if  two is company and threes none, two parties mean constitutional government and three are just about equal to none. Consequently, one of the chief considerations before Parliament and the people is the reduction of those three parties to two. My friend, Mr. Watson, is perfectly right when he said that no mere personal considerations had kept those parties hitherto apart. The differences were deeper, and it is a mistake to attempt to ignore them.No personal differences, no differences which some favouring political breeze could enable us altogether to forget in the glow of the rising sun, no differences of that kind had kept those parties apart. The honorable and learned member went on to define what he meant -I look upon the acceptance of the responsibility of the majority as the most pressing importance that awaits us, and the revival of parliamentary methods -Parliamentary methods, not caucus methods - as a matter of urgency. Moreover, I feel convinced that parliamentary methods cannot be revived unless constitutional principles are given free play. At present they are not given free play from the whole of the House, because, although they may operate upon some portions of it, they play upon an imperium in imperio, and they have to deal with Mr. Watsons party. It draws outlines without considering expedients, and with regard to which it puts everything beyond its pale, and it makes all those who are not within it against it, because they are without it, and if that policy has to be pursued, Mr. Watson will have to take his place, not upon the Treasury benches, but upon the Opposition side of the House.In this statement we have a revelation of cardinal differences of principle. It is inconceivable that the honorable and learned leader of a great party, who in the month of May, 1904, denounced the very constitution of the labour caucus, and the very constitution of the labour leagues, as false to the principles of constitutional law, as interfering with the rightful liberty which the political conscience should have in Australia - it is inconceivable that an honorable and learned member who sees these radical differences of principle and organization could be found taking his place side by side with those who persist in them. The honorable and learned member took up a proper position when the two alliances were being placed before him. His difficulty with the Labour Party was not one of want of respect for them. Nothing of the sort.  Give up your caucus, he said, in effect -  give up your methods of political organization, and I am as free, and perhaps freer, to cooperate with you than I am to co-operate . with Mr. Reid and his party. It is inconceivable to me that the Labour Party are going to oblige the honorable and learned member for Ballarat by giving up their methods and their organization. I have known my honorable friends of the Labour Party for a good many years, and I do not think that such a thing is conceivable. They are in a position of honorable obligation to others who are outside Parliament, and they will not overlook them.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[2]/continue[12]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

265,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"REID, George","F4P","N/A","N/A","N/A",45,"- I am sure that the members of the Labour Party do, and I mention the fact only to show the grounds for my attitude. If there were a rational prospect of my honorable friends opposite joining with the honorable and learned member for Ballarat and his party - I do not care how suddenly, in a new alliance-I should then say  Shuffle your cards as much as you like ; take your offices ; rake up your unions; surrender your principles to constitutional law and propriety; surrender your caucus and your leagues and come over to the Treasury benches.   But such a procedure was inconceivable to me. I did not think that the honorable and learned member for Ballarat would stoop to it, nor did I think that my honorable friends opposite would do so. That being so, I contemplated, as only one of the possibilities of the future, that my honorable friends of the opposition corner might be shown, in the light of public events, to have had a more enlightened view of the situation than had the honorable and learned member for Ballarat. They opposed us from the first. They from the first said,  No, we will not. as protectionists join Mr. Reid. They acted in a courageous and straightforward way. It seemed to me that they were putting themselves in rather a false position, but, at any rate, they did not shrink from the consequences - they took all the risks. The situation now is this, that it is the leader of the Protectionist Party who seems to be shaping a course towards returning to those who seceded from him, and that it is not the seceders who are going over to him. Why should the honorable and learned member for Ballarat have dragged his old friends into the Government for the sake of a few months of office, in order to leave them outside the pale of the great party to which they had belonged all their lives? I wish to push that point only to this extent : That, apart from the facts of this situation, I sympathize with the desire which my_ honorable friends of the Protectionist Party may have to come together again. That is a matter not for me, but for them. I have nothing to do with the question of whether they do or do not, for they owe me no responsibility. But I have no want of sympathy for the feeling which my honorable friends must have in being cut off and separated. The best that could happen was that we should return to the same state of things - the state of three parties,, and a consolidated protectionist party. That is a party that some of my honorable colleagues left, and they find themselves in a position which must be most painful to them. I do not know how any man could laugh at their situation. Have those honorable gentlemen come into that position without relying upon the support of the honorable members sitting behind them ?","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[2]/continue[13]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We joined in our opposition to their extreme Socialism. We had broad lines of agreement on those points, and we had behind us a fiscal truce, which we did not manufacture, but which the people of Australia had ordered before this Parliament met. Do not forget that. If this fiscal peace had been of our manufacture it would indeed have been a precarious foundation for us to work upon. But do not forget that the then Government went to the people and asked. Australia to proclaim a fiscal peace for this Parliament, and we all came back, and said it was proclaimed. It was on the broad and secure footing of a national mandate that I approached the honorable and learned member for Ballarat. The people had ordered a fiscal truce.

Mr. Deakin goes to Ballarat on the 2nd August, while the late Government was in power, and, after we had arrived at this agreement. What did he go to do? He went to form a National League.

My honorable and learned friend said, andAve know that he is in earnest in everything he says -I wish to submit that, by a simple series of morsels, the present Labour Party -Listen to these few words - it is the same Labour Party, not a single man has been altered since August, 1904 - the present Labour Party threatens the independence of the whole community.Is there any basis for political arrangements between the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, and people who threaten the independence of the whole community? I have yet to learn that there is. There may be - wonderful things happen in politics. However, we shall see. Here is another statement by the honorable and learned member -I say there can be nothing more derogatory to a representative or injurious to his standing in Parliament than to see a body of men required to pledge themselves to vote and act as their judgment would not direct them to.Nothing is more derogatory to a representative, or injurious to his standing in Parliament. I want now to come to another point, on which the honorable and learned member unconsciously imitated the Labour Party - or, rather, it was not, I think, the Labour Party, but one member of that party who bluntly said,  We are open to the highest bidder. I do not. say that that was a statement made by the Labour Party, but the honorable and learned member for Ballarat thus referred to art utterance of a labour man -I ask you, could a more demoralizing bargain be transacted in any public body or in any great institution.Unconsciously the honorable and learned member has put .himself before Australia in exactly the position of the labour member to whom he referred, and I shall show why. This was at a time when the honorable and learned member says that the agreement had not been broken, but when, according to him, the Tariff Commission was in perfect harmony with the spirit of the agreement, and when he approved of the agreement and the Commission. But he said that the report of the Commission might raise, and probably would raise, the fiscal question. Well, I say that in the light of that possibility, the honorable and learned member stands before Australia exactly in the shoes of the labour member, whose conduct he denounces, because he deliberately insults the free-traders of New South Wales! by offering them his support as the price of their treachery to their principles ; he says,  We will support your New South Wales leagues  - the honorable and learned member knows, those leagues were formed very much under my auspices - We will support the Australian Liberal Leagues in New South Wales, if they will put protection in the forefront of their policy.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[2]/continue[30]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The honorable and learned member for Ballarat denounces the methods, the organization, and the sectional policy of the Labour Party, as threatening to the welfare and independence of the whole community, and yet he also says,  If you will put protection in the forefront of your programme we will assist you. So, as I say, we find the honorable and learned member putting himself in the very position which he recognises in others as demoralizing - we find him offering the support of his great talents and authority, and those, I suppose, of his friends, in a political campaign of the Dugald Dalgetty kind, saying, in effect,  We will go in for either side, we do not care which, that will give us our price; we will sell ourselves. We know that the honorable and learned member holds a principle which he has fought for all his life, and it is an honorable principle on his part. But when he appeals to two parties wide as the poles asunder, and says that he is willing to fight with either, I think he puts himself very much in the position I have described. Here is another remark which makes his meaning clear -When, as in this case, you have not only the separate dangers of each piece, but the cumulative force of the whole, you will begin to recognise that it is organization-That is, the Labour Party organization - - pushed to the extreme, so as to turn the voters into dummies, to turn their representatives into pawns, and to turn their Ministers into figureheads.Here is a party the voters of which are dummies, the members of which are pawns, and the Ministers of which are figure-heads. Can we contemplate an alliance between that party and a gentleman who holds those opinions ? Of course,- it might happen, but I cannot contemplate such an event. The honorable and learned member went on to say -Instead, therefore, of taking the downward path which would lead to political servitude-That is not a mere glowing period of a poetical orator; it is the statement of a leader in political affairs, to whom thousands of people look for solid guidance, and not merely for eloquent language or beautiful peroration.Instead, therefore, of taking the downward path which would lead to political servitude, and, perhaps, to social slavery-What does that mean? We have manhood and womanhood suffrage; what does this allusion to social slavery mean? Is it not a reference to the socialistic programme ? What else can  social slavery  mean in ia country where we have manhood and womanhood suffrage, and where the political power is in the hands of the people?","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[2]/continue[34]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The honorable and learned member proceeded1 - - to rally to our flag those in favour of responsible government, to restore majority rule-Does that mean the majority rule of a few wretched, insignificant persons in Parliament, or the much larger majority rule of the electors of Australia? - and to maintain that priceless heritage-Just think ! A  priceless heritage  as well as a flag ! Something worth sticking to, that is ! You know that a flag does not cost much, but a priceless heritage we must stand by - - and to maintain that priceless heritage which our forefathers have handed down to us, and which we should preserve, or-Or coalesce with the Labour Party? Oh, no ! - or perish.There is a  flag, and there is a  priceless heritage  - there is something that we would rather die than give up. I hope it is all right, still.

By-the-bye, the honorable and! learned member for Ballarat pointed out that I had missed the psychological moment for an appeal against Socialism. Well, Ave know that there cannot be a psychological moment if there is not something real about the issue - there is no psychological moment for running after a bogy or a disembodied spirit. A psychological moment means that there is a great national question at issue, and that there is an opportunity to appeal to the people of Australia on that issue. What was that opportunity? The Arbitration Bill ? Surely, it is possible for men to differ about Socialism, and to agree about an Arbitration Bill? Surely, the principle of an Arbitration Bill is one upon which men of all political parties may agree, as they have done. What is the object of an Arbitration Bill? Is it to destroy private enterprise, or to destroy the relations between employer and employ?

But that I opposed certain clauses in it does not make me an opponent of a Bill providing for arbitration. I have made these references because of one main point which I wish the House to accept from me before I pass to another matter. We had all these public declarations of the honorable and learned member for Ballarat before us, and had to consider in Cabinet the position in the light of his remarks. An alliance on vital matters of national welfare with the party which the honorable and learned member denounced root and branch was to our minds inconceivable; when we looked at the honorable members who support the honorable and learned member such an alliance seemed equally inconceivable. That being so, what was the only political operation that could follow from the speech at Ballarat? The resolution of the House into the old state of three political parties. I admit that the speech might well draw together the members of the Protectionist Party in the House, who are divided. Unconsciously, perhaps, and it certainly would not have been a wrong thing in itself, that was probably one of the motives which influenced the honorable and learned member for Ballarat in making his speech. But the speech leaves us just as we were before. Instead of two parties, we are thrown back on three, and on that very state of things because of which the honorable member for Bland asked for a dissolution. We have three parties, pretty equally divided. That was the position to which we as a Government had to give the fullest significance. We have to consider now, as the honorable member for Bland had to consider in his time, the responsibilities of our position. My honorable friend asked for a dissolution upon a point which did not seem of very great consequence to most of us, although he evidently thought it was a serious one. I wish to say at once that my honorable friends conduct in resigning his office, or holding it, never suggested to me any offensive remarks of any kind.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[2]/continue[57]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I have noticed in Parliaments, that if a man commits the most blackguardly abuse of the rules of the House, and apologizes, he becomes almost more popular than he was before ; and if that is the treatment meted out to hardened offenders, I think that this Chamber might very well treat me with equal leniency. Having made these little mistakes, we have to rely on our general conduct ; and I think that honorable members will admit that I do not study forms of offensive expression. In any case, we had to consider our position, just as the honorable member for Bland and the honorable and learned member for Ballarat had to consider their positions. The honorable and learned member for Ballarat pointed to a condition of things which seemed to admit of no sort of hopeful prospect.

The draft of the speech was lying on my table last Monday morning, awaiting ratification by the Cabinet, to be afterwards written off, and submitted to His Excellency the Governor-General. I had had copies of the speech typewritten by my private secretary, who was acting confidentially, before Monday morning, and most of them were sent out to Ministers before 10 oclock on that day.

I accept it absolutely ; and I can say that my honorable colleagues will find the greatest possible relief at that statement. I cannot speak for them, not having consulted them, but I am sure that they will do so. I assure my honorable and learned friend that he has removed from my, mind - I do not care what happens - the sting of the situation absolutely. I do not care what happens now. I hope that my honorable friends opposite, who laugh, will excuse me. I have never, in the bitterest hours of our political controversy, when we were fighting tooth-and-nail, used an unkind word of my honorable and learned friend, the member for Ballarat. I am afraid that I could not say that about all my honorable friends. I have, from first to last, had an unstinted admiration for my honorable and learned friend, and the heat of party conflict never drew from me a single word of an offensive character. And I say that has been my spirit all through. I do not care what happens now, after that statement of the honorable and learned member. Now I will proceed to deal with other matters. And I want to say this, with reference to the form of the GovernorGenerals Speech. We felt, under the circumstances, that we had no other course to adopt. We felt that the Ballarat speech meant the reconstruction of the Protectionist Party, that that meant changing the political situation, and that that would bring us back to the irritating state of inefficiency that the House was in, notoriously, before. But now I should like to address myself to one or two of the matters that my honorable friend, the leader of the Opposition dealt with. I hope he will forgive me for having postponed my observations to this stage. I want to take up my honorable friend upon his attack upon me on the ground that knowing that the movement represented by the party opposite was a socialistic movement, I accepted their support. I did so without any idea of any kind of aiding and abetting, or of shutting my eyes to the socialistic movement; and I again repeat that that movement was never proclaimed to be a movement which the members of the labour leagues accepted as a membership qualification.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[2]/continue[66]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

All I can say is that the whole thing seems to me to have come to the forefront of the political life of this country. And I do not shut my eyes to the enormous power of the labour leagues. I am an old political campaigner ; and I know that the loyalty of their members, and the enormous strength of their organizations, gives them a marvellous power. A shower of rain would keep thousands of my friends away from the polls; but a great cyclone would not keep a loyal supporter of the Labour Party away, even if he had to walk ten miles to vote. I heard of one man who went twenty miles to vote for one of my honorable friends opposite, and walked all the way ; and he had to walk back twenty miles, though the return of his candidate was a certainty. My friends abstain from voting if a candidates return is a dead certainty ; that is the difference between us ; but we hope to wake our friends up. We do not think our opponents are in a majority, but they are a very powerful minority. Now, I want to speak a word or two with reference to the High Court. .

I would like to make another observation, and I am sure that the House will bear with me, because it deals with a matter about which there is a general misunderstanding. I have been twitted over and over again - and even my honorable and learned friend the honorable member for Ballarat fell into, as I think, the same error - with not putting a positive policy before the country. I should think that in the history of responsible government in the British Empire there never was a case in which a Government, whilst it was doing business with Parliament, and proposing to go on doing business with Parliament, issued a manifesto to the electors of the country. They are two absolutely hostile things. If a Government came forward with a Governor-Generals speech, proposing to go on with business in Parliament, say, for six months, and then issued a manifesto to the electors, it would be an appeal from Parliament to the people. It would be absolutely unprecedented.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[2]/continue[89]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

442,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"DEAKIN, Alfred","009MD","Ballaarat","N/A","N/A",58,"- Certain statements have been made in this House that should not be allowed to remain even on the pages of Hansard for five minutes without the strongest and most emphatic contradiction which it is in my power to give them. It is scarcely necessary to say that in times such as the present, when, as the Prime Minister has observed, the Ministerial majority hangs upon every member of it, the position of every one of us becomes of exceptional difficulty. On such occasions we all work under a heavier load of responsibility, and are exposed to more trials than ordinarily fall to the lot of the representatives of the people. Owing to the exigencies of the position which I occupied, I considered it my duty to take an active and prominent part in endeavouring to resolve the three parties in this House into two parties, with a view to the restoration of Constitutional Government, as I understand it, and have endeavoured from the first hour of this Parliament until now, as far as was honorably possible, to discharge the burden of obligation which rested upon me. I do not say that I have not made any mistakes; nor that I could not have acted more wisely ; but do claim to have acted on the best light I had, and without personal motive. When the Prime Minister and myself met during the tenure of office of the previous Government, I thought that we had found a means of solving the difficulty in which we found ourselves. We drew up proposals which I thought both parties might accept. They were temporary proposals. They were marked down as such from the very first, and stamped with a date as the probable date on which they were to terminate. We were creating a party to fill an interregnum - a definite interregnum ; although there was a possibility that before the period fixed had elapsed the majorities of the two parties might be blended into one - possibly with some losses on both sides, but still a majority sufficient to enable the public business to be transacted. In a new country so extensive as this, and still so subject to the operation of local and provincial influences, the task of bringing together a majority and keeping it for any lengthy period is most difficult. We do well, and have fulfilled the requirements of the situation, if we manage to keep together a majority for the term of one Parliament, and allow the Legislature to carry out its work with a proper sense of responsibility. Influenced by this motive and by no others, I proposed an arrangement mat, in spite of my recommendation, was rejected by the party to which I belong. It was distinctly laid aside by large majorities, not once only, but twice or thrice. From the outset the mainspring of majority rule was broken, and that which I had dreamt of and hoped for could not be realized. However, the Watson Government struggled on with a minority only on their own side, but with the assistance of those members of the Protectionist Party who sympathized with them. When the crisis arose, which determined the fate of that Government, I entered, as I have often said, into the consideration of the situation, without knowing that a crisis was about to arise, and before it was known that the Government would select the question then under discussion as one upon which they would stand or fall. They were perfectly within their rights in taking up that position, but I had not anticipated that they would do so. The present Government then came into office with a majority so small as scarcely to deserve the name. The Prime Minister assumed the responsibility of office with the full knowledge that he had a very slight majority, and without endeavouring to revive the previous proposal for party union, and from that day to this he has not endeavoured to call together the supporters of the Government.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The consequence was that, so far as the allegiance of honorable members who, like myself, had belonged to the previous Ministerial Party and who still belonged to the Protectionist Party, were concerned, the support given to the Government was, as the Prime Minister has recognised, free and spontaneous, without pressure or compulsion, and it was that, and that alone, that was depended upon. I am forced, much against my will, to touch upon a few personal matters, but will do so as lightly as possible. The Prime Minister commenced his speech by saying that he intended to address himself to this question without any personal bitterness. So far as his manner is concerned, he has, with one or two slight exceptions, kept to his resolution. His remarks, however, have bristled with epithets and implications which, in the hands of so practised a speaker, could scarcely have been unintentionally used, but which . have been used to drive home, by continual reiteration, the impression that I have been a traitor and a plotter, and have betrayed my old friends in the Ministry by withdrawing my support from them without giving them proper notice. The charges made bv the right honorable gentleman are gathered together in a leading article appearing in todays Argus, which contains more untruths than I have lately seen embraced in any one statement in the public press.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[3]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

446,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"DEAKIN, Alfred","009MD","N/A","N/A","N/A",60,"- I propose to make no further reference, except incidentally, to these statements, but now feel compelled to allude to a few personal matters. It is very hard, to do so without committing a breach of confidence, because the communications to which I shall have occasion to refer were of a confidential character. I  shall, however, endeavour to accomplish my task without overstepping the proper bounds. I have no hesitation, and had none, even during the time the Prime Minister was speaking, in contradicting the statement that I had dragged the right honorable member for Balaclava into the Ministry. At another stage of his speech, the Prime Minister stated that I had implored the right honorable gentleman to join the Government, and he also stated that I had forced him into the Government, after having myself refused to accept office on the score of ill-health. None of those statements are true, either in relation to the right honorable member for Balaclava, or any other member of this, or any other Government that was ever formed. I never yet advised any man to join any Government - even a Government formed by myself. I laid before my four friends who did me the honour to consult me, what seemed to me to be the pros, and cons, of the case, and in each instance said that I saw no possible objection to their joining the Ministry, but that they must take upon themselves the burden of responsibility of a choice of that kind. In the case of my friend, the right honorable member for Balaclava, I went further. He has been my friend for fifteen or twenty years, and I knew from his own lips of the warnings that he had received from his medical advisers, and I said to him not once, but half-a-dozen times,,  On this choice no one dare advise you. The warning you ha.ve received is of so serious a nature that I cannot understand any man, be he your friend or not, venturing to urge you to join a Government under the circumstances. If you do join the Government you will make a splendid sacrifice, but no word of mine shall be uttered to induce you to go one step further than you feel justified in doing. I said that I could drive home this contradiction, and shall do so. When I first saw the Prime Minister, after the announcement that the right honorable member for Balaclava had joined the Government, I said,  However did you contrive to convince a man in such a state of health to assume the responsibilities of office? He then gave me what he thought was the particular reason which had induced the right honorable member for Balaclava to, at the last .moment, change his mind. I think that the Prime Minister will recall the fact of my having expressed surprise - for I was surprised. I had anticipated nothing but an absolute refusal, because I believed that the right honorable member for Balaclava had no choice other than to refuse. I had not seen him for two or three days previously, and no one was more surprised than I was at the announcement that he had accepted office. If it had not been for the implication made in this regard, I should not have alluded to these matters, which ought to be subjects of indifference, because, although it was not owing to my persuasion, or pressure, or force, that my old colleagues and members of my party joined the present Government, they did so with my full knowledge and consent, and I feel, as I have always felt, that I am absolutely as much under an obligation, so far as they are concerned, as if they had acted at my request. I chose, and, I think, rightly, not to assume the responsibility for men making a serious choice of that kind; but whilst I desire to clear myself from the implications directed against me, shirk no tittle of the responsibility attached to the position which I occupy, and which I shall, for a few moments, ask honorable members to consider. I was, at all events, the titular leader of a party, and was on friendly relations even with those honorable members who had severed themselves from it. Under these circumstances, I felt, and have done from the first, that an extra burden of responsibility rested upon me. I ask honorable members to do me the favour and the justice of placing themselves in the position which I occupied, having regard to the principles of constitutional government, and, above all things, to Cabinet loyalty and unity. How was I to act towards the present Government in such a way as not in the least to overstep the line which ought to keep a private member outside Cabinet discussions? How was I to abstain from the least attempt to impose any policy of mine upon the Government, or to force them to go in any direction they did not choose of their own free will, except by most jealously and zealously paying respect to their Ministerial duties and responsibilities, and independence of me? I have never used any influence, either as a friend or a politician, with any one of them with respect to matters either of legislation or administration. I have kept apart from my friends in the Ministry, and have refrained from talking politics with them, because I knew that, in view of my intimacy with them, it was impossible to enter into any discussion with them without at least appearing to influence them in their deliberations. From the day that the present Government was formed until the present time I have seen less of my friends in the Ministry, and have spoken less to them, than at any previous period. This has not been due to any personal choice of mine, but merely because I felt that, in view of the relations which had existed between us, it would be impossible to discuss politics wilh them without overstepping the line which separates Ministers from those who are not responsible for the administration of public affairs. That reason alone has kept me apart from them. My feelings with regard to them have not changed, and my estimate of them has not been in any way affected. I believe they are all that I have said they are, and I have spoken frankly with regard to them. I do not think that I have so far broken any confidences, but I am now again approaching delicate ground. I have had the privilege of meeting the Prime Minister several times. He knows that, upon each of those occasions, I saw him at his own suggestion, and that he was responsible for nearly all the matters which, we discussed. It has been asked,  How is it possible for a man giving a Government a frank and loyal support to stand apart from them, and to see them make what, in his opinion, is a mistake without warning them. Only one vitally serious matter happened during the recess upon which I felt bound to speak. I did speak at once in regard to that vitally serious matter, by sending a direct message to the head of the Government, who was not then in Melbourne, informing him that upon that question - even if it involved the fate of the Ministry - I must be considered as adhering to the principles which I had always expressed. The only other matter to which the Prime Minister has alluded, and upon which he thinks I ought to have spoken, has reference to the Arbitration Bill, and to the fact that it was not laid aside. Unfortunately, the right honorable gentleman lias not done me the favour of reading the full report of the remarks which I made at Ballarat. Indeed, I do not know from what report he quoted, but he has entirely misconstrued the nature of my reference to that matter. I have noticed - as adi must have done - that in addressing the leagues throughout the country in reference to anti-Socialism, the Prime Minister has, again and again, referred to industrial matters - to preference to unionists, and to a variety of other subjects which were dealt with in the Arbitration Act. Having that in mind, and desiring to draw a distinction at the time between the right honorable gentlemans views and my own, I explained that I had voted for granting preference to unionists, and for other provisions in that Act which he had opposed. But I stated that if the Prime Minister wished to conduct his crusade against Socialism, or State Socialism, having regard to his attacks upon those provisions which he had described as dangerous","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[3]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Those two subjects may satisfy us sufficiently, because they cover practically the whole of the speech, and because they constitute the only two points which have been challenged. The first relates to my criticism of the anti-socialistic movement. The Prime Minister will recollect - as I have previously said - that when it was proposed to establish these leagues, I objected from the very outset that a mere general anti-socialistic crusade would not succeed, and that I could take no part in it unless a definite programme was put forward. WhenI went to Ballarat, therefore, and made that the text of the first part of the whole of my speech, it came as no shock ..or surprise to any member of the Government, or to any person in Victoria who watches politics. I have taken up the same position from the first. The Ministry knew it - they were perfectly well aware of it. When, therefore, I devoted half my speech to that question, I was speaking of something upon which the Government knew my views better than did anybody else in the community. Then the Prime Minister will recollect that as the result of an interview which -I had with him. he suggested that I should see my old friend and colleague, Sir George Turner. I did so, and during the greater portion of the consultation I had the advantage of the presence of the Minister of Defence.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[3]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Prime Minister will remember that some months ago I pointed out to him that while his majority stood as it did, and there was no apparent danger ahead, yet the first time that the fiscal question was introduced, into the House he must look forward to seeing his majority grievously imperilled. I think that the right honorable gentleman agreed with me. At all events, I took the responsibility of warning him most seriously. X thought that the prospect of any such question arising during the present session was rather remote. I realized that any recommendation of the Tariff Commission might bring it forward, but, so far as one can judge from the press reports* no such proposal is in immediate contemplation. However, I took time by the forelock, and it is now two or three months since in that spirit of frank and loya] support to which the Prime Minister lias so frequently referred to-night, but always to point out what appeared to be shortcomings, I took the liberty of cautioning him. Directly I saw this fiscal danger on the horizon, the first living person to whom I spoke on the subject was the head of the Government.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[3]/continue[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

When, at the Prime Ministers suggestion, I saw my colleagues, I took the liberty incidentally of letting them know how my mind was exercised in that regard. I let them know that I looked forward with the greatest apprehension to the emergence of the fiscal issue in a party fashion. I saw - indeed, everybody must see - that it is quite possible that the first report by the Tariff Commission may not raise the fiscal issue. I said so two or three times in my Ballarat speech. But as soon as it dawned upon my mind that there was a possibility that that Commission might make a report some lime during the present session - and I may say that I have had no communication with any member of it - I at once laid my apprehension before the Prime Minister, and before two of my old colleagues. That constitutes the second part of the Ballarat speech.

467,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"DEAKIN, Alfred","009MD","N/A","N/A","N/A",63,"- When honorable members hear of  plots, conspiracies, and reticences, it is only fair I should say that the first person to whom I spoke on the two subjects nearest to my thought - the question of Socialism and anti- Socialism upon the one side, and that of fiscal war or fiscal peace upon the other - was the Prime Minister. Directly they crossed my mind. I communicated them, as a frank and loyal supporter, to the head of the Government. What more could I have done? It was only afterwards that the communications about which I spoke, and which have been curiously interpreted, were exchanged. My attention had been, partly drawn to these dangers of the future by letters from all parts of the Commonwealth. All who have been in politics for a few years know that we are accustomed to receive a miscellaneous mass of correspondence. There are gentlemen in various parts of the country who favour us with advice, criticism, and suggestions. Some of them are members of this Parliament, others are members of State Parliaments,, and others again are important persons who are interested in politics. From that time forward these communications kept raining down upon me, and they all sounded a note of apprehension. I replied as best I could by asking questions, and by requesting further opinions. A few wrote to me with reference to the dispute with the Justices of the High Court. But the protectionists in Queensland, Western Australia, New South Wales, and Tasmania were writing to me apprehensively as to what was to be the future so far as protection was concerned. I replied, stating, my own opinion, and inviting more opinions from my correspondents, and from fellow members of Parliament. I received their replies. Practically none of them raised the question by suggesting anything, approaching a party move against the Government. The communications did not relate to tactics, or to procedure in the House, but with scarcely an exception they related to the time when the fiscal issue must re-emerge, because the Tariff Commission must sooner or later report. This was the subject of the correspondence. If I were standing at the bar of judgment For my utterances at Ballarat, and elsewhere, I could summon witness after witness from this House, and outside of it. I should be able to call, more particularly my old colleague, the right honorable member for Swan, with whom I was in Western Australia six weeks ago, and who, in view of the fact that he was being urged to return into local politics, impressed upon me the necessity of my opening my whole mind to him as to the political future of the Commonwealth. He knows what was in my mind. The honorable member for Eden-Monaro, who happened to be in Western Australia at the same time, was also aware of it. I put before them everything I knew about the political situation, and of its future. They well know whether there was ai hostile, treacherous, surreptitious thought in my mind in regard either to this or any other Government. I had reasons for speaking with special frankness to my right honorable friend, because of the possibility of his leaving Federal politics - and his retirement from Federal politics would be a distinct loss to the Commonwealth - to return to the politics of his State. In these circumstances, he saw into my mind and thought as no one else was entitled to do, and as perhaps no one else did. I concealed nothing. The fact that he sits with me today, and approves of everything I have done, and of every word I have uttered, shows that he knows that a party political trick, or a Ministerial surprise, was the last thing in my mind. I do not pretend that I went to Ballarat having nothing to say, or that I did not take my place on that platform without the gravest sense of responsibility. I had been appealed to, as no doubt many other honorable members have been, by persons in all parts of the Commonwealth, in whose political creed protection is the chief article, whatever their opinions may be on other matters. I went to Ballarat because they were pointing out, and I could not deny it, that the Prime Minister was speaking of a dissolution, and of a limitation of the subjects to be decided by that dissolution - to the question of anti- Socialism, whatever it meant, as against Socialism, whatever that might mean. We know that every man has a different definition of them. These men are quite as expert, or even more expert politicians than many. Some of them are journalists holding important positions in other States, watching every event with a keen eye. They were alarmed, and, as it seemed to me, the Protectionist Party throughout the Commonwealth, so far as I could get in touch with it, was alarmed at this prospect. They said, in effect,  The Prime Minister at every meeting which he addresses refers to a dissolution, and to the policy that is then to be submitted. But never by any chance does he allude to the fiscal question. He does not say that the policy to be submitted is going to be that of free-trade or of protection; he absolutely closes the door upon the fiscal issue. Are we to understand that you are going to be a party to a dissolution in which the issue of protection will be sunk, no matter what the Tariff Commission may have advised, or may. hereafter advise Parliament to do? Are you going to join in the election of a Parliament that must for three years close its doors to the reports of the Tariff Commission ? If you are, you might as well seal up its reports, and lock them in the vaults of the House for that time. What is the position going to be if the Prime Minister sends you to the country, and sends you soon?","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[3]/continue[12]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

No one ever proposed or thought of such a delay as that. No one ever contemplated that, after appointing a Tariff Commission, charged with the responsibility of inquiry, investigation, and report, the Government were to adopt a course that would mean that until 1909 the fiscal question must not, should not, and could not be raised. Such a position is impossible. As soon as I had seen that the fiscal issue was becoming imminent - that the creation of the Tariff Commission had set in motion another set of causes - I felt that it was time to speak. The Commission was appointed in good faith, and honestly. I have never questioned that; but it could not have been so appointed if its reports were to be of no value for three years. The Commission was not informed that it would be so hampered. If that had been the intention, the Commission should have been charged to report on or after such and such a date. But they were appointed with power to present sectional reports, and I thought it was agreed on all sides1 of the House that special cases would probably be dealt with first, and could be dealt with as the House thought fit.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[3]/continue[14]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In any event, I. hope that Ministers will approach this question with a broad view, and with open minds considering the national interests at stake, and without attempting to make a fiscal issue on matters in which that question is really only a subordinate consideration.There I was, loyally and faithfully supporting the Government, pleading with them, in the event of this contingency, not to put themselves in a position of hostility to the House, or which would imperil them in any way. I was not looking forward with delight to the raising of the fiscal issue as a means to attack the Ministry against which I am supposed to have been secretly plotting. I was pleading with them, if the opportunity arose during the session, to look at the question, not from the point of view of dry-as-dust theorists, but in a business light, and, if it were possible, to deal with the recommendations made, not on the lines of fiscal war, but as a business proposition for the protection of Australian interests. I , pleaded with the Government to take a broad view of the situation, and not to put themselves in a position of hostility to those of their supporters whose principles and whose past commits them, if it commits them to anything, to protect protection, to protect Australian industries.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[3]/continue[15]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I had intended to speak about a fortnight earlier, but could not get the , hall except for a Friday or Saturday night in that week, and was determined that there should be no further delay. I wished to take the earliest opportunity to answer the appeals that I had received from all parts of the Commonwealth.

I referred to the business programme of the Government, and to the valuable practical Bills as being part of our own. If Ministers did me the honour to read my speech, they saw, so far as the programme for this session was concerned, I was in sympathy with them, as I hope the whole House is, in their desire to deal with certain practical and non-contentions legislation. Of what was I speaking beyond this ? Of the time when the House was to be dissolved, and questions submitted to the country. Why was I obliged to speak of this subject? Because the Prime Minister, at each of his meetings, had put a dissolution in the forefront of hie programme. He had alarmed the Protectionist Party and other parties, probably all over Australia.

483,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"DEAKIN, Alfred","009MD","N/A","N/A","N/A",65,"- I have addressed myself to-night to the Address-in-Reply almost without preparation, and fear that I may not altogether preserve the consecutive order of my remarks ; but taking my pencil notes of the speech of the Prime Minister, I have dealt, so far as my memory can check them, with the principal allegations which he made either directly or by inuendo. The fact that for some time this year a number of us did not make an appearance upon the public platform has been commented upon, and certainly my silence was not unfriendly to the Government. Except in the one instance I mentioned, I do not claim to have suppressed myself or my opinions unduly ; but I certainly have waited patiently for the matter relating to the High Court, about which I feel very strongly, to unravel itself and become clear from the accessory matters attached to it. However much we feel that the question of expenses is one for proper examination by this House above all others, I think we realize that the discussion in regard to it should not have taken place in public, and should not now be pressed upon the public more than is absolutely necessary. To bring disputes of that kind upon even the floor of this House is most undesirable, and certainly they have no place, or should have no place, in the press when Parliament is not sitting. Until the papers are laid upon the table, I propose to refrain from dealing with that question ; although, having been responsible for the Federal principle upon which that Court was launched administratively in the first instance, I naturally take the deepest interest in seeing that those principles are preserved. My chief reply to the indictment of the Prime Minister is that at Ballarat I dealt with two subjects, on both of which I had previously indicated my sentiments in brief, but very emphatically - and not in brief, having regard to the length of our interviews - and more than once to the right honorable gentleman himself. When, therefore, I went to my constituents, it was to say aloud what I had been saying to him in private, because it appeared that a certain responsibility rested upon myself and others in this regard. We had to make it quite plain by public announcement what our course must inevitably be, providing a sudden dissolution took place. The Prime Minister was very frequent in his appeals to my four colleagues and my sentiments for them. I had to remember that my four colleagues after all do not include the head of the Government, and those who know the right honorable gentleman and his reputation for astuteness and strategical ability, and who realize the powers which a Prime Minister has even bv contrast with the whole of his colleagues, will feel that in the matter of a dissolution, the choice rests far more with him than with all the rest of his Government. There may arise, even in the first days of a session, in any circumstances, contingencies in which, if he pleases to take advantage of them to make it appear, if it were not really so - though it might not really be so - that the House was no longer respondent to the Government lead he can cut short its existence. We had, therefore, to face the possibility of a sudden dissolution - a dissolution without warning, a dissolution arising out of some contretemps in this House of a more or less unexpected character, after which we would be required to face the country, with our party divided in this House, and uncertain, without it, as to the course to be pursued and the questions to be submitted to the electors. On reflection, it appears to me, therefore, that in speaking as I did, and with the frankness which I certainly employed, I did no more than discharge an obligation which I owed to mv constituents first, and to those of the same opinion throughout the Commonwealth in the second place. It would have been too late for me, on such an event having happened, to have turned to them in the haste and turmoil of an election on some new issue, brought about perhaps at twenty-four hours notice, and said to Ministers,  Now this dissolution has occurred, it is perfectly certain that, owing to the appointment of the Tariff Commission, the electors will expect from candidates a clear statement as to their intentions in regard to its recommendations. It would have been too late for me to have said to Ministers,  You ought to nave realized that we were earnestly and sincerely anxious to maintain the fiscal peace which we promised to our constituents; that we desired to see the question when it was again submitted to you, buttressed by the facts elucidated and classified by the Tariff Commission; the particular industries needing protecting singled out, their circumstances detailed, and the competition to which they were exposed, and its nature, plainly stated, so that with the whole of the facts before us - let us hope irrefutable facts, incontestable facts, proved before the Tariff Commission - the country could be invited to express, through the constituencies, a definite opinion on the proposals which would be brought forward by the whole or by a part of that body. It would have been too late for me, I say, and for most of us, to have endeavoured in the circumstances of a sudden dissolution, to reach the people throughout this vast Commonwealth, and to have assured them that we had not been blind to the trust reposed in us, and to the responsibilities which rested upon our shoulders. Yet Ministers complain because I give them in public the warning I had given them in private, because it was due to the public too. At Ballarat I said no word which had a personal bearing. The one question on which I might have come into direct conflict with the Government, that of the High Court, not only was passed over, though on my notes, in consequence of my continual interruption and my physical weakness, but when I gave it to the press next morning, it was only a matter of three or four lines, to safeguard myself ; on my notes I had proposed to deal with it at considerably greater length than that. I commented upon the silence of the Prime Minister in regard to the clauses which he proposes to substitute for the two sections - and the only two, so far as I know - in the legislation of the Barton Government, that he has indicated his intention to challenge. Beyond these instances, and my regret at Sir George Turners retirement, I do not at the moment recollect anything approaching a personal reference in that address. Practically the whole of it was taken up by a statement of the anti-socialistic position, then of the socialistic position, a criticism of both! positions from my own stand-point, showing their unsatisfactoriness, and then, so far as time permitted, a statement of my own views as to what are termed the proposals of State Socialism. In these matters I tried to be, and think I was, as frank with my constituents last week, as I have been on previous occasions when visiting them. The right honorable gentleman has quoted from criticisms which I offered. Of course, if he chose to do so, it was perfectly within his brief. I make no complaint of it. I have neither unsaid anything which I then said, by way of criticism, nor altered the motives which led me to make those criticisms. I have made them in this House before and since. My opinions on that matter are not secret. They ought not to be, and they are not, and those whom I have criticised have responded to those criticisms in private, with more or less agreement or disagreement, but always with a recognition that what I did say was said in the open, that I had not made any concealment about it. Neither in regard to them nor any party in the House, did I endeavour to give by subterranean means what I thought, and still think, ought to be a challenge in the open. Passing by that speech as perhaps having no further relevance to this House, if it had not been made the subject of a most extraordinary Ministerial volteface, I have to ask myself what I am to learn of my duties as a frank and loyal supporter of this Government from the treatment I have received in consequence of my daring to go to my constituents to discuss public questions of the day in a perfectly frank and. personally friendly way. I ask whether, when I took part in any arrangement, written or verbal, considering either its spirit or its letter, I had parted with the right of free speech either in this House or out of it? If I had a direct challenge to give to the Government, I should have been justified in giving it.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[3]/continue[19]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If I had gone to Ballarat without notice to the Government, and had challenged them there directly for their action or inaction, I should have been open to the reproach which I think would rest upon any member of this House, who, without warning or notification to another member, makes a prolonged and bitter personal attack upon him. I think that if I were to say that the Prime Minister had made upon me to-night an uncalled-for, prolonged, and bitter attack, without notice, I should not be saying more than what is actually the effect and substance of the remarks which the right honorable gentleman has made. But I make no complaint, because he chooses to challenge me in an indefensible manner which has invited and compelled me to deal with a variety of personal questions which I should rather have left untouched. I make no complaint at all. I think that he might well have refrained from complaint as to a speech which, right from its first word to the last, contained no personal reflection on himself or any of his colleagues, and only safeguarded myself in the one matter of the High Court. As a matter of fact, I had proposed to speak of certain of the Ministers, and in terms of commendation ; but it occurred to me that an implied reflection might be assumed on any Minister omitted, especially if those whom I singled out for approbation happened to belong to the side of the Cabinet which is closer to myself. It might have led to misapprehension. At all events, it would be departing from the important idea of Cabinet solidarity. I, therefore, struck out of my notes all personal references to Ministers. What did I put before the country ? I put no proposal of my own in substitution for any proposal of the Government. I put no case which depended upon my own powers of argument from my own principles. What I did put were the indisputable facts of the situation - the Prime Ministers continuous references to a dissolution, the closeness of the numbers in this House, the probability that a dissolution might occur, the one question proposed to be submitted by the Prime Minister to the country at any dissolution, the defects of the question as proposed by him, the omission by him to notice the other question which must arise either before or after the Tariff Commission reports, and the importance of that question to the country, and particularly to those with whom I am associated. The fact is that if every member of this and the other Chamber pledged himself not to mention the fiscal question on the platform in the event of an early dissolution, it would not avail in the face of the equally indisputable fact that every candidate would be challenged in every constituency, and upon every platform, as to what course he would take when the Tariff Commission made its recommendations.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[3]/continue[20]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Just in the same way with the Labour Party. It is no insult to a party which contains both free-traders and protectionists to say that if they hope for support, they must put protection in their programme. That is no insult to the Labour Party, which includes members of both fiscal faiths. I was quite fair to both parties - the only recognised bodies in the field to whom I alluded - when I pointed out that as protectionists we had to look to the forthcoming election - that there was a question which must be put, which we could not prevent being put, and which ought to be put, namely, the question of the fiscal policy of the country. We cannot prevent that. The Tariff Commission has been appointed - the deed done cannot be undone, and the consequences cannot be destroyed.

My honorable and learned friend also knows that when Federation was brought about, I had no desire to join the Federal Parliament. He had very little desire to join it himself, either. But he took the view that as he and I had joined in advising the people of Victoria to give their assent to the bargain, we were bound to take a part in the early parliamentary work. Then, when the change of government took place, he knows well that I desired to be relieved from office; and he pressed me so strongly then, and put it that it would be such an advantage to the Commonwealth that I should remain, that I did remain with him. Afterwards, our Government went out. As honorable members . know, at that time I was not in a good state of health. For years past I had been in misery. I have sat in this Chamber conducting the affairs of the State of Victoria, when I hardly knew what I was doing. I broke down my health in trying to fight against the bad times - during a period when we were nearly on the rocks ; and mv desire has always been - though I have been charged with clinging to office - my desire has always been to retire from political life at the first possible opportunity. I have made no secret of that. Unfortunately, I have to do it now, because I cannot take that active part which, as a prominent man, I should take. Since I find that I cannot do what I ought to do, I feel that I am bound to make way for some one else who will be more competent than I can be.

At that time I let him know that I had no intention to take any part in any new Government that might be formed, and he also felt very strongly upon the same lines.

I have taken no part in the socialistic or anti-socialistic campaign up to the present time. When the right honorable gentleman at the head of the Government came to me after the vote adverse to the late Government Was carried and desired that I should join with him in a new Government, I said that I could not see my way to do so. But, on the other hand, he again pointed out how  unfairly he Would be treated in the matter if .we refused to join him. He said that he would be perfectly prepared to carry out the bargain which was made with regard to the equal re. presentation of parties in the Cabinet, but, nevertheless, I did not see my way to join, and I said that I would see my leader, the honorable and learned member for Ballarat. I did see mv leader, as naturally I should have done. Does any one suppose that I, recognising the honorable and learned member as my leader, was going to do anything of this kind without his1 consent and approbation? Utterly impossible ! I would not give an answer to the Prime Minister until I had. consulted my leader and had put to him the position which had been put to me, with regard to unfair treatment in bringing the Prime Minister into a consultation, agreeing to terms, and then leaving him  on his own  - altogether in the lurch. I have begged and prayed the honorable and learned member, time after time, to take what I considered to be his proper position, and to work in the Government, but he absolutely declined, and urged :upon me that I ought to join, as it would give the Government a better position in the country, and as he thought that I could do good work. He said, There can be only one objection; the only question is whether your health will allow you to join. If your health will allow you to do so, you will be doing the right thing in joining. After that I did join, but I refused to take the position of second in command, because I felt that I should break down if I attempted to carry out the work attaching to that position. That is how I came to join this Government; and I say, unhesitatingly, that I only did so because it met with the approval and approbation of my leader, and on his repeated assurance that he thought that he could do more good supporting the Government than as a member of that Government, and that during the time for which we had entered into the bargain, he would give us loyal and hearty support, and I expected to receive from him that kind of support which I received when I was conducting the affairs of Victoria.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[4]/continue[13]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I found certain statements made -Since returning from Western Australia, and giving my best thought to the circumstances of the time, it seemed wise to put myself in touch with those of our friends throughout . the Commonwealth who were of the same way of political thinking, and it has been due to that, and that alone, that my address has been postponed until to-night - not on any ground of tactics, because I think that, from a party point of view the sooner I could have addressed myself to this question the better, but because, as a matter of fact, it has only just been possible for me, having regard to the manner in which public men are scattered during the recess, to avail myself of the assistance of my friends in the various States.I considered that I was one of his friends and I thought that under the circumstances I should have been one of his most trusted friends. I was close at hand, and I had not been consulted in any shape or form. I defy any impartial man to draw any other conclusion from the reading of his speech, than that the honorable and learned gentleman had been voluntarily putting himself in communication not alone with honorable members on this side of the House, but with my protectionist friends in the corner on the other side, and that they had been corresponding for some time with regard to the step he ought to take. The only step that could have been taken was one that would unite the Protectionist Party in this House. Reading that passage in the speech, and also his reference to the fact that the appointment of the Royal Commission made it absolutely necessary that the question of the Tariff should be taken up, I remembered that when I intimated that the Government were going to appoint the Royal Commission, I, in answer to an interjection, had said as plainly as words could, say that under no circumstances would I be a party to any dealing with the Tariff by this House until its members had been to the country and obtained relief from the promises they had made. I knew my own case. I knew that for years I had held for the Protectionist Party, little as they thank me, a practically free-trade seat. I knew that if I had told the electors of Balaclava the last time I stood for election that I was going to rip up the whole Tariff the probabilities Were that there would have been opposition to me. We, as a Protectionist Party, did not go to the country on the question of re-opening the Tariff. We acted for good and sufficient reasons. We knew, or thought we knew, what we were doing, and I was astounded afterwards when I found members of that party coming forward and saying that we were going to re-open this question. I knew the constituency I represented, and I felt that I would be false to the pledges I had made to the electors if I had attempted to deal with the Tariff issue until I had appealed to them, and got a mandate as to the position I was to occupy. The honorable and learned member must have known that, so far as I was concerned, I was not going to take any step with regard to dealing with the Tariff. Surely he ought to have had sufficient confidence in me to feel that I would not !","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[4]/continue[18]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I should not have allowed anything of that kind to be done, nor would any of my protectionist colleagues, even if the free-trade part of the Cabinet had tried to do it. which I do not think they would. We should not have allowed the Tariff to be reopened. From the reading of the Ballarat speech I could come to no other conclusion than that which I have mentioned. If this amendment brings success and leaves two or three of us sitting with the freetraders the fault will not be ours. I have no objection to see the Protectionist Party re-united. If that can be brought about, let it be done. I, with my protectionist colleagues, was induced to enter into this coalition for the purpose of carrying on non-contentious work, and the action which is now being taken in consequence of the speech of my honorable and learned friend at Ballarat places us in an absolutely false position. If any reuniting was to take place, surely we ought to have had an opportunity of saying to our colleagues :  A change has taken place. The party has come together again. We think now that the time has come when you must allow us to leave.

No man is better capable of persuading any one to do anything. Many a time he has sat in the Ministerial corner, and has by means of one  magnetic look persuaded me to give way. I venture to say that the public will come to the conclusion that if he had desired to deal magnanimously with the Government which he had placed upon the Treasury bench - a Government which he now says has misread his speech - he would never have moved his amendment. He would have said at once,  I see now that you were stupid. You made a mistake. I am perfectly satisfied that if you had understood my speech, you would not have acted as you have, and I am not going to help your political foes to put you out of office. He does not, however, say that, but he still persists in his amendment. Can he suppose for a moment that with a threat of that kind hanging over us, we can do anything? Would he do so? No; he would say,  Deal with that amendment, and when you have done so, we shall know the explanation of it, and shall be prepared to do what is right. If he were still friendly, he would have no right to move the amendment; but he has done so, and we are perfectly prepared to take the consequences. If he is to be the head of a new Government, I shall wish him every success. I trust that he will have a united party behind him. I hope that ha will not form a coalition - I do not believe in coalitions. A coalition is justifiable only when the circumstances are such that the public business cannot be carried on without it. That was the reason why the present coalition was formed. It was thought - my honorable and learned friend was the first to express that view - that with the three parties in the House, no work could be done. We were attending here month after month and drawing our salaries, but doing no work for the country. There was an immense amount of good and useful legislation that could have been dealt with before we should, in the ordinary course, have gone to the country, and it was suggested that we should combine to do that work, which would be of immense advantage to the commercial community throughout the Commonwealth. The work was of a non-party character, and would be attended with great public advantage, and we all agreed to adopt that course. Now, the hand that made us is the hand to break us. I am not going to quarrel with my honorable and learned friend.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[4]/continue[37]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Under ordinary circumstances - if the slight misunderstanding that has been made so much of, and that appears to be considered sufficient to justify the ejection of the Government from office, had not arisen - the Government would have put forward in the GovernorGenerals speech, fifteen or twenty useful measures which would have been strongly supported by honorable members opposite, and would have been for the benefit of the country. Whatever Government may come into power will bring forward these measures. I do not believe that this Parliament will discuss the Tariff question. There are very few industries of any magnitude that can be dealt with separately. The moment you attempt to touch one industry you will find that others will be affected. We know that every protectionist wants the highest possible duty imposed upon the goods he manufactures; but that when . any one else is producing the goods he requires, he desires them to be admitted free. We know that woollen goods could not be dealt with unless consideration was at the same time paid to the made-up articles of which they constitute the raw material. In my view, there is only one item with which this Parliament could deal. We are told that we shall have an opportunity of revising the spirit duties, but, judging from my experience, I do not think that when they come before the- House they will receive very much consideration. I feel very sore with regard to this particular question. I felt very sore indeed, when I thought that my\ honorable and learned friend had broken away from us, and that whilst we, backed up by a majority of the party, were honestly doing what we considered was in the best interest of the protectionist cause, our recognised leader without giving us any notice, was in consultation with those who had severed themselves from us with a view to uniting the party. That was how I read the speech delivered by the honorable and learned member. I had no desire to construe it adversely to Him. Judging from the cheers with which the amendment has been greeted, there is no doubt that it will be carried. Some of my honorable friends opposite will be glad to support it. Let me hope that the day will not come when some of them will be sorry that it was ever proposed.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[4]/continue[39]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If there is to be a mere reshuffling of the cards. I think that the people whom we represent will form their own opinions with regard to the matter, and perhaps they will be very strong opinions.

I can indorse every word that was uttered by my right honorable colleague, the Treasurer. He has pretty well explained my own position. When I was asked to join the Government by the Prime Minister, I told him that I could give him no answer until I had seen my honorable friend and leader, the honorable and learned member for Ballarat. Two or three days later, I called upon that gentleman in his room. I again pressed him to join the Government, and told him that I should be glad to support him. He informed me that he could not accept a portfolio, but that , he believed he could assist the Government more by sitting behind it than by becoming a member of it. If any person had told me then - even if he had been my dearest friend - that the honorable and learned member, whom I have known, and with whom I have been upon friendly terms during the past quarter of a century, or more, merely intended that I should occupy the position of a stop-gap until he was prepared to form a Ministry, I should have told him that it was false, and that the honorable and learned member was incapable of doing anything of the kind. I must confess, however, that when I saw the report of his speech at Ballarat, I could not - even with every desire to place the most favorable construction upon it - put any interpretation upon his words other than that for some unexplained reason he had withdrawn his support from the Government. So far as I am aware, the Ministry have not departed to the extent of a hairs breadth from the honorable understanding which was entered into between the honorable and learned member for Ballarat and the Prime Minister. We acted up to it in every possible way, and 1 think it is only fair to the Prime Minister to say that he has never upon any occasion sought to take any advantage of the fact that the free-traders predominated amongst the Government supporters. On the contrary, whenever there has been any little advantage to be given to one side or the other it has always been given to the protectionist members of the Government. Even in the case of the Tariff Commission, the chairmanship was given to a protectionist, notwithstanding the fact that there were a larger number of free-traders sitting behind the Ministry. Upon every possible occasion the Prime Minister has honorably adhered to the bargain which he made with the honorable and learned member for Ballarat. During my public career - and it has been a fairly long one - I have never occupied any position which was so painful to me as is my present position. I could not have believed that my old friend, whom I have trusted, and would have trusted with anything under the sun, could have so treated the protectionist members of this Government. It is only fair I should say that ; his explanation this evening has taken away a great deal of the sting of the remarks which he made at Ballarat.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Consequently, I fail to understand how he can feign surprise that we should regard it as a hostile deliverance. I am perfectly sure that no intelligent person could put any other construction upon it. I have not met a single individual who has not placed the same interpretation upon it that we did. It appeared to me, therefore, that there was only one honorable course for the Government to adopt, and that was, not to attempt to cling to office after we had forfeited the confidence of the friends who had placed us there. I am sure that no supporter of the Government would have desired us to do anything of that kind. It would have been most humiliating. We took the only straightforward1, honorable, and manly course which could be adopted. I join with the Treasurer in hoping that when the honorable and learned member for Ballarat forms his Government, it will be for the well-being of Australia. I regret very much that he has placed me in the position that, although I should like to be following and supporting him, he has denied me the opportunity of so doing. He has placed his old friends in the most painful position ; it is one which estranges his friends of a quarter of a centurys standing. I sincerely hope that he does not view the matter in the light that it presents itself to my mind. I had no wish to address the House this evening. When interviewed regarding the honorable and learned members speech at Ballarat, I refused to say a word to the newspaper representatives. I told them that I. would make no comment upon it. In spite of what I had read, and despite the construction which I placed upon that address, I did hope that the explanation of the honorable and learned member would go further than it did this evening. I accepted his explanation in good faith ; but when I saw him pull a motion of no-confidence out of his pocket - a motion which had been prepared beforehand - I must confess that his action was more than I expected from him. I have said harder things than I intended, for when I rose I was determined hot to say a harsh word of the honorable and learned member. I think now that the sooner we come to a division the better. We all know that the amendment is going to be carried, and I am perfectly sure that no one will accuse us of trying to cling to office when we find that we can no longer retain our positions with advantage to the country. I hope that our successors will be in a better position to do so, and my only wish is that they will govern with credit to themselves and with advantage to the country.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[5]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I have long known the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, and wish to put one or two considerations to him. I must say that when I perused the reports of his Ballarat speech, I had to agree with the statements contained in the two leading newspapers in reference to it. On the morning of its publication, I met some friends - and the honorable and learned member knows that I have a few - but I did not encounter one who failed to say,  The Reid Government must go, for Deakin has spoken. That was the general opinion. I am appealing to the honorable arid learned member for Ballarat as one with whom I have had differences, but who, I feel confident, will not refuse to deal generously with the three protectionists in the present Ministry, who are, so to speak, marooned by his action. I am sure the honorable and learned member will agree with me that in loyalty to their present leader they will have to vote with him when the division takes place; but that that fact should never be mentioned outside this House as showing that they voted against the policy of protection. I wish the honorable and learned member to say that the votes of these three honorable gentlemen on the approaching division will never be taken as a vote against protection.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

667,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MALONEY, William","KLM","N/A","N/A","N/A",83,"- I am very glad to have the honorable and learned members assurance on that point. I was delighted to hear the speech delivered by the Prime Minister. It was a good fighting speech, and I may say that I regret that the rift between the Labour Party in New South Wales and the Prime Minister ever took place. I have found him a generous! and kindly man, and have never brought a wrong before him during his terni of office that has not received his attention. I trust that the declaration made this evening by my old friend, the right honorable member for Balaclava, who entered the Victorian Parliament with me, that the speech which he was then delivering would probably be his last in this Parliament, will not prove true. I trust to hear him again and again, and to see him fighting once more, although perhaps on this side of the House. My hope is that his health will be such that he will remain a member of the Parliament at all events to the end of his term. The right honorable gentleman knows very well that if he will adhere strictly to the real protectionist policy he will have my vote, and perhaps that of every member of the Labour Party, when a question of the platform is concerned; but he will pardon me for saying that he should not speak of that of which he knows very little - the inner working of the Labour Party. If he were with us, and saw how justly the proceedings of the party are conducted, I am sure he would not use such expressions as those which, to my regret, he uttered this evening, when dealing with) the party. I hope that he will come into closer communion with us. When I first entered the Victorian Parliament there was no such body as a Labour Party in Australia; but the right honorable gentleman knows1 that the Labour Party which was formed in Victoria was the only one in the House that had a platform with which every one was familiar. There was no attempt to conceal the designs of our party. The planks in our platform were as open and as free to all as were the ten commandments, and no one could say that they were based on a wrong foundation, cr designed to work injustice to any class or party. The right honorable gentleman may differ from us, and from the objects that we are striving to attain, but he will admit that we are a loyal party. It cannot be denied that a pledged labour candidate has never been a renegade. True, we have had labour men in the Victorian Parliament who were renegades, and were sent into the umbo of forgetfulness, but they were not pledged members of the Labour Party. Every honorable member is aware that the numbers are up in connexion with the approaching division, but I must say a few words of sympathy with the loyalty of the free-trade members of the Ministry to their protectionist colleagues. The division on the amendment will perhaps be unique in the history of this Parliament, but I hope that we shall all extend our friendship to the protectionist members of the present Government. I have often confessed that I cannot understand a member of the Labour Party not being a protectionist. If members of our party object to the cheap labour of other countries, why should not they object to the produce of that labour coming in to the Commonwealth free of duty?","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[6]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The events of this evening have, perhaps, laid down new precedents for political parties in the future. It is very pleasing to me to know that the right honorable gentleman who has been parading the Commonwealth during the last five or six months, sharpening his anti-socialistic battleaxe for the purpose of cutting down those whom he has described as Socialists, will have a further opportunity to sharpen his tomahawk before he will require to put it into use. No doubt the present position has come as a direct surprise to the Government. It has been most interesting to listen to the debate from the stand-point of the Prime Minister, and from that of the honorable and learned member for Ballarat. One has asserted that he had no intention of expressing any loss of confidence in the Government, and the other has asserted that he was absolutely convinced that no other interpretation could be placed upon the speech of the honorable and learned member for Ballarat. With their differing opinions, I have nothing to do, but I am pleased to know that we have to-night arrived at a condition of affairs which I anticipated we should arrive at after the coalition Government was formed. I stated at the time that although the Protectionist Party had divided itself for the time being, it would have to come together again, as it could not continue to trust the future of its policy to the right honorable gentleman with whom some of the party allied themselves.

He has raved in season and out of season during the recess on the objects of the Labour Party in trying to gull the people with regard to their mission. He has endeavoured to raise a bogy in order to frighten people, who have hitherto stood behind that party, into withdrawing their support.

But honorable gentlemen opposite appear to have evolved backwards, and so they have not followed any example which I may have set. I have no wish to say very much, as honorable members generally appear to desire to terminate the debate early and get an expression of the opinion of the House by a vote as soon as possible. I again express my delight at the attitude taken up by the honorable and learned member for Ballarat. The honorable and learned gentleman has shown the Prime Minister and others that he is not going to allow them to lead him astray, and to lead him to the country with the object of annihilating him. I can extend my sympathy to honorable gentlemen opposite ; but it is good for the country to know that the Prime Minister is not to be given an opportunity to further delude the people by the misrepresentation of what he calls Socialism. We shall now be able to do some business in this Parliament in which, up to the present time, we have done little or nothing. I am very anxious to justify my presence in this . Parliament. For various reasons which have not been clearly explained to-night, the present Government brought down an historical GovernorGenerals speech, containing nothing, but throwing down the gauntlet to the Opposition, and telling honorable members that they would be driven to their masters whether they liked it or not. While asserting that they are prepared to drive us to our masters, the Government have not put forward any policy to be submitted to the people.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[8]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

731,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"WEBSTER, William","KXK","N/A","N/A","N/A",87,"- That was before the Prime Minister and the honorable gentleman had an opportunity of putting in their deadly work in misrepresenting the objects and aims of the Labour Party. It is now our turn to say when we desire or require a dissolution, and it is not for the Prime Minister or the Postmaster-General to dictate to us and tell us that we shall be driven to the people. I expect that before this Parliament closes we shall have an opportunity to justify our presence here by the passing of useful legislation in the interests of the Commonwealth. I hope that we shall have a progressive policy, which will do justice to the industries of the Commonwealth, and at the same time properly regulate the conditions of employment affecting the working classes of the community. If we carry such legislation, this Parliament will have justified its existence. If the motion before us had been an ordinary motion of censure, or want of confidence in the policy of a Government, there would have been something tangible on which we could speak, but the present Government has placed no policy before Parliament, and has merely threatened us with a dissolution at the earliest possible moment. I never thought that the Prime Minister would seek shelter under a cowards castle of that kind. I should have expected the right honorable gentleman to come forward with a definite policy, on which his Government would be prepared to stand or fall. He has, instead, come forward with a threat of dissolution, and I feel sure that he is not going to succeed. I realize that many people will wonder how it comes about that the Labour Party and the Protectionist Party are prepared to join hands at this juncture for the purpose of proceeding with the business of the Commonwealth, and in order to prevent a rash and wasteful expenditure of Â£50,000, involving perhaps further taxation on the people, irrespective of consequences.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[8]/continue[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

735,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"WEBSTER, William","KXK","N/A","N/A","N/A",87,"- That may be so, but we are given no opportunity to know what the opinion of the present Government is. The only idea the Government have is to catch the people under this spell of so-called anti-Socialism, and, before they have had time to realize the position, to force a dissolution. The. Government want to take the people by storm and get from them a vote on a question which they do not understand, so that the present occupants of the Treasury bench may return to power on misrepresentation. The Prime Minister and his supporters have been very well treated to be allowed to occupy the Government benches for so long. The Prime Minister will now have every opportunity to consider what policy he will place before the country, and it is possible that we shall not hear any more of the socialistic bogy. It may turn out that all the money spent in New South Wales on this campaign has been spent in vain, and that all the meetings addressed by the right honorable gentleman may be resultless. The Prime Minister has now had six months of office, and has held a high and honorable position, to which any man might legitimately aspire, arid look back on with pride. The Prime Minister, like the honorable member for Robertson, the honorable and learned member for Werriwa, and others has, during the recess, been addressing the people on a question which he does not understand ; and but for that procedure the present Government might have been allowed to remain in power a little longer. We cannot tolerate this bogy with which the Prime Minister has been trying to frighten the deluded country folk of New South Wales. The right honorable gentleman has told the farmers of that State that if any one of them is the possessor of one pig the Socialists desire to take half of it, or if they have two head of poultry, one, together with half of their land, will be taken away to divide amongst those who have not any. I do not want to say anything which would hurt the feelings of the Prime Minister, because I am quite sure the blow is severe enough for him. I am not one to inflict unnecessary pain on any gentleman in his position ; and, further, I should be the last in the world to say anything which would hurt the feelings of even the honorable member for North Sydney. Whatever the outcome of the present situation, I hope we shall be able to go on with the business of the Commonwealth, doing something for the people who have sent us here, and not merely keeping a Government in power, with the effect of a retrograde step in legislation. The honorable and learned member for Ballarat was quite right when he asked the Prime Minister, not only to declare a negative position, but to state what portion of the legislation of the Labour Party he would prefer to strike off the statute-book. What is wanted is a definite programme ; and in that desire I have the greatest sympathy with the honorable and learned -member for Ballarat, and would have had sympathy with the honorable and learned member for Parkes, if the- latter had not climbed down when threatened with a gun. Honorable members who sit behind a Prime Minister who is not prepared with a policy ought to be ashamed, and use every effort to alter their position. I shall not detain the House longer than to again express the hope that the division will not leave honorable members any worse friends, but- that in the future we shall be able to work in harmony, not for party interests, but for the benefit of the whole of the Australian community.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[8]/continue[11]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
