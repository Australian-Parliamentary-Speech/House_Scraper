These amendments would see a statutory review of sentencing for offenders convicted of Commonwealth child sex offences with the findings to be reported to the parliament within four years of the bill coming into effect. A review of four years, rather than two or three as was suggested in the amendments by the Labor and the Greens, will ensure that the review properly captures the impact of this bill on sentencing outcomes for Commonwealth child sex offenders charged after the passage of the bill.","Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sexual Crimes Against Children and Community Protection Measures) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr PORTER (Pearce—Attorney-General, Minister for Industrial Relations and Leader of the House) ","(12:02):"
4,0,0,0,1,1,"Dreyfus, Mark, MP","HWG","Isaacs","ALP","N/A",4552," Theres a lot that this bill gets right. Labor will always work with MPs and senators from all sides to strengthen our laws to protect our children. Nothing should get in the way of this objective. There is nothing more sickening than child sexual abuse. Children are the most precious and vulnerable members of our community and Labor will always support strong and effective laws to protect children from abuse and to punish their abusers.I thank the government for agreeing to Labors suggestion that there be a statutory review of Commonwealth sentencing practice in relation to child sexual abuse matters. Thats what this first amendment deals with. That review is to commence within three years and to be completed within four. It will provide an opportunity to review the practice, the working, of the current settings of sentencing in this child sexual abuse area.I would add that from the very beginning Labor have said that whether our amendments succeeded or failed in the Senate we would support this bill. That is what Labor did in the Senate last night—Labor supported this bill. The government has signalled that it will delay the passage of this bill indefinitely if Labor insist on our amendment to remove minimum sentencing from this bill. Thats disappointing. The government has already delayed the passage of this bill for some eight months. Unlike the government, Labor will not allow the passage of this bill to be further delayed. For that reason, while we maintain our opposition to mandatory sentencing—because it does not work and makes it harder to catch, prosecute and convict criminals—we will not insist on our amendments relating to mandatory sentencing when the bill returns to the Senate. Protecting the welfare of children will always be Labors overriding priority and concern.Question agreed to.","Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sexual Crimes Against Children and Community Protection Measures) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr DREYFUS (Isaacs—Deputy Manager of Opposition Business) ","(12:03):"

The amendment would remove schedule 6 of the bill, which is the schedule that provides for mandatory minimum sentences for child sex offences that attract the highest penalties and to recidivist child sex offenders who have previously been convicted of a child sex offence. The government has taken the view since the inception of this legislation in 2017 that current sentencing practices for Commonwealth child sex offences are resulting in manifestly inadequate sentences that do not sufficiently recognise the harm suffered by victims or provide for adequate rehabilitation time in custody. The mandatory minimum provisions provided for in schedule 6 are critical and necessary to achieve this bills overall intent of ensuring sentencing for child sex offences are drawn into line with community expectations.","Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sexual Crimes Against Children and Community Protection Measures) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr PORTER (Pearce—Attorney-General, Minister for Industrial Relations and Leader of the House) ","(12:06):"
6,0,0,0,1,1,"Bandt, Adam, MP","M3C","Melbourne","AG","N/A",4552," I just want to place the Greens position clearly on the record. The Greens support this bill, especially now that amendments (1) and (3) have been agreed to. I think the belief is universal amongst everyone in this place that child sex abuse is a scourge. It is unthinkable and we must fight it. So what we are dealing with here now is not a debate about whether the bill will be agreed to. We are dealing with whether or not the majority view of the Senate should be respected. And the majority view of the Senate gave effect to a basic principle of the rule of law, and that is that when people are convicted of crimes, especially when they are convicted of heinous crimes, it should be left up to judges to make the decision about what the appropriate sentence is. Theres a very clear reason for that and a very simply understood principle. That is that it is difficult for parliament to think in advance of every conceivable situation. In the context of this bill, in particular, it is important that we—and, as I say, the Greens support this bill—have strong responses to offences but that judges be given the capacity to consider individual situations.Id ask members of the public to consider their teenage daughter or son who is at high school. What if they sent a text message to the person they were seeing at the time, their partner, who happened to be in the year below them? What if that text message was of a sexually explicit nature? What if those two people happened to fall on either side of the dividing line of the relevant age? That young person might be committing an offence. Should they be required to go to jail? That is the question that we are debating now, and the Greens are saying that that question should be left up to a judge. And that is why, historically, most people who defend the rule of law, like the Greens, oppose the imposition of mandatory minimum sentencing. Now, it is clear that the majority of the Senate, certainly up until this morning, opposes mandatory minimum sentencing and supports the rule of law. This House should support the rule of law as well. There is unanimity in this place about supporting the bill. There is unanimity in this place about stamping out child sex abuse. But there should also be unanimity in this place about preserving the very important principles of separation of powers and the rule of law.It has been said in the submissions to the inquiry into this bill, by legal experts, by everyone who would also agree that we need to take strong action to stamp out child sex abuse, that we also need to make sure that we preserve the independence of the judiciary. The Greens will act on principle and defend the independence of the judiciary at the same time that we support strong laws to tackle child sex abuse. Others had said that up until yesterday they agreed with those matters of principle, and it appears now its a case of: These are my principles. We agree with them strongly, but, if you dont like them, weve got others. It only takes a strongly worded headline or a push from a minister and they change their position, and thats disappointing because the decisions that we make about matters of principle, defending the judiciary, defending the separation of powers and the importance of the rule of law have very-long-lasting consequences. So I repeat: the Greens give support to the bill as its been amended in the Senate. Were glad the House has agreed to amendments (1) and (3), and the House should also agree to amendment (2).I also add two final matters. We as the Greens have raised some technical issues that there were with the bill. We dont think that should stand in the way of supporting it. Lastly, if I might ask, Mr Speaker: in the context where we are moving an amendment thats in the negative but we are also calling divisions to satisfy the separation rule, I would appreciate some clarity about which way ought to be called if you want amendment (2) to stand. Sure. I think were probably at the question, but I need to check. The question is amendment (2) be disagreed to. No further speakers? Ill put the question. If a division is required, it will proceed because its on a motion moved by the Leader of the House. If it had been an amendment moved by a non-government member, it would have been deferred. The question has been framed in the negative, so it will be disagreed to. That will simply mean those voting aye are on the government side and those voting that it not be disagreed to are on the opposition side. The question is that amendment (2) be disagreed to.A division having been called and the bells having been rung— As there are fewer than five members on the side of the noes in this division, I declare the question resolved in the affirmative in accordance with standing order 127. The names of the two members who are in the minority will be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings.Question agreed to, Mr Bandt and Mr Wilkie voting no.","Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sexual Crimes Against Children and Community Protection Measures) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BANDT (Melbourne—Leader of the Australian Greens) ","(12:07):"

22,0,0,0,1,1,"Hill, Julian, MP",86256,"Bruce","ALP","N/A",4559," I want to acknowledge the remarks of previous speakers but emphasise my view that, above all else, ASQA must focus on ensuring quality to protect the consumers of vocational education, students, and on ensuring also that the significant public investment in the training system actually achieves outcomes for the industry and the nation, and on maintaining our reputation globally for quality. I say that with a great degree of affection. In a former life I spent some years helping to promote Victorias international education sector across the world. Ive led trade missions to many parts of the world with TAFEs and quality private providers, and I think its fair to say that in recent years its been devastating for those whove valued Australias training system to watch the decline in quality, when they really understand whats going on.To ensure that reputation for actual quality, then, a strong and productive relationship with the sector, the providers, is so important. In many instances, a collaborative and educative regulation can be appropriate. But reports of heavy-handed approaches for minor administrivia or paperwork breaches are not appropriate and not helpful. But, of course, theres a balance there and care needs to be taken—because I know theres been pushback from parts of the private training industry to perceived overreach—that the pendulum doesnt swing too far the other way, where real quality issues are uncovered. Then firm action does need to be taken. Australians should expect that the governance changes proposed in this bill will assist with that.I want to turn my remarks to the proposed second reading amendment. The government have damaged the quality of Australias world-class vocational training system by cutting TAFE and training by more than $3 billion. Theyre in their seventh year with $3 billion of cuts accumulating, coupled with the simultaneous crisis of youth unemployment and skill shortages that were seeing break out. Its really quite an achievement, isnt it? We have skills shortages and at the same time theyre cutting the vocational training system by $3 billion and, in some cases, relying on overreach of temporary migration to fill the gap because theyve stuffed up the training system. And, of course, theyre failing to tackle completion rates.This is not a genuine reform package; this is a minor little tweak to governance arrangements, which might be fine in itself. But, in their seventh year in government, with the crisis in the skills training system, this is not a genuine reform package. These are serious and important issues. Indeed, it would be fair to say that the Liberals have conducted a war on TAFE, a war on public training, with their obsession with creating the market. I say right up-front: I think the former Labor government overreached in some areas in that regard. People have said so, and weve corrected that. But the government has had six years—and are now in their seventh year—to address these issues, and there is nothing. A few weeks ago the Prime Minister said, Were going to have a look at the vocational training system. He couldnt bring himself to say, Were going to fix the TAFE system, could he? He said, Were going to have a look at the vocational training system.The COVID crisis makes it even more urgent that the government acknowledge this crisis and actually get a plan to overhaul the sector. We already had skills shortages in critical areas of the economy before COVID. Weve seen a 73 per cent drop in approved apprenticeships. We cannot lose the pipeline of apprenticeships right now, when migration into the country is stalled. Itll create a double whammy, so we have to see action from the government to restart the apprenticeship system and get it back on track. Its not rocket science, is it? Youd think that, in a recession, even this government would understand that now is the time to let people engage in the skills and training system and in the education system. Actually put some money back into TAFE to let people get back into the training system and incentivise them to do so now—not in six months or 12 months or at the next election when they come up with some nice-sounding policy, but now. Get young people back into the training system and back into apprenticeships. Uncap the university places. The universities are reporting that they cant accommodate the demand theyre now seeing. Funnily enough, in a recession, people think, What am I going to do? Maybe I should upgrade my skills. Maybe I should go and get another qualification.Of course, we hear a lot about manufacturing. You can say manufacturing. Yes, we want to see the resurgence of manufacturing, but its not just going to happen. There are three critical ingredients, at least in my view: reliable, cheap power, and we know that renewable energy, which the government is so hostile to, is the cheapest reliable form of power; innovation and research, which the government is presiding over multibillion-dollar cuts to right now; and skills. Theyre the three ingredients, and the training system is so important.I also want to turn some of my remarks to another important part of ASQAs function, which is the oversight of VET providers who deliver to international students. International education is this countrys fourth-biggest export overall and our biggest services export. It is now worth $40 billion to the economy, and that includes significant VET delivery. Its in crisis at the moment. Ive remarked elsewhere that the government needs to get its act together. Its the only top-10 export sector that the government is not only not assisting but actively harming, with the Prime Minister out there telling students just to go home. They are astounding comments that are damaging future prospects to our biggest services export industry.In relation to vocational education, I say clearly that our future success will rely on three things. The first is ruthless enforcement of quality, which is where ASQA comes in. We are a higher-cost, high-quality provider. Thats our market niche. We cant compete with low-cost providers and destinations elsewhere in the world, so we have to maintain that reputation for quality and be ruthless about it. The second is that we need a great student experience. One of our competitive advantages with other places in the world where young people can choose to go to study is that, overall, we have a good student experience. People can have an English-speaking experience, living in and working part time in the community. The third ingredient, of course, is positive word of mouth. That is where the Prime Ministers comments telling students to go home are so damaging. They set social media ablaze. People are rightly hurt, upset and, indeed, confused. Providers are despairing. Ive spoken to them. The debate about student experience and marketing is for another time, but the government needs to act.Theres one thing I want to put on the record. I think the government could use this short window of time—I hope it will be short—when we dont have incoming students to actually fix a few problems in the vocational training system in relation to quality regulation by ASQA. This issue affects both domestic and international students, but I think it is a particular problem for international students. Australias consumer protection system for international students and its legislative framework, despite the problems weve seen emerge in quality, was a world first and remains among the worlds best. We should be proud of it. Indeed, our bureaucrats, trade officials and providers still spend time overseas—probably in Zoom at the moment—explaining to other systems how our system is run and the regulatory architecture around it. That commitment to the highest quality standards must be accompanied by strong and effective monitoring and compliance mechanisms. This is necessary to ensure quality teaching and services to international and also domestic students. Most providers seek to do the right thing, private providers included, but there remain some who do not. So, despite efforts over years, were told, under this government to crack down on dodgy providers, serious concerns continue to exist in the community and also in the sector.If you talk to the long-term reputable high-quality private providers, they share these concerns, probably more than anyone because its them who get squeezed by the bottom feeders in the market that keep cutting costs. These bottom feeders are effectively a visa factory, selling work rights to students with very little regard to quality. Theyre concerned about the effectiveness of the current quality regime to catch these providers. I stress again: most providers—TAFE and quality private providers—do the right thing. But some of these bottom feeders are catering for a small minority of students who are not in Australia to study and are really treating the student visa as a work visa. Its a very small percentage of a very big number of students here, but that very small percentage is the part of the market that brings the whole into disrepute. Indeed, I would venture to say, based on evidence that weve seen and some of the work by fair work, its those students right at the bottom of the market who are not here to study who are undercutting wages and pushing domestic residents and young people out of a job because theyre not here to study and are therefore not adding to the economy.Those students are recruited directly by dodgy agents, and, as a result of the COVID crisis and the governments failure to provide assistance, theres been a bonanza for onshore education agents who are hanging around outside the universities, hanging around outside the quality privates and saying to the students: Come with me. Ill find you a cheaper course. Youll still get your visa, but Ill find you a cheaper course. I might happen to get a great big kickback, but Ill give you a thousand bucks as well. Hows that? You can see what that does, of course, to the quality. How can you actually deliver a quality product if the students are paying four grand? You cant. Its cut teaching with no attendance, and the spiral goes down.Dodgy courses and providers catering to that minority of students also risk our reputation and undermine community confidence. The problem is, in my view, ASQAs current regulatory regime—and this is the sort of thing that should be thought about if the government had a proper reform package instead of this piecemeal little governance thing and a few marketing slogans, which seems to be most of their policy. The problem is ASQAs current regulatory approach doesnt identify these providers and shut them down, and the government changes in this bill wont do it. The governments focus, they say, is building training provider capability through education and a quality improvement approach to address sector concerns, but it doesnt touch the real issues. In my strong view—and this is one suggestion—its time to consider and trial a more fundamental shift in our regulatory approach to weed out, finally, those dodgy few VET providers who harm the reputation of the rest who try and do the right thing.An additional thought for consideration is that in Australia all VET providers are registered as both training and assessment providers. Once you get registered with ASQA, youre a training and assessment provider. In plain English, this means that, when youre registered, you do the training and you also do the exams and practical assessments and grade the students, which is fine in the good providers, but in the dodgy ones it opens up an enormous rort. It doesnt matter whether the student of the cooking class can actually cook, it doesnt matter whether the student in the aged-care course can actually look after senior citizens in a competent way, as long as theyre paying the fees, you give them the mark and they keep the visa and keep working. But some countries separate the training and assessment functions to varying degrees, providing some measure of external assessment and independent validation of the students competency. In the extreme, youd think of year 12, where someone else marks the exam from the students at that school and theres a bit of moderation and so on. Im not proposing we go to that extreme, but theres a strong case to at least trial external moderated assessment for the higher risk courses and the higher risk providers.Just briefly Ill outline how this could work. Informal industry feedback that Ive sought from quality public and private providers, coupled with data from regulatory enforcement action—ASQA probably has a reasonable idea, but, if you talk to the proper private providers and the decent agents in the sector, they will tell you who the dodgy providers are. They know to whom they lose the students for lower fees; they know who these providers are. This data combined with actual intelligence could suggest certain courses in the VET sector. Id highlight cooking and aged care and security which pose a much greater risk of quality concerns and breaches. I propose that ASQA trial an independent training validation assessment—its not a catchy acronym; the bureaucrats wont love it!—in identified high-risk courses. ASQA could accredit a limited number of high-quality providers—probably the TAFEs, as they do in other countries—and register them to undertake independent training validation assessments of students from other providers delivering the high-risk courses. In plain English, if theres ongoing evidence of concern regarding some of the dodgier cooking course providers, ASQA could force those providers to send their students, once a semester, for instance, for some independent assessment of skills. Go on, cook a cake for me. Go on, cook some peas. See if you can cook. My mum failed cooking peas at nursing—thats where I got the peas from.

That would identify the schools where most of the students actually cant cook, which would then give ASQA the evidentiary basis to shut those courses down. At the moment, the random enforcement model of ASQA turning up and checking if the paperwork is in order is not working; it doesnt work. Even the dodgy providers can get their filing cabinets sorted and make sure the students have signed the right forms, but it doesnt actually find the schools that arent training people and providing any quality. I think its worth a try. The payment could be from the student or the training provider. Its a relatively small amount of money in the scheme of the fees paid and the market. It would be a few hundred bucks, I guess, per student, and different models could be designed with industry. But political leadership is needed to force this change in policy and model.This concept is not something I thought up. I think it was in a report from around 2007 or 2008 that the Rudd government was looking at. I think it was some work by Professor Peter Noonan at that point, and it included a range of other changes. They were pretty good changes, which the government could well look at going back to, if theyre looking for inspiration. Some of that quite rightly was put on hold during the global financial crisis—not wanting to impose any extra regulatory burden—and was never revisited. I think there are more creative ideas that the government really needs to look at if theyre going to be serious about improving the quality of regulation through ASQA, because these piecemeal little governance changes are not actually going to do anything significant to address the quality concerns. Aside from that, Im sure the bills great.","National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Governance and Other Matters) Bill 2020","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[16]","N/A","N/A"
25,0,0,0,1,1,"Bird, Sharon, MP","DZP","Cunningham","ALP","N/A",4563," Can I indicate at the outset that I support the amendment moved by Labor and also that I dont oppose the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Governance and Other Matters) Bill 2020 that is before us today, just as Labor doesnt oppose it.As has been outlined by many speakers, the bills intention is to amend the governance structures of ASQA, the Australian Skills and Quality Authority, and also to enhance its information sharing with the National Centre for Vocational Education and Research. These are both commendable intentions in and of themselves. The bill seeks to do this with two key amendments. The first one revises ASQAs governance structures, replacing the chief commissioner, chief executive officer and two commissioners with a single independent statutory office holder—a CEO. Secondly, the bill establishes the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Advisory Council, which Ill just refer to as the advisory council, which is intended to provide ASQA with access to expert advice regarding the functions of the regulator.On that particular aspect, the Labor Party more broadly is very conscious of the value of TAFE and also of union representation. We would argue that those views and voices should be heard when it comes to developments in the VET sector. For this reason, in the Senate we will seek to move amendments to ensure the public provider does have seats at the table. It is always a sensible and a useful option for government to set up forms of advisory councils bringing together key stakeholders in a sector to provide feedback and advice to government. Indeed, for a period of time under the Labor government, when I held both parliamentary secretary and ministerial responsibility for this sector, the thing that struck me was that, particularly in vocational education—maybe more so than in almost any other sector of policymaking that the government deals with at a federal level—there was a profound commitment by stakeholders to the sector and to improvements in the sector.And there were many bodies, significant numbers of which I think were—in a very short-sighted and foolish manner—dismantled by the first Abbott government when it came to power. They were bodies that brought together industry, government and the trade unions in the sector to sit around the table and develop a range of advice to government. It might have been on areas such as the need for skills advice—whats happening in industry, whats happening in the economy and how our vocational education sector should be adjusting to address emerging demands, such as new levels of skills needed or indeed skills for which there is declining demand because of change in technology and so forth. There may have been advisory bodies around the actual implementation of skills training—the development of the training packages themselves.I was very critical, when I had shadow responsibility for this area, of the fact that the government re-formed advisory bodies from the industry to talk and provide advice on skills packages and specifically excluded the trade union representatives. At the time I said to government—and I still, in the context of this bill, would say—that that is a short-sighted, stupid decision. There are people across the trade union movement—and Ive dealt with many of them over the past 10 years—who have a deep and profound understanding of the vocational education and training sector. They sat, when Labor was in government, on many of these advisory councils and are very well regarded and respected by the industry representatives who sat on those bodies. And I have to say, many of the industry representatives were also profoundly knowledgeable and committed to vocational education and training. It was one of the few places where you would see all the other arguments and disagreements that might be expected between industry and union representatives left at the door and very constructive work done in a cooperative manner, and the government benefited from that. It made a significant difference to the quality and the outcomes that we saw in the vocational education sector.So, I would say to government that when it looks at this advisory council it should be looking at tapping in to that deep expertise in the union sector about the vocational education sector across the board. In particular Im thinking about representatives from the more traditional trades, particularly organisations such as the Electrical Trades Union, the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union and the Australian Workers Union—a range of those unions that have a long history of working with apprenticeships and with skills training. People in those organisations take significant pride and have significant knowledge about how the system has developed over decades. Theyre not coming to the table with just a couple of years of experience; theyre coming with decades of experience and a commitment to and priority of the outcomes for the students. Their priority is: how do we get a quality worker out of a training system, somebody who is deeply and broadly qualified in the skills that they are being trained in?I would argue that that has been a national asset for Australia for many decades. People talk about the international standing of this sector. There was a period when we rivalled Germany. Internationally, other countries that are looking at developing their vocational education sectors would look at Australia and Germany. We were seen as the two leading lights internationally. I well remember, on the change of government—when the Abbott government came in—we had people in India at the time, as India looked deeply at replicating our training sector, doing that work for Australia.Unfortunately, what weve seen in the seven years since is an absolute decline in that situation. While this bill talks about quality in the vocational sector, it is remiss of government not to get its head around the fact that for seven years they have not really, deeply and meaningfully dealt with the vocational education and training sector. What is the evidence for that? Why do I say that? Because we have significantly fewer people engaging in the vocational education and training sector. We have significant—in fact, alarming—drops in the number of people engaging in the apprenticeship system. Weve seen lost opportunities to address this issue during the COVID period, when the country has required government to step up with what would not be natural for them—interventionist-type policies.During the global financial crisis, the government was very conscious that one of the first groups of workers that would be hit were apprentices. When the sectors that employ apprentices are particularly hard hit, one of the first decisions they often take is to lay off their apprentices—and that was one of the first responses. In an unprecedented manner, the way in which that the Labor government tied its investment and stimulus to the employment of apprentices meant that we actually did not see a drop in apprenticeship numbers during the global financial crisis. That was an extraordinary thing. What is really important about it is that it tells this government that they can do it. They can ensure that those connections remain in place through their policy settings.Instead what we have now seen is a report from peak bodies that were looking at losing 100,000 apprentices in this year alone as a result of COVID-19. Weve already lost over 140,000 over the last seven years of Liberal governments. But this year alone; thats a crisis. That means that we will completely destroy the pipeline of skilled tradespeople, whether in plumbing; carpentry; electricians and electrical goods; hairdressers; chefs; mechanics; bricklayers; or trainees in the IT sector. The breadth of coverage of the pipeline of workers that were going to need in the future in these industry sectors which will be impacted by that sort of loss is a serious issue that government needs to have a policy response to.I eagerly watch every press conference and read every media release—and I have done since the Abbott government was first elected—when governments pre-empt the fact theyre about to do a big announcement on vocational education and training or apprenticeships. On each and every occasion, I have, unfailingly, been massively disappointed in what theyve announced. Its a marketing opportunity only: therell be tweaks, Well have someone to do a review; we will tweak this particular bit of regulation; well wag our finger at the states.","National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Governance and Other Matters) Bill 2020","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms BIRD (Cunningham) ","(12:47):"

A whole lot of things are put out there as a massive response; that only they understand the problems in the vocational education sector and theyre going to do something about it. Theres no detail, definitely no funding and no outcomes that theyre ever held to account for in any of those announcements. It was no different when the Prime Minister stood at the National Press Club the other day and said that one of the key things he was going talk about was skills and the vocational education sector. Again: a massive disappointment, Lets just move on—well move on to the next announcement and no-one will notice that we actually didnt make any difference at all to the number of people being able to access vocational education, or the numbers of people engaged in apprenticeships and traineeships.Its simply not good enough. Its not good enough for the young people who need those pathways into good careers across so many industry sectors—in growth areas such as aged care, child care and disability care—and the opportunity to have meaningful traineeships in those sectors and create careers for people. It is not good enough for young people. Its not good enough for mature-age workers, who could take up apprenticeships and traineeships as an opportunity to restructure their own careers if theyre in industries that are in decline. Labor at the last election and the one before had policies about getting mature workers those opportunities. But we hear nothing but crickets from this government.Its not good enough for our economy. Its simply lazy to think that you can continue to use temporary migration programs to fill skills gaps that youre doing nothing about addressing in the first place. Those programs are good programs designed to give this nation the time and space it needs to train Australians up for the industry sectors that might be emerging or where weve got shortages. Thats a sensible thing to do. It is not sensible—in fact, its a dereliction of duty by a national government—to use that program simply to keep papering over the problem and never do anything about it. Over $3 billion has been either taken out of or underspent in vocational education and training by the federal government. Lets not exempt state governments. I certainly think many of them could pick up their acts as well. But the federal government has a national responsibility for economic diversification, for economic development, for participation and for productivity.All of these big issues are underpinned by a vocational education and training sector that delivers for people and for the economy and it was never treated that way until the Abbott government. The Turnbull government was no better. The Morrison government, I would argue, is even worse, because it cynically seeks, at so many opportunities, to do the photo op, to do the marketing spin, to do what looks like a big announcement and then to walk away and actually deliver nothing. It is time they were held to account. This bill is a very minor tweak to the quality system. It is good that its being done. But, I tell you what, theres a whole lot more they need to be doing.","National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Governance and Other Matters) Bill 2020","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[13]","N/A","N/A"
28,0,0,0,1,1,"Ryan, Joanne, MP",249224,"Lalor","ALP","N/A",4566," Im pleased to follow the member for Cunningham today, because she has an unrivalled history in this space in this place. There are few people in this building with a deeper knowledge or understanding of this sector—what it needs and the history of it, the mistakes that have been made and the way we should move towards fixing them. So I welcome her contribution today on the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Governance and Other Matters) Bill 2020 and the amendment moved by the member for Cooper, who is seated in front of me today.I welcome the amendment from the member from Cooper because I welcome the opportunity to talk about vocational education and training—and the sector itself—because we are in a desperate, desperate state. That fact is only highlighted further by the economic impacts of the COVID-19 health crisis and whats coming at us now, which is the recession, and what thats going to mean in terms of both industry pipelines and, as the member for Cunningham so eloquently demonstrated for us, the pipeline of workers that we are going to need.I had a conversation last week with a young person in my electorate who said that they were looking to do a civil construction certificate IV. As part of that course, they would get heavy machinery certification and their truck driving licence. Do you know what they said to me? They said that they were going to be working with pilots in Victoria who were retraining to get jobs as truck drivers. Thats where we are. Highly qualified people are seeking to retrain wherever there is a shortage. My heart breaks at that point for the pilot who is not working and for their family, but also for the young person who walked away thinking that they werent good enough to compete in that space and that it didnt matter what qualifications they pursued, because they wouldnt get employment in this tough market. Thats what this government should be addressing.As the member for Cunningham said, this is a tweak. Yes, we need quality. Yes, we need changes to ASQA, and this process may be part of improving quality in TAFE. But, lets face it, since this last decade, not a lot of people in the community have a lot of faith in this sector anymore. Thats because of bad headlines but its also because of bad administration in this sector by this government, which continues to go for the sugar headline and fail on the substance, and which continues to grab the good-news story at the front end with no accountability and no outcomes at the back end. This space is no different: all spin and no substance. This legislation is a small tweak. Were in here talking about vocational education and training, and this government hasnt sat and talked to the peak bodies and hasnt been out on job sites time and time again to talk to people in the training sector.In my electorate, it is absolutely clear where the issue rests. As an educator for many, many years, who worked in techs a long time ago, let me tell you that the private sector will go hard in this space where delivery is cheap, where equipment is cheap and where you can make a profit. That leaves our public sector to do the heavy lifting where the equipment is expensive. Do you know how long a lathe lasts on the ground in our tech schools—the John Howard tech schools or ours? Its about five years before a lathe is out of date. Do you know what they cost? Thats why public TAFE has to be public TAFE. This is expensive, and the private sector doesnt want to pay for it. The private sector doesnt want to be involved in our licensed trades where accountability is high and there are exams at the end of it that are externally assessed.I listened to the member for Bruces contribution earlier and I thought he had some terrific ideas. Lo and behold: they are not new ideas. How do you get integrity into this sector? You separate the provider from the assessment; thats how you get integrity into this sector. You do not rely on a tick-box exercise to deliver quality; you make sure it is connected at the hip to the industry that it is serving and to the community that it is serving. These are the things that this government needs to address—not tweaks, not doffs of the hat to the shortages that are being created. As the member for Cunningham said, there were 140,000 fewer apprentices before COVID. As the member for Sydney said just last week at that dispatch box, the projections at the moment are that were losing 2,000 apprentices a week. Everyone in my electorate knows how this works. They all know. They cant figure out how we can have shortages. Weve got no bricklayers. Thats a skills shortage. Weve got no bricklayers, yet we have unemployed young people. How is it that we cant put these two things together and fix it? Its not that hard: focused delivery.I cant talk about this sector without adding to talk about government services and the jobactives and their interaction with the sector. It is often the case that young people are getting certification in spaces and are then applying for positions only to find that they actually havent done the OH&S training that they needed to do. Without that card in their pocket, theyre not going to get past first base. When I first became a member and I sat with my local jobactives, I saw that the people who were giving guidance to the young people who found themselves unemployed didnt know about the white card and didnt know you needed one. They were pushing kids out and sending them to interviews. The kids couldnt get past the first hurdle because, although they had done a VET subject, they didnt have a white card.This is not difficult, but currently weve got a government that doesnt want to do the heavy lifting, doesnt want to do the hard yards and doesnt want to sit and talk to the peak bodies, the unions or the people providing the training. Worse than that, in the development of this legislation, they have not asked for the views of the trainers and the educators. They have not sat with them. They havent spoken to the people who actually deliver this training to find out what they think would work.Im pretty sure most of the trainers out there would be pretty keen to get around a table and tell a government how to fix this system. I know that trainers, teachers and educators in the public TAFE sector are desperate to get that system back up and running. There is nothing more satisfying than working with someone in an education program and watching them walk out the door to their first day of work. Theres nothing more satisfying. Theres nothing more satisfying as a teacher than connecting a young person with an employer. People talk to me a lot about these things. Obviously I spent a lot of time in secondary schools. Obviously I was a senior level coordinator before I became a principal. Obviously I used to organised for young people to go and do their work experience.Weve got some terrific people and some terrific businesses in my electorate. Weve got a plumbing company that has two kids a week from our local schools doing work experience with them—two kids a week. Its no surprise theyre getting a lot of business. Every one of those families tells all of their friends, if they need a plumber, to ring that company. They say, Theyre good guys; theyre training our kids. It also means that that company gets the pick of the kids. Theyve seen them all on the job site, theyve had a chat to them, theyve had them in the van and they know whos keen so they get the pick of the kids. This is not difficult, but what it requires is goodwill. What it requires is a community based response. What it requires is that the jobs and the shortages out there are connected in.Ive listened for years and years and years to people saying, Id really like to put an apprentice on but theres nobody out there who wants to be an apprentice. Its really simple: ring your local high school and talk to the careers teacher. Theyll have them lined up at your door tomorrow for an interview. This is not hard, but weve corporatised it. Weve created a pool up here for the private sector to say theyre going to give certification, but theyre not connected to give anybody a job. This government needs to address these things. The member for Wannon, as the minister, should know this. Hes from regional Victoria. He grew up in Victoria. He watched these things. Its really not that difficult.What we do know about this government is that theyre not interested in talking to educators—not in any sector. We saw that last week when they said, Well just make a cross-the-board decision and get the sugar-hit line that were giving free child care and a couple of weeks later well rip that away, well rip jobseeker away, we wont talk to educators, we wont talk to the service delivery people, we wont talk to the small centres in communities and we wont ask them, At what level do you become unviable in terms of capacity? Do we talk to them? Do we talk to the educators? Does this government bother? No. They just make broad sweeping statements. They come in with a policy and walk away, and its the same with this piece of legislation.I welcome anything that muscles ASQA up. I welcome it because in my community Ive seen a lot of young people pay for training and then have it questioned, or, worse, pay for training and not have a certificate delivered even though they were told they completed the training. Theyre paying off loans for things that have no value for them. This piece of legislation muscles up ASQA, and Im all for that. But how on earth is it going to be self-funded? How on earth are you going to get quality but not give the funding for ASQA to do the work that they are doing? How is that going to make sense? How is it going to work?Again, to the member for Wannon, the minister in this space: its a broad portfolio and it goes to your governments value of education that one person is to oversee all levels in education, making them an expert in nothing. It means they cant get their head into the detail in any of these sectors. I feel for the member for Wannon. Its a big job. Its an extraordinarily big job, and he works inside a government that has cut and cut and cut and cut this part of his responsibility out of his whole portfolio. The poor minister gets to walk in here and front us and the cameras every day to explain how were supposed to, in a crisis and in a recession, fill these skills shortages and match up the unemployed with the skills shortages when there is no funding to do it. How are we supposed do that if were not all working together? How can we on this side work with a government that devalues education and training at every level? Do you know how I know its devalued? Its easy: if you value something, you fund it. If you value education, you see it as an investment and not as a cost. This governments failed on every measure since I came to this place in 2013, and this piece of legislation is no different.The government says: We want to muscle up ASQA. Well write some pretty lines here about how its all about quality. Were going to improve the quality of the sector by muscling up ASQA to help them to do that. Whats the fine print? ASQA have to do it with no funding. In fact, were going to change the funding model and theyre going to have to become self-funded. Whos going to pay? Young people in my electorate seeking certification so they can get a job—thats who is going to pay. When we are confronting a recession and when we are going to be trying to rebuild our economy, we are going to have skills shortages with a lack of apprenticeships. We have temporary migration, on the one hand, suddenly not available for this skills shortage. What is the government doing? The governments saying, Well, ASQA will have to do that, but theyll have to find the money to do that from the clientele. Are they going to go out to business and ask them for money? Why would business give ASQA money? No, they are going to pass on the cost of this to the young people in my electorate needing a job. They are going to pass on the cost of this to the recently unemployed pilot who is trying to retrain. Thats whos going to pay for this self-funded improvement in quality in our vocational education and training sector.I complete my remarks by reminding this government and by appealing to this minister. You want to muscle up ASQA? Well, all I want you to do, Member for Wannon, is muscle up in cabinet. Can you muscle up in cabinet? Can you be a force in cabinet? Can you walk through those doors, look the Prime Minister in the eye and say, You cannot fix the things you are trying to fix until you value education and fund education properly in this country?","National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Governance and Other Matters) Bill 2020","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms RYAN (Lalor—Opposition Whip) ","(13:02):"
29,0,0,0,1,1,"Zappia, Tony, MP","HWB","Makin","ALP","N/A",4570," It is a pleasure to follow the member for Lalor in this debate on the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Governance and Other Matters) Bill 2020. I, too, whilst not opposing the legislation, speak in support of the amendments moved by Labor. The Morrison government has a shameful track record on supporting skills and vocational training in this country. Its abandonment of skills training since coming to office in 2013 will be looked back on by future generations as one of the catastrophic failures of the Abbott, Turnbull and now Morrison governments. It has left Australia vulnerable. It has left Australia unprepared.First, it was the rorting of the VET sector by shonky operators, where we saw millions of dollars paid out to crooked training operators for training that was never delivered or delivered to non-existent trainees or for courses that did not meet relevant training standards and ultimately undermined the reputable TAFE system. These were scam operators who were able to exploit the VET system under this governments watch even after what was going on had become very clear. Simultaneously, the government white-anted the public TAFE system by cutting $3 billion of funding or simply not spending the funds allocated. Over the last five years, the underspend has been around $919 million. The result has been a training sector in crisis, a national skills shortage, a closure of TAFEs around Australia and a reliance on overseas skilled migration.The facts speak for themselves. Between 2013 and 2019, apprenticeship numbers across Australia fell by almost 140,000—from 412,000 to 276,000. Those figures are now over a year old. The numbers would very likely be much worse today, but the government doesnt seem to want to release those latest figures. I ask: why not? I suspect its because they will tell an even more damning story. The number of apprentices didnt fall because of a skills glut in Australia. There was not an oversupply of apprentices or tradies. It was because the funding and the training places were simply not there.At the same time, industry sectors were facing skills shortages. What was the Liberal governments response to that? It was to bring in skilled migrants from overseas. In 2018-19, Australia recruited 110,000 skilled permanent migrants and 41,000 skilled temporary migrants to fill skills shortages. The government has been doing that year on year for several years now. Those are all skills shortages that could have been filled by Australians had they been trained. Skilled migration has dominated Australias migration intake. Of course we should be grateful for those skilled migrants who came to Australia and filled job vacancies, enabling productivity or services to continue. However, the flip side of that is that I often speak to young people or to their parents about the difficulty that they have in getting an apprenticeship in a vocation in which Australia has a national skills shortage.In my own state of South Australia, the apprenticeship situation is even worse. Apprenticeship numbers in South Australia have more than halved since 2013, from around 33,000 to around 16,000. Again, those figures are a year old, and I suspect the numbers are much lower today. When the South Australian Liberal government took office, it added to the demise by closing TAFEs, including three in my own region at Tea Tree Gully, Port Adelaide and Parafield, again, not only closing the ability of people in South Australia to skill up but closing opportunities to young people in that part of Adelaide—young people who dont always have the money to drive from one side of Adelaide to the other in order to get the training that they need. The Marshall government also cut TAFE funding from an average of about $441 million over the last decade to $347 million in 2018, and it seems that there will be a further $15 million cut in this financial year. Those cuts will inevitably result in job losses and fewer courses available.Not all people want or are suited to university study, but they may be attracted to a trade career if they are given the opportunity. Yet federal and state Liberal governments cut back those opportunities by cutting the funding. They seem to have this view that its up to industry to train the people that they need. And, whilst I dont have a problem with industry doing that, the government equally has a responsibility to ensure that we have sufficient training places and opportunities for people in this country—so much so that industry sectors like the Civil Contractors Federation South Australia are establishing their own apprenticeship and group training organisation in order to overcome skills shortages. In other words, they cant rely on the government, so they have to do it themselves. Now, I applaud them for doing that, because I know that industry led training organisations do a good job. Its in their interests to do so. They want the people that come out of the training to be trained up to the standards that they want them to work at once they become employees.At the beginning of this year there were over 4,000 registered training organisations in Australia. Im not convinced that they were all needed or that they all provide value-for-money training, so Im hoping that this legislation will raise confidence in the VET sector. The legislation makes two structural changes to the oversight of VET training in Australia. It replaces the current Australian Skills Quality Authority hierarchy of three commissioners with one single CEO, and then there will be a 10-person-maximum advisory council appointed to provide advice to the CEO. Other members on our side have already raised the concern about the selection process. We dont know how its going to take place or who will be appointed. I assume that, if there are nine people on that panel, there will be at least one from each state, but even then it doesnt give me confidence that it will be a properly representative panel. That is going to be critical to how effective this whole legislation is. Having said that, I have to say the legislation in itself and that change are not going to make the drastic changes to skills training in this country that the country urgently needs. I see it more as something that the government is doing in order to pretend that it is an issue that it has on its agenda and to pretend that it is making advancements in respects of skills training across Australia. Nevertheless, it is something we dont oppose. But it will be interesting to see in two or three years time what effect that advisory panel and having a single CEO has had in the system across Australia.Ultimately, its effectiveness will be dependent on the competence of the CEO and the members of the advisory council, so it is important that we have the right people in those positions. I do note, however, that the advisory council will not provide advice to the regulator in relation to particular registered training organisations or particular VET accredited courses. Whilst the advisory council is there to oversee the regulator, I would have thought that, if we pull together a panel of nine people who have expertise in VET training, the regulator might want to take advice from them about all sorts of matters relating to VET training in Australia. Why waste the experience that these people will supposedly have? Regardless of whether its simply to do with the regulators position, or whether it is to do with actual courses or, indeed, other training organisations, I would have thought that that panel should be there to provide all kinds of advice. It doesnt mean the regulator, or the government for that matter, has to take the advice, but they should at least consult the council wherever an issue arises where its advice could very well be useful.As I said earlier, this legislation tinkers around the edges of the skills crisis in Australia. Like so much of what this government does, there is a lot of spin over substance with respect to it. Theres been much fanfare and big announcements by this government, but often very little delivered. I refer to the announcement by the government in March of this year that up to $21,000 would be allocated between 1 January and 30 September for each apprentice or trainee employed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Again, that was a measure that I welcomed, and I think it was the right thing to do. At the time, the government claimed that the measure would support up to 70,000 small businesses employing around 117,000 apprenticeships. What we dont know, and what we havent heard since—and Ive certainly never heard any statistics with respect to this—is: what was the take-up rate of that support? It seems to me that, because the government hasnt been using the statistics, perhaps the take-up rate wasnt very high. If it was, Im happy to be corrected. Its a matter that Ive got an interest in and I would certainly like to know. As I say, its a matter where I suspect it was a case of the government putting spin over substance once again. There have been debates in this House time and time again with respect to skills training across Australia. There is no doubt in my mind that it is an important issue. And there is no doubt in my mind that over recent years this country has done badly with respect to skills training.Recently in South Australia we also had commentary that the naval shipbuilding work that is proposed for South Australia might hit a stumbling block because we simply dont have enough skilled people in that state. I suspect that a lot of the skilled people we did have may have left the state because of the work winding down the way it did—again, under this government. If that is the case its a sad indictment on this government that it allowed the situation to get to that point. I would certainly hope, given that much of that shipbuilding work hasnt started yet, that in the years ahead and in the immediate years ahead we will recommit to training people so that, once the work does start and the employment is there, it is South Australians, and Australians for that matter, who take up that work, rather than what were seeing elsewhere which is people coming in from overseas in order to fill the skills shortages.Ill finish on this note: over recent months I have had discussions with several people who have come to me because they have a son or a daughter who hasnt been able to get work and, in particular, hasnt been able to get work in a trade that they were pursuing. They cant get the work because the employers find it impossible to take them on when there is not enough support for them. Again, it is the industry itself, the people that would otherwise say, I would take on an apprentice if I was given more support from the government. But they wont. Again, I think its high time that this government understood that there are opportunities there, that there are young people who would like to enter a trade or a career of one kind or another but they are simply blocked out because for too long this government has cut the funding—as has the state government in my state of South Australia—that would enable those people to pursue the career or the vocation they would like to.","National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Governance and Other Matters) Bill 2020","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ZAPPIA (Makin) ","(13:16):"

But even now, as the world turns its focus to the coronavirus, it is the worlds poorest countries where millions of children are being affected by diseases such as polio, diphtheria and measles where we cant let up on the cause of providing vaccinations to those people.Over the next five years, Gavi will spend over $800 million to immunise over 140 million children. As part of this, Gavi will provide $200 million to continue immunisation programs through the COVID pandemic and will later organise catch-up immunisation campaigns once it is safe to do. Immediately to our north, over 400,000 children in neighbouring Papua New Guinea will receive life-saving vaccines, and four million Indonesian children will access pneumococcal vaccinations at a quarter of the cost.

Celebrations often re-enact the journey Bloom makes across Dublin, a mock epic that reflects the structure of Homers Odyssey. Its almost a century since the novels publication and, to the day, 116 years since the day this amazing book is set—a journey of exile, of history. It is a book, as TS Eliot said, to which we are all indebted, and from which none of us can escape.Ulysses revolts against history as hatred and violence. And while its often said to be about everything, it is fundamentally about love. It is almost as funny as Derry Girls. It elevates everyday and ordinary lives to Homeric levels, injecting them with dignity. It finishes famously with Molly Blooms thoughts and memories and the most practical demonstration of the nature of love, and ends on a note of reconciliation. In Ulysses, James Joyce faithfully re-created the sounds, smells and rhythms of Dublin from semi-exile with a painstaking eye to detail—a love letter to home. Bloomsday is a day that brings much of the Irish diaspora around the world together. Normally the Irish community would be celebrating Bloomsday at the Canberra Irish Club in Weston, in the heart of the Bean electorate. Happy Bloomsday to all!

Music venues have told me of the stress of paying commercial rent and insurance when the business is bringing in no income. The governments inadequate solution—a rent relief code of conduct—leaves venues vulnerable, requiring them to negotiate individually with landlords.

53,0,0,0,1,1,"Drum, Damian, MP",56430,"Nicholls","Nats","N/A",4580," Ive been very vocal recently, urging the Victorian government to build a designated tunnel from Southern Cross Station to West Footscray Station as an integral part of the Melbourne Airport Rail Link project. The concept of a designated tunnel to take six to eight trips to Tullamarine every hour has featured strongly on the Labor Party governments press releases and websites. Last year, if you entered the Big Build website, you could read about the Melbourne Airport Rail Link project. It said: … additional tracks between Sunshine and the CBD, to cater for faster, more frequent metro and regional trains. This would most likely be a new tunnel that would be part of the Melbourne Airport Rail Link. If you go onto that same website now, the Labor government in Victoria has deleted all references to the tunnel. On 16 October 2018, they had a press release and a big launch, saying: … additional tracks between Sunshine and CBD, most likely through a new tunnel, which would also be used by airport-bound trains and integrated with the Airport Rail Link. If you go onto that website now, youll see that that press release has been doctored.In 2017, Daniel Andrews said, effectively: When we build this airport rail link, it needs to benefit every single Victoria. In our view the airport rail link has the potential to unlock western Victoria and northern Victoria. It seems as though Daniel Andrews and Jacinta Allan have walked away from all these promises. Theyve walked away from all of these comments that they made previously, and now theyre going to burn western Victorians and burn northern Victorians. Theyre going to burn everybody, just to put in a cheap and nasty airport rail project.","Melbourne Airport Rail Link","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[18]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr DRUM (Nicholls—Chief Nationals Whip) ","(13:56):"

We restore the revenues that those essential services rely on not by higher taxes. We secure that higher revenue by ensuring we get people back into work, that we get investment back into our economy and that we see our economy grow again. That is why our JobMaker plan is about keeping the tax cuts that we have legislated in this place, and we remain absolutely committed to keeping those tax cuts to give Australians that continued incentive in the economy.This includes the changes that we need to make to skills, working with the states and territories; the changes we need to make in workplace and industrial relations; the changes we need to make to ensure that we deregulate our economy so businesses can invest and employ people and find their way back; the changes we need to make in infrastructure and increasing our investment. As we said yesterday, almost $10 million has been brought forward in new investment just in the last eight months alone.Of course, there is much more to come in this area as we continue to roll out the JobMaker plan, which ensures we can get the growth that will provide the revenues to support the essential services were committed to, such as the $31 billion in extra spending on hospitals in the five-year agreement signed by all states and territories, which was secured by the Minister for Health.

When it talked about younger workers—who, like female workers, have been really badly hit by this COVID crisis—it made the point that payroll jobs in the final week of May increased by two per cent for those aged under 20, compared to 0.4 per cent for all jobs. Thats a reflection of the fact that some of those sectors where young people and women are more prominent—and Im talking about the hospitality sector and the retail sector—are starting to open up.

Australians are doing it tough in this once-in-a-century pandemic, particularly older Australians: those who are either in retirement or planning for retirement. Thats why the Morrison government has acted, with $750 cash payments—one that started on 31 March and another to come in July—that have been supporting more than two million pensioners. Weve also reduced the drawdown rates by 50 per cent to give retirees more control over their savings. Weve also reduced the deeming rates by 0.75 per cent so at the lower level they are at a quarter of one per cent. The Council on the Ageing has welcomed these measures and said that the government is helping to get senior Australians through this crisis.Im asked about any alternative policies.

As someone who led an international initiative on womens economic empowerment before coming to this place, she is in a terrific position to support her community at this time. I know that she would understand really well that the choices women make for themselves, for and with their families, in the workplace are all optimised by a strong and resilient economy. Women are indeed making a significant contribution to our COVID-19 response and recovery. Women are on the frontlines, making up the majority of employees in essential services like health, education, aged care and disability services.Prior to COVID-19, womens full-time employment and female participation reached record highs. We will absolutely continue our focus on our $158 million womens economic security plan, which we were the first to introduce and which the Prime Minister said earlier this week will get a refresh. Women have been the hardest hit through COVID-19. Our participation figures show that 325,000 women have lost their jobs and the womens workforce participation rate has fallen 0.9 percentage points to 58.4 percentage points, and this is partly due to the fact, of course, that women are heavily represented in sectors with sharp decreases in paid work: hospitality, tourism and retail. We know that increasing womens participation in paid employment will assist in accelerating Australias overall recovery.Our record investments are supporting women and men, households and businesses through COVID-19. Half of all JobKeeper payments are going to female workers. It has been a lifeline for female-run businesses, like that of Kerry Haskew in my electorate of Farrer, who runs a small lingerie business in city walk in Albury. She wrote to me to say that she really appreciated the relatively quick and easy way she was able to get support through JobKeeper. Kerry doesnt want a continual handout. She wants her business open. It opened on 1 June. She wants people walking in the door. She loves her elderly customers. She wants shoppers in the streets. She knows that this government has been there when she needed it.We saw some welcome news today. ABS payroll data shows that the number of females in jobs increased by 1.4 per cent through May. Weve got more work to do, but its a really encouraging start.Outside the workplace, unfortunately, the pandemic has meant domestic violence rates have increased. We are still working hard. The support that we added during the crisis included our domestic violence initiatives and our information campaign. Whether it be womens safety, participation in the workforce or financial security, we want to see every woman empowered to make, for themselves and their families, the choices that a strong, resilient economy will allow.

You have to appreciate there are some complexities. You have to understand theres complexity around the clean-up in that some of those buildings contain asbestos. It took time to get personnel into those areas to make assessments about whether there was asbestos and whether any unsafe trees had to be felled so that they could get people in safely. You cannot put other Australians in harms way. These are professional men and women who make these assessments. They are held by the state governments, who pay them to make sure that they keep all of us safe.The New South Wales government has done that. In fact, they have made a commitment to have all homes in New South Wales cleaned up by the end of July. In Eden-Monaro, let me tell you what the numbers are as of 16 July. In the Snowy Valley LGA, 188 homes have been cleared out of 208. In Snowy Monaro, 11 out of 31. In Queanbeyan, 48 out of 64. In Bega Valley, 375 out of 431. In Eurobodalla, 570 out of 610.

In particular, she has been a great advocate and supporter for headspace Southport, along with all of the young people on the Gold Coast.We know the challenge of youth mental health is real, profound and significant. One in four young Australians in any one year face some form of mental health challenge. Over 400 beautiful young Australians took their lives in 2018, for which we have the confirmed figures. Last year, one of the central features of the budget put forward by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer was a youth mental health package of over $500 million. Going into the pandemic, however, we knew that more needed to be done and that the challenges that were already there required additional investment, so the first phase of what we did was a $1.1 billion investment in primary health. In particular, there was a $74 million investment in mental health with a significant focus on support for youth and children: $2 million for Kids Helpline and $6.75 million for the work of the Head to Health youth focused website. All of these things have been helping to make a difference.More broadly, telehealth, now with over 14 million services, has been a prime deliverer of additional mental health support for young Australians and, in fact, for all Australians. The second phase of the mental health program through COVID-19 had a particular youth mental health focus—a program of over $40 million, coupled with the pandemic mental health plan. That led into the third phase, which was the practical research focus. That was a $20 million investment, with half of that to be spent on suicide prevention, with youth as a fundamental part of that.Going forward, we have more work to do. Its something that every member of this House believes in and is passionate about. Its part of our fundamental responsibility. In that context, Im delighted that we have been able to announce in the last week an additional $24 million for headspace to expand services in headspace centres around the country. We currently provide approximately $120 million a year for headspace, but this investment will provide additional services for young people in their teens and early 20s in over 40 different headspace centres. I had the privilege of visiting headspace Queanbeyan, where Tiana talked about the way in which headspace has been able to transform her life and her experience. The investment were making there is similar to the investment were making in over 40 other headspace centres.

So it took time to bring the community and civic leaders together. We didnt want a Canberra led recovery. Those on the other side would like to see that its all centralised from here. We wanted engagement with the local community. Therefore, the commitment to the rebuilding of those communities will be important, community by community. In terms of having media people within the National Bushfire Recovery Agency stood up immediately, that was important. There was important information that needed to be put out. In fact, $240 million in immediate relief was put out. It was important that the message got to people. It was important that we helped the states to disseminate information about the small business grants, the farmer grants and concessional loans to ensure that people understood what was available. They were going through trauma. It was important that we were able to communicate to them the programs that were available both centrally and on the ground. Thats why we continue to put additional personnel from the National Bushfire Recovery Agency on the ground. This has been a multifaceted approach.The next phase is recovery. Its about the local economic recovery plans—a local led recovery, not a Canberra led recovery—ensuring that locals are empowered to make decisions about what that recovery looks like in terms of Building Back Better. They should determine that, not someone from Canberra. Thats exactly the strategy that weve undertaken and will continue to undertake because we want to build this nation back better for those who have been impacted. This is what its all about: calmly and methodically working through, ensuring that the $2 billion in additional support will get out there. In fact, we said we would only be able to have $500 million out by 30 June, but we will have $1 billion of the $2 billion fund out by 30 June. Thats because weve been able to communicate with those who need it the most—getting it out of our pocket and into their pockets. Thats exactly what you should do in this recovery: look after them. And weve done that, calmly and methodically, and we say to those opposite that we are open and transparent, happy to work through any issue you may have.

As a former vice-chancellor of one of our leading universities, she has a longstanding commitment to the welfare of young Australians, so its a very appropriate question for her to be asking.Through the COVID-19 pandemic we have seen a very high usage of the internet by children and by adults. The internet is an extraordinarily valuable resource. But, sadly, a percentage of human interactions online, just as offline, are not positive ones. Thats why its very important that we have the eSafety Commissioner there to protect Australians, particularly children, against some of the risks they may encounter online. Indeed, our government took the lead in establishing what was first called the Childrens eSafety Commissioner in 2015, before its responsibilities were expanded, and was one of the leading governments around the world in making sure that there was an agency there to protect Australians. The eSafety Commissioner is funded with $90 million over the next four years.Over this period, traffic to the website of the eSafety Commissioner—esafety.gov.au—has doubled as Australians, particularly children, parents, carers and teachers, come forward seeking practical advice and assistance. More than 28,000 people have registered for one of eSafetys free webinars since mid-March. Very importantly, the eSafety Commissioner has the power to intervene if a child is the subject of cyberbullying, and the eSafety Commissioner has the power to take action where people are the victim of image based abuse. And Im sorry to say that we have seen a 200 per cent increase in reports of image based abuse coming to the eSafety Commissioner during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic, with more people at home and online. Im very sorry to report to the House that weve seen an 80 per cent increase in reports of child sexual abuse content.

167,0,1,0,0,1,"Porter, Christian, MP",208884,"Pearce","LP","N/A",4597," I thank the member for his question and for his great commitment to this area. The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sexual Crimes Against Children and Community Protection Measures) Bill 2019 will shortly be put to a final vote in the Senate. In fact, in its original form, it was introduced on 13 September 2017. Absolutely central to that bill, as the Minister for Home Affairs elegantly explained, is minimum mandatory penalties. It is the absolutely central part of that bill. Why has the government never given up on minimum mandatory penalties for child sex offences? It is because the type of offending they sentence are the worst of the worst, because the instances of this type of offending are increasing, because the Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation tells us there has been a 123 per cent increase in the average number of reports of child exploitation it receives each month, and because theres clearly undeniable evidence that sentencing does not align with community expectations and therefore doesnt provide sufficient or general specific deterrence.Last year, in 39 per cent of Commonwealth offences in this area, the offenders did not receive a single day in jail. There have been sentences where the maximum penalty is 15 years, such as that of a 22-year-old who committed sexual activities online with someone whom they thought was a 12-year-old child and the offender received nine months—15 years; nine months.Members opposite have been opposed to minimum mandatory sentencing as a matter of principle. But, in assessing that, let me read statements of Senator Penny Wong on the introduction of mandatory minimums in the Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures Bill 2010. She said:The measures in the bill will address the often serious consequences of people-smuggling … The bill will act as a greater deterrent for people smugglers …… … …The bill is a measured response to a growing problem and demonstrates the government’s commitment to addressing the serious nature of people-smugglingTo assess whether or not that was a matter of principle or hypocrisy, listen to those sentences again with a slight change to the words and answer whether it now makes more or less sense: The measures in the bill will address the often serious consequences of child sex offending. The bill will act as a greater deterrent for child sex offenders. The bill is a measured response to a growing problem and demonstrates the governments commitment to addressing the serious nature of child sex offences.

Can I thank all the states and territory education ministers for working with the Commonwealth to agree on this key achievement: the establishment of this $50 million national evidence institute. Dr Jenny Donovan will be the inaugural director from 1 July 2020.

One of the key foundations of life is the beginning journey for a child in a family environment, which consolidates the way in which nurturing love is the basis for a great opportunity. I want to acknowledge the member for Barton, because she and I, many years ago, worked on a document called Solid foundations, which went to a number of aspects not just of education but of social and emotional wellbeing—the elements of the way in which children were given an opportunity that gave them a better future. The Morrison government has invested a further $243 million under the IAS Safety and Wellbeing program, which includes funding for social and emotional wellbeing support for families and youth; violence reduction and victim support for families; crime prevention, diversion, rehabilitation and reinvigoration activities; and youth alcohol and substance misuse prevention and treatment activities. One of the things we need to think about in the protection of families and children is that, when they experience a disruptive life in which domestic violence or sexual abuse is part of their life, it leaves an indelible scar that carries on into their future years and often is a barrier to the success of their journey in life. It impacts on their education. And so the interventions that were putting into place are being done by working with community, working with our women, who are our leaders in so many fronts in health and education and family violence, and also working with our men so they can take their place in the protective role that they have to share and be involved in. If we are to change the dynamics, then its important that all of us in this chamber build on those strategies.Were focused every single day on getting more children to school, reducing suicide rates, which are a scourge on our communities, and creating jobs and economic opportunities for all Indigenous Australians—because all of those have flow-on effects that will make a difference. And we are succeeding. Successive governments have built success. We should celebrate success, not always focus on the gap. Whilst the new Close the Gap report has significant targets, we must celebrate every achievement.

205,0,0,0,1,1,"Chalmers, Jim, MP",37998,"Rankin","ALP","N/A",4607," This month Australians learned that we as a nation are in recession for the first time in almost three decades, and this week the Morrison government showed its true colours. This was the moment when the Prime Minister and the Treasurer snapped back from were all in this together to youre on your own when those opposite reverted to type—to the stale, failed policy of tough luck and cold charity, to the unfair and un-Australian notion that if you fall behind you get left behind.Every member of this side of the House understands that recessions arent about spreadsheets on a computer screen or some abstract technical jargon; theyre about people, their jobs and their living standards. Theyre about whether people can afford to pay their rent or their mortgage or put food on the table or school shoes on their kids. Theyre about whether or not as a nation we can avoid the long-term unemployment which can turn into long-term, entrenched disadvantage and which risks cascading down through the generations in communities like the one I represent and those represented by this side of the House.These are serious times, and people are understandably anxious. Hundreds of thousands of people have already lost their jobs. Just today, in the new data, we learnt that 750,000 jobs have already disappeared and that the impact of those job losses has been felt disproportionately by women, by younger workers and by people employed in industries dominated by casual and insecure work. Faced with this avalanche of reality about what this recession means for real people in real communities, those opposite are leaving those workers behind. Theyre leaving those workers in the lurch. Theyre leaving them hanging when it comes to important updates and reviews of the JobKeeper program and the budget update, which was promised for June but now, all of a sudden, has been pushed back beyond the Eden-Monaro by-election in July.Three decades of continuous economic growth, which began under Labor and was defended by Labor when it was last most at risk, has now come to an end under those opposite because of this pandemic. On this side of the House we have always acknowledged the devastating economic consequences of this diabolical health crisis. We know that the pandemic arrived without warning, but the truth is that weakness in the economy did not. And, with us having acknowledged the role of this pandemic in ending that remarkable period of continuous economic growth, its now time for those opposite to acknowledge three things. One is that we entered this crisis from a position of weakness because of seven years of incompetence, inaction and ineptitude which saw slowing growth and stagnant wages, business investment going backwards, productivity flatlining, record household debt and record public debt. We came into this crisis from a position of weakness. We werent as strong as we needed to be in confronting something as serious as this. Thats the first thing.The second thing that they need to acknowledge is that stupendous errors have been made in the implementation of programs that should be doing more good in our economy than they are—and Ill come back to that. The third thing for them to acknowledge is that as it stands today, despite all the speeches and all the slogans, there is still no comprehensive plan for jobs and the recovery and the future of this country. Australians cant afford for those opposite—having bumbled the economy before, having botched the response—to bumble the recovery as well. Every Australian needs the government to do a much better job of managing this crisis and this recovery than they were doing managing the economy in the lead-up to this pandemic.Perhaps the defining debacle of all of this has been the JobKeeper program. Im referring in part, but not wholly, to the biggest-ever error made in any budget by any Treasurer in the history of the Commonwealth—the Treasurers $60 billion JobKeeper blunder. That matters, because they turned people away on the basis the program was full only to cough up late on a Friday that it was actually three million workers short.But thats not the only error those opposite have made with the JobKeeper program. Theyve left too many people out of it, and that means theyve left too many Australians behind. They introduced it too late and it was too narrow, and now they risk withdrawing it too soon and too bluntly. The tragedy of this is that the JobKeeper wage subsidies could have been such an important part of dealing with this crisis.The government actually started with the right instinct, which was to try and keep as many people connected to their employer as possible, and we supported that. We support it now. But what they showed is that you cant trust a bad government with a good idea. Its a good idea but badly implemented and badly communicated, and Australians are paying the price for it. And thats why even the Reserve Bank, including today in their minutes, have said multiple times that the economy is going to be weak for some time, so dont withdraw the support too soon. All that will do will mean that weve spent all of this money turning an April-May problem into a September-October problem so that people are in strife later in the year instead of earlier in the year.In question time this week, we asked the government why, if the JobKeeper enrolments were down, they wouldnt admit that the jobseeker enrolments were up. We learned the answer from the committee chaired by Senator Gallagher, the shadow finance minister. Those opposite are all of a sudden pretending that JobKeeper and jobseeker are one and the same. The truth is, on the side of the House, wed prefer people in work if they wanted to be in work. Wed rather people maintain that connection. The original instinct of this program was right; its just been bungled in its implementation. We want people in work, and we prefer people in work.When asked today about how many people would be sacrificed in September to this snapback that the Prime Minister is clinging to, all those opposite wanted to do was to talk about the Labor Party. It wasnt that long ago that this Prime Minister was saying, In this country, if you have a go, you get a go. And now hes saying: You had a go. Off you go to Centrelink.What do those opposite say to all of those Australians whove been left behind by the incompetence and ineptitude of those opposite and sacrificed to their cold and cruel ideology? They say to the Australian people: Dont worry. I know youve lost your job, but our recession is not as bad as Americas. Their main defence—and we know whats going on in the United States—is: Dont worry. Its not as bad as whats happening in the US or Italy. They say: Dont worry. We know youve lost your job, but its not quite as bad as we originally feared. It is for that family. It is for that breadwinner. It is for that community. Their defence that its not as bad as the US or not as bad as they feared is cold comfort if youre one of the hundreds of thousands of Australians who headed off to lengthen the unemployment queues.Just as having no plan before the crisis was a recipe for economic weakness, it is so too a recipe afterwards. The Prime Minister gave a speech yesterday which tried to do two things at once. It tried to argue this crisis will be with us for longer but that the support should be drawn out sooner. You cant have it both ways. Hes got to pick which of his comments is true. It makes no economic sense for him to be talking up austerity at the same time hes pretending hes game for growth.In serious times like this, we need a Treasurer whos up for the task as well. Instead, we get the butterfingers of Australian politics—the Treasurer who will always have his name on the first recession in three decades, the Treasurer who will always have his name on the biggest blunder ever made in a Commonwealth budget since Federation and the Treasurer who printed the mugs saying we are back in black only to deliver the biggest ever deficits in the history of this nation. We need those opposite to do better.The Leader of the Opposition has said rightly that Australians have a choice. The choice before all of us is whether we want to snap back to the worst elements of the economy before this crisis—all the insecure work, stagnant wages, flatlining living standards and record household debt—or whether we can go forward to something better, and that is the question before this parliament. We wont get anything better if those opposite continue to bungle JobKeeper, or if they fail to understand that this recession, on their watch, is about real people in real communities. We wont get there without a plan or without leadership, and those opposite are providing neither.

206,0,0,0,1,1,"Howarth, Luke, MP",247742,"Petrie","LNP","N/A",4609," Ive been overwhelmed by the number of calls that Ive received to my electorate office in response to the governments handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Im sure that the member for Grey has had the same number, and the members for North Sydney, Chisholm and OConnor have all experienced it. And I suspect some of those on the other side of the House have also had calls from people about how pleased they are with the governments performance and about how the Prime Minister has handled this in a very statesmanlike manner by calling the national cabinet together—Australias first national cabinet. Australians desperately want leadership. They wont get it from this shadow Treasurer and they wont get it from this Leader of the Opposition, but they will get it from this Prime Minister.When the Prime Minister spoke about our JobMaker plan in question time today, it was really inspiring to hear what he had to say—to hear that he understands Australians need and rely on the services that we deliver. We want to ensure that revenues are restored, that people get back to work, that the Queensland borders are opened, that tourism is flourishing, and that the services that people rely on are delivered. We know that getting people back to work pays for all the services that people rely on, whether its the $31 billion in additional funding that we pumped into hospitals, including the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, or the almost $20 billion thats been forecast for schools funding. When I was elected, we were spending something like $14 billion a year on schools. Its currently $21 billion a year. Fantastic! And those services can be delivered to our children because of the economy that were in. We want to make sure that the economy is up and running again as quickly as possible.But what we hear from those opposite and what we just heard from the shadow Treasurer is a whole lot of negativity. He actually used the words: sacrificed in September. Those are the words of the shadow Treasurer. We heard nothing from him about jobseeker and the doubling of jobseeker, for those important people who are living in public housing or are looking for work or are doing it a bit tough—nothing from the opposition acknowledging the help that is being provided to those people. We heard nothing about the emergency relief funding thats being rolled out around the country or about the JobKeeper payment that is helping so many Australians and the many small businesses who have called us and said, Thank you for what youre doing and the plan that you have in place. Deputy Speaker, do you know that the stimulus that the federal government has delivered is almost ten times larger than the states combined? Its unbelievable what the Australian government has been able to roll out to help so many people.Those opposite dont have a plan. The member opposite, the shadow Treasurer, just criticised the Prime Ministers speech to CEDA yesterday. The opposition leader didnt even do a speech, and he has criticised JobKeeper because the forecast was wrong. If those opposite had been in government it wouldnt have been an underspend, I can tell you that, Deputy Speaker. It would have been a big overspend. So I do find it appalling that this opposition come in here at this time and try to talk down the economy—sacrifice in September is the sort of language that the shadow Treasurer brings to this place to inspire people.I heard the Prime Minister speak today about the JobMaker plan. People are inspired by that, and I know they are because people have been calling my electorate office. Theres also a plan for manufacturing—making it, for the agriculture sector—growing it, and for the resource sector—mining it, and there are infrastructure projects being rolled out around the country—servicing it.In relation to manufacturing, the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology has spoken about the Manufacturing Modernisation Fund, which is a really good opportunity to help all Australians support manufacturing. This government has supported over 200 job-creating projects, investing over $215 million; thats over $1 million on average per project. Were also investing in homegrown companies like Kestrel Manufacturing and Clets Linen—both in Labor-held electorates, I might say. Theyre manufacturing personal protective equipment and looking for opportunities to export. Under this minister, weve also set up service hubs and new cybersecurity hubs. In my own electorate, the Dolphins leagues club were recently hacked by someone and theyve had to strengthen their own cybersecurity, but weve set up hubs in Brisbane, Townsville and the Sunshine Coast. Weve also set up SME export hubs in Boothby in South Australia and in Melbourne to work with businesses and help businesses gain access to international markets.In the agriculture sector, we are doing a lot to help grow the economy. Were making sure the agriculture sector has the workers it needs, and were making sure that the freight assistance to support that is also in place. Theres a lot happening in agriculture. The resources minister, Minister Pitt, spoke about mining yesterday. He said that the Australian resources sector has contributed around nine per cent to Australias GDP and 25 per cent growth of all our exports have been coming into the economy in this sector in the last couple of years—some $100 billion in the iron ore industry and $50 billion in liquid natural gas. Weve got a lot of plans in place in the resources sector and in agriculture, and what do we get from the Queensland Labor Party? We get roadblocks at every opportunity. Thats why we need a new government come October in Queensland. There are good women up there who understand that we need to get rid of the red tape and the roadblocks that others are putting up—LNP candidates like Amanda Cooper in Aspley; Kerri-Anne Dooley in Redcliffe; Yvonne Barlow in Murrumba; and Kara Thomas in Pine Rivers. We would love to see them elected.It is nice, by the way, that the federal government is investing in Victoria as well. We are investing in both of those hubs in Jagajaga and Scullin. Unlike the Victorian Labor Party—and unlike what is happening with Adem Somyurek at the moment—at least we are actually looking after Victoria.In relation to infrastructure projects, weve just seen $1.8 billion invested in councils right around the country to make sure that councils can get jobs happening right now. That involves projects in my own electorate to upgrade places like the Clontarf Beach Scout Group and a road upgrade at Bonnet Parade and Mango Hill Boulevard, where weve invested $555 million. These projects, relying on councils, are happening right around Australia.The JobKeeper wage subsidy program has been really helpful to people. The cash flow incentives for small and medium businesses have been essential. Some small-business owners told me the other day that they received a $50,000 rebate in PAYG. Weve put in place a 50 per cent wage subsidy for apprenticeships and a safety net for companies facing financial stress. The instant asset write-off is really helping the economy: you can invest up to $150,000 and ensure that that item is written off straightaway.I would say to the member opposite who raised this matter of public importance that what hes saying is false, because the calls that we are receiving are overwhelmingly supportive, right around the electorate. When I get out and talk to people, theyre really happy with what the government is doing. Theres more work to be done, but I believe that the Prime Minister is providing the leadership that this country needs and the plans—particularly our JobMaker plan—to ensure that, over the next five years, we continue to go from strength to strength.Australia is the best place to live. I am proud to live here and to be a member of this House. I say to those opposite: dont talk negatively and try to scare people. Look at what youre doing and how you can contribute to a better Australia.","COVID-19: Economy","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr HOWARTH (Petrie—Assistant Minister for Community Housing, Homelessness and Community Services) ","(15:44):"
207,0,0,0,1,1,"Jones, Stephen, MP","A9B","Whitlam","ALP","N/A",4611," The fact is Australia is in its first recession in 30 years, and ordinary people are worried about their jobs. In my electorate, those with a job are concerned if they are going to keep it. Those without a job dont know when they are going to get another one. These serious times mean we need a serious government. Sadly, we do not have one.Its a fact that, before coronavirus, business investment was falling off a cliff. It is a fact that, before coronavirus, wages growth had flatlined. In fact, workers share of national income was at its lowest level in decades. It is a fact that debt had exceeded $500 billion. It is also a fact that all of these problems havent gone away; they have got worse. But we do not have a government with a plan to deal with them. In fact, we have a government which is seriously contemplating making each and every one of those problems even worse.Its a lamentable fact that, come October, a million Australians are going to get an income cut as a direct result of the decisions of this government. We are told that somehow $40 a day was insufficient for those one million and more Australian workers who lost their jobs at the commencement of the coronavirus. It was insufficient in March, but somehow it is going to be just enough in September when all of those workers on JobKeeper, many of whom are in industries which are still being affected by the restrictions, are going to have their support slashed, and business support is slashed as well.The government says in response to these criticisms that Australian workers do not want a handout. Well, isnt it remarkable that that is exactly what this governments decisions are going to leave millions of workers doing? Im referring to the fact that it has encouraged two million workers to raid their retirement savings. These workers are going to be more reliant, not less reliant, on pensions come their retirement because, for every $20,000 that is withdrawn, its probably going to cost them in excess of $100,000 in retirement. The well-off people on the other side might yawn and say, Thats nothing, but if you are a low-wage worker in an electorate such as mine that is probably the majority of your retirement savings. The government think its nothing that these workers cleaned out their retirement savings accounts.Because this government was so slow and so sluggish at putting in place support for businesses and support for workers, many of those workers had no choice but to raid their superannuation. Because of the misadministration of this scheme, weve had workers savings exposed to frauds and rip-offs. It has been a honeypot for fraudsters.","COVID-19: Economy","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr STEPHEN JONES (Whitlam) ","(15:54):"

This has not been an easy task. The current crisis we find ourselves in is unprecedented. But, thankfully, the coalition governments strong economic policies have put us in a good position to bounce back. Without the coalition governments decisive economic response, we would not be in the position we are in now.The impact of COVID-19 has been severe, not only for our health system but for the economy as well. While those on the other side might try to attack us for our mismanagement of the economic crisis, it would be important for them to note that we are in a global crisis. The average fall in GDP across OECD countries in the March quarter was six times that of Australia. Our economy has only contracted by 0.3 per cent, which is negligible in comparison to countries which experienced the full extent of the outbreak at the same time as us—including COVID-19 successes, such as Germany, which had its economy shrink by 2.2 per cent in the same period.Government initiatives like JobKeeper have helped 7,000 organisations in my electorate of Chisholm. These organisations have been able to keep people on the books and off an already strained welfare system. Without this program, unemployment was projected to rise to 15 per cent instead of the worst-case scenario of 10 per cent that is currently predicted. In what universe is this not a success in economic management? Additionally, the coronavirus supplement paid along with the jobseeker payment has effectively doubled the payment for those who have lost their jobs and are doing it tough. This has stopped Australians from having to default on their loans, which could have led to a wider collapse of the banking and financial systems. That could have had wide-reaching consequences for the economy. Im glad we have managed to avoid that possibility through the coalitions measured and well-considered policies. Of course, these measures can only be temporary. We, the government, are committed to ensuring that our economy can fully recover from the effects of the COVID-19 crisis. This is of incredible importance for Australia as a whole and cannot be rushed, and I wish those on the other side could understand that.Unlike those opposite, we do have a comprehensive plan for Australias economic recovery, based on growing the economy and creating jobs. We have already begun to unveil parts of this, such as the JobMaker program, which aims to fast-track infrastructure projects around Australia, creating jobs and promoting growth. We are committing a further $1.5 billion to immediately start work on small priority projects identified by the states and territories. This is on top of the $7.8 billion of projects we have already brought forward since November last year.Our economy is slowly reopening, with restaurants, cafes, bars and other non-essential services gradually beginning to serve customers again across Australia. This is a great help to those businesses that have been struggling through these difficult times. We should continue to work together to make sure that our hard work does not go to waste. We live in strange times, but I am glad we have a strong coalition government with a proven record of sound and strong economic management to lead us out of this challenging time.","COVID-19: Economy","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms LIU (Chisholm) ","(15:59):"

Well, from where Im standing nothing could be further from the truth. This government has no idea what regional areas like my electorate of Gilmore on the New South Wales South Coast need. They have no plan to help us recover from this year from hell. We suffered from drought, bushfires and floods, all well before coronavirus.At every opportunity I have stood here and asked those opposite to do more, to actually look at what areas like the New South Wales South Coast need for our economy. Even before the unprecedented threats of this year, I begged those opposite to invest in local jobs on the South Coast. We have the highest youth unemployment rate in New South Wales. Our youth unemployment rate before COVID, before bushfires, was 18.7 per cent. In the December quarter last year alone Nowras unemployment rate was 17½ per cent. They have had no plan to address this. They have done nothing.I have asked the government to invest in projects like the Princes Highway, affordable housing projects in Bomaderry and east Nowra—now theres a great idea: affordable housing—the East Arterial Road, Currarong Road, the Mogo adventure trail, the Eurobodalla hospital. The list goes on. That is without even considering the bushfire recovery. But what has the government done instead? They have given $25,000 so that people in city areas can renovate their homes. Apparently this will save our economy. We have people still living in caravans waiting for their homes that were destroyed by bushfire in December to be cleaned up. But this lot are more worried about home renos. How out of touch can this government be?Only last week we discovered the truth about the bushfire clean-up. Less than one in three destroyed and damaged properties in my electorate have been cleared. In the Shoalhaven 280 out of 772 destroyed properties have been cleared. In the Eurobodalla the story is even worse with 331 out of 1,195—absolutely appalling. All the government knows how to do is make flashy announcements and false promises. They dont know how to follow through. They leave people out time and time again. There was one tiny project under the Building Better Regions Fund and one tiny project under the Manufacturing Modernising Fund. People are still ineligible for the Drought Communities Program Extension. Job opportunities have been squandered and theres no plan to help communities on the South Coast.How about bushfire-proofing our emergency evacuation centres? When the bushfires came so many communities were cut off with only one road in and one road out. Then the power and the telecommunications failed. People were left with nothing. Ulladulla Civic Centre was lucky. The circus was in town and they kept the lights on. But what about elsewhere? People were left scared and frightened. Those opposite could listen to Lana, who said this on my Facebook page only yesterday:About evacuation centres: they should be made accessible. So many elderly people and those with mobility issues could not access the centres we had during this summer. I know people who were in motorised wheelchairs rolling around with a garden hose because there was no point evacuating to somewhere they couldnt access.This is outrageous. It should never happen anywhere. But where is the governments plan to fix it?We need to also make sure every region has a fit for purpose emergency operations centre. When the Currowan fire was split in two, the Eurobodalla emergency operations centre was run out of a community hall, complete with fold-up tables from Bunnings. The staff there did an amazing job, but why should they have had to do it in those conditions?The next tragedy might not be on the New South Wales South Coast, but you can bet it will be somewhere. So why is the government focusing on renovations that most people cant afford anyway? This is just too little too late for people impacted by bushfire. As Mirren said:Plenty of us would have qualified to help us rebuild, but weve already signed with builders, thus making us ineligible…Its a slap in the face.Indeed it is.

The member for Rankin spoke almost entirely on the governments intention to remove JobKeeper at some stage later this year. If more intellectual honesty had been put into the MPI, perhaps he might garner some support from this side of the floor, particularly from regional and rural representatives. But thats not what he did. What he did was put a fairytale as the first section of an MPI that was in two parts—firstly, the governments mismanagement of the economic crisis and, secondly, a lack of a comprehensive plan for the recovery.But for this government, but for the plans of this government through JobKeeper and jobseeker, Australia would be in a world of hurt. Labors constituents and many of the people who voted for Labor—hundreds and thousands of them—engaged in those programs. Why? It was because they were needed. Why? It was because it was good policy. As the member for Rankin said, it put food on the table. As my colleague said, it paid the rent. How can that side of the floor criticise this government for making good policy and keeping people in contact with their employers so that, when we get through this, there will be jobs for them? And that is exactly what has happened. There are many companies and businesses out there who are now saying: We dont need JobKeeper. Thank you for it, but we dont need it. I have been out there. I have spoken to businesses. I have spoken to people on the street. I have received emails from the people of those opposite, saying: I dont normally vote for your side of politics, but thank you. Thank you for putting out JobKeeper. Thank you for putting out jobseeker. For the Labor Party to sit on their side and criticise, it is just fanciful. In the first sentence of the storybook, Chicken Little walks outside and starting telling everybody that the sky is falling.Now, in addition, what we have is a policy to go forward. How can the Labor Party say that there is no planning for the future? We have $9 billion of infrastructure, $1.5 billion of which came out this week alone. There is JobMaker. We are putting jobs back out there. We are creating the environment for that. Politicians dont make jobs. They create the environment for jobs to be made, and that is what this government is doing.

St Kilda, St Kilda East, Elsternwick, Port Melbourne, South Melbourne, Southbank and Windsor are some of the hardest hit suburbs in the country because they are filled with casual workers. They are filled with people who work in hospitality, in retail and especially in our arts and entertainment industry, which is absolutely doing it extremely tough in this very difficult time. Sadly, many people in my electorate have been left behind by the Morrison government—left behind by this government that is all spin and no action, that doesnt have a plan to get our economy moving.This Prime Minister is very good on announcements but not so good on the follow-through. The government are happy to just sit there and watch industries fade away. Theyre happy sitting and watching the arts and entertainment industry fade away, just like they were happy to sit there and watch the car industry fade away to go offshore. I remember the Treasurer at the time stood in this place, goading the car industry to leave, and that is exactly what happened. And jobs in my electorate, in Port Melbourne, disappeared when that government didnt stand by the workers in this country, and we are seeing that once again.At the moment, one of the key things we need in this economy is certainty. The Prime Minister himself promised that the JobKeeper supplement would be here at least until September. Well, it didnt take long for that promise to be broken. After only four days the Prime Minister took the JobKeeper payment away from some of the most underpaid and hardest working people in the economy in our childcare workers. They have done a stoic job, our childcare workers, and what did the Prime Minister do? He ripped the certainty away after only four days. But its not surprising, because there has been a growing number of members on that side of the House who have been desperate to take away the support measures that we have been calling for for months.

Only moments after the Eden-Monaro by-election is over, this government is going to rip JobKeeper away from vulnerable businesses and businesses on the brink.Finally, the Minister for Housing and the assistant minister for housing, who led this debate for the government—well, it says a lot about that minister that, through his 10 minutes of whatever he ended up saying, he didnt mention his portfolio once. His portfolio is one of the most neglected portfolios. The government is letting down Australians by failing to invest in housing, failing to invest in the economy and failing to support Australian jobs.","COVID-19: Economy","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[12]","N/A","N/A"

225,0,0,0,1,1,"Wilson, Rick, MP",198084,"OConnor","LP","N/A",4617," Its my lucky day today, not only to be able to contribute to this debate on the member for Rankins matter of public importance but also to follow the member for Macnamara, whos made a couple of extraordinary statements through his contribution, one of them being that the member for Rankin, had he been the Treasurer, would have acted months before the coronavirus. Well, well never know whether the member for Rankin had some sort of crystal ball, but we do know that he would have been busy implementing his $370 billion worth of new taxes. Thats what he would have been doing. We know that. We know he would have been dismantling negative gearing. Imagine how that would be impacting the construction industry at the moment. So we do know a couple of things that the member for Rankin might have been doing, had the disaster occurred of a Labor government being elected last 18 May. But fortunately that didnt happen.I think its worth taking a moment to reflect on those very dark days at the end of March, when the national cabinet were meeting at least every couple of days and the Prime Minister was holding a press conference at the end of those meetings to inform the nation of the decisions that were being made. We heard of businesses being forced to close and the job losses that were coming. Obviously the health crisis was paramount at that point in time, but the Prime Minister also made it very clear that, at the same time, we had an economic crisis coming towards us.One of the things that gave me and, Im sure, many Australians who were watching those early press conferences great heart and confidence was that, when the Prime Minister was asked about what he considered was an essential job, he said, Every jobs an essential job. Every job is an essential job. Ive spoken in this place previously to acknowledge and thank some of the people who kept working through those dark days—the people who work in supermarkets, serving customers and stacking the shelves, and the truckies delivering those goods. Through those dark days, they were still turning up to work. They were fronting the public and taking the risk, and they deserve enormous credit for that.As that economic crisis started to unfold, the government announced the JobKeeper program, and immediately afterwards I had a phone call from a very good friend of mine who owns a car dealership and employs 61 people, including six apprentices. She said to me: This is a lifesaver. This is going to save my business and its going to save those 61 jobs. And that was repeated 4,100 times across the electorate of OConnor—4,100 businesses and individuals accessed that support. I happen to know that that dealership is now back on its feet and, if not running at full capacity, then certainly, in the lead-up to the end of the financial year, getting a lot of interest in new vehicles. Thats partly because of the $150,000 instant asset write-off—another initiative of the government to boost the economy and part of our plan to get businesses back on their feet and people back in jobs.So thats the impact of the JobKeeper program. As part of the governments plan to reinvigorate the economy, we stand firm for the electorate of OConnor. And the mining sector across my electorate never faltered. Every year it produces over $10 billion of income for our nation—it was $11.4 billion in the past financial year. And there are plenty of projects that are ready to go that just need their approvals. I note that the assistant minister who is assisting the Prime Minister with deregulation is here in the chamber this afternoon, and I know that part of the governments agenda and its plan going forward is to make those approvals quicker and simpler so that we can get those projects up and running and producing income for this nation.The other sector across my electorate which hasnt faltered, is standing firm and will produce income and revenue for this nation going forward is the agriculture sector. Our grain exports, our meat exports and our wool exports will carry this nation forward. Ive got to say, I was very, very pleased to hear today that the live export ship the Al Kuwait is loading at the moment and will be on its way to Kuwait shortly.

226,0,0,0,1,1,"Murphy, Peta, MP",133646,"Dunkley","ALP","N/A",4618," The Prime Minister and the Liberals now preside over the biggest blunder in Australias history, the $60 billion JobKeeper blunder, the first recession in decades, record debts and hundreds of thousands of Australians unemployed or left behind, and they dont have a comprehensive plan to get us out of it. In fact, with the only plan they have had, really—the JobKeeper plan—the member for Farrer appeared to call it a handout in question time today. Thats the attitude that this government has towards supporting people to get through this recession.The Grattan Institute recently analysed job losses. My electorate of Dunkley was estimated to have lost 7.9 per cent of jobs since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is the third worst hit electorate in Victoria, after Wannon and Mallee. We need a plan. Yet the JobKeeper wage subsidy isnt reaching all of the people in my electorate who need it. There are the casuals. There are the local government employees at PARC, for whom weve been fighting week after week after week, and the Treasurer says, Just go and lobby someone else; Im not interested in helping them. There are the employees at Monash Universitys Peninsula Campus. They are not covered by JobKeeper, and its not good enough. The governor of the Reserve Bank has warned the federal government that the JobKeeper Program may need to be kept going beyond September to avoid the Australian economy falling off a cliff.There is not a comprehensive plan for the recovery. Too many Australians are going to be left out when the Prime Minister tries to enact his snapback. Do you know who most of those Australians are going to be? Its women—who, apparently, are the essential workers at the frontline: childcare workers, hospitality workers, retail workers and those supermarket workers that the speaker before me mentioned. Women have been hardest hit during this pandemic. We dont care about them, apparently—thats from the government. The Minister representing the Minister for Women, in answering a question in question time today about how great this government has apparently been for women, called JobKeeper a handout. Thats their comprehensive plan to get us out of this recession, but 325,000 women have lost their jobs during the pandemic. Half of all JobKeeper payments are going to female workers. Wheres the plan for women? Payroll jobs for women declined by eight per cent, while male payroll jobs rose by 6.3 per cent.Wheres the plan for young people? Payroll jobs worked in by people under 20 decreased by 16½ per cent. Job losses have been concentrated in sectors with high concentrations of workers excluded from JobKeeper. One in three hospitality jobs have been lost. One in four arts and recreation sector jobs are gone. That is not a comprehensive plan for the future or to get us out of this and recover.Yesterday, the Prime Minister was reported as saying that one of the ways to recovery is a modernisation of how Australia approaches the economy. They would be nice words if they werent followed by, The plan for modernisation is simply deregulation. How about an actual plan for modernisation of Australias economy? Take the once in a lifetime chance. Have a triple bottom line accounting method. Lets have a look, actually, at every single policy for the future having an economic benefit, an environmental benefit and some social capital benefit. No. Lets just have deregulation. Lets have an economy for the future that supports people, that protects the environment, that builds new jobs in new manufacturing areas and that supports women, rather than just cutting everyone off at the knees with JobKeeper in September.My electorate has been so hard hit by job losses. Wheres our investment? Wheres our investment in our roads?Wheres bringing forward some Black Spot funding when we need it? Wheres the business case for the electrification of the train line to Baxter? Wheres the commitment to support the arts and the sports and the cultural hubs we have in Dunkley? We actually need a comprehensive plan to support people, to support institutions, and to grow our economy and leave no-one behind.","COVID-19: Economy","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[10]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms MURPHY (Dunkley) ","(16:25):"
227,0,0,0,1,1,"Hammond, Celia, MP",80072,"Curtin","LP","N/A",4620," Since this pandemic first came upon us, the government have made it quite clear that we had to tackle it on two fronts: on the health front and on the economic front. On the health front and because of the unified actions of all Australians, we have slowed the spread of the virus through quarantining, through social distancing and through social isolation through our border closures. Its been hard. I think the words challenging and unprecedented have never been used as much as in recent times. It has been hard, but Australians have sucked it up because its been in the best interests of the country. It has also hit us on the economic front, and the government have always been very clear both that it was going to hit and now that it is hitting us. As a result of the measures we had to take, our economy has been severely impacted. Economic activity has slowed and businesses and households are facing uncertainty.Like businesses everywhere across the country, many of the small and medium-sized businesses in my local community have been financially devastated by the measures put in place to protect our health and protect our safety in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Through my contact with local businesses over the last couple of months, I have heard about the extent of their financial losses; their fear and concern for their livelihoods, their families and their future; and their fear and concern for those they employ and for those they trade with. Amidst the fear and the worry, Ive also heard stories of the positive impact the various government support initiatives have had on many of these businesses. To many, JobKeeper, the measures boosting cash flow for employers and the expansion of the instant asset write-off have not just helped keep businesses in business and people in jobs; they have eased, to a certain degree, their anxiety and their fear.Of the 26,000 small and medium-sized businesses in Curtin, approximately 6,000 have accessed JobKeeper. Jane from Barchetta cafe in Cottesloe had to close her cafe on the beachfront in Cottesloe in an absolutely beautiful location. When the pandemic set in, she had to close the cafe. She employs 14 people, who she describes as family members. Jane was able to access JobKeeper. She was able to keep all of those 14 employees in employment, and, when restrictions were eased in Western Australia recently, she was able to reopen Barchetta with all of those 14 staff members. She also used the instant asset write-off scheme to do a bit of a renovation during the closure. She had hoped that we would come back, and so she bought some new equipment and did up the kitchen. She said it was great to be back at the cafe on the first day of their opening, and the local community loved it.Another example is Filament Coffee in Osborne Park. This is a new start-up that was hit by the pandemic within the first nine months of their operations. Filament Coffee is actually a cold brew coffee, and its supplied on tap and in cans around Western Australia. Id never tasted it before I went out to visit Filament Coffee. All I can say is that its got a bit of a caffeine kick to it! Aaron at Filament Coffee was able to access JobKeeper. Once again, this meant that his business could retain the very small number of employees that they had and continue to go forward as a start-up. For people who were starting up businesses in the last 12 to 18 months, it is that start-up phase that is the greatest pressure point of any business. Aaron accessed JobKeeper. He also accessed the instant asset write-off to purchase two new tanks of some description to store and help process the cold brew. Many of the sole traders in Curtin—sole traders who feared at the outset that theyd be left behind but were included within JobKeeper, because of feedback and because the Treasurer and our government recognised the importance of sole traders—were able to access JobKeeper. Ginger B is a gift store in Wembley run by Bianca, and she said that JobKeeper helped her keep her doors open. The Painted Teapot in Subiaco is run by a lovely woman called Tory, and she told me directly: Without JobKeeper we would have lost the business entirely. The support gave us some hope, and that glimmer of hope is now turning into confidence for the future. That is where this government is now focused: looking at the future, building that confidence, building on that hope and making Australia bounce back even harder and stronger.","COVID-19: Economy","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[11]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms HAMMOND (Curtin) ","(16:30):"

231,0,0,0,1,1,"Jones, Stephen, MP","A9B","Whitlam","ALP","N/A",4621," We disagree with the proposition put by the government. Quite simply, for the second time this week, the Senate has voted in favour of corporate transparency and, for the second time this week, the House of Representatives has been asked to concur. All Labor members of the House concur with the Senate. I understand that members of the crossbench also concur with the Senate, and so they should. It is important at any time that incorporated bodies have transparent reportage of financial arrangements. It is important at any time, but, in the midst of a financial crisis, with such economic uncertainty, it is more important than ever.These provisions, when inserted in the act 25 years ago, were a part of a temporary and transitional arrangement. They were supposed to be reviewed. They were not. They were supposed to be transitioned to be removed out. They were not. They apply to in excess of 1,000 very large corporate organisations, some of the biggest private companies in the country. We say that we should be removing this anomaly which applies one set of rules to some private companies and a different set of rules to other private companies. Its an unlevel playing field that those members opposite should be supporting Labor in having removed.When this matter was last before the House, there were three government members in the chamber. There was the member for Forde, a former financial planner. I fully expected him to jump and concur with Labor in defence of the financial planners, whose interests are being compromised by the fact that this bill is in deadlock, but there has not been a word from the member for Forde. There was the member for Goldstein, who finds it incredibly difficult to remain silent on any matter as soon as hes awake, but there has not been a word from the member from Goldstein. It fell to the assistant minister, the member for Petrie, to run the defence for the government. We were waiting with baited breath to hear what possible public interest reason the government could be advancing to have one set of rules apply to some corporate entities and another set of rules—a much more stringent set of reporting rules—to others.Unable to articulate the public interest reasoning for having two sets of rules, he tabled a document. Ive managed to obtain a copy of the document, and it reads as follows: The issue raised by this amendment is the subject of a recommendation in the Senate economic committees report Corporate Tax Avoidance Part 1: You cannot tax what you cannot see. The reason we reject it is that the House will not pre-empt the governments response to this recommendation as a part of its response to the Senate economic committees corporate tax avoidance report. Members of the House might be interested to know when this report was tabled. Maybe it was last year. Maybe it was the year before. Maybe it was the year before that. No, it was August 2015. Students of this place know thats three prime ministers and three treasurers ago. Weve been waiting a long time for this response. There can be no justification for further delay.This amendment has been recommended by the corporate regulator, who has found as follows:The lack of availability of public financial reports reduces transparency about possible indicators of tax avoidance or tax minimisation.So, when we ask again, What possible reason could members opposite have for rejecting this amendment thats been put and rejected? the only conclusion we can find is they are protecting their corporate mates and their corporate tax avoidance. There can be no other reason. Perhaps, as has been put elsewhere, there are large donors to the Liberal Party who find themselves on this list. I hope that is not the reason. I expect that the assistant minister at the table will leap to their defence and articulate a plausible public reason for why the rules should not be altered, and, if hes unable to do that, he should join with the crossbenchers and Labor and accept the message from the Senate.

232,0,0,0,1,1,"Sharkie, Rebekha, MP",265980,"Mayo","CA","N/A",4622," I will keep my comments very brief. I find it extraordinary that the government wants to send the message to the community that there should be one set of rules that apply to the super rich in Australia and another set of rules that apply to the rest of us. That is quite simply what this amendment seeks to do—to change what is currently existing so theres not one set of rules for the super rich and one for the rest of us. There is no public interest reason for the government not to support this amendment.I think its rather childish if the whole purpose of the government not supporting this amendment is simply because it isnt an idea of government. This place is supposed to be the contest of ideas. All good ideas should come up from this, and, if its a good idea that the majority of the place supports, like what happened in the Senate, then the government should take that idea and champion it. But whats happened twice now is that, because the government have the majority numbers in this chamber, they have not supported a very sensible amendment simply because its not their amendment. The Treasury Laws Amendment (2019 Measures No. 3) Bill 2019 is a good idea. We cant allow in Australia one set of rules for the rich and one for the rest of us.I implore the government: dont allow this to be the hill that you want to die on—on this issue in Australia now. Our community wants transparency. They dont want to see the richest people in Australia getting to hide their information, particularly when ASIC has been very clear that it believes that this rule should be overturned. I would urge the government, in the strongest possible terms, to accept this amendment. This is a good amendment for Australia.","Treasury Laws Amendment (2019 Measures No. 3) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms SHARKIE (Mayo) ","(16:42):"
233,0,0,0,1,1,"Mulino, Daniel, MP",132880,"Fraser","ALP","N/A",4623," I rise to support the comments made by the shadow Assistant Treasurer and the member for Mayo in arguing against the motion thats just been put on the Treasury Laws Amendment (2019 Measures No. 3) Bill 2019. Im going to begin my observations by misquoting Oscar Wilde and say that to reject a sound amendment once is unfortunate, but to reject it twice is careless.Were finding ourselves here again, debating the most simple of propositions and we are going to see speaker after speaker raise very sensible public policy reasons why one of the foundational elements of the regulation of the financial sector—transparency—should be applied on a level playing field, and there will be not a word from those opposite—not a word. Weve had what can only be described as a very lame document provided, as I think the shadow Treasurer may have said, in Marcel Marceau fashion. In the dead of night a document was passed across the chamber which said, We will get back to you on our reasons for rejecting this very sound amendment multiple times when we respond to a report that was lodged years ago. This is government at glacier pace. This is not something that warrants multiple years of consideration.Lets start with the basic proposition here—transparency. This is something I would hope people across the aisle could agree with: transparency is absolutely foundational to our regulation of the financial services sector. The royal commission highlighted this. The royal commission was something which we on this side had to drag those on the other side, kicking and screaming, into agreeing to. But, once it was established, it demonstrated with absolute crystal clarity why it is so important that we expose our financial services sector to transparency and why that transparency should be comprehensive and applied throughout on a level playing field. Im on the House economics committee. Time and time again, we see the results of that royal commission played out and the damage that has been done to individuals throughout our society because organisations werent held to account through transparent regimes.As earlier speakers have noted, this is a measure brought in as a temporary measure a quarter of a century ago. So thats only a small amount of time longer than this government is taking to respond to a straightforward report that was tabled many years ago. It is nonsensical that this measure, this exemption, is not being removed when it has been subject to such a sensible amendment. This exemption creates a two-tiered system without any public policy rationale, and the two-tiered system means that some of our countrys wealthiest individuals, through proprietary companies, are not having to report to ASIC in a way that other companies are. Its creating a two-tiered system with a completely arbitrary cut-off. Those companies that were on the list in 1995 dont have to report to ASIC; those after 1995 do. There is absolutely no public policy rationale for this distinction. In fact, it is such an absurd situation that even when companies want to remove themselves from the list, even when they dont want the exemption to apply to them, its impossible for that to occur. Malcolm Turnbull tried to get his company removed from the exemption and that couldnt happen. Thats one of the few actions hes taken in recent years that I support, but it was blocked by his own government.In government, we proposed getting rid of this exemption for companies with turnovers of more than $100 million. The coalition overturned that change. That was on the basis, in part, of the fact that some proprietary companies could face kidnapping or commercial disadvantage. So again, as I mentioned yesterday, this is the absurdity of where we are at the moment. Those opposite, to the extent that they have laid out any policy rationale for this distinction, seem to imagine that kidnappers have some exhaustive record of ASIC records and when companies were formed or when they got different exemptions or not. This is a bizarre situation that has absolutely no justification on public policy grounds.What we face here today is that the Senate is sending back a very sensible amendment which the Senate has passed twice now. It is an amendment that stands on its own merits, but its also an amendment that aligns with broader objectives of transparency that should be more important than ever. As the shadow Assistant Treasurer said, at times like this, transparency is more important than ever, particularly after all that weve seen coming out of the royal commission. We should support this amendment.","Treasury Laws Amendment (2019 Measures No. 3) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr MULINO (Fraser) ","(16:44):"
234,0,0,0,1,1,"Keogh, Matt, MP",249147,"Burt","ALP","N/A",4624," I invite members of the chamber to cast their minds back to history and to think about the chap Henry VIII of England, a former monarch, effectively, of this great land eventually. The things about those times were the issues that Henry was confronting. He had lords, earls and other noble people that he had to keep on his side because there were threats to the ongoing viability of his position as monarch. So Henry came up with the idea of the exchequer. It was a bit of a problem for some of these nobles. They didnt really want to be having to pay a lot of money to the king, and particularly to the exchequer, especially because Henry kept having wars. They were worried about the scrutiny that was being applied by Henrys central government, but they cut a bit of a deal. They decided that, if they could just make sure they didnt have to report on things so much to King Henry, it would make their lives a bit easier.In the times that you would expect something like this to happen—in the Middle Ages of England—Henry drew up a list of some of his favourite barons. He said: If youre on my favourites list, you dont need to report on your financials to the exchequer. You dont need to tell my government whats going on. Itll be fine. We might think: Thats the Middle Ages. That sort of makes sense. You might also think that that wouldnt be an arrangement that would last for terribly long, and it certainly wouldnt survive over multiple terms of parliaments and governments. But then we cast our way forward to 21st century Australia where we find that it has for reasons of transition, reasons of referral of power and reasons of old Corporations Law schemes—and, quite frankly, I will not bore this chamber with the history of the Corporations Law in this country in migrating from being a state based scheme to a national scheme, and you will all thank me for that! But somehow, in that process, we ended up with a list of private companies that were exempt from the application of law as it applied to everyone else.A fundamental tenant of this nation and of liberal democracies generally is that the law applies equally to everyone. You dont create a law and then create a special little list of your mates who dont have to comply with the law, and you especially dont create that list and never update it. This is so perverse and odd that even a former Prime Minister who was on the list couldnt get off the list when he wanted to get off the list. There is really no defence available to this government to justify now why a list from 1995—25 years ago—still exists, cant be removed and cant be fixed. For some reason, in this little area of Corporations Law that most Australians have paid no attention to, the government wants to continue to run a protection racket for this list that was set in 1995.Twenty-five years sounds like a long time ago. But to put that in a little bit of context—for the minister at the table, in particular—if only I had been able to incorporate a private company when I was in year 9, I might have had a chance of getting on that list. Thats how long this has been around. Yet now—after reviews, after recommendations and after the corporate regulator said, Why dont we change this and get rid of this list?—this government is continuing to try and maintain this arcane little exemption to the Corporations Law that has existed for 25 years. There is probably not one line in the Corporations Act now that is the same as what it was 25 years ago. This is a historical anachronism if there has ever been one when it comes to Corporations Law.I spent time prosecuting the Corporations Law. I had to do it under two different criminal law regimes. The whole regime changed in that time, but somehow these companies kept their exemption from the application of the Corporations Law. Its ridiculous. Theres no justification. Theres no basis that you can have to explain why we should keep an exemption. Youve got this little list of people who get to play the game differently. Theres no justification in principle. Theres no justification in law. Theres no justification in a liberal democracy as to why you would keep this some 25 years later, even if there was at the time. For the government to now want to bounce this back up to the other place as if somehow their principled position is principled just goes down with every other principled position this government has ever had.","Treasury Laws Amendment (2019 Measures No. 3) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr KEOGH (Burt) ","(16:49):"

Im perfectly happy to yield to anyone on the other side who wants to defend the position that they are about to vote for. I think theyre hoping that people will see the word tax and just tune out. But lets be very clear about what were debating in the House right now: the government want to throw an invisibility cloak over their mates so they can evade scrutiny. It is as simple as that. This is a measure that should have been a temporary exemption for a couple of years. Thats what it was to have been when the Keating government put it in place in 1995. But it was the Howard government that said: You know, this is a pretty good lurk for some of our mates. Lets make it permanent.As previous speakers on this side—I dont need to say that; there have been no speakers on the other side—have noted, 1995 was a long time ago. The year 1995 was the era of Forrest Gump. It was when Oasiss Wonderwall topped Triple Js Hottest 100 list. It was the era of Silverchair. It was a period in which most parliamentarians werent on the internet and didnt have email. It was a very different era from today. Yet the coalition want to keep on rolling this little exemption forward, using excuses that become more and more spurious.As Im sure all of our parents mentioned at some point, if you dont have anything nice to say, just dont say anything. What those on the other side are doing is taking it to the next level: if you dont have a single decent defence, dont say anything at all; just stay really, really quiet and hope the Australian people dont see that youre voting for a cloak of invisibility for your mates. Those on the other side are welcome to jump up and defend it at any point, but they cant and they wont. They know it is as indefensible as their taking money from cigarette companies, as they did up until recently. They know its as indefensible as their pledge to introduce a national integrity commission bill by the end of last year, which they squibbed on.As the member for Whitlam has noted, their reason for voting against it is just laughable: The issue raised by this amendment is the subject of a recommendation in the Senate economics committees report Corporate tax avoidance: Part 1—You cannot tax what you cannot see. As the member for Whitlam noted, it wouldve been helpful if theyd mentioned the year of that report. That is a 2015 report. The basis upon which they want to defend a 25-year-old exemption is a five-year-old Senate report that they havent got around to responding to. So maybe, if we give them another 25 years, theyll respond to the Senate report, and maybe, another 25 years after that, theyll think about getting around to removing the exemption for their mates.Lets remember whos hurt by this. The Australian taxpayer is hurt by this. Other competing businesses are hurt by this, because new businesses dont get the lurk. This is not just a grandfather provision; its a great-grandfather provision, and its disadvantaging the young start-up firms that have to report their dealings to ASIC, as they should.The fact is that the government has not a single excuse for its current position. Saying its in a 2015 Senate report that theyll get around to responding to is laughable. ASIC supports removing this exemption. Labor support removing this exemption. We voted for it in 2015 when Ricky Muir put it up, and the Liberals and the Greens voted it down. We voted for it in 2018 after the Greens backflipped and decided to put it up. Were voting again today to remove this exemption which should not have existed for more than a couple of years. It is absolutely indefensible that the government would continue to defend those 1,500 select few companies. It is the party not of the many but of the few. Theyre not the party for Middle Australia; theyre the party for looking after their mates. Theyre not a party for transparency, because they dont have the guts to stand up here right now and defend their own position. Not one of them will step up and defend it, because they know its indefensible. The question is that the House insist on disagreeing to the amendments insisted on by the Senate.","Treasury Laws Amendment (2019 Measures No. 3) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr LEIGH (Fenner) ","(16:54):"

238,0,0,0,1,1,"Payne, Alicia, MP",144732,"Canberra","ALP","N/A",4629," I rise to speak on the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Governance and Other Matters) Bill 2020. Labor will support this bill because we believe that students studying in Australian TAFEs deserve to study high-quality courses. The pandemic and associated economic downturn have made it clearer than ever just how important education is not only for the individual but also for the nation. The VET system is fundamental to the Australian economy, but it has been neglected under this government. The changes proposed by this bill, while possibly helpful, are relatively minor and certainly dont deliver the significant level of reform that the TAFE system needs.The bill amends the governance structures of the Australian Skills Quality Authority, the national VET regulator, and enhances information-sharing arrangements between ASQA and the National Centre for Vocational Education Research. Key amendments will revive ASQAs governance structure, replacing the existing chief commissioner, chief executive officer and two commissioners with a single independent statutory office holder, a CEO, and establish a National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Advisory Council. The advisory council is intended to provide ASQA with expert advice regarding the functions of the regulator.The lack of TAFE and union representation on the advisory council is a serious oversight by this government and, as usual, is a sign of ideology, rather than prioritising the provision of the best advice to ASQA. Union membership is strong within the industries typically trained by TAFEs. They clearly understand the work that construction workers, care workers and other heavily unionised industries do, and, as such, the training they need. With TAFE staff also strongly unionised and TAFE teachers clearly expert in the provision of VET courses, why on earth wouldnt they be at the top of the list for a place on the TAFE advisory council? When it comes to the VET sector, their views should be heard and considered. Thats why well seek to move amendments in the Senate to ensure the public provider has seats at the table.Labor supports a fair and considered approach to ASQA reforms. We will support changes that improve ASQAs capacity to ensure responsiveness to students, communities and employers, but we will reject changes that attempt to weaken ASQAs regulatory framework. We need to ensure that reforms to ASQA audit processes do not allow any reduction in quality. In the past, weve seen this government be slow to act on quality issues and this has done serious damage to the sector. Quality is vital in the VET sector. Lives and safety depend on it. A poorly trained builder or carer can do serious damage.TAFE creates skilled workers who build our country and keep it operational, but it hasnt been delivering what we need it to for a long time. Australia has a crisis in skills and vocational training after seven years of a conservative government. Australia has experienced a 73 per cent drop in the number of apprenticeships advertised. The system has been cut to the bone; $3 billion has been removed from TAFE and training sectors. We need this funding restored and we need serious investment in vocational education and training, a sector that will be vital to the economic recovery our nation is about to embark on.We had skills shortages before COVID-19. As we recover, we will need a strong and well-funded vocational education and training system to train and upskill our workforce so they can participate in the new economy. If people are unemployed because of this crisis—and we know one million Australians who werent unemployed at the start of 2020 will be by the end of the year—then we need to enable them to easily access new training opportunities and skill them for work.But not only have the government cut VET to the bone, they have has also failed to spend money they have budgeted for skills. The federal education departments own data shows the Liberals have failed to spend $919 million of their own TAFE and training budget over the past five years. With acknowledged skills shortages in this country, how is an underspend possible? With high youth unemployment across various parts of Australia prior to COVID-19, how is there an underspend? Where is the strategy from this government to skill Australians and get them into work? And why are TAFE facilities crumbling across Australia with almost $1 billion unspent? Why arent we offering quality courses, taught to anyone who needs training, in high-quality facilities across Australia? Its a serious lack of vision on the part of this government.Now the Prime Minister has announced his intention to maybe improve the way the Morrison government funds TAFEs, but only if the states agree to do the heavy lifting, and then, maybe, if they come to the table, the Prime Minister will restore some of the billions he has ripped out of the TAFE system. There is no commitment to improve skills training during the first recession in almost 30 years. There is no commitment to stem the haemorrhaging of apprenticeships that has occurred under this government. It is all talk, no action.This lack of action is alarming considering that unemployment has doubled since COVID-19 began. Under the Liberals there are 150,000 fewer apprentices and trainees, and a shortage of workers in critical services, including plumbing, carpentry, hairdressing and motor mechanics. The number of Australians doing an apprenticeship or traineeship is lower today than it was a decade ago. The independent National Centre for Vocational Education Research recently found that, over the past year, 20 per cent fewer people were signing up to trade apprenticeships and traineeships. This was even more extreme in a number of essential trades. The number of Australians studying an apprenticeship or traineeship in construction, including carpentry, bricklaying and plumbing, dropped by an alarming 40 per cent. There are more people dropping out of vocational education training courses than finishing them. These numbers must get better—not only for the economy but also for the young people who a decade ago would have been undertaking this training but are not today.As Anthony Albanese outlined in his vision statement on emerging from the shadow of COVID-19, we need to support people to train too. For many young people, this will mean a liveable youth allowance payment. I have been contacted over the last few months by many students who have been unable to access anything from this governments COVID-19 package and who are desperate for assistance. What makes a government exclude young people during this crisis? Ive heard from students who obviously had not been working in their casual jobs for a year, many because they had moved to Canberra in January to start studying, who were, of course, unable to access the JobKeeper payment. Then, because theyre students, which means theyre not unemployed, they have been unable to access the jobseeker payment. And, because this government has refused to relax the parental income test on youth allowance, they have not been able to access youth allowance, even in this time of crisis. A further issue on that point is that the parental income test is based on the parents income from the previous financial year. So, if their parents have lost their jobs due to COVID-19, have had their income massively reduced or have lost their business, that is not accounted for in that income test, and the government has refused to heed Labors calls to do something about this and ensure that some support can be provided to these young people.It is this mindset that has led to this government failing to adequately support the training of our young people. They have failed to acknowledge that not everyone has family who can support them while they train or study and that, with the increased cost of living, it is increasingly unrealistic for middle-income families to support their adult children. There is a further assumption that its easy for parents to support adult children and that students who are trying to study can do it because their parents can help them. That is exactly the sort of thing we as a nation want to address. We want everyone to have the chance to study at TAFE or university. Clearly, they cant with costs of living as they are and no support from this government.Its time that we saw youth allowance as an investment in young Australians and in the future of our nation. For over a month now, Labor has been calling on the government to increase access to youth allowance, and the minister has refused to act. The Labor Party called on the government to waive the parental income test on a case-by-case basis, but they have refused to act. We must invest in our young people and set them up for success. The Morrison government has failed to do this during the pandemic, and this bill demonstrates the lack of ambition they have for our TAFEs, our young people and, in turn, the future of this nation.","National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Governance and Other Matters) Bill 2020","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms PAYNE (Canberra) ","(17:07):"
239,0,0,0,1,1,"Sharkie, Rebekha, MP",265980,"Mayo","CA","N/A",4631," In the past decade, TAFE and similar training organisations have been the poor cousins when it comes to investing in post-secondary education in Australia. As the education spokesperson for Centre Alliance, this leaves me and, Im sure, many of those who are involved in the sector deeply concerned, particularly as our young people navigate a post-COVID-19 world.Just yesterday, I listened to the education minister talking about the huge surge in interest in university applications and about how many applicants the minister believes wont receive a place, which will leave many young people languishing next year with few job prospects. With no opportunity for a gap year and with poor job prospects, it seems those with a marginal interest in attending university have decided that study might be better than unemployment. There has been a considerable amount of marketing of university as a job training pathway, and higher education continues to rise in importance. However, direct employment outcomes do not always follow a degree. During my time working in the youth sector and in other sectors, I have met many young people with degrees who couldnt find a job in their chosen field. What we need to do, though, is to ensure that young people realise that there are many pathways to success and that the support is there to access those pathways. One pathway is certainly TAFE.Latest figures show that Australia had 1.5 million university students enrolled in 2019. There were 4.1 million students in vocational education and training, including around 260,000 apprentices and trainees, 230,000 school based students and more than a million students in government funded courses provided through institutes such as TAFE. In South Australia alone, there were 70,000 TAFE enrolments last year, with students taking part in over 630 courses across 290 sites.I would like to talk briefly about the TAFE sites in my electorate of Mayo in Mount Barker, in Victor Harbor and on Kangaroo Island. Around 2½ thousand people across my electorate are involved in TAFE training in some form. All three campuses work exceptionally hard, with very limited resources, facilities and equipment—and I cant underline enough how limited their resources really are. Even barista equipment is in dire need of upgrade. Given these limited resources, I am amazed at how much TAFE is able to do with so little, but significant additional investment is clearly very much needed. Training on Kangaroo Island is not delivered through a dedicated campus. Rather, courses are delivered directly to industry, agriculture and community sites, including at one of the local pubs, and students are supported with online training materials.Just last week I received some very welcome news from the TAFE manager in my region about a certificate III in individual support—thats in ageing and disability—that has just commenced on Kangaroo Island. It took a considerable amount of time and effort for that certificate to be available. I understand that 14 students are signed up to gain that qualification, and Im advised that all of them, provided that they pass, will be able to walk straight into a job on the island, given the significant need for the invaluable skills they are learning. I would like to commend all of those students for taking that step and seeking to gain that certificate. There is an urgent need for carers on the island, and this course will help meet that demand.Indeed, there is an urgent need for carers throughout Mayo, the electorate with the oldest median age in South Australia. So it would seem quite logical that we would have that great need. We need to have some really significant investment in vocational training in my electorate so that locals are able to get that certificate III in caring, in ageing, and then provide support to those who are in need in our community. Its been estimated that the aged-care workforce will need to grow from 366,000 to nearly one million by 2050 to meet the needs of the increasing numbers of older Australians accessing aged care. But I dont think we are planning for this. Mount Barker and the surrounding regions contain more than 30 residential aged-care and disability facilities. Victor Harbor and its surrounding region contain another 15 residential aged-care and disability facilities. Yet getting into a course locally is so difficult.The move towards individualised and specialised service provision through the individual care plans in the National Disability Insurance Scheme has created an unparalleled shortage of new workers, and we need to ensure that our vocational education providers, such as TAFE, have the resources to meet the demand. Another pressing need in my local area is investment in building and construction and in hospitality. An extensive refurbishment of the existing skills labs at the Victor Harbor and Mount Barker campuses would significantly expand TAFEs capacity to deliver training in these key areas.There are just under 11,000 businesses operating in Mayo; 99.6 per cent of them are categorised as small businesses, and nearly one in five of them are in the construction sector. TAFE SA Mount Barker has just begun a multi-trades program for high school students who are interested in trade pathways, focusing on building and construction. Twelve students are currently participating in the program, and already one student has been signed up for an apprenticeship. Noah started work as a first-year apprentice bricklayer last week and he will continue trade training through TAFE. Good luck, Noah. We need you. We need really good bricklayers, tilers and builders. I was pleased to learn that TAFE SA is rolling out much-needed training in forklift and telehandler tickets and licensing on Kangaroo Island across June and July. Im advised that these short two-week courses are fully subscribed and are being run with the support of local businesses and organisations, including Kangaroo Island Council, Kangaroo Island Business and Brand Alliance, Ag KI, Mitre 10, Capula, Junction Australia and the Ozone Hotel.Besides construction, more than 10 per cent of small businesses in Mayo are involved in retail, food and accommodation. The Adelaide Hills, Fleurieu and Kangaroo Island are well-known destinations for food, wine, hospitality and tourism. All of them are in my electorate. And my electorate is home to over a hundred recognised wineries and cellar doors, complemented by increasing numbers of restaurants, cafes, microbreweries, hotels and accommodation facilities. Demand for skills and labour across the tourism and hospitality sector continues to grow in our region. The changing nature of the industry, moving away from seasonal peaks to year-round activity, provides increasing genuine career pathways and ongoing employment opportunities.Our construction and tourism sectors have been hit hard by COVID restrictions, world market conditions and, of course, the bushfires, but we will bounce back. Figures from Global Apprenticeship Network Australia show the number of advertised apprenticeship positions fell by 73 per cent between January and April this year, largely due to the downturn in the economy thanks to COVID. There were 468 jobs advertised in April 2020 compared to 1,212 in April last year, but there were strong signs of business confidence returning, with the number of apprenticeship vacancies increasing by 150 per cent in May, to 678 positions. The biggest proportional increase was in hospitality, travel and tourism.Having toured the TAFE campuses in my electorate, I know much of the work that needs to be done at the Mount Barker site involves bringing the construction, automotive, community services, hospitality, business and IT facilities up to modern standards. The Victor Harbor campus is also desperately in need of upgrades to facilities for forklift licencing and training in tourism, hospitality and community services. Both campuses are located in rapidly growing areas. Mount Barker will be the second largest city in SA in the next 30 years with a population of more than 56,000 by 2036. The size of both campuses and the age of their facilities will significantly restrict the quantity and quality of courses that they can offer our young people if we dont act now. This is why, before the federal election last year, I made a commitment to the people of Mayo that I would advocate strongly for investment in our TAFE campuses. Young kids in regional areas, such as my electorate, want to study regionally, and one of the places they can do that is TAFE. But our TAFEs have not had the investment that they need.University isnt the only pathway to success, as I mentioned before. We need young people to study in areas that they love right across the spectrum, from aged care, through to mechanics and carpenters and in the construction industry. We want young people to stay in our regions, and they want to stay in our regions. We want young people to stay in South Australia, and we need to make sure that the avenues for training are there for them. So I call on the major parties to make it a priority to invest in quality training and education and, particularly, to invest in TAFE and vocational education in the regions, as well as to provide greater opportunity for young people from the regions to access university.","National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Governance and Other Matters) Bill 2020","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms SHARKIE (Mayo) ","(17:17):"
240,0,0,0,1,1,"Gosling, Luke, MP",245392,"Solomon","ALP","N/A",4634," Im very happy to be here to talk about the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Governance and Other Matters) Bill 2020. As Im sure many of the previous Labor speakers would have mentioned, we support a fair and considered approach to the ASQA reforms, and well support changes that improve the capacity to ensure responsiveness to students, communities and employers, but well reject changes that attempt to weaken ASQAs regulatory framework.If I can be frank, and I hope I can, more broadly, this legislation is just another tweak from a tired third-term conservative government who simply refuse to deliver a genuine reform package that overhauls this vital sector to our nation—if Im honest. The Liberals have slashed funding to TAFE and training, let apprentice numbers fall and presided over a national shortage of tradies, apprentices and trainees. I see that in my electorate of Solomon in the northern capital of Australia, but I know its happening around the country. For more than seven years this tired and clueless Liberal government has left Australia facing a crisis in skills and vocational training. If they dont do something seriously to fix this skills crisis that they have themselves created, we could be looking at the extinction of the Australian tradies.Under those opposite there are 150,000 fewer apprentices and trainees and a shortage of workers in critical services, including plumbing, carpentry, hairdressing and motor mechanics. Experts are now warning that we are on track to lose another 100,000 this year if the government fails to act. Thats 2,000 trainees and apprentices a week. I also need to remind the House that those opposite have cut TAFE and training by over $3 billion. The number of Australians doing an apprenticeship or traineeship is lower today than it was a decade ago. Just two weeks ago in my electorate I was talking to young refrigeration mechanic Cameron—good lad. He was in his last year and he was saying that not many of his mates were able to get into the training that they wanted and in fact that industry needed, and he couldnt really understand what had happened. Hed seen his older brothers and older mates go through and get a trade, but what he was seeing was far different to that.There are also more people dropping out of apprenticeships and traineeships than finishing them, and thats a problem for us and a problem for our nation. Theres a nearly 10 per cent increase in the number of occupations facing skills shortages. While the Australian Industry Group says 75 per cent of businesses surveyed are struggling to find the qualified workers they need, there are about 1.9 million Australians who are unemployed or underemployed. So you can see that theres this disconnect. We are simultaneously experiencing a crisis of youth unemployment and also a crisis of skills shortages. One of these is bad enough, but to be faced by both at the same time is pretty hard to imagine. But here we are, confronted with both. While businesses are struggling to fill the skilled positions they have on offer, we have young Australians desperate for work who cant fill those positions because they havent been given the chance to gain the skills that those roles, those jobs, require.I want to know why the Prime Minister isnt training these young Australians for jobs in industries where theres a shortage of workers. The answer, of course, is what I mentioned just a little while ago. Theres been $3 billion cut out of the sector. Theyve cut funding to TAFE and training. Even though this is the case—and its plainly obvious that it is—the government, those opposite, refuse to properly fund the sector. They refuse to give it the proper reform that it so desperately needs.Now, young people have been clear about what they need. They need a skills training sector that is properly funded and properly resourced and has educators who are properly trained and able to skill these kids up as a pathway to meaningful employment so they can grow our nation. This government hasnt delivered on a single element of those requests from our young Australians, from our future. Fiddling at the edges of the current system will not address the profound problems that undermine vocational education and training and, consequentially, the productive performance and international competitiveness of our economy.The government doesnt seem to understand the critical role of TAFE as the public provider, the value in skills and apprenticeships or the value of the hardworking and passionate public TAFE teachers. If we continue down this path, we will severely jeopardise our future economic growth, undermine the opportunity of individual Australians to meet their full potential and, very importantly, compromise our ability as a nation to compete with the rest of the world using the skills, knowledge, discovery and inventiveness of our people. We know that nine out of 10 jobs created in the future will need post-secondary school education, either TAFE or uni, so we need to increase participation in both our universities and our vocational educational sector to make sure our young people are prepared for the world of work, which is changing so very quickly. If we do not value the role of an appropriately funded VET sector for the training, skills and apprenticeships they provide to so many Australians, nor its vital role in driving the economy and enhancing industry, we fail our nation.This third-term government has had seven years to fix this sector. Rather, they started the cuts and, in the intervening years, they have failed to properly fund and resource the sector. They need to deliver a genuine reform package that overhauls this higher ed sector and properly funds both the VET providers and the universities to deliver the services that the students need.When it comes to the Northern Territory, it is undeniable that the governments inattention and callous disregard for apprentices and trainees has been a kick in the guts for Territorians. The tradie crisis created by the federal Liberal government—that is, those opposite—is hurting the Territorys economy and denying Territorians jobs. As a result, we now have shortages of bricklayers, plumbers, hairdressers, bakers, electricians, mechanics, panel beaters and other critical trades.We have so many terrific businesses in Darwin, Palmerston, the rural area and other parts of the Northern Territory, and they want to grow. They want to hire more staff. They want to employ more locals. They want to employ those who have put down roots in the Territory. Thats what they would rather do. Unfortunately, theyre forced to either go without those additional workers or look for oversees workers, because theyre let down by the Prime Ministers failure to back apprentices and trainees.We have lost over 600 apprentices in the Territory since those opposite came to power. This is the government that promised to grow the North and to develop the North. What a load of rubbish that turned out to be. It has been seven years and all weve seen are cuts to this sector, a lack of resourcing and 600 fewer apprentices. Were trying to grow the North and at the same time were being hamstrung by those opposite who fail to recognise the essential nature of the skills VET training sector.This is a government that has bungled so much in that seven years. The fact that theyve stuffed up TAFE and training isnt a shock really, but once again it is something that will devastate thousands around the country. What gets me the most is that its affecting our future. Its affecting the young Territorians, the young Australians. Its affecting those who want to start a career, be able to support themselves and be able to support their families in due course, but their opportunities are far fewer after seven years of those opposite.The Prime Ministers latest marketing ploy around tradies hasnt really helped anyone either. HomeBuilder has done nothing for tradies. Its a rubbish policy designed for grabs on the nightly news and to shield an incompetent government that has no plan to help tradies at all. The quote from the member for Blaxland, Its more Scottys scam than Scotty Cam, is a cracker. I think it very nicely sums up this absolute facade.In the time I have left, Id like to acknowledge the work done by the Northern Territory government to help support our tradies during the pandemic. The Northern Territory government—Im proud to say it is a Labor government—has chosen substance over spin and has rightly focused on developing a plan to keep people employed. They’ve backed our tradies.We need this federal government, those opposite, to start focusing on meaningful reform in this sector over marketing and spin. Its all about the announcement but theres never any follow-through. I remind honourable members that it has been seven years and all we have seen from the government is mismanagement, creating crisis after crisis in the VET sector. Young Territorians and young Australians deserve a lot better and I call on those opposite to pull their fingers out and provide the system that we need to grow our nation.","National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Governance and Other Matters) Bill 2020","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr GOSLING (Solomon) ","(17:27):"
241,0,0,0,1,1,"Templeman, Susan, MP",181810,"Macquarie","ALP","N/A",4636," This is one of the issues thats going to be key in our ability to help people recover from the economic crisis and from the financial crisis they have personally faced during the COVID-19 pandemic. When I think about 31,000 apprenticeships and traineeships disappearing from New South Wales, its a horrific thought, particularly for a community like mine in the Hawkesbury where so many people have built their business and their life on their apprenticeship. They started out wanting to be a plumber or wanting to work in construction and, through that, working in a family business or for a friend of a family member or finding their way into an apprenticeship in some of our fantastic small business areas, they then went: You know what? I dont just want to work for someone else. I want to work for myself. I think we forget about the pathway that is laid by having a strong VET system. These bills which start to improve the system, although not to the extent that we would like, will really make a difference to kids lives. We, of course, would like to see a much bigger difference being made, but we obviously wont oppose this bill.One of the issues that has been raised with me over the years has been the quality of ASQAs governance. People have found it very difficult to find their way through the bureaucracy and the procedure involved. So I think the key amendments here—revising ASQAs governance structure and replacing the existing chief executive officer and two commissioners with a single independent statutory office holder, or a CEO—are really important. I hope that makes a difference. I hope the establishment of the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Advisory Council, which is intended to provide ASQA with access to expert advice regarding the functions of the regulator, also makes a difference.In relation to the value of TAFE, Im very lucky to have within my electorate of Macquarie a wonderful woman who heads up the TAFE Teachers Association, Annette Bennett. She works tirelessly to make sure that not only are the interests of students fulfilled but also the TAFE teachers are treated the way they deserve to be. They are people who are absolutely expert in what they do. Not only have they achieved a professional standing that is recognised by their peers, but they have also chosen to give up their professional ability to earn money in that capacity to say: Look, I want to share what I know. I want to share my expertise and my skills with people. It is people who are really driven to share their expertise who help us transfer the skills to the next generation. so I think we should all be commending TAFE teachers for the work that they do.We recognise that we need a fair and considered approach to these ASQA reforms and we will support the changes that improve the organisations capacity to ensure it is responsive to students, communities and employers, but we do not support the changes that attempt to weaken the regulatory framework.I just want to talk more about the broader need for reform in TAFE. This really is just another little adjustment to a system that has been undermined for the nearly seven years of this government. There havent been things that have built up TAFE; there have only been things that tear it down. Every member in this place can see it with their own eyes in their own electorates, where the range of courses that used to be offered in a TAFE are no longer offered. You cant get the specialty manufacturing skills needed for the manufacturing sector in the electorate of Macquarie any more, nor can you get it in large areas of Western Sydney. You need to travel a really long distance to be able to do certain courses.Im all for bringing together specialities, but you also have to make TAFE accessible. You cant make it hard for young people who have simply stayed in their suburb and gone to their local primary school and then their local high school, being all of a sudden asked, even before some have their licences, to travel large distances. Keep in mind that Hawkesbury, in particular, doesnt have good public transport connections with so many other TAFEs. For instance, to get to the Kingswood TAFE you need to catch a train to Blacktown—thats a hike in itself—change trains and head back in the other direction to get to Penrith. In a car its an easy half-hour drive but by train can take over an hour and a half. These are the sorts of things that really go to the heart of TAFE—making training accessible.I think the coronavirus outbreak has really brought home to people the need for accessible education. There are many people who are now on jobseeker or JobKeeper and are likely to lose their JobKeeper payment and their job come September. Theyll be asking themselves: How do I retrain? What system do I want to go to? How do I know Im going to get quality training for the money that I spend? Its not just a token amount any more. Were now talking about serious expenditure. Its a heavy debt that people carry for the privilege of learning.More than ever, we need to think about how we make TAFE accessible and how to build up its capacity for the many new people who, until now, might not have considered the need to reskill. With coronavirus and the crisis it has brought to the economy, they will recognise the need to shift their skill base. The most recent figures show a 73 per cent drop in the number of apprenticeships advertised. Not only am I concerned, come the end of this year, about the people whose jobs will disappear in September but Im concerned about the people in years 11 and 12 now. Ive been speaking to a lot of year 12 students. Many of them do want to get an apprenticeship. They dont see university as the most appropriate path for them, but they want an apprenticeship. I had contact from a constituent recently whose son lost his apprenticeship during this coronavirus pandemic. Hes desperate to get back into it, to find a new employer and to pick up that apprenticeship to further his career.Right now we should be talking about capacity building in TAFE. While in this amendment there is a slight adjustment in hopefully the ability of the TAFE to deliver a quality product, its not what we need. We need way more than what is being offered in this and other pieces of legislation that have come to this chamber in the last week or so.I dont think you can talk about TAFE without talking about the skills shortages. It strikes me that therell be additional skills shortages going forward. In 2013, I lost my house in a bushfire and for the next few years there was a shocking shortage of brickies and roofers. I know the Blue Mountains had to have roofers brought down from northern New South Wales to meet the demand, and that was a fire that took out 200 homes. Now weve had fires across the state taking out thousands of homes, so we are really going to struggle to find the tradespeople to be able to do those rebuilds in a timely fashion. It isnt good enough to just say, What weve got will do, and nor is it good enough to rely on bringing in temporary workers from overseas. The only reason you would do that is if you were using them to train up your people and create more traineeships. But, as weve seen under this government, were not seeing more trainees and apprenticeships created; were seeing fewer.There are fewer apprenticeships and trainees now than there were when Labor was last in government, and that is a shocking statistic for people to consider. But its not surprising when you know that this is a government that spent seven years cutting funding while also underspending on what had been promised to the sector. Rebuilding our skills and our training sector is crucial, and I look forward in coming months to seeing some legislation before the place which actually talks about rebuilding the sector.We need to properly fund our TAFE and apprenticeship program. We need to see something that makes up for the $3 billion of cuts to TAFE and training in recent years, and the government needs to restore all the funding that its cut by investing in training so that the next generation of tradespeople actually find their way into TAFE and have a supportive mentor—someone who is willing to take them through the hard yards. It isnt easy to say, Im going to take on an apprentice.Ive spoken to a lot of builders in the last few months for a whole range of reasons, from bushfire to HomeBuilder. They say that its harder than ever. The support for them as employers is less than theyve seen for themselves in previous years, and many have chosen not to keep on taking apprentices. We need to reverse that. Those employers have such depth of knowledge to share, but we all know what its like having work experience people in our offices. It takes time to make it a really worthwhile process for them. Now do that tenfold with apprentices, and it does take a real commitment from an employer. So I salute the employers who do have apprentices and who are willing to take them on and invest in them, whether it is in the construction industry or whether its in the hair and beauty sector, where there is also big demand.Ive talked to some fantastic operators of hair and beauty salons. Linda Fenech, who is considered to be a real leader in her industry, is based in Richmond. Linda has a team of girls. She admits shes tough, but they absolutely recognise that. She is not only tough but fair. She sets for them a really high standard of work. Thats the sort of person we need and the sorts of ideals we need, but those employers need to be supported to be able to take themselves away from their business so that they can mentor, teach and guide their younger apprentices.I suspect that, in the wake of COVID and the job losses that weve already seen and the ones that we all expect to see, it wont just be young people who will want to be apprentices. We will need to have people willing to mentor and train up older workers who can see that theres an opportunity and that we should be creating that opportunity. We should be making it easy for those people to see an alternative pathway in a whole lot of ways, such as by making it accessible to find out what the pathways are online.The other thing I absolutely think we need to be looking at is how we tie together university and TAFE. The two of them work so effectively together for so many of the jobs of now and the jobs of the future. Im very lucky to have a TAFE and Western Sydney University campus side by side at Richmond, and they are looking at all sorts of agricultural initiatives that will involve students from the TAFE as well as the university researchers.One of them is to do with periurban cropping. How can we use the giant greenhouse at Western Sydney in the Hawkesbury campus to expand what is available for local use but also for export? They have a vision of having a logistics hub placed right next to that. They have a proposal to the government for that. I urge the government to consider supporting the Western Sydney proposal for a logistics hub that not only would help periurban producers in my electorate—especially in the Hawkesbury and parts of the Blue Mountains—but would help producers all through Western Sydney. It would also create opportunities for export, because if we can do work on how to grow things so that they travel easily and if we look at, logistically, how we package them, we give ourselves an edge for exports to Asia. They are the sorts of things that generate more jobs and generate apprenticeships in a whole range of areas.Of course, the other thing TAFE campuses need is some investment. Absolutely, go for the great big new things, but we could also do with improvements. The greenhouses at Richmond TAFE desperately need updating. Theyre 30 or 40 years old. Theyre still working, because the TAFE teachers and the people who work at TAFE just keep on getting the best they can out of them, but one of my election commitments was to upgrade them. Thats the sort of thing this government needs to be doing.","National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Governance and Other Matters) Bill 2020","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms TEMPLEMAN (Macquarie) ","(17:40):"
242,0,0,0,1,1,"Wells, Anika, MP",264121,"Lilley","ALP","N/A",4639," Its a pleasure to rise on this bill this evening and speak on behalf of the apprentices in my electorate on the north side of Brisbane. Many of them have been in touch over the previous months since I was elected to talk about the crisis in TAFE and the need for more investment in the sector.Labor will support the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Governance and Other Matters) Bill 2020 this evening, because we believe that students studying in Australian TAFEs deserve to study high-quality courses. Thats what they deserve. The pandemic and the associated economic downturn have made it clearer than ever just how important education is. You never know when youre going to need to pivot, whether as an individual or as a nation.The VET system is fundamental to the Australian economy, but it has been neglected under this government. The changes proposed by this bill, while possibly helpful, are relatively minor and they certainly dont deliver on the significant level of reform that our TAFE system needs. I feel that this is possibly the third time Ive risen in this House to make this point, and it represents another missed opportunity this evening for us to do more for our VET sector and our TAFE students.The bill amends the governance structures of the Australian Skills Quality Authority and enhances information sharing arrangements between ASQA and the National Centre for Vocational Education Research. The key amendments will revise ASQAs governance structure and replace the existing chief commissioner and CEO and two commissioners with a single independent statutory office holder. It will also establish the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Advisory Council. Thats intended to provide ASQA with access to expert advice regarding the functions of the regulator.The lack of TAFE and union representation on the advisory council is a serious oversight by this government, and, to be honest, it smacks of ideology rather than the provision of best advice to ASQA. Union membership is very strong within these industries. They are typically trained by TAFE themselves. They understand the work that the construction workers, the care workers and the workers in other heavily unionised industries do—the people on the frontline. As such, they understand the training that they need. With TAFE staff who are also strongly unionised and TAFE teachers who are clearly expert in the provision of VET courses, why on earth wouldnt they be on the top of the list for these seats on the council? Their views should be heard and considered when it comes to the VET sector. Thats what we believe on this side of the House, and thats why well seek to move some amendments to that effect, to ensure that the public provider has seats at the table. We will do that in the other place.We support a fair, considered approach to the ASQA reforms. We will support changes that improve ASQAs capacity to ensure responsiveness to students, communities and employers, but well reject changes that attempt to weaken the regulatory framework. We need to ensure that reforms to ASQA audit processes dont allow any reduction in quality. In the past, we have seen this government be slow to act on quality issues. That has done serious damage to the sector. Thats a real problem, because quality is vital in this sector. Lives and safety depend on it. A poorly trained builder or a poorly trained carer can do serious damage.TAFE creates our skilled workers who build our country and keep it operational, but it hasnt been delivering what we need it to, what our students need it to and what our future students need it to for a very long time. Australia now has a crisis in skills and vocational training. After seven years of a Liberal government, Australia has experienced a 73 per cent drop in the number of apprenticeships advertised. The government has cut the system to the bone. It has removed $3 billion from the TAFE and training sector. We need this funding restored and we need a serious investment in VET, a sector that will be vital to the economic recovery our nation is about to embark upon.We had skills shortages before COVID-19 and, as we recover, we will need a strong and well-funded VET system to train and upskill our workforce so that they can participate in the new economy. If people are unemployed because of this crisis, and we know that they will be, and we know that one million Australians who werent employed at the start of 2020 will be by the end of the year, then we need to enable them to access new training opportunities and to skill them for new work. But not only has the government cut VET to the bone; it has also failed to spend the money that it budgeted for skills.The federal education departments own data shows that the Liberals have failed to spend $919 million of their own TAFE and training budget over the last five years. With acknowledged skills shortages in this country, how is an underspend even possible? With high youth unemployment across various parts of Australia prior to COVID-19, how is there an underspend? I know in my home state of Queensland, the unemployment rate is something like 6.3 per cent for the Brisbane east area, higher than the national average. But the youth unemployment rate is at 11.2 per cent, double the national average. In parts of Queensland, particularly North Queensland—and I note the member for Leichhardt has just come in—youth unemployment has risen as high as 25.7 per cent for kids who are growing up in regional areas like Cairns or Mount Isa.We have a crisis in youth unemployment and we have a crisis when it comes to skill shortages, but for some reason the government fails to put two and two together and continues to underspend. It boggles the mind. One of these is bad enough to be faced with if you are a kid growing up in regional Australia, but both of them at the same time, and now with this pandemic, is very, very tough. We should be doing more here in this place. Thats what people elected us to do. Our apprentices and tradies, people who were told that if they had a go they would get a go, have been the worst affected by this. The school students and the young jobseekers in my electorate of Lilley have been clear with me about what they need. They need a skills training sector that is adequately funded, that is properly resourced and that has educators who are properly trained so that they can aspire to and secure the highly skilled, highly paid jobs in technical industries. The coalition government needs to come up with a better plan than this.According to the Australian Industry Group, which is hardly a bastion of socialism, 75 per cent of businesses surveyed are struggling to find the qualified workers they need. At the same time, almost two million Australians were unemployed before COVID or were looking for more hours of work. So why isnt the Prime Minister training jobseekers for jobs in these industries where there is a shortage of workers? This seems like first-year economics 101 stuff: supply should meet demand. Where we have employers crying out for more qualified workers and jobseekers desperately looking for more work, only this government could fail to connect the two.Late last year, I had the pleasure of visiting a TAFE north of Brisbane, Bracken Ridge TAFE, which is, I will admit, just outside my electorate in the member for Petries electorate. But many of the students there are from Lilley, so I go there as often as I can possibly get myself invited. I took the member for Sydney and the Queensland state minister for TAFE with me for a tour of the facilities. The campus has a shared delivery arrangement with TAFE Queensland SkillsTech and the Queensland Pathways State College. We heard about the fantastic work that the Queensland Labor state government is doing despite the federal funding cuts, including providing free apprenticeships for people under the age of 21. There are over 20 free apprenticeships for those under 21 available on the Brisbane North campus, including apprenticeships in electrotechnology, construction, plumbing and marine mechanical technology. Since July 2019, over 115 new apprentices commenced training on that Brisbane North campus. Put simply, when TAFEs are properly invested in, we get results, and Im sure the member for Petrie would agree with me on what a great job the Queensland Labor state government is doing in that space.When I was speaking to these apprentices on that visit at the end of last year, what really stood out for me was the relationship they had with their teachers and the outstanding work their teachers are doing in leading them through. I met Andrew Begbie, who was teaching carpentry and cabinet making; John OShea, outdoor powering equipment; and Dave Compton, automotive industry. And I met all of their students, who were diligent and hardworking in the hopes that they would be able to secure a job as a result of their efforts.We need to make sure that these fantastic teachers have the support that they need. They are passing on their knowledge and their skills to young people who want to learn and to work, and they deserve better than $1 billion in underspending. I also want to take this opportunity to commend Zupps Aspley, who are providing certificate III apprenticeships in light vehicle mechanical technology to young locals on the north side. They are stepping up and doing what this government should be doing.The Prime Minister isnt training young people for jobs in industries that are facing skill shortages. Instead, hes starving TAFEs and training funding and wondering why the rates of apprenticeships and traineeships are dropping. Australias economic growth has been the slowest since the global financial crisis, and that was before we faced the pandemic this year. Wages were stagnant. Household debt had skyrocketed, and business investment was at its lowest level since the 1990s recession. A decline in vocational education and training only worsens those outcomes for everybody, and it worsens them for generations to come. Fiddling at the edges of the TAFE system, as we are seeing here again now, will not address the problems that this government has created in vocational education and training. If we continue down this path of underfunding, we will sabotage future economic growth, undermine the opportunities for young Australians looking to upskill to meet their full potential and compromise our national productivity.We know that nine out of 10 jobs created in the future will need post-secondary-school education, including TAFE. We need to act now to increase the participation in our vocational education sector to make sure that our young people have the skills necessary to meet this demand. Look at what adequate funding has done on the Brisbane North TAFE campus. I know how important vocational education and training is to our local economy and for our local jobs. The Liberal government either doesnt care or doesnt have the capacity to do that hard work that needs to be done to build a path to skilled jobs. Tonight is another failed opportunity to do more in this space. The Prime Minister claims that he wants to lift the status of vocational Australia, yet his actions, like the failure to move more significant reform than that provided to the House this evening, prove that he doesnt. Australians are sick of the marketing, the hollow men, the publicity stunts and the empty gestures. The vocational education and training system managed by this government is failing students, it is failing workers, it is failing local business, it is failing local economies like the north side of Brisbane and it is ultimately failing the national economy. Australians want this government to take serious action now and to grow the job opportunities for the young people of today and of tomorrow.Under this government there are 15,000 fewer apprentices and trainees and a shortage of workers in critical services, including plumbing, carpentry, hairdressing and motor mechanics. The number of Australians doing an apprenticeship or traineeship is lower today than it was a decade ago. The independent National Centre for Vocational Education Research recently found that over the past year 20 per cent fewer people were signing up to do trade apprenticeships and traineeships. This was even more extreme in a number of essential trades. The number of Australians starting an apprenticeship or traineeship in construction, including carpentry, bricklaying and plumbing, dropped by an alarming 40 per cent. There are more people dropping out of vocational training courses than there are finishing them. These numbers have to get better, not only for the economy but for the young people who a decade ago would have been undertaking this training but are not today. As the Leader of the Opposition outlined in his vision statement on emerging from the shadow of COVID-19, we need to support people to train. For many young people, that will mean a liveable youth allowance payment.Over the past two months, I have been contacted by students who are desperate for assistance but who are unable to access anything from this governments COVID-19 assistance package. What makes a government exclude young people during a national crisis? On what metric does this funding need to be restored? We need serious investment in VET, a sector that will be vital to the economic recovery that our nation is about to embark upon. We had skills shortages before COVID-19. As we recover, we will need a strong and well-funded VET system to train and upskill our workforce so they can participate in this new economy. If people come to be unemployed because of this crisis—and we know that one million Australians who werent unemployed at the start of 2020 will be by the end of 2020—then we need to enable them to easily access new training opportunities and skill them for work.Now is the time for this House to act. The parliament is together to make amendments and to make good reform in this space. I urge the government to reconsider and to put together more significant amendments to this bill so that we can support our TAFE sector.","National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Governance and Other Matters) Bill 2020","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms WELLS (Lilley) ","(17:55):"

Ive since been informed that the out of figures referenced in my answer are in fact the number of properties expected to be cleared by 20 June and not the total number of properties impacted in each LGA. This information has been provided by the New South Wales state government to the National Bushfire Recovery Agency. Its important to note that, as of 16 June 2020, the number of homes that have been cleared of debris in the five LGAs mentioned in my statement is 1,192, and the New South Wales government estimates 1,344 homes in these LGAs will be cleared by 20 June 2020. The National Bushfire Recovery Agency continues to request real-time updates from the New South Wales government, as the New South Wales government is the jurisdiction that holds this data.","Bushfire Recovery Fund","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p","Mr LITTLEPROUD (Maranoa—Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management and Deputy Leader of the National Party) ","(19:01):"
325,0,0,0,1,1,"Watts, Tim, MP",193430,"Gellibrand","ALP","N/A",4662," Given the very unconventional circumstances that bring me to my feet today, I hope youll excuse me and give me a moment to gather myself, following the shock of that bill being rammed through without a single speaker in opposition just now. Im sure that there was a great urgency and contingency that drove that from the government side.But we now come to the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Regional Commercial Radio and Other Measures) Bill 2020. This bill is the governments latest attempt to deal with the very significant structural changes occurring in regional media in Australia. The can has been kicked down the road by this government for many years now. Indeed, the Australian content obligations being discussed and dealt with in this bill have been kicked down the road by this government for four years, and now before the House we have a bill that we are told needs to get through the parliament this week. Thats not the way, by any stretch of the imagination, that Id go about managing, coordinating or doing a proper policy process, but here we are.The bill before the House is one that the Labor Party supports. We support it not because we believe that it will solve all problems, and not because we believe that it will be a decisive intervention in addressing the issues confronting regional broadcasters—regional commercial radio broadcasters and regional television broadcasters—but because we believe that it will provide some degree of regulatory relief, and there is no reason for us to stand in the way of that. We do have a second reading amendment, which I will move shortly, when the text is before me. But we are happy to support the passage of this bill in order to accommodate its passage for the government. As I said, this bill has been brought on here today in fairly extraordinary circumstances—with, I understand, the discussions that have been going on to support it. The postal bill, which many people were very enthusiastic to speak about, has been put off.As I said, really the structural changes in media go back to the convergence review under the Rudd-Gillard government. The fact that we are now seven years into this new conservative government and have not seen the substantive structural issues dealt with is extraordinary. Indeed, in 2017 we saw a reform bill come through the parliament that was going to turn this upside down, was going to address the big-picture issues. Yet three years on we see another set of amendments coming into this chamber. Of course, these commercial broadcasters arent the only part of this regional media picture. A very significant part of this also is the role of the ABC, and we know what the government has been doing with respect to the ABC in recent times—constant cuts to the ABCs budget, after we were promised, before the 2013 election, that there would be no cuts to the budget of the ABC. The people who bear the cost of this—the regions of Australia that bear the cost of this—most acutely are those in rural and regional Australia.And this is all part of the same ecology. I dont like to talk about it now, as a Melbournian, but I grew up in country Queensland, as the Speaker may be familiar with, and I know how important the ABC is to rural and regional areas. Its treasured in those areas. Its literally a lifesaver in times of crisis. People turn to the ABC as that trusted source of information when their lives are on the line, when their livelihoods are on the line, when their property is on the line. They turn to it for the local coverage that is necessary. And weve seen this government treat the ABC with contempt, after promising thered be no cuts to the budget of the ABC, and weve seen a series of cuts, and now were starting to see the consequences of those cuts. Were seeing cuts to staffing in regional areas. The chickens are coming home to roost.So, we see the structural problems in the industry. Were familiar with them. In the commercial sector theyre becoming very acute. I should say that the problems being experienced by both commercial radio and commercial television broadcasters are part of big structural changes in traditional media, but theyre being made more acute by the growing uncertainty caused by this government kicking the can down the road. Its really difficult to invest, its difficult to plan, its difficult to tackle these challenges head-on when you dont have confidence in the regulatory arrangement, when you know there are multiple review processes underway that havent been dealt with.The Broadcasting Services Amendment (Regional Commercial Radio and Other Measures) Bill 2020 amends the Broadcasting Services Act and the ACMA Act 2005 with a range of deregulatory measures to ease the regulatory and compliance burden on regional commercial radio and regional commercial television broadcasters. The bill makes relatively minor amendments relating to local content obligations and the Australian content transmission quota. Once again, the government serves up regulatory housekeeping when major reform is needed. Once again, this government is rushing a bill through the parliament when theyve been sitting on these issues for literally years. Once again, this government dithers and delays on genuine reform when the industry is crying out for uncertainty to end.The media sector is in crisis, and it was in crisis well before the impact of the latest COVID-19 pandemic. So, as I said earlier, Labor will not oppose this bill. Well be constructive. Well play our role. We wont stand in the way of relatively minor regulatory amendments to alleviate the regulatory burden on regional broadcasters, particularly in the face of concerns about the market failure of regional commercial television. But we are concerned that regional Australians are missing out as a result of this governments ongoing failure to support regional media. Indeed, the measures in the bill dont so much make things better for regional Australians as simply stop them getting worse. They press pause.We are also concerned that the government continues to delay genuine reform, which exacerbates the uncertainty faced by the media sector as a result of digital disruption. Media reform isnt a straightforward exercise and the issues are complex, but this government has had almost seven years to address the systemic challenges facing the media sector. During this time, review after review into the media sector have piled up and gathered dust on the shelves. They used to be Malcolm Turnbulls shelves, as the communication minister. Then they were Mitch Fifields shelves. Now they are the member for Bradfields shelves, as the Minister for Communications, Cyber Safety and the Arts. The shelves might have changed, but the issues remain the same. The names on the front pages of the reports have changed, but the lack of action remains the same. In many ways, the bill is a small admission of failure by the Liberal-National government when it comes to regional broadcasting. There in the fine print is an admission that the government has failed to ensure that the regulatory framework keeps pace with market realities, but the government sat on early warning signs that regional commercial television broadcasters are facing market failure—something that has occurred on this governments watch—and that regional Australians will have less Australian content available to them than they should have, as a result of this governments failings.The measures contained in schedule 1 of this bill permit greater flexibility for regional commercial radio broadcasting licensees in satisfying their local content obligations with amendments to the local content requirements and associated reporting requirements. Currently, regional commercial radio licensees are required to provide a minimum amount of material of local significance per business day in order to support the ongoing availability of local content in regional Australia. The regional commercial radio industry considers a number of the requirements associated with the local content and minimum service standards obligations to be inflexible, impractical and overly burdensome. The bill will provide the regional commercial radio industry with more flexibility in acquitting its local content and minimum service standards obligations. These changes facilitate flexibility in staff rostering over Christmas, in January and on public holidays, simplified reporting, and a move towards a complaints based approach, rather than ACMA monitoring. They also remove a requirement for a three-yearly statutory review of certain local content provisions. Importantly, the bill will not lower the amount of local content that is currently available to regional audiences on commercial radio.Schedule 2 of the bill permits regional commercial television broadcasting licensees to be deemed to have complied with the multichannel transmission quota obligations even if they have not broadcast the required 1,460 hours of Australian content if the amount of content on the multichannels that they do carry under affiliation agreements is not less than the amount of Australian content on the equivalent metropolitan multichannels. Currently all commercial television broadcasting licensees, whether metropolitan or regional, are required to broadcast an annual minimum transmission quota of 55 per cent Australian programming between 6 am and midnight on their primary channel and broadcast minimum levels of Australian content—at least 1,460 hours of Australian programming—across their multichannels or non-primary channels between 6 am and midnight.Metropolitan television networks provide regional and remote commercial television broadcasting licensees with content under affiliation agreements. However, there is currently no obligation on regional broadcasters to take every multichannel, like 7mate, 9Go! or 10 Bold, produced by their metropolitan affiliate. This means that some regional television networks may fall short of the multichannel transmission quota requirement to broadcast 1,460 hours annually of Australian content, depending on how metro networks schedule Australian content across their multichannels. The measures in the bill will assist certain regional and remote licensees that are failing to satisfy the obligation as a result of programming decisions beyond their control by the metro affiliates. It will not directly reduce the amount of Australian content available to regional viewers, but it does permit a reduction in the overall hours of Australian content broadcast by regional broadcasters.This brings me to my next point. The bill says it all about this governments failures on regional media in Australia. Its late, its inadequate and it sells regional Australia short. The bill is late, because it addresses an issue the government has known about since at least 2017. An issue arose in 2017 which the department considered to be an early warning sign of market failure in regional television broadcasting, yet the government is only just getting around to addressing it now. To quote the explanatory memorandum:The Department is of the view that broadcasters difficulties in meeting content requirements can be taken to be an early warning sign of market failure. In order to fulfil the intention of its policy, the Government will need to take action before market failure occurs, as this would limit regional audiences access to Australian content rather than promoting it.After sitting on this issue for years, the government is now rushing the bill through the parliament having introduced it only a few days ago—indeed, having brought it forward significantly on the Notice Paper today.The timing of this bill is off for another reason, though. The bill amends the Australian content transmission quota for commercial television broadcasters, which is a provision the government currently has under formal public review. Only two month ago, the government released an options paper for consultation as part of its review of the Australian content framework. As the explanatory memorandum states:This process will include consideration of the Australian content transmission quotas, including the multi-channel quota.Go to the departments website today and youll find that the consultation on the options paper is still open and doesnt close for a couple of weeks yet. The government is still inviting submissions but now seeks to amend the quota for regional and remote commercial television broadcasting licensees with little to no public notice.The bill is inadequate because it merely tinkers with a few provisions in the Broadcasting Services Act when a coherent, holistic and strategic package, including wholesale reform of the policy and regulatory framework, is necessary—a fact this government has known since it took office in 2013. Even the explanatory memorandum refers to:… concerns that the legislative framework had failed to keep pace with the market realities of providing commercial television broadcast content in regional and remote geographic areas of Australia.Instead of doing the hard yards to reform the legislative framework, all this government knows how to do is dismantle it, piece by piece. The bill contains relatively minor amendments when major structural reform is required to address digital disruption, COVID-19 and the risk of market failure in regional television. While the bill will ease the compliance burden for regional broadcasters, the measures are relatively minor and, alone, are insufficient to address the risk of market failure.After seven years of inaction on wholesale reform, and after letting the issues the bill addresses fester for years, the government is now rushing this bill through the parliament. Whereas the former Minister for Communications, Senator Mitch Fifield, was renowned in the industry for doing very little—with all manner of work disappearing into what became widely known in the industry as the Fifield triangle—the current minister for communications is so desperate to appear to be doing things, hes doubling up. So desperate is the minister to appear to be doing things that not only did he falsely claim to have suspended the Australian content quotas in April this year, he now has a bill before the parliament to amend a provision that he currently has under review. Witness the Fletcher paradox, where the minister says one thing but does another and where he says hes consulting on the transmission quota even as he puts legislation before the parliament to amend it.The bill sells regional Australia short, because it assumes that, where broadcasters face challenges in meeting Australian content requirements, the answer is to relax the content requirements rather than assist broadcasters in bridging the gap somehow or undertaking genuine reform to address structural challenges. When faced with the problem that some regional broadcasters are finding it difficult to satisfy their transmission quota, what does the government do? It looks to relax the consumer safeguard, not support reaching the consumer safeguard. While the bill will not lower the amount of local content that is currently available to regional audiences on commercial radio, it does permit a reduction in the number of hours of Australian content on regional commercial television that is currently available to regional audiences. At best, this will be only an indirect and modest reduction in the number of hours of repeat Australian content or simulcast content already available to regional audiences—content that is currently used as filler to make up hours to satisfy the quota. At worst, it may have unintended consequences and result in a significant reduction in the number of hours of Australian content available on regional commercial television. The explanatory memorandum notes:The Department worked closely with ACMA throughout the development of this measure to ensure that the preferred deeming provision option has enacted the Governments policy without any unintended consequences.The explanatory memorandum further notes that the government assessed these risks as low to very low. What is clear is that regional media is facing challenges, partly as a result of this governments failure to keep the regulatory framework up to date and regional Australians are missing out as a result. It isnt regional media that has failed here, it is the government that has failed regional media. For years, Labor has been calling on this government to overhaul the policy and regulatory framework and implement a real plan to support Australian content, public interest journalism and regional media in a landscape transformed by digitisation and convergence. For years, Labor has been warning this government that their legislative changes, funds and backroom deals are inadequate to support regional media in the face of digital disruption.When this third-term coalition government took office back in 2013, they knew Australias media laws were broken. The regulator said so, and the industry had told them so. Years ago, this government itself decried the regulatory framework as analogue era, yet it has failed to provide a digital-era replacement in the many years since. Over six years, this government has left the hulking analogue framework in place and has not addressed the main game around new services, the shift in advertising revenue and the uneven playing field.In September 2017, the former Liberal Prime Minister described the governments changes to media law as a new era for Australias media and boasted:The government is strengthening Australias media industry, enhancing media diversity and securing local journalism jobs, particularly in regional areas.Less than three years later, the government stated that it is of the view that:… broadcasters difficulties in meeting content requirements is an early warning sign of market failure.The AFR is reporting regional TV on the verge of market failure. Its an indictment. The governments failure to address these systemic challenges has left the sector exposed to external shocks, and Australians are missing out on public interest journalism and content as a result. Its coming up to seven years of this third-term government, and they still dont know what to do. Theyve had years to fix the outdated regulatory framework and address the systemic challenges facing regional media but still dont know what to do.The government have a pile of reviews and recommendations at their disposal, yet they continue to ignore them or cherry-pick them in a lopsided manner. The final report of the ACCC digital platforms inquiry, which was released in June 2019, devotes an entire appendix to recent reviews of media industry laws and regulation. Its a library. The government have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on consultants to advise them on regional media, but they dont know what to do. As recently as this month, the department put out to tender for research to:… provide an assessment of the existing, emerging and novel business models for the production and distribution of news and media content.It will also:… evaluate the regulatory and non-regulatory measures employed (or being considered) in comparable jurisdictions.The research is to be delivered by 31 August 2020. The government have taken almost seven years to commission this research, but the consultant gets less than seven weeks to actually do it.The government released its response to the ACCCs Digital platforms inquiryreport to much fanfare in December 2019. Unfortunately, the government did not support all the ACCCs recommendations for the media, and their so-called reform road map makes no clear reference to modernising measures around regional broadcasting, among other glaring emissions.The ACCCs Digital platforms inquiry: final report makes a range of recommendations that this government has not supported, is pretending to support or has been slow to implement. For example, in recommendation 6, the ACCC recommends a process to implement a harmonised media framework. The government says that it supports it and will be:commencing a staged process to reform media regulation towards an end state of a platform-neutral regulatory framework covering both online and offline delivery of media content to Australian consumersYet this bill is a step away from harmonisation, as it treats metropolitan and regional commercial broadcasters differently when it comes to Australian content multichannel transmission quotas.In recommendation 7, the ACCC recommended a code of conduct to govern relationships between digital platforms and media businesses. The government supports it in principle. The ACCC is currently working to consult on a proposed mandatory code of conduct, but questions remain as to how much this will help regional media or independent media outlets. In recommendation 9, the ACCC recommends stable and adequate funding for the public broadcasters—the SBS and ABC. The government says that it supports the recommendation, even as it cuts a further $83.7 million from the ABC.In recommendation 10, the ACCC recommends grants for local journalism. The government says that it supports this in principle and has brought forward a new fund, the Public Interest News Gathering fund, to replace its embattled Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund, but there are a few hairs on this too. The government is too slow when it comes to getting direct support to media outlets who need it. The fund they announced in 2017 failed to get the money out the door, and the fund they announced in 2020 came almost a year after the ACCC had recommended it. Where the ACCC has recommended the fund be administered at arms length, the minister has installed himself as the decision-maker. Where the ACCC recommends $50 million over three years, the government has announced $50 million for one year, and $30 million to $40 million of that is an underspend from the fund that they announced back in 2017. Its unclear how much funding is available for regional print, regional commercial radio and regional commercial television or for smaller publishers, and our questions to the minister on this remain unanswered. In recommendation 11 of the digital platforms inquiry, the ACCC recommended tax settings to encourage philanthropic support for journalism, and the government has said it does not support the recommendation.In the context of COVID-19, we urge the government to recalibrate their response to the ACCC digital platforms inquiry and reconsider many of the good recommendations that have been advanced by parliament, the ACCC, industry, academics, non-profits and others, such as the Public Interest Journalism Initiative. Regional media has been hit by the triple whammy of digital disruption, COVID-19 and an inept Liberal-National government. Australias media was already in crisis before COVID-19. The governments many failures on regional media have left the sector exposed to external shocks. Regional areas are where the underlying trends impacting the media are being felt most acutely. Regional media in Australia has been pushed to the brink of market failure by this governments inaction.Data collected by the ACCC shows that between 2008 and 2018, 106 local and regional newspaper titles closed across Australia, representing a net 15 per cent decrease in the number of these publications. These closures have left 21 local government areas previously covered by these titles without coverage from a single local newspaper in either print or online formats, including 16 local government areas in regional Australia. According to the Public Interest Journalism Initiative, 200 titles have closed since January 2019, and the number of contractions in Australias public interest news landscape has grown to over 200 since January 2019, according to data from the Public Interest Journalism Initiative Australian Newsroom Mapping Project. The Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance has noted:In recent months we have seen more than 150 regional and community newspapers cease printing. This is on top of the 106 local and regional papers that closed over the previous decade.Many of those papers are more than a century old. Many may never reopen.It shouldnt be this way. The stories of regional and rural Australia are important: our stories matter.In regional Australia the local paper is the heartbeat of the community and provides the local news that the big cities cant or wont provide. Its often also a focal point for community connection, cohesion and education.Media diversity in regional and remote areas is at or below the minimum number of voices in 68 per cent of licence areas, and multiple local television stations have closed their doors. On this governments watch we have news deserts emerging, widespread closures of newspapers, closure and consolidation of multiple television newsrooms, and mass sackings of journalists—a devastating loss for many local communities and for our stories, our culture and our democracy.Labor welcomes the relief announced by the government so far, but it is inadequate, and more is needed. Thats why Labors shadow minister for communications, Michelle Rowland, wrote to the Deputy Prime Minister in April advocating for the regional community media sector to be considered as part of the governments $1 billion regional community fund. There has not been a response to date, and that is why Labor is moving an amendment to this bill. I move:That all words after That be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House:(1) notes the alarming decline in regional media;(2) acknowledges that regional commercial television broadcasters difficulties in meeting content requirements can be taken as an early warning sign of market failure;(3) notes the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has found that:(a) between 2008 and 2018, the closure of 106 local and regional newspaper titles across Australia has left 21 local government areas previously covered by these titles without coverage from a single local newspaper (in either print or online formats); and(b) the public broadcasters, the ABC and SBS, are not currently resourced to fully compensate for the decline in local reporting previously produced by traditional commercial publishers;(4) further notes the Public Interest Journalism Initiatives Australian Newsroom Mapping Project found that the number of contractions in Australias public interest news landscape has grown to over 200 since January 2019; and(5) is of the view that this third-term Government has failed regional media by failing to reform the legislative framework and failing to deliver effective direct and indirect support to industry in a timely manner.","Broadcasting Services Amendment (Regional Commercial Radio and Other Measures) Bill 2020","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr WATTS (Gellibrand) ","(19:02):"

331,0,0,0,1,1,"Sharma, Dave, MP",274506,"Wentworth","LP","N/A",4669," Australia and New Zealand have done remarkably well in weathering the coronavirus storm. Australia has had something in the order of 7,300 cases—including active and predominantly resolved cases—and slightly over 100 deaths. Our trans-Tasman neighbour New Zealand has had in the order of 1,100 cases and somewhere around 22 deaths. Every death of course is regrettable, but, compared to how the rest of the world has fared, we have done remarkably well in protecting our population from the ravages of this crisis.One of the untold success stories is how well our immediate neighbourhood has fared. The countries of the south-west Pacific, despite being potentially quite vulnerable to the ravages of this disease, have actually done a tremendous job in managing the impact of this disease on their populations. According to the WHO, there are now 322 cases in total in the Pacific and some seven deaths in total. But the countries that we consider closest to us have quite a small number of cases. Papua New Guinea has had eight cases. Fiji has had 18 cases. For both countries, it has now been more than three incubation periods since they’ve had a new case. The Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Tonga and Samoa have all been COVID-19 free. In fact, most of the cases have really been concentrated in what we would consider the eastern part of the Pacific, the territories of Guam, French Polynesia, Northern Mariana Islands and New Caledonia.Why do I mention this? There has been a lot of talk in the Australian media and between our governments about a trans-Tasman bubble. Thats a bubble that would allow air links, travel, commerce, trade and tourism to resume between Australia and New Zealand. It makes a lot of sense because both of our countries have done relatively well in managing this virus, and in a risk-based approach we can look at resuming these air links.But in the next step we need to look at expanding this concept to include some of the countries of the south-west Pacific. The countries of the south-west Pacific are very vulnerable to the coronavirus, because they’ve got limited public health infrastructure and, if the virus was to take off there, their systems of public health could quickly be overwhelmed. But, as I said earlier, the governments have done a very good job in preventing new infection by preventing overseas arrivals, limiting internal travel, raising public awareness, good hygiene practices and the like.Australia is already helping these countries get on their feet. Weve helped these Pacific states defend themselves and weve helped them respond to the threat of COVID-19. I commend the work of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Payne, and the member for Mitchell and Minister for International Development and the Pacific, Alex Hawke, in helping to reprogram our aid program to the Pacific and make sure we support things like testing capability, public information campaigns, access to medical supplies and expertise and the like.But for these countries now the risk is as much economic as it is health related. The World Bank has warned that the economic outline for Pacific island countries this year is subject to substantial risk due to their economies reliance on grants and tourism. This is why a trans-Tasman bubble would be such an important initiative. It would allow Pacific islands to once more access some of their biggest tourism markets, which are Australia and New Zealand. It would also incidentally provide an opportunity for many Aussies and Kiwis to take a holiday in our own region rather than further afield and get to know our own neighbourhood a little better.One example is that tourism accounts for around 30 to 25 per cent of Fijis GDP. Thats almost gone to zero overnight because of the cutting of air links. Somewhere in the order of 85 to 95 per cent of those tourists and travellers to Fiji are Australians and New Zealanders.There is an interesting pilot that has been underway this week: 189 German tourists got on a plane in Dusseldorf on Monday and flew to the Spanish territory of Majorca in the Balearic Islands. Its part of a pilot scheme taking place before Spain opens up to international tourism to see whether, and how, these sorts of air links can be resumed. Interestingly enough, these tourists are staying in only two hotels. They need to have a temperature check before they go, fill out an address and have a questionnaire completed, and theres a facility to quarantine these people should they test positive at any time during their stay. These are the sorts of innovative things that we will need to pursue as we look further ahead beyond the health aspects of this crisis and look towards getting our neighbours back on their feet.Australia is well known as part of the Pacific family. Indeed, we view the countries as our family and we look out for each other in tough times. The next step for this family is to ensure we come through this crisis together.","COVID-19: Pacific Island Nations","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[1]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr SHARMA (Wentworth) ","(19:30):"
332,0,0,0,1,1,"Thwaites, Kate, MP",282212,"Jagajaga","ALP","N/A",4671," I want to speak about the Uluru Statement from the Heart, because it is such an important document and an opportunity that we should not just let pass us by. Much of the conversation around the Uluru statement has been focused on a voice to parliament. I fully support a voice enshrined in our Constitution, but there is another part of the statement that gets less attention but which seems particularly relevant to our national conversation at the moment. Thats the call for a makarrata, or a truth-telling process.It is the case that most of us in this country grew up with a view of history that was not complete. It was told from only one point of view. I well remember being in primary school and making my projects about the settlers and the explorers, but there was a chunk of what happened that I hadnt heard about to include in my history project. As my colleague and First Nations woman Linda Burney has said, some of the massacres that occurred in this country happened just one generation ago. They have, necessarily, left scars. It will hurt us to look more closely at them, but we cause far greater ongoing hurt for First Nations people if we are not prepared to do this work. Doing this work would not make us less as a nation; it would make us more. It doesnt have to be a culture war; it can be part of reconciliation and part of healing.In the last few weeks, so many people in our community have been showing us that they are ready for this conversation. I want to thank all the people in my electorate whove contacted me, urging the parliament to progress the Uluru Statement from the Heart. It is time for leadership from this place to make that happen. Its time for voice, treaty, truth.Doing this work makes us so much more likely to get progress on the areas where the experiences of First Nations people are still unacceptable. The 1991 Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody found that Aboriginal people are more likely to die in custody, because theyre arrested and jailed at disproportionate rates. As of March this year, 28.6 per cent of the male prison population is Aboriginal, yet Aboriginal people only make up three per cent of the total population. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are more likely to be held in custody for traffic offences, unpaid fines or minor offences than white Australians. Since the royal commission, 434 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians have died in custody. My colleague Senator Pat Dodson in the other place, who obviously knows far more about this subject than me and has a long history of fighting for improvements in this area, made a speech that was far more eloquent than I could make on this very topic just last week. I urge everyone to look at and listen to that speech, because it is so important.Being honest about our history also means we can be honest about the work that we need to do next. This is important at the moment with the Closing the Gap Refresh process thats occurring. The Coalition of Peaks, a new group of Aboriginal peak organisations, have been leading the way in this process for Aboriginal Community Controlled Organisations to deliver the services that First Nations people need. Theyve been demonstrating that, without a voice at the table and without genuine investment, we dont get progress.Weve heard a lot in this chamber about the Closing the Gap targets and progress and too much about a lack of progress. What we need to hear about is a new way, and thats one of the things thats on the table for us now if were prepared to do the work, if were prepared to listen to Aboriginal people and put their voice at the table. The Coalition of Peaks made the point that those targets that we hold up can be meaningless if governments arent willing to change the way they work, if were not willing to cede some of that control that we hold so closely and to put these voices front and centre.Theyre also meaningless without proper funding. You cant close the gap if you dont fund it. You cant change someones life if they dont have a roof over their head. You cant help families keep their kids with them, rather than in custody, if they dont have a clean kitchen to feed them from. These are really big issues that our nation—lets be honest—has not done a good job of confronting. We have the opportunity now; lets not let it pass us by. Its time for us to endorse the Uluru Statement from the Heart.","Uluru Statement from the Heart","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms THWAITES (Jagajaga) ","(19:35):"
333,0,0,0,1,1,"Simmonds, Julian, MP",282983,"Ryan","LNP","N/A",4672," Tonight the parents of Australia and, in particular, the parents of the Ryan electorate are sleeping more soundly. Because of the three years worth of work of the Morrison coalition government, we now have mandatory sentences for child sex offenders. Its been three years of Labor opposition and their backflips and tactical games, but this is because of the hard work of the Morrison government. In particular, I want to congratulate the Attorney-General and my fellow Queenslander Minister Dutton for shepherding these important reforms through both the House and now the Senate. Because of their efforts, the Morrison government has been able to put front and centre the protection of children and our most vulnerable children at that.We have invested more than any government before us in tackling child sexual exploitation. Under the guidance of the Minister for Home Affairs, weve established Australias eSafety Commissioner, which is providing parents with a broad range of online safety programs and resources. Minister Dutton has established the Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation, which is successfully driving the national response to counter the exploitation of children, leading to a significant increase in arrests. This focus and spending has been so vital for Australian families. As a dad, it is hard to comprehend just how disgustingly prevalent the risk of this abhorrent exploitation is. Each year the Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation receives almost 18,000 reports of child sexual exploitation. Each report can contain hundreds or thousands of explicit videos and images.One child suffering sexual abuse is one too many in this country, and yet current data shows 7.7 per cent of Australians will have experienced childhood sexual abuse before the age of 15. Child abuse causes lifelong mental and physical harm to the victim, and the financial cost of child abuse and neglect in Australia is over $9 billion per year. Unfortunately, during the COVID pandemic, as we have spent more time at home and online, the eSafety Commissioner has seen a 300 per cent increase in reports from some forms of online child exploitation reporting. The ACCCE reports a 123 per cent increase in child exploitation cases compared to just last year. In the last few weeks, weve seen that the AFP has made major arrests in our community, including nine men across three states, laying 40 charges relating to a sophisticated child abuse network operating in Australian suburbs that was putting child exploitation material online.The new mandatory sentencing legislation will now act as a strong deterrent of this most abhorrent behaviour. Last year, current sentencing outcomes meant 39 per cent of convicted Commonwealth child sex offenders did not spend a single day in jail. This is just so wildly out of step with community expectations, it is hard to imagine how it has gone on this long. Its taken us as a government three years of hard work to get past Labors political games and backflips, but its now so important that were here, because, instead of that situation where 39 per cent didnt spend a single day in jail, now a jail term is the starting point for all of these federally convicted child sex offenders. Maximum penalties will also be increased to better reflect the gravity of these types of crimes, including a new life term for the worst offenders. The bill creates a new maximum penalty of life for the most serious Commonwealth offences and a presumption against bail to keep offenders in custody while they face trial.This is a tremendous outcome for Australian parents. As parents, we now need to look to our own families, because we can do more. While parents talk to their kids often about stranger danger, only three per cent of parents list online grooming as a concern. Children are allowed access to the internet at a young age but are not given the tools to understand the dangers. Four out of five children aged four are using the internet, and almost one-third of these four-year-olds have access to their own device. By age 12, 50 per cent of kids have access to their own internet enabled device, yet 70 per cent of parents allow children aged 12 to use the internet anywhere in the house, including where they are alone. Parents, its time to talk to your kids about how prevalent this is and to make sure they are armed with the tools to prevent it.Congratulations to the A-G and particularly Minister Dutton for three years of hard work to get this together. Because of your efforts, the parents of Australia will sleep better tonight.","Child Abuse","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[3]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr SIMMONDS (Ryan) ","(19:40):"
334,0,0,0,1,1,"Haines, Helen, MP",282335,"Indi","IND","N/A",4673," In the 19th century, it was regional Australia that led the world in the transition from gas to electricity. When electric lighting first lit up our streets, it happened first in towns like Tamworth, in 1888, Penrith, in 1890, and Broken Hill, in 1891. Sydney didnt get electricity until 1904, after Federation. This history is fitting because, in the 21st century, regional Australia is again leading the country in the transition to renewable energy. The hard-headed engineers at the Australian Energy Market Operator tell us that some 15 gigawatts of coal power will be retired from Australias electricity system over the next 20 years and will be replaced almost entirely with the cheapest form of new electricity going around, and that is renewables. The CSIRO projects that $1 trillion could be spent on Australias electricity system by 2050. A boom is coming in renewable energy, and its coming to the regions. Those same engineers have identified 33 renewable energy zones across Australia that are prime locations to concentrate on new renewables. Im proud to say that my electorate of Indi is one of them. The question is: how do we capture the benefits of this boom for regional communities? I believe that community energy provides a pathway forwards.Community energy is where everyday people own, develop or benefit from a renewable energy project. That project could be putting solar on every roof of every house in your street. It could be putting solar panels on the roofs of all the local schools, the local hospital or the footy club. It could mean raising money to buy and install a community battery to store electricity when its cheap and cut the whole towns power bills. It could be working with a commercial wind farm to develop it and ensuring that the local community can buy shares in that project, so that every electron sold brings money back into regional communities. The possibilities are many, but the message is clear: putting everyday regional communities at the centre of the renewables boom is the best way to ensure that they benefit. I know this because Indi is a leader in community energy. We have 12 community energy groups across the electorate, more than in any other electorate in Australia. There are 100 in total, with more than the 12 in Indi. Theyre looking to build microgrids in towns like Euroa, Yea and Corryong; to put batteries in Beechworth and Yackandandah; and to install solar on low-income housing in Wodonga.When I was elected, I committed to developing a policy to unlock the potential of community energy, not just for my electorate but for every regional community in Australia. It was pretty ambitious. Thats why, five weeks ago, I launched a community co-design process to invite everyday Australians to work with me to develop a national policy for community energy. I published a discussion paper on my website, outlining the massive potential that community energy holds for regional Australia, the barriers that exist for further deployment and policy options the Commonwealth government could take to accelerate the sector. Im inviting every Australian to have their say. Until 3 July Im inviting submissions from interested Australians to comment on this paper and to answer an important question: what could the government do to unlock the potential of renewables in your regional community?So far in this co-design process weve held workshops with Totally Renewable Beechworth, Totally Renewable Yackandandah, 2030 Yea, Euroa Environment Group, Renewable Albury Wodonga Energy, and Wangaratta Landcare and Sustainability. Weve held two national workshops with people from all over the country. Over the next few weeks weve scheduled workshops with Renewable Energy Benalla, Renewable Energy Mansfield, Wangaratta Youth Council and GV Community Energy in the Goulburn Valley. As soon as I finish this speech Im going back up to my office to rejoin a Zoom workshop with the Kinglake Rotary club.We had submissions from Manilla, Tamworth, Dubbo, Orange and, of course, right across Indi. Submissions will close on the co-design process on 3 July. I encourage every community group, local council and sporting club and every person in Australia to make a submission to my community co-design policy. At the end of it, together with a panel of community energy experts, we will be developing a concept paper to bring to the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction outlining practical, sensible steps. This is an experiment in participatory democracy. When I was elected, I promised to do politics differently. I meant it. This is community co-design, bringing a democratic approach to new policy.","Renewable Energy","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[4]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr HAINES (Indi) ","(19:46):"
335,0,0,0,1,1,"Pearce, Gavin, MP",282306,"Braddon","LP","N/A",4675," It was great news for the Braddon electorate yesterday. The Prime Minister announced the step up of the governments JobMaker program. Project Marinus is one of the 15 projects that will be fast-tracked for approval. Renewable energy is one of the greatest economic opportunities in the north-west, West Coast and King Island. Were the envy of Australia. We have what the rest of the world needs: the capacity to produce clean, reliable, affordable energy.We are on track to be 100 per cent renewable by the year 2022. It has been forecast that we could generate up to 200 per cent of our current electricity needs by the year 2040. This means that we will be not only a producer of renewable energy for our own domestic needs but also an exporter of renewable energy across the national electricity grid. Tasmania is perfectly placed to supply Australia with the energy reliability and security it needs, which in turn will inject billions of dollars into the economy and create literally thousands of jobs in our local region.The proposed route for the Marinus Link interconnector is between Burnie and the La Trobe Valley in Victoria. This means that yesterdays announcement is yet another vote of confidence in our region by Prime Minister Morrison and another job-creating commitment for the north-west, West Coast and King Island by the federal government.Progressing the Marinus Link and Battery of the Nation projects, as well as backing our broader renewable sector, will underpin these projects. This is a particularly keen focus of mine. Renewable energy is vital to our region because the sector has the potential to secure our prosperity for generations to come. Renewable energy will create thousands of jobs today and tomorrow. Whether its through pumped hydro, hydrogen, wind energy or the incredibly exciting federally funded wave energy pilot that is about to be commissioned on King Island, these industries have the potential to create a jobs boom. It is estimated 1,400 jobs will also be created over the peak construction phase of Marinus, with up to 2,350 jobs also created from further renewable energy and storage development over the peak construction period for the Battery of the Nation and Marinus developments. The combined investment of Marinus Link and the new renewable energy developments will inject over $7 billion into the Tasmanian economy over the coming years, and a large proportion will be in the electorate of Braddon.Its important to note that the governments announcement to fast-track the approval for Project Marinus doesnt mean that environmental safeguards will be relaxed. This isnt about reducing environmental standards. Were accelerating projects through existing process by cutting red tape, not by cutting corners. Having stronger and faster environmental approvals through the removal of inefficient administration is key to our economic recovery as we emerge from COVID-19.Yesterdays announcement continues to build on the work that the government has already been doing to improve the assessment time frames in delivering quick and robust decisions on major projects well ahead of time. Marinus will still undergo an extensive environmental assessment and checks. The announcement to fast-track Project Marinus means that the required due diligence will happen sooner, enabling the project to provide the stimulus that our region needs sooner. Last month the Australian Energy Market Commission confirmed the need for increased renewable energy supply, increased energy storage and increased interstate transmission infrastructure. All of this can be supplied within the north-west, the west coast and King Island, supported by our nationally-significant Battery of the Nation and Marinus Link projects. I am committed to playing my part to secure Tasmanias renewable energy future, working with my state Liberal colleagues to progress these vitally important projects for the electorate of Braddon and for Tasmania.","JobMaker","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[5]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr PEARCE (Braddon) ","(19:51):"
336,0,0,0,1,1,"Stanley, Anne, MP",265990,"Werriwa","ALP","N/A",4676," When Gough Whitlam was first elected as the member for Werriwa in 1952 there was not a single high school, let alone a university, in the electorate. University participation rates in the western suburbs had, for a long time, been the lowest in Australia. The concept of a university in Sydneys western suburbs was, for decades, repeatedly considered and shelved. Gough was not only instrumental in ensuring a tertiary education was the right of all Australians but was also an active champion for the establishment of a university in Western Sydney.Gough, of course, remained a close friend and supporter of WSU until his death. The university honoured that support with the establishment of the Whitlam Institute in 2000. He would no doubt be proud to know, as I am, that Werriwa is now home to more Western Sydney university students than any other electorate—3,909 at the last count. In 30 short years, the universitys impact on the region has been immense, becoming one of the driving forces in the transformation of Western Sydney.There arent too many people who live, work or play in Western Sydney that dont have a connection to WSU. All three of my sons are alumni of the university. Two of my current staff are both alumni and ex-staff of WSU, and I have a staff member who is currently a student. Because of these strong links, WSU recognises it must play a leading role in the post COVID-19 recovery of the Western Sydney economy. It aims to do this through employment, education, training and construction. Despite a disappointing lack of support and assistance from the federal government and unlike a lot of other universities, WSU is proposing no staff cuts or redundancies this year. So I commend WSU on its ongoing negotiations with the NTEU and the PSA.WSU is also supporting an essential retraining and reskilling effort by offering online short courses in the areas of education, aged care, interpreting and translation. Through a swift migration to online learning, existing students were able to negate the toll COVID-19 has had on their studies. The WSUs Student Hardship Fund has provided an olive branch to both domestic and on-shore international students experiencing financial hardship. A critical 10 per cent reduction for international students was implemented, along with money and food vouchers to ensure theyre well taken care of.WSU is determined to support their students, their staff and the wider community. However, the burden of any recovery effort cannot be carried by the tertiary sector alone. The federal government must support our TAFEs and universities. As we saw with Labors successful management during the GFC, one of the key factors to keeping an economy strong and Australians working is providing strong stimulus, particularly in the construction sector. If were to overcome our nations first recession in three decades, it wont come via HomeBuilder. WSU is ready and committed to do some of that work. The university believes residents across the width and breadth of Western Sydney should have ready access to the worlds best education and research facilities, and it wants to do that building. A multiversity, bringing in four of Australias leading higher education institutions, would be one such facility. Located at the Aerotropolis, also in my electorate, the multiversity will focus on STEM specialising disciplines, including aerospace engineering, advanced manufacturing and defence.A health research and education hub, adjacent to Liverpool Hospital and the Macarthur Medical Research Centre in Campbelltown, will provide thousands of positions in the health sector, focused on education, research and employment. Theres the peri-urban greenhouse and the logistics hub at Hawkesbury and a future technology centre at Werrington, providing projects based on CBD campuses. The first of which is the Peter Shergold Building in Parramatta, which sets a world standard for technology driven modern learning spaces. The Ngara Ngura building in Liverpool, which opened last year, is a similar success.Gough once said:We are all diminished when any of us are denied proper education. The nation is the poorer—a poorer economy, a poorer civilisation, because of this human and national waste.Western Sydney University is trying their best to make sure that the students of Sydneys west have the best outlook on life.House adjourned at 20:00","Western Sydney University","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[6]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms STANLEY (Werriwa—Opposition Whip) ","(19:55):"

Those who do know him or know of him might associate his name with the Kingsley Amateur Football Club, where, as chairman of the selectors of 2002, he turned the clubs fortunes around and the senior and reserves made their respective grand finals. Later that year in October, the clubs players, 19 of them, headed to Bali to celebrate their win. Laurie was there too. They had been in Bali for less than 12 hours when tragedy struck. Laurie Kerr was born on 12 May 1958. He was a survivor of the Bali bombings on 12 October 2002. The club lost seven of its players that night in Bali at the Sari Club. Laurie survived with burns to 20 per cent of his body, but the bombings really changed his life.Sadly, I stand here today to commemorate the life of Laurie Kerr. He passed away on Saturday 13 June 2020. When I met Laurie, I was struck by two things: his incredible sense of humour and his incredible sense of sadness and loss. As we shared a meal one day in a little cafe in suburban Greenwood, just a few minutes from his home in Kingsley, he wavered between tears of sadness and sometimes tears rolling down his face while he bellowed in laughter. Laurie didnt want his life to be defined by the bombings, but the trauma was just too much. In fact, in the moments after the bombings, despite his injuries and still inside the Sari Club, he worked to rescue others. But in the years since then, he had been battling constant pain from his injuries, hed undergone numerous operations and he had chronic pain syndrome.My office, along with Kingsley MLA Jess Stojkovski and the Australian Red Cross, helped Laurie to get permanent housing and to work with Centrelink. He didnt live in Cowan; he actually lived in Moore, and I know the member for Moore to be a decent human being, and I understand that he will also be speaking on the life of Laurie. He deserves to be remembered in this chamber.Laurie is survived by his children Tristan, Aaron, Brittany and Allira, and by six grandchildren. I understand that he passed away peacefully and was found in his lounge room on the sofa. If there was one thing I could have wished for Laurie, its that he would find peace.

I was delighted, only a couple of weeks ago, to make an announcement, standing shoulder to shoulder with the state member and the local councillor, Marty Hunt and David Law, about a $60,000 rebranding exercise for the town.

It will be a stamp on what Nambour is. It will show a clear line from the past, all the way through to the future.

The history and significance of the Overland was recently documented by railway historian John Wilson, who last month released his third railway book The Overland: A Social History. The Overland is currently a twice-weekly service operated by Journey Beyond, formerly Great Southern Rail. For the past five years, since this federal government cut subsidies to pensioners, veterans and seniors, the service has relied on Victorian and South Australian government subsidies. Those subsidies have now stopped, with the South Australian Marshall government ending its financial assistance in 2018 and refusing to extend it, while the Victorian government continued funding the service until this year. The future of the Overland is up in the air, with COVID-19 adding to that uncertainty. If the service was discontinued, it would be a short-sighted, penny-pinching decision by the two state governments and the federal government, particularly given the modest subsidy required and when nationally there is a revival in building rail networks. Aerospace engineer Edwin Michell has outlined a proposal for modernising the Overland that would turn it into an attractive, viable service at a cost of around $50 million. I dont know if his proposal has been independently costed, but at a time when hundreds of millions of dollars are being put into other national infrastructure projects, at the very least the proposal should be properly assessed by governments.This Friday between 1 and 2 pm a Zoom community summit will be held for people, many from country regions in Victoria and South Australia, that would be affected by the loss of the Overland. Amongst those people will be author John Wilson, Mayor Mark Radford from the Rural City of Horsham, Mayor Bruce Meyer from the West Wimmera Shire, Councillor Mat OBrien from the Rural City of Murray Bridge, representatives of the Tatiara District Council and Margaret Millington of the rural community of Nhill.The purpose of the summit, which has been referred to as the Serviceton Summit, is to launch a public campaign to save the Overland. For South Australia the loss of the Overland would be devastating. It would be another serious blow to South Australias image, public confidence and status. I call on the South Australian government to work with the Victorian government, the federal government and Journey Beyond to secure the future of the Overland.

Regional communities like my electorate are the key to our recovery, Prime Minister. We have boundless plains to share. Weve got the land, and many new families are moving into my electorate to chase that great Australian dream of home ownership. New estates are springing up at Chisholm, Aberglasslyn, Gillieston Heights and Thornton, bringing with them people who need jobs and services. While we welcome those new families—I relish the thought of one day being able to doorknock all those thousands of new homes—I know that the people that are moving to our area and the people that live there want the infrastructure to support these new families moving to our area. Its one thing to have lots and lots of people moving into the area, but they have to be able to move around; they need hospitals and schools; they need the infrastructure and services to support a worthwhile life and to enhance that dream. Unfortunately, after drought and fire and now COVID-19, many people in my community have felt that the government just hasnt done enough to kickstart the economy and really back their family in. Im imploring the government to do more to help the Paterson economy bounce back.The Prime Minister has said hes going to fast-track $1.5 billion worth of infrastructure projects. Well, Ive got some suggestions for things that he could do in my electorate that desperately need doing. The Prime Minister could build the M1 extension from Raymond Terrace to Black Hill.

This is just not good enough. We know that lots and lots of freight comes from western New South Wales across the New England Highway and the Golden Highway down to the Port of Newcastle. It intersects with that same stretch of road, and, in the meantime, I have people who are just trying to make a living. They just want to get to work and not be camped with holiday traffic for three hours—and its not just the holidays; its every morning and afternoon now.Come on, Prime Minister, give us a clear run on the M1, and the Newcastle Airport, while Im at it. If we could make the runway a code E runway, then we would be able to have planes landing that would be able to reach further into Asia and we would be able to take our beautiful seafood and our produce into those areas, creating export dollars and industries for my community. This is so important. Im going to be talking to my community in a virtual town hall about this. Im inviting you to come along. Its Wednesday 24 June at 10.30.

348,0,0,0,1,2,"Pasin, Tony, MP",240756,"Barker","LP","N/A",4681," Deputy Speaker Gillespie, I know you know that this week is Mens Health Week. Unfortunately, the health status of men in most countries, including Australia, is generally poorer than that of women. More men die at early stages of life, more men have accidents, more men take their own lives and more men suffer from lifestyle related conditions than women of the same ages. At the same time, men are less frequent visitors to their general practitioners and less inclined to seek help on account of their health. Mens Health Week is to heighten awareness of preventable health problems and to encourage early detection and treatment of disease amongst men and boys.Im a huge supporter of raising awareness of mens health issues, particularly conditions that are preventable or have high survival rates when detected early. Prostate cancer is one such condition. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in Australian men, and early detection and treatment can significantly improve prostate cancer survival rates.The Limestone Coast region in Barker has a strong community led prostate cancer support group, and Im really pleased that every year they take the opportunity to have their big annual Aussie barbie out the front of my electorate office. Its now in its sixth year, and the Limestone Coast Prostate Cancer Support Group join with me at my office. We have a great day. We cook a few snags and we raise money, but, most importantly, we raise awareness about prostate cancer and the importance of knowing the risk factors, knowing the symptoms and how to undergo the health checks, particularly that you can now rely on a blood test.The Limestone Coast has also been fortunate to have the support of the Male Bag Foundation, an organisation Ive spoken about previously in this place. This year the foundations efforts were aimed at funding transperineal biopsy machines in Riverland and the Limestone Coast. The foundation has entered into a memorandum of understanding to facilitate machines at both locations by mid-2021. These machines will significantly boost the number of biopsies and seeding procedures, which currently require patients to travel to Adelaide or interstate.This week, being Mens Health Week, is a fantastic time to announce a prostate cancer nurse for the Limestone Coast. This is something that I have been working for with my local community for a very long time. To think our community was included in our governments $23 million announcement is outstanding. The Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia will support not only a nurse in my community but in 24 other locations around Australia.Finally, the message for all men this Mens Health Week is: be active, get medical help if you dont feel well, have a problem that wont go away or you notice unusual symptoms. Dont try to do everything on your own or bury your problems. Talk to your partner, talk to your friends, talk to your workmates and get the help you need.","Mens Health Week","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[6]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr PASIN (Barker) ","(16:17):"

The Lilley team were able to achieve a great result for the Queensland Stoma Association in Chermside, who contacted us asking for help with a loophole they were caught in that prevented them receiving JobKeeper. After working with the Queensland Stoma Association, Treasury decided to exclude government revenue from the turnover calculations so Kylie and her team were eligible for JobKeeper.Mark from Taigum had his NDIS appeal approved after working with my team. Mark now has the green light to install an access ramp in his home. Patricia from Chermside was finally able to get her Centrelink carers allowance claim approved after we worked with Centrelink a good seven months after she initially applied.We were also able to secure JobKeeper for Tim and his team at Harvest Rain, an amazing youth arts organisation in Stafford. Tim applied for JobKeeper for 22 of his workers in April. One month after the reimbursements were supposed to start rolling out, Harvest Rain had not received a cent. By that time, Tim had spent over $130,000 in wages in April and May and the Harvest Rain bank account was empty. So we called the tax office to let them know that he would have to stand down 22 workers without pay if he didnt receive JobKeeper that week, and, after six weeks of waiting, the claim was processed and the money was put in Tims bank account. I want to congratulate Tim for his advocacy, both for his workers and being a good boss, and for his work for the northside and broader Queensland arts industry.We were also able to help out Shorncliffe Outside School Hours Care, who had applied for JobKeeper but had been incorrectly classified by the ATO, resulting in very long delays paying the subsidy. We were able to work with the ATO to change their classification and get them their subsidy. We worked with the Department of Home Affairs to help get Yaping Shiers travel application approved so she was able to fly to Taiwan for her sisters funeral.Thank you to all of these northsiders who trusted me and my office to help them when they were going through a rough patch. It was my pleasure to help you as your federal member and it is something I will do every single day that you entrust me with the role of being your federal representative. These have been very tough times for us. We have worked together on the northside. We have highlighted where there are gaps in the system, and these are some examples of how, when we work together constructively and effectively, we can get really good results.I will endeavour to continue to do this for you in the months and, hopefully, years to come. Again, I thank you very much for working with my team. Please sing out if we can do anything for you. My office number is (07)32668244.

350,0,0,0,1,2,"Pearce, Gavin, MP",282306,"Braddon","LP","N/A",4683," There was good news from the great state of Tasmania this week, with Premier Peter Gutwein announcing that we have no active coronavirus cases. This is the milestone that weve all been working towards, and it could not have been reached without the sacrifice and the discipline of all Tasmanians. Thank you to everybody across the north-west, the west coast and King Island for playing your part.Since the pandemic outbreak Ive had contact with hundreds of businesses who have told me their stories. Every business has been affected, every individual circumstance has been different, but the unifying theme has always been gratitude. Businesses have told me that, without the swift and targeted support of the federal government through the cashflow boost, the extension and then the expansion of the instant asset write-off, the doubling of the safety net and jobseeker coronavirus supplement, and, of course, the JobKeeper program, their businesses would be in a much worse financial position as they emerge from the crisis. Some have told me that without the governments support they would have closed their doors for good.What JobKeeper has meant to businesses across the region can be summed up by Michael Gates, who owns Print Domain in Burnie. Michaels staff is highly specialised and cannot be easily replaced. In his words, JobKeeper meant that he could retain his highly trained staff throughout the shutdown phase. He said that, thanks to JobKeeper, he had not been burdened with having to recruit or train new staff. Hes hit the ground running and hes getting back to full production sooner. Its good for Michael and his staff and its exactly what our local community needs.A few weeks ago I also met with Justin Delanty from Lending4U in Devonport. I was after their feedback about government programs, like the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme and the instant asset write-off, and how they were being received in the electorate. Justin, Steven, Madison and I spoke about the many positives of the scheme, and they also raised a few challenges and issues they had with delays in processing claims under the instant asset write-off. I immediately had a meeting with the Treasurer and outlined to him what Justin had told me. The government is listening. Within a week the six-month extension of the $150,000 instant asset write-off had been announced.I have confidence in the people of the north-west, the west coast and King Island, and I know that because the government is listening and is responsive we will emerge from this pandemic a stronger, more resilient community that understands our enormous potential to achieve great things together.","Braddon Electorate: COVID-19","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[8]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr PEARCE (Braddon) ","(16:22):"
351,0,0,0,1,2,"Watts, Tim, MP",193430,"Gellibrand","ALP","N/A",4684," Since 2016, the US government has invited the public to hack the Pentagon. Its true! Knowing that adversaries are constantly trying to breach their systems, the US Department of Defense periodically invites white-hat hackers to try to breach its systems and win a cash bounty if theyre successful. Its known as a bug bounty—a financial reward used to harness external security researchers in the task of identifying security vulnerabilities in systems—and its working. Since 2016, more than 10,000 vulnerabilities have been discovered as security researchers have hacked the Pentagon, the army, the air force, the Marine Corps and the Defense Travel System.Compare that with this government, which not only fails to engage with security researchers to strengthen the Commonwealths cybersecurity posture but has often been actively hostile to their work. Compare the philosophy of Hack the Pentagon with this government, which threatened a prominent cryptographer for revealing that an anonymised dataset released by the health department was easily re-identifiable. It is a government that has sought to gag security researchers at Commonwealth funded cybersecurity conferences and has kicked journalists out of public forums on the development of its cybersecurity strategy. Most recently, it has allowed unnecessary bugs to undermine the effectiveness of its COVIDSafe app by failing to engage with the community of public-interest technologists who have volunteered their time to review the apps code for security and operations flaws. Just this week, Richard Nelson, a software developer studying COVIDSafe in his own time, identified a bug in the app that prevents locked iPhones from being logged by other phones—two months after the app passed internal reviews and went live.This governments approach to security is entirely founded on secrecy, but vulnerabilities dont vanish when you refuse to talk about them. Transparency doesnt create security threats; it reveals them. Yet the government have treated the good-faith endeavours of independent security researchers as acts of malice. Theyve treated potential allies as enemies. While the US government pays independent security researchers, the Australian government gags and ignores them. The governments addiction to secrecy in cybersecurity is making us less safe.A government that wanted to harness the endeavours of independent researchers to improve our posture could take a number of steps. It could initiate a process to reconcile conflicting and confusing state and territory laws that are potentially applicable to aspects of security researchers work. It could insist that Commonwealth entities publish a vulnerability disclosure process outlining how security researchers can alert management to vulnerabilities in their systems and how entities will respond. It could set up a centralised vulnerability disclosure process of last resort for reports that are not adequately addressed.The governments neglect of cybersecurity policy has been obvious to all since the Prime Minister, when he came to power, abolished the dedicated portfolio for it in the executive and made it the last point in Minister Duttons to do list. The new Cyber Security Strategy has been in the works for 10 months and is now two months late. But the most inexplicable neglect in the governments approach to cybersecurity is its refusal to engage with the security research community, public-interest technologists volunteering their time to help the government be better.","Cybersecurity","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[9]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr WATTS (Gellibrand) ","(16:25):"
352,0,0,0,1,2,"Sharma, Dave, MP",274506,"Wentworth","LP","N/A",4685," I want to congratulate the New South Wales government for listing, on 12 June, Rushcutters Bay Park and Yarranabbe Park, in my electorate of Wentworth, on the New South Wales State Heritage Register. For over 150 years, this area, once swampy land covered in tall rushes—hence the name—has been a place for people to get fresh air, exercise, enjoy views and enjoy entertainment.Making it Rushcutters Bay Park and Yarranabbe Park, in fact, was one of the largest harbour reclamation schemes for public recreation in New South Waless history. Six acres for this park were set aside in 1878, and it was proclaimed in 1885, making it one of the earliest recreational spaces protected from development. This area has seen much history. It was the site of the famous Sydney Stadium, which saw many boxing matches of the era, including the famous heavyweight bout between Tommy Burns and Bill Squires in 1908.It also hosted many of the famous pop and rock stars of the era, including The Beatles on their famous 1964 tour. The area includes the Reg Bartley Oval, named after a former lord mayor of Sydney, and the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia, which every year on Boxing Day is a hive of activity as yachts prepare to set sail in the Sydney Hobart Yacht Race. Today, both these parks, Rushcutters Bay Park and Yarranabbe Park, are vital places of recreation, well enjoyed and frequented by residents living in the built-up areas adjacent, in Elizabeth Bay, Potts Point, Rushcutters Bay, Edgecliff and Paddington. You see people walking dogs, people exercising, children using the playground equipment, and people eating at the kiosk. In fact, Im a frequent user of the park myself.This listing on the State Heritage Register is the culmination of a long campaign to ensure that these two parks, Rushcutters Bay Park and Yarranabbe Park, have a high level of protection and are preserved for the benefit of many future generations to come. Today, I want to commend some of the local residents who have been involved in this long campaign to have the site heritage listed. I would like to acknowledge Andrew Woodhouse, the President of the Potts Point and Kings Cross Heritage and Residents Society, and all members of the society; Ms Charlotte Feldman, president of the Darling Point Society, and all the other members of the Darling Point Society; Ms Dixie Coulton, a local resident; Mr John Walton AM, another local resident and passionate supporter of the area; Mr John Bevel, a local resident; Ms Chicky Bray, a local resident and also a family friend of mine; and, finally, my state parliamentary colleague Ms Gabrielle Upton MP, the New South Wales member for the seat of Vaucluse.

355,0,0,0,1,2,"Allen, Katrina, MP",282986,"Higgins","LP","N/A",4686," Its not often that you come to this place and one of the first inquiries that you sit on regards the expertise in your former life. So it is with a great sense of pride that I support the report that was recently handed down on the inquiry into allergies and anaphylaxis, Walking the allergy tightrope. Ive spent a lot of my professional career dealing with families and children with food allergies. The reason that I did this is that, as a paediatric gastroenterologist, I became exposed to people who were complaining about things that were affecting their life and they didnt know why. I dedicated my professional career to trying to understand this new concern: food allergy. As a medical student and as a medical professional, we were not trained in allergy, so there is a whole cohort of doctors who have had to be reverse trained in order to understand the issues of allergy. I would like to make the comment that the report that was handed down just this week is of immense importance because the committee members who sat on the committee came across information that many doctors, who are formally trained, have not come across. I would say that the committee are now experts in allergy, which is wonderful for this place.Food allergy is one of the conditions that is terribly frightening for families and the person or child affected. When someone is exposed to something that could be completely safe for 99 per cent of the population but could effectively kill them if they were to eat it is terribly frightening. But, more than that, there are many families with food allergies who seek help from doctors and are not offered the right advice, the right management or the right treatment. I would like to congratulate the allergy community for the work they have done over the last 10 to 20 years to increase awareness about this particular group of conditions and to bring light to this area that has so needed exposure to information.As a paediatric allergist, the most common question that I was asked is: is food allergy on the rise? Also: if it is on the rise, why is it on the rise? People just cannot understand how something as innocuous as a peanut can literally kill somebody. I spent a lot of my medical research time trying to understand why food allergy was on the rise. Im pleased to say that the food allergy community, both here in Australia and overseas, has delivered information for a number of reasons why we think food allergy is on the rise. We are at the point where were able to make some public health recommendations to help turn back the tide of food allergy. This is a very exciting time in medical research and, indeed, for healthcare practitioners because they have an ability to make a real difference. I often used to say to people, Cancer, infectious diseases, Alzheimers—you name it: these medical conditions have been around for as long as mankind, but food allergy in particular and allergy diseases in general have only occurred more recently. This is a concern of the modern era. This is a particularly interesting era for medical researchers to try and understand why something like this is occurring. The possibility that, as this has occurred only in the last number of decades, we could potentially completely eliminate it is incredibly tantalising.I really recommend this report because it focuses on recommendations on how to move this area forward for the benefit of families with food allergy and other allergy and for children and adults who are suffering with allergic disease. It is amazing that one-third of people in Australia will develop allergies over their lifetime. So many people have problems with hay fever, asthma, food allergy, eczema and anaphylaxis, and unfortunately Australia has the highest rate of food allergy ever reported. Unfortunately, Australia is the food allergy capital of the world. Australia is a country; its not a capital, but you get my point; we do have incredibly high rates. In fact, 10 per cent of children aged 12 months appear to have food allergy in Melbourne, which has the highest food allergy prevalence in Australia. Over four million people are living with allergies, and this number continues to rise. Of course, the most common food allergy consequence that is most frightening for everyone is anaphylaxis. As someone who themselves has a peanut allergy, I know how frightening it can be to have the most life-threatening condition, anaphylaxis. All that we can do to help save lives and protect lives through prevention of anaphylaxis is a very important outcome indeed.Last August, in 2019, the Minister for Health, Greg Hunt, referred the inquiry into allergies and anaphylaxis to the Standing Committee on Health, Aged Care and Sport. The inquiry looked into the prevalence, management and treatment of allergies. It was a very thorough inquiry. It received 257 submissions from members of the public, doctors, parents and organisations. I would like to congratulate all of those submitters for their dedicated work. These people took time out of their professional days to either provide a submission to the inquiry or present in person. Id particularly like to thank Maria Said from Allergy and Anaphylaxis Australia; Jill Smith and Preeti Joshi from the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy; Kirsten Perrett and Jennifer Copland from the Centre for Food and Allergy Research; and Richard Loh and Maria Said from the National Allergy Strategy. Now, Richard has recently retired from the National Allergy Strategy, but it is very important that we acknowledge the important work he has done advocating for a national approach to allergies.When I travelled internationally as a medical researcher, there was absolutely no doubt that we had some of the highest rates of allergic disease in the world; but, we equally had the best health care with regard to clinical guidelines and the allergy profession working together to protect allergy patients. More importantly, we have a very dedicated multicentre group of people who were interested in trying to work out how to deal with allergies better, and Richard Loh and Maria Said should be congratulated for the work they did in coming up with this National Allergy Strategy. Some ideas that have come forward as recommendations by this committee have been informed by that information.There were a number of recommendations made after seven hearings. The first was a recommendation that there be a national centre for allergies and anaphylaxis in Australia to continue the work that has already been done and to explain why Australia has the highest rate of allergy in the world.Recommendation 2 was additional funding into food allergies and anaphylaxis research, in particular funding for clinical research into oral immunotherapy trials. We know that a number of families—in fact, hundreds of families—are travelling to the United States and receiving care for food allergy because they cannot get that care here in Australia, and that care is oral immunotherapy. So people who have peanut allergy or egg allergy or other food allergies are living with these allergies and living with the risk of having anaphylactic events in uncontrolled situations. Some of these families have spent upwards of $35,000 to travel to the US for a cure for their food allergy. These clinical trials at this point in time are still in the research domain here and overseas, so our recommendation is that Australia leads the way by starting oral immunotherapy trials for food allergy here so that we can provide cutting-edge research and clinical trials to families who have food allergy.The inquiry report, Walking the allergy tightrope, has also recommended we ensure that the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy receive ongoing long-term funding to continue its partnership work with the Department of Health and the National Allergy Strategy to develop minimal standards of allergy training for health professionals, and to continue the good work that these collaborative organisations and institutions have already commenced.Recommendation 6 recommends that telehealth funding support for doctors and allied health workers is provided so that we can have professional services that give support to allergy patients in rural, regional, and remote Australia. I know, as a paediatric allergist, I had people travelling from all over Victoria and, indeed, from all over Australia—and even from the Asia-Pacific!—to have specialist care for food allergy provided at the centre that I used to work at, the Royal Childrens Hospital in Melbourne and the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute.Recommendation 12 recommended that the Therapeutic Goods Administration provide some competitive alternatives for autoinjectors. It was made very clear that there have been issues with the supply chain for autoinjectors. Fortunately, that does not appear to have happened during the recent COVID pandemic, but it has happened previously when there have been supply line issues. It was thought it was important that patients always have access to adrenalin autoinjectors to ensure that they remain safe.Recommendations 14, 15, 16 and 17 provide that we ensure theres vocational education about food allergies in food service. Now, we do know that schools around Australia have made great headway in legislating to ensure that children in schools are kept safe. In fact, state legislation in Victoria has ensured that Victoria does not take a back seat to safety compared to anywhere in the world, being one of the first states to legislate for food allergy. But we would like to see a more standardised approach for all states to have education in schools, and wed also like to see consistency in vocational education about food allergies in food service. Wed also like to see consistent food processing, including the use of the vital tick. Now, it is very important that the allergen—Ive been told I have 10 minutes, not five minutes.The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Youve spoken for 10 minutes.","Health, Aged Care and Sport Committee","COMMITTEES","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr ALLEN (Higgins) ","(16:31):"

358,0,0,0,1,2,"Zappia, Tony, MP","HWB","Makin","ALP","N/A",4689," I say to the member for Higgins that going over time was not a problem for this side of the House, because it is indeed a very important issue and 10 minutes doesnt do the issue justice. Member for Higgins, well done for the contribution you made within that limited time.I will begin by thanking both the secretariat and my committee colleagues, including the member for North Sydney, whos in the chamber and who chaired the committees work, for their work in this inquiry. I agree with others who have made it absolutely clear: this was a very significant inquiry, not just because of the work of the committee but also because of the issue at hand. I particularly thank the many people who made submissions, both written and in person, to the committee, especially those people with allergies who fronted up before the committee and told their personal stories and their lived experiences. For me, it was a real eye-opener. Its not that I havent had some experience with allergies, but it was a real eye-opener to hear about some of the struggles, the social limitations, the financial cost, the stresses and the severe discomfort that many people live with each and every day.As others have said, some four million Australians around the country live with an allergy. Ten per cent of children and two per cent of adults live with allergies. Those figures themselves are quite startling, and when you put them into perspective you start to understand that you cant go very far without running into someone who has an allergy problem of one kind or another.For those whose allergies can result in life-threatening anaphylaxis, life, as we were told in the report, must be very much like walking a tightrope or walking through a minefield, particularly as so many of the risks are often beyond the persons control and impossible to detect. Ill use the case of the pesto and peanut issue of earlier this year that was brought to the committees attention. Again, there were undeclared peanuts in a product—pesto that contained cashews—that was imported from overseas. No-one was to know. Families looked at the label, and, before you knew it, some people had suffered severe reactions to it. That highlights the risks Im referring to.Between 1997 and 2013, there were 324 recorded deaths from anaphylaxis in Australia, and, as the report says—and I agree with it—I suspect those rates were underestimated. Quite often, while a death might not have been directly linked to the allergy, it was the allergy that triggered the chain reaction that ultimately caused the death. So, I suspect it was much worse than that.Australia has one of the highest allergy rates in the world, and that in itself is an interesting phenomenon that I would like to think we would put a lot more research into. Having said that, I accept that Australia is also a world leader in allergy research—but we could do a lot more, and we should. As a country, were in a position to do more, if the will is there.I note with concern and interest that, in the past 10 years, hospital admissions for food allergies increased fourfold. Again, that begs the question: why? I dont know why. We can all speculate, and I think the committee tried to come to some conclusions about it, but its of real concern that it is happening. Its also of real concern—and I can talk about this from experience because it happened in my family—that 10 per cent of infants up to 12 months have an allergic reaction to a food. For a mum to see a little baby suddenly turn red and stop breathing because of an allergic reaction would be a nightmare. I have to say it would be one of the most frightening experiences I can imagine.I believe we should be focusing on four areas: research; medical education, which the previous speaker spoke about a moment ago—I think it is critical for our GPs and others to be better trained with respect to treatment and diagnosis; public education, so that the broader community, right across the board, understands the risks associated with allergic reactions; and educating the food industry, whether it be food processors or fast-food retailers, both of whom have a critical role to play here. Many have done a terrific job, but it hasnt been enough. Thats where most of the risk arises.Ill conclude with this observation. It really comes down to this, and I have to say that its an issue that often frustrates me with respect to the work of this committee and others, but particularly this committee, on other matters as well. We spend billions of dollars in this country each year on military equipment and defence projects. When theres a blow-out, not of thousands, not of millions, but of billions, we just accept it: Thats okay. We can find the money for that. Its not a problem. We just spent billions of dollars as part of a stimulus package. Again, there was no criticism. The fact is that there was a need, and we found the money, and were spending it in a way that we would like to think helps the broader community out there. Yet we cant seem to find modest amounts of money that would truly change the lives of people who are suffering each and every day in this country, and I think that that mindset needs to change. The report goes to some of these issues.Recommendations 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 all go to the issue of trying to provide a little more comfort to those people who are suffering from allergies in one way or another, whether that is through giving them access to medications which for some bureaucratic reason they cannot access right now but which we know will help them—they should be able to access that medication—or through disability support payments, because, in some cases, where an allergy results in a severe disability for a person they should be entitled to be treated like everyone else who has a disability. Again, I accept that that comes down to a medical diagnosis, but where it is the case—and we had examples of this presented to us—they should be given that type of support. It would make a world of difference if there were carers payments made available to people who are caring for people who could not survive without a carer. I dont believe this country cannot afford to provide support for these things. I think that, when you sum up the total cost of all the things that we would like to see, it would pale into insignificance in terms of the money we spend in other areas. Yet, I doubt the difference made to the lives of people in those other areas would be as important or make as much difference as the expenditure on this issue would.The people who appeared before the committee or made submissions to the inquiry are, through the voice of the committee, pinning their hopes on this parliament giving them the support that they are literally begging for in some cases. For those reasons, I hope that the minister will embrace the recommendations in this report, because all the recommendations were carefully thought through.Debate adjourned.","Health, Aged Care and Sport Committee","COMMITTEES","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ZAPPIA (Makin) ","(16:43):"
359,0,0,0,1,2,"Bell, Angie, MP",282981,"Moncrieff","LNP","N/A",4691," It gives me great pleasure today to stand here in the Federation Chamber and talk about The next gen future: Inquiry into the deployment, adoption and application of 5G in Australia report. As a government member of the Standing Committee on Communications and the Arts, it gives me great pleasure to be here. Australia was among the first to get our hands on the next generation of mobile technology, with Telstra allowing public use of its 5G enabled wi-fi hotspots in my electorate of Moncrieff on the central Gold Coast. As a member in the pilot region for the rollout of 5G, I was pleased when, during the public hearings, the committee visited the Telstra 5G centre at Southport to witness and experience firsthand the benefits of 5G.The major attribute of 5G is its latency capability. This means that there is no lag time between receiving the signal and the response from the technology its being applied to. For example, I was able in that forum to show off my electorate to my colleagues by putting them in a mask that showed the iconic Kurrawa Surf Club at its best, complete with the breathtakingly beautiful Gold Coast coastline, the surf and the coffee shop—which is now open for business, can I just add. It was in 360 degrees and in full 3D. Kurrawa is one of the nine surf clubs in my electorate, and I would like to give a shout-out to them and thank them for the work that they do in the community. Also, Surfers Paradise surf club has undergone a renovation, and Trevor Hendy tells me that there are many programs that that club undertakes in the community. I digress, but I never miss an opportunity to sneak in a few comments about my community.The committee experienced this 5G virtual reality tour. I talked about the first mask that was put on. We then put on another mask—and I see some of the committee members here today—and were instantly transported to an elevator. We knew that our feet were firmly on concrete, but we were instantly transported up to the 21st floor of a high-rise in Southport, where I could look over Southport, in the CBD of my electorate, and see the birds flying past and the cabs on the ground. There was actually a beam that came out of the lift that we were dared to walk on. This mask made it so real through 5G technology that the member for Chifley, the member for Lyne and I were a little bit frightened to actually walk out on the beam, because we felt that we were going to fall off the 21st floor and fall down to the bottom. There were a number of members who decided not to walk out on that beam; however, I was not one of those members of the committee—I did step out. I stepped off to the left of the beam, and I was instantly transported to the ground floor. I opened my eyes and there I was back on the ground floor. It was very exciting, and it certainly opened my eyes—and my bravery—on that day to what 5G can deliver. It was a great day.At the hearings on the Gold Coast we heard from many of my constituents on the Gold Coast, but we also heard from constituents in Adelaide, Melbourne, and Sydney. We also heard from Vodafone UK, who conducted the UKs very first live holographic call using 5G technology. The low latency and high speeds of 5G actually made it possible to produce a 3D holograph of someone who was more than 330 kilometres away. This technology could transform very many areas. It could transform the way that families stay in touch or the remote working experience. These things that I am talking about might seem like a novelty, but this technology could be applied to areas like education, health, sport, industry and many other areas. As a member of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, I was very excited to think about how this technology could be applied to rural and remote education and benefit, particularly, Indigenous communities around our great country. Thats what really excites me.The other thing that really excites me is jobs and how 5G could transform our economy into jobs. It not only has the capability to revolutionise those remote education outcomes but also has the ability to transform health, small business, industry, manufacturing, road safety, sport and the environment. But, most importantly, as I said, it has a role to play when it comes to creating Australian jobs, and those jobs of the future that we hear people talking about. And what are those jobs of the future? Well, 5G will create those jobs of the future through the technology, which is very, very exciting. Its going to revolutionise the way we do things in Australia. Indeed, we have an opportunity to be a world leader, to be a centre of 5G equipment component manufacturing. Weve heard a lot about Australian manufacturers having a bit of a rebirth, and 5G is a great opportunity for our great country to go into the manufacturing of componentry for 5G technology. So there are definitely opportunities for start-ups to develop their ideas and to connect our nation through 5G.Several organisations told the committee that 5G is essential if were to be a global competitor in food and wine production, entertainment, automated vehicles and IT. You might ask how in food and wine production. It is all to do with the sensors and how 5G can pick up how much moisture is in the room and those sorts of things. It can automatically change the humidity in an environment, through its innovation and technology. Thats very, very exciting.5G builds on current 4G technology, which of course was built on 3G and 2G. As the title of the report says, its the next gen future. But it does several things differently, from the radio waves to the equipment, handsets, infrastructure, and application. It will use multiple spectrum bands of radio waves, including bands in a higher frequency to those used for older generations of mobile phone technology. The different way of using spectrum bands means that new equipment and infrastructure are needed to transmit information using these radio waves.Unfortunately, a vast amount of misinformation about the safety and impacts of 5G is out there in the community. The committee received a large amount of information from inquiry participants who were concerned over the deployment of 5G and asserted that 5G would have a detrimental impact on human health. I do, as did the chair and the committee, acknowledge their concerns and thank them for their contributions to the hearings and for their submissions. But I would like to make one thing very clear, and that is that the committee heard from several Australian government agencies and officials that 5G is in fact safe for humans. Due to the technological qualities of 5G, beam forming and network slicing and the multiple output technology involved in 5G, the amount of energy that is received is lower than 4G, which is lower than 3G, and it is safe. You get more exposure from a baby monitor or a microwave than you would from 5G technology. These concerns in the community have been influenced by misinformation about the technology. The technology is safe. I urge the public to be cautious of claims from anti-5G campaigns. These campaigns are generating unfounded fear and concern within the community.The committee made 14 recommendations. I wont go through all of them, but they include, importantly, the speedy allocation of spectrum needed for 5G, which will improve market competition.A division having been called in the House of Representatives —Sitting suspended from 17 : 00 to 17 : 09","Communications and the Arts Committee","COMMITTEES","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms BELL (Moncrieff) ","(16:51):"

So there are the jobs, jobs, jobs that I was speaking about earlier. 5G technology enables enhanced mobile broadband features like digital video streaming and browsing the internet and pages super quickly. But, in summary, there are huge productivity gains across the whole of the Australian economy that can be realised. 5G could have a very significant role in the reinvention of Australias next generation post-COVID economy, in terms of innovation applied to business models in order to improve our domestic and international competitiveness and the future of our great, great country.","Communications and the Arts Committee","COMMITTEES","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[12]","N/A","N/A"
361,0,0,0,1,2,"Gorman, Patrick, MP",74519,"Perth","ALP","N/A",4693," Id like to start by thanking the secretariat of the Standing Committee on Communications and the Arts for their work on this report, The next gen future: Inquiry into the deployment, adoption and application of 5G in Australia, and thanking the chair and the deputy chair of the committee for their work. It was a good, collaborative exercise where we ventured to some interesting places. I didnt make it to the Gold Coast—a lovely place, and I was very sad to miss it—but I did make it to the Ericsson offices in Melbourne where, again, very quickly, the goggles were out and we all put on our favourite hi-tech fashion accessory. I would also like to thank the 537 people who submitted to this inquiry. Its fair to say that this topic of 5G technology raises very strong passions and the possibilities of this technology also really excites people. We held six public hearings and addressed time and time again the concerns that some people have about the health impacts of this technology. When it comes to health related issues, the science is incredibly clear. As we have just been through and continue to deal with the coronavirus pandemic and we have accepted the advice of science and health experts, we must maintain that discipline and accept the advice of science and health experts when it comes to the rollout of technology. So Im very comfortable in saying that 5G technology is safe for our communities and for our country.But that is not to say that we cant do more in terms of improving the way we communicate this, because, when people have anxieties about technologies being rolled out, those anxieties are real. I think this committee process was a good way to allow people to raise their concerns, but Id also say to anyone who has lingering questions—because of some crazy Facebook meme they have seen—to read the first couple of chapters of this report. It condenses the science and the advice of the Australian government experts and scientific experts very well in saying how this technology is safe and how it can be rolled out safely across our country.It is important that we have good mobile telecommunications services across this country. There are some 34 million mobile devices connected to mobile networks in Australia today, and that number is only going to increase. That is 1. 4 devices per person. And, as I look around this room, I notice that most people have multiple devices connected currently to probably 4G networks or wi-fi. But hopefully soon, as we address the challenges in this building of ageing infrastructure—which this report touches on—we will also have 5G rolled out in this building. Some 80 per cent of that mobile traffic occurs indoors, which, for this technology using smaller shorter waves, is a particular challenge. It requires more hardware but smaller hardware to be rolled out across our communities, and I have a great concern that that rollout may be patchy and may lead to a new digital divide. Some of the recommendations in this report address how you can ensure that you dont have such a digital divide in the future. We have seen the challenges of rolling out large-scale infrastructure projects in Australia. Indeed, I note that one day soon the NBN is due for practical completion. The reality is that the rollout of 5G technology will need to be much quicker than we have seen with the rollout of other such technologies.I will address some of the specifics in the report. The first recommendation is about how we actually improve the process through which we auction spectrum. Those auctions are primarily done in the interests of the government, in terms of creating revenue, but one of the recommendations the committee has made is that it should also be about improving market competition for the benefit of consumers, because ultimately they are the users of that spectrum—both business consumers and individual consumers across our country. This goes to the member for Moncrieffs point about making sure this technology best delivers on expanding the range of job opportunities for people—the types of jobs that are available anywhere in Australia.The second recommendation is something that I think is very worth the government taking fast action on, which is how to manage redundant infrastructure in Australia. Whenever you roll out new infrastructure, it obviously also means that there are pieces of infrastructure that become redundant. If you think about the infrastructure that people have campaigned against at times in their communities—people have the right to do that; Ive never signed such a petition, but people have the right to campaign against such things—we will get to a point where people wont necessarily know whether the old mobile communications infrastructure in their communities is, in fact, still operating. Sometimes its cheaper for telecommunications companies not to remove the infrastructure and just leave it there. Therefore, weve recommended there should be action taken to make sure that there are proper processes for managing redundant and/or ageing telecommunications equipment. Similarly, for new equipment, we should do more with co-location. We talk about co-location in a lot of other areas. Theres no reason we cant do more when it comes to co-location of 5G infrastructure and infrastructure sharing.One of the things that excites me most—and Im sure it excites you, Deputy Speaker Rick Wilson—is the idea that the committee heard about from WA farmers: a large-scale trial within a farming region. I note that one of the most innovative farming regions in Australia is in your electorate, Deputy Speaker. Indeed, the WA farmers suggested that Esperance would be a good location for such a trial. Im pleased that the committee has noted that recommendation. The other place that was suggested by WA farmers was Margaret River. The member speaking earlier said there are applications of this technology in the production of high-quality, high-value exportable products, such as wine. Indeed, if you were to roll out this technology in the Margaret River as an early-stage trial, coordinating with government and carriers, that could be a very good thing.The other challenge we have, and weve seen this most recently with challenges in our supply chain for personal protective equipment, is that we are not immune from supply chain shocks when it comes to high-tech infrastructure in this country. Indeed, practically nothing we use to build these networks is made here in Australia. Recommendation 8 is for the government to investigate ways to look at encouraging manufacturers of some parts of this infrastructure here in Australia. That would be very welcomed. To roll out the technology wherever it is produced, we also need to make sure we invest in training. One of the committees recommendations is that we should ensure that graduates are industry-ready and make sure that we talk to TAFE, universities and, indeed, to our high schools to make sure that there is enough training and enough apprenticeships to be able to roll this out. Weve seen in the past that rolling out large-scale government infrastructure programs can be a challenge if there are not appropriately trained people. We know that this technology will have huge economic benefits for our country and, therefore, we should make sure that we line up with TAFE, vocational education and training institutions and the private sector to make sure we have the skills necessary.We spoke to a range of local governments. There were some very interesting comments from them in terms of how they might deploy this. Since we did this inquiry, Ive seen a smart bin. There is one in my electorate. There is a smart bin in Elizabeth Quay, in the electorate of Perth. I would never have noticed the smart bin if I had not done this inquiry. Local councils talked to us about smart bins and other things. However, we noted that theres a gap in knowledge in many levels of our community services and, in particular, in local government, so further education and increasing awareness of the benefits of 5G technology within local government would be of benefit.The final point Ill make is that we need to make sure that the information that is provided by government departments on this technology is received by those who need to receive it and that they communicate through appropriate channels. That might be more through social media than through traditional media. I applaud the governments further investment in such communication efforts, but weve got to make sure were constantly monitoring and evaluating that communication effort, because it is clear there is misinformation out there and, if not addressed through an effective government communication campaign, we will have failed to fully realise the benefits of this technology.","Communications and the Arts Committee","COMMITTEES","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr GORMAN (Perth) ","(17:10):"

Ensuring that Australia has world-leading telecommunications infrastructure is one of the Morrison governments top economic priorities, because the forthcoming rollout of the 5G network is going to be very important to underpin our prosperity and economic opportunities going forward. I am very pleased to be a member of the Standing Committee on Communications and the Arts, which recently handed down the report on the inquiry into 5G, The Next Gen Future. It is very timely for us to look at this particular issue. The importance of telecommunications infrastructure cannot be stressed enough. In fact, the implementation of the NBN, which is on track to be completed this month, in 2020, has already seen a huge contribution to our GDP. It has created up to 5,400 new businesses and supported 2,900 new jobs. These figures are only climbing.Im also delighted to be a government member of the Joint Standing Committee on the NBN. It has been a very interesting time for me, sitting on both of these interrelated committees. Australians need fast and reliable internet now more than ever as they continue to work at home and learn online. I think this is particularly important. I was recently hosting a Zoom conference with members of my constituency, and the guest speaker was none other than Professor Ian Harper, who is a world-renowned economist. He was asked what he thought the future held with regards to what we would learn post COVID. One of the things he said is we would learn to work more from home. I did make the comment that perhaps men would learn to work more from home, since I think there are many women who have been working in a flexible environment using the internet over the last 20 years. Women have been early uptake users of communications and using these sorts of technologies from home so that they can have a flexible work-life balance and manage the many commitments that they do have.My constituents have told me how they have taught their parents and grandparents to use FaceTime. I myself made a little video for my Facebook so that we could get more constituents using FaceTime and getting online so they can communicate with their families while in isolation. We have seen businesses using online learning and online communication. In my office we have been using Skype and Zoom to communicate more broadly with my electorate. So its been a very interesting time during COVID, but it does really bring to the fore the fact that the internet is the future.The government has achieved so much in the past six years with regards to telecommunications, and the introduction of 5G continues to build on this important trend. In order to maintain Australias current leading position in the global system for mobile communications connectivity index score and to facilitate future economic prosperity, Australia is welcoming the 5G network rollout. There are many benefits of this. As I mentioned, the report that has been just been handed down is called The next gen future: Inquiry into the deployment, adoption and application of 5G in Australia, and it really has affirmed to me personally, and also to the committee, the benefits of 5G. I welcome the comments made by my good friend the member for Moncrieff earlier in this debate, where she explained how she saw the wonders of the internet going forward, the internet of things. I have to say Im quite jealous of that visit; I was home in Higgins and unable to participate in the visit. But it was very clear that the new technologies that are coming at us at speed are not just the domain of sci-fi; theyre now here with us and theyre going to change the way that we do business, the way we connect with families, the way we connect with the globe at lightning speed. Id like to acknowledge the member for Lyne, the chair of the committee, and the work he did in helping to hand down the report, and all the other committee members who were very diligent in their assessment of the inquiry and the submissions that were made to this inquiry.Australia, along with the rest of the world, is really on the brink of experiencing what we dub now the fourth industrial revolution, or the digital revolution. I often like to say that the paint is not yet dry on the digital revolution. In fact, I believe that we have gone through a massive social revolution as a result of us now being able to work and play in a very different way. Theres been a sixfold increase of data downloaded onto mobile handsets in the four years leading up to 2018, which is evidence of the immense changes that we are going through as we experience the internet of things going forward. Its very important that Australia is alive to the opportunities that this provides. These circumstances really do necessitate an upgrade from our current 4G infrastructure to the proposed 5G.5G technology promises great capacity and faster data speeds and significantly lower signal latency and delay, and it will support a larger number of devices in a given area. This will be absolutely critical for digitally reliant industries to be productive and competitive in a global market. The committee has heard that the 5G rollout will allow solutions to some of our most compelling challenges at the global and national level. It has predicted that 5G technology will also be hugely beneficial to those in regional and remote Australia. I know myself, as a medical practitioner, with the use of telehealth to prevent patients from having to travel for many hours to get to my clinic, I could actually do a lot of my care across the internet line through telehealth. We know that those strong connections will be incredibly important.So the committee made a number of recommendations. In fact, it made 14 wide-ranging and productive recommendations, a handful of which Ill consider today. Importantly, it noted that we need to be aware of the issues of manufacturing, and that has been an issue that has been very much front of mind for the Morrison government in our post-COVID plan for the future. We understand that we need to be alive to the opportunities for manufacturing, and manufacturing of 5G infrastructure in Australia in particular. This includes advanced manufacturing for components and equipment used for the rollout of the 5G networks. This could be supported through the establishment of a 5G R&D fund to fast-track development. It could also involve manufacturing partnerships with countries like Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States. I note here the chair for the Committee on Treaties, and Im sure he will have an important role to play in ensuring we have a strong relationship with regards to advanced manufacturing in our treaties relationship with other countries. This will also enable our 5G rollout not just to have domestic benefits but to also have international benefits. So in this way, the 5G network could help support a more diversified economy, which we know will be incredibly important in our post-COVID environment.The Next gen report also found that we should be reviewing ICT curricula for roles in 5G related industries. TAFE, accredited training providers and tertiary institutions should be modified also to ensure graduates are industry ready. Something we have noticed in particular moving forward is that we need our students and our youth to be ready for the future, and we need them to be skilled and trained for the new jobs that are coming online at speed. In particular, the committee recommends that the government lift apprenticeships in the ICT sector. These are jobs for the future which the rollout of the 5G network will support both directly and indirectly.The committee also noted that there were concerns about network and data security of 5G equipment and that there are cyberthreats that are sophisticated and constantly evolving. Australia has a strong track record of data protection, but we must continue to strive for this to be robust.We also noted that there were concerns from the community about the perceived health threats from 5G, and Id like to reassure the community, after having reviewed all of the submissions, that the committee felt very strongly that the threats that people perceived were a problem are not indeed a problem. That is because the intended frequency of the 5G network will stay well below any harmful radiation—in fact, it is lower than visible light. It appears that most of the confusion that has resulted is from misinformation and a lack of awareness about the 5G infrastructure. The committee does recommend that a public health information campaign would be a very important component of ensuring that 5G is well recognised by the community and can be safely rolled out. There needs to be education and awareness to ensure that, indeed, the community members that are confused or misinformed have their fears dispelled by a careful campaign to understand the information that it is actually a safe thing to do.In conclusion, Id like to say that the technological progress for Australia is really on an irreversible trajectory and Australia cannot be left behind. We need to be ready for the digital revolution that is upon us and we need to ensure that we can seize new ideas and innovations. Importantly, it will help form the bedrock of Australias economic prosperity.Debate adjourned.","Communications and the Arts Committee","COMMITTEES","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr ALLEN (Higgins) ","(17:20):"
363,0,0,0,1,2,"Mitchell, Rob, MP","M3E","McEwen","ALP","N/A",4698," Today we can say, Mark your calendars, because in less than three months the government are packing up shop on the Australian people. As far as the government are concerned now, its every man, woman and child for themselves, as they pull back from helping Australians through this pandemic. Despite skyrocketing unemployment and underemployment rates, despite no clear path to recovery, the government want to pull the rug out from under struggling families—the end of the JobKeeper program; the end of the coronavirus supplement, with the jobseeker payment cut in half; the end to wage subsidies for apprentices; the end to the small and medium enterprises loan guarantee, where the government back 50 per cent of new loans issued by lenders; the end to the ban on rental evictions; the end of free child care, which has been plagued by issues and falsehoods from the government but which many families have relied on to stay afloat; and the end to the banks mortgage freeze. Many people will see their lives turned upside down and tossed about when theyre already on the brink.As we know, this government are all about marketing. Too many Australians will be left behind by the Morrison government. Theres a new announcement every day, but they never, ever deliver. They never deliver, and its always the Australian people who suffer the consequences. People want to see the economy and businesses carefully reopen as soon as its responsible to do so, based on medical advice. Some parts of the economy will recover faster than others, but not all jobs in all industries will just snap back to normal like Prime Minister Morrison assumes.We understand that the Prime Minister has acted too narrowly and too slowly. Australians cant afford the government to withdraw support too quickly. Firstly, they promised immediate support for bushfire victims. Months later, we know that only around four per cent of them have received any help. They gave us robodebt, the JobKeeper program, the Ruby Princess and budget stuff-ups, and turned a blind eye to criminals stealing peoples superannuation.Australians have worked together to combat the virus, but more work must be done by the government to ensure that our hardest-hit Australians are not left out and left behind in the recovery. Take the governments announcement on child care, which was to provide six months of free child care. That was the headline. It made for a great headline when it was announced back in April, but for families struggling to make ends meet, for those working in essential jobs or working from home, it couldve been welcome respite. But, instead, as weve unfortunately come to expect from this government, when we got beyond the slogans, families and childcare providers were sold a pup.Prime Minister Morrison reneged on a promise that the JobKeeper program would continue until the end of September by announcing that it would be ripped away from childcare educators in July. With more than 10,000 children under four in McEwen alone, tens of thousands of parents are relying on childcare providers so that they can get back to work. Regardless of what you do for a living, whether you are a nurse, a supermarket worker, an office worker or a teacher, if you have young kids, most of us will need help at some time or another with child care. Its these families whose tax dollars are fronting the Prime Ministers stimulus package. Instead of using those taxpayer dollars to invest in families wellbeing, supporting those who are trying to return to work and to continue to work, or supporting women trying to raise their own families or run childcare services, the Prime Ministers message is clear: as far as hes concerned, its not his problem. Despite his initial claims that he consulted with the industry, we later learned that this was simply untrue. There was no consultation with family day care providers. Charity organisations were actually misled on what this meant.This is a mostly female workforce, with around 95 per cent of childcare workers being women. The governments mismanagement of this so-called free child care has been a monument to the Morrison governments attitude towards supporting women in the workforce. While we know that most childcare workers are women, we also know that its mothers who continue to take on the lions share when it comes to child care. We know that if families cant afford child care, mums are more likely to skip a shift or reduce their hours to make sure that the kids are looked after and that the family budget stays in the black. The damage of this policy will be felt for decades after the pandemic is over.As I said, the government assured us they would leave the program alone until September. While this left many childcare workers on severely reduced incomes, it at least gave them a timeline to work with, to plan and to survive. But, in a massive U-turn, 120,000 childcare workers have now been told that they will lose access to the JobKeeper payment in July—two full months before the government promised it would end. Three days after the Prime Minister guaranteed all Australian workers on the JobKeeper payment that payments would continue until September he kicked early educators out of the program.Lets be clear about the JobKeeper scheme: wage subsidies along with the principle of keeping workers connected to their employers in order for businesses to restart after times of crisis is a good idea. We know its a good idea, because Labor put forward the idea. Labor, the trade unions, the business community and leading economists were all calling on the government to introduce a wage subsidy scheme for months before Treasurer Frydenberg was dragged kicking and screaming to take any action whatsoever.We all know that good ideas are simply not enough when youre in government. Good ideas and good government require good governance and strong leadership. From day one, after the Morrison government belatedly and begrudgingly introduced the JobKeeper scheme, we have sadly seen mistake after mistake. Some of the mistakes, like the $60 billion budgeting blunder, occurred simply due to the governments careless implementation. It meant that rating agencies were misled, investors were misled, businesses were misled and Australian workers who found themselves out of work were misled. Its a budgeting bungle that is bigger than any in the history of this nation. I can guarantee one thing: we wont see them flogging that on black mugs anywhere!Sadly, for other people in Australia, these cuts have been much worse and much more sinister. What really worries me is that there are many examples where we now see the Morrison government making calculated and cruel decisions to deliberately dud workers who were promised, and took it in good faith, they would be looked after by the scheme during difficult times—people like the workers at dnata, who were sold an absolute pup. They actually applied. They were given the go-ahead to go and do it, and then the government reversed their decision late one Friday afternoon in whats becoming known as take out the trash Friday with this government.They have also deliberately left behind casuals, freelancers, temporary migrants, NDIS workers, local government employees, charity workers, teachers and university staff. They all contribute to building a nation and they were all deliberately failed by this government. Its hard to have any faith that this lot have the capacity to deliver a plan that will effectively transition the economy out of the pandemic, let alone that they will have the intention of looking after the most vulnerable and deserving along the way.The economy was not going well before coronavirus, drought and bushfires, and the Morrison government has no plan to turn it around. How this support is removed from the economy is as important as how it was introduced. You cant just turn it off like a tap. Recently the OECD has warned about the risk of removing assistance too early, and many sectors from across the economy are currently calling for jobseeker to be extended for six months. With a little over 12 weeks before all assistance packages are set to expire, the government has provided no certainty and no clarity to Australian workers. The support must be phased out in a responsible way that doesnt undermine Australias recovery or risk thousands of jobs. Millions of Australians who have lost their job because of the pandemic are anxious and going to be wondering how theyre going to make ends meet, while the Prime Minister sits back and says: No. We can just snap back. It all ends in September.One thing that weve talked about too is the need for infrastructure, and the government belatedly has come to the party talking about shovel-ready projects. Weve had two shovel-ready projects sitting on our books for a long time: the Wallan interchange on the Hume Highway, which is a federal government responsibility, and the Macedon Ranges sports precinct. Both of these projects are ready to go. The federal government is the only roadblock stopping these much-needed projects being delivered. The Macedon Ranges Shire Council is on board. The Victorian government is on board. In fact, even the Victorian Liberals came on board with this project for the Macedon Ranges sports precinct as an election promise.Twice the shire has applied to the federal government for funding, and twice theyve been misled and twice theyve been knocked back. Enough is enough is enough. Hundreds and hundreds of families each and every week cant get access to the sporting facilities they need because this government is too cruel and heartless to support people in regional areas. Weve seen the way that this government has made promises that theyve never delivered. We only have to look at the Calder Freeway. Fifty million dollars was promised by this government to deliver extra loans to the Calder Freeway, and not one cent has been spent. The Hume Highway, Australias traffic spine, needs extra lanes put in it because of the growth in the outer suburbs and the growth in regional areas. Again, it was a promise made by the government before the election, and theres been not a single peep afterwards.People rightly are finding that theyre more and more cynical with politics these days. And, sadly, when youve got a government thats all spin and no substance, runs out of headline and doesnt deliver on its promises, this is only going to get worse and worse. Its time the government stood up for Australians instead of standing on them.","Morrison Government: COVID-19","GRIEVANCE DEBATE","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[1]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ROB MITCHELL (McEwen—Second Deputy Speaker) ","(17:31):"
364,0,0,0,1,2,"McIntosh, Melissa, MP",281513,"Lindsay","LP","N/A",4701," I was really pleased to receive some information from my local university in Lindsay, Western Sydney University, around our local manufacturing industry today, which says that Western Sydney is the site of Australias largest industry concentration of manufacturing, generating in excess of $41.5 billion per annum. The manufacturing sector employs approximately 114,000—up to almost 115,000—people in Western Sydney alone, and across transport, warehousing and logistics supports an additional 71,000 jobs. These are pretty impressive numbers, but, in Western Sydney, as across Australia, we have a lot more to do when it comes to backing Australian manufacturing.I do speak a lot about manufacturing and advanced manufacturing in this place, and for very good reason. Recently I convened the Lindsay Jobs of the Future Forum, which is made up of representatives from primary schools and secondary schools in Lindsay; our local tertiary institutions, the university, TAFE; industry experts; local manufacturers; and business and science institutions. We come together and discuss how we can advocate for small business and influence policymaking.As part of this group, we established the Advancing Manufacturing Taskforce, which Im leading. Im really pleased to say that as part of this taskforce I have representatives from Western Sydney Institute, Kingswood TAFE, Sydney Science Park, Nepean Community College, a Schools Industry Partnership, Swinburne university, and of course Western Sydney University, in addition to local manufacturers, which is really important. The task force will investigate and promote local and national opportunities for advanced manufacturing in Western Sydney, advocate for manufacturing and backing our manufacturing industry and, as I said, attempt to influence better policymaking when it comes to supporting our manufacturers. Where there is an opportunity to collaborate or draw from existing task forces, we will seek to achieve this as a tangible outcome. Im looking forward to working closely with our task force and presenting our findings to the Morrison government.The challenge weve faced for many years is that we dont always see the benefits of supporting Australian industry and business by buying Australian-made where we can. Every time you purchase an Australian product, youre making sure that the revenue is kept in Australia, and that flows onto the millions of Australians who need jobs. It keeps Australia competitive and, most importantly, it backs our products, which are famous for being some of the best quality in the world.The Advancing Manufacturing Taskforce will work with our local businesses and industry leaders to make sure that we are encouraging more opportunity and growth in Western Sydney. The Western Sydney International (Nancy-Bird Walton) Airport, the aerotropolis and Sydney Science Park will see Western Sydney at the forefront of emerging industries and science, technology, engineering and so much more. We will be a centre of excellence for research and education, and thats why it is so important to start the discussion now, to get the work going now, on how we support Australian industry.Manufacturing in Australia has long faced difficult challenges. Our geographic location, a smaller population, scattered centres of population and transport difficulties have combined to limit the scope for manufacturing in Australia. In addition to higher labour costs and lower productivity, these have been critical factors affecting the competitiveness of manufacturing. But manufacturing has also survived many challenges over the past decade, including the global financial crisis, an extended period of unfavourably high exchange rates—with the Australian dollar trading at parity against the US dollar for about three years from 2010—the rapid rise of China as the worlds factory and Australias largest trading partner, the end of local automotive assembly operations in 2017, and the onset of digitalisation. Something else that local manufacturers often speak to me about as being a barrier to local success is the high cost of energy, which the Morrison government is currently working very hard on.While manufacturing has faced these challenges, its important to recognise how many Australians are showing their support for Australian manufacturing. Last week I met with the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology to talk about how we can support Australian-made products and Australian industry. In Western Sydney we have local businesses like Pandrol and business owners like Jeff Sinclair, who are so passionate about supporting manufacturing opportunities in Western Sydney. I met Jeff and his wife, Tracy, at their family business and we talked about the challenges facing Australian manufacturing and small and medium businesses. Jeff is the quintessential Australian who has worked hard all his life and put everything into his business. If we all knew that buying Australian products and supporting Australian-made meant keeping businesses like Jeffs afloat, I know we would always make this choice when we could.Jeff and I met with Pierre, Pat and the team at Pandrol in Western Sydney, where again we saw wonderful Australian-made products. Pandrol define the industry standard across rail fastening systems. Theyve created rail infrastructure in more than 100 countries, with products and services that extend to designing, developing and manufacturing equipment, and constructing and maintaining railways. Every day, millions of Australians use our rail networks, and a lot of that is because of the types of products that Australian companies like Pandrol have on the market.Pandrol, like many Australian manufacturers, work very closely with local contractors, and this means more local jobs. They support small engineering businesses—the one-man or one-woman shows like Jeff and Tracy have—as well as supporting many other local businesses across the community. That is part of the wonderful work that our local manufacturers do in our communities. I want to thank Jeff and the team at Pandrol for showing me around both their workplaces the other week.In February, across Australia, nearly a million people were employed in the manufacturing sector. It makes up 7.1 per cent of total employment in Australia. In New South Wales we have nearly 200,000 people who work in manufacturing. It has been steadily declining over the last 20 years, with employment in the sector falling, and its now experiencing some important rebalancing in its products, technology and supply chains in response to long-term local and global structural shifts. As I indicated earlier, some of the problems the industry has experienced include high energy costs and a high Australian dollar. Now the sector is experiencing some challenges, as we are across the whole of our economy, when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic. That is why it is so important now to be getting behind our Australian manufacturing industry.In the last decade, consumers have sought more Australian food and beverages, which account for 27 per cent of manufacturing employment. Building materials, furniture and household items have also contributed. I want to encourage everyone in my community of Lindsay to keep backing manufacturing. Youve said to me that this is what you want to do, that youre focusing more on quality over price. When it comes to advanced manufacturing, that is particularly where Australia has its competitive edge. If we invest in that focus on quality, and with Western Sydney airport coming on board very soon, we will have many opportunities for local people in our community to work closer to home. By investing in skills in advanced manufacturing we will be ensuring our kids are being trained in the jobs of the future, which is one of our greatest challenges at the moment in the advanced manufacturing industry. With all the energy and focus and collaboration that I know is going on in my community, Im very confident that advanced manufacturing will be strong going into the future.","Lindsay Electorate: Manufacturing","GRIEVANCE DEBATE","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs McINTOSH (Lindsay) ","(17:39):"
365,0,0,0,1,2,"Ryan, Joanne, MP",249224,"Lalor","ALP","N/A",4703," The electorate that I represent, the seat of Lalor, seems to be at the epicentre of any decision those opposite make. All too often the actions taken in Canberra by this government are detrimental to the residents who live in the electorate of Lalor. When it was the GP tax, we were in the top 10 of bulk-billing electorates that would have been hurt. When the Liberals announced their attempted income tax hike—remember the increase to the Medicare levy?—we were in the top 10 of those who would be most affected. When the government announced tax cuts that favoured people in higher income brackets, we were of course in the bottom 10 of electorates that would benefit from that change. It is clear that the electorate of Lalor is low on the Liberals priority list, and weve seen that most grievously in their questionable allocation of grants, most infamously the sports rorts grants—the Prime Ministers fund, administered by Senator McKenzie, where we saw an uneven and unfair allocation of grants to marginal seats and safe Liberal and National seats across the country.The population of the city I call home and represent has grown extraordinarily, by 42 per cent between 2013 and 2019. We are now a city of over 275,000 people in Melbournes outer west. In that time, cricket has grown by 137 per cent in participation rates; soccer has grown by 124 per cent; netball, my love and passion, by 69 per cent; while basketball grew by a whopping 356 per cent. You think these impressive numbers would mean something to a program that claims to be, and I quote:Supporting small to medium scale projects … to improve local community sport infrastructure which will support greater community participation in sport and physical activity and/or offer safer and more inclusive community sporting hubs.Wouldnt you have thought that the seat of Lalor wouldve been a high priority? But guess how much the sporting clubs in Lalor got? Zero. In those same years, womens football—footy, of course, being Australian Rules for my friends north of the Barassi Line—has grown by a whopping 600 per cent. In those same years, there was a massive growth in womens sporting teams and womens participation. But how many clubs or grounds got funding from the Prime Ministers grants to build female changerooms? Zero—zero for the electorate of Lalor.But its not just in the scandal-plagued sports rorts that Lalor has missed out; its across the board, with all this governments decisions. Our local council told me about their experience with congestion funds—that buzz word which Im sure tested well in the marketing groups but doesnt actually deliver much. The local council were contacted by the minister, spruiking this fund, but, when they sought clarification on the grants, they were knocked back and told its not up to them. Seriously? They wrote to the council announcing funding and then the minister told them not to bother because it was out of his hands. But the hollow-man-esque scenario of writing to council to grandstand when they knew nothing was available isnt the worst of it. How can the government wipe their hands of our city—25 kilometres from the CBD of Melbourne, home to the most Victorians who spend more than two hours a day commuting to and from work? How can it be ignored?Clearly, the congestion our community faces needs to be addressed. The state government are doing great things to reduce this congestion. They are removing three level crossings in the city and offering more transport options. But, while the state government gives and gives, the federal Liberals have forgotten about Melbournes west and Wyndham. The Prime Minister is happy to stand with maps of the Monash or the Eastern, but his knowledge of the West Gate is how to get to Geelong. Despite all the stats and the common sense about building congestion-busting infrastructure—and the marketing screams while donning a shiny new hard hat—in the eyes of our marketing PM, Lalor was not worthy. What did we get from this government in congestion funds? Zero. In fact, in Victoria, coalition seats and some marginal seats received 89 per cent of the $1.26 billion allocated across Victoria, leaving 11 per cent for the rest of us—and, again, nothing for Lalor, absolutely zero.I have been on my feet in this chamber so many times talking about parking at train stations and about Labors commitment at the last election to build the Wyndham west link, which would create two bridges on the edge of our city to move us in and out, to connect the two sides across the river, but the government claims that we didnt ask. In fact, we did. Labor proposed infrastructure projects at the last election and even our previous mayors have written to the minister about the infrastructure we need. We did ask, but those opposite chose to give us nothing. They just dont care about our communitys needs.The long list of rorts has grown in recent weeks, with The New Dailys shocking revelations of the rorts in the community development grants. It gets better and better! The CDG program is 11 times the size of the sports rorts and the pork-barrelling more blatant: 75 per cent of the funding went to Liberal seats; $10 million has been spent in Liberal seats and just over $4 million in Labor seats; and, of the 27 electorates that missed out on funding altogether, 22 were Labor seats—and it will be no surprise to anyone listening that Lalor was one of those seats. It is clear by the actions they take and the decisions they make that the Liberals dont care about Lalor. They have never made one election commitment to our community since I have been in this place. They treat the entire spectrum of government grants with contempt and dont deliver to the areas in need.The disdain has been exposed again by the JobKeeper program and the Prime Ministers snapback deadline that he refuses to move away from. The postcodes of 3029 and 3030 encompass almost every residential suburb. They also have the highest number of JobKeeper applications of any postcode in Victoria, behind the Melbourne CBD. While there are holes in the JobKeeper payments, its clear our local businesses are reliant on these payments. I fear that, if the JobKeeper ends, with the PMs snapback deadline, our Centrelink lines will grow and our local businesses will close.As of last week, the list of people warning against the cutting of JobKeeper payments were the OECD, the Reserve Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Australian Institute of Company Directors and many private forecasters. If JobKeeper ends in September, it will be devastating to our local economy. So I stand here and I say: Prime Minister, theres a place just between the leafy east and the towns beyond Greater Geelong; its called Melbournes west. Its time to find us, its time to fund us, and its time to give Melbournes west and Lalor a fair go.","Lalor Electorate","GRIEVANCE DEBATE","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[3]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms RYAN (Lalor—Opposition Whip) ","(17:51):"
366,0,0,0,1,2,"Martin, Fiona, MP",282982,"Reid","LP","N/A",4705," I would like to make some remarks regarding the Morrison governments plan to regain consumer confidence, create jobs and put our economy on a path to recovery. Were building momentum in our economy with a five-year plan that will shape Australias growth over the next three decades.This week, the Prime Minister outlined the details of the JobMaker program. Infrastructure development is a key part of that plan. The Australian government is cutting red tape under a bilateral government model to fast-track 15 major projects across the nation. They include the Melbourne to Brisbane Inland Rail, the Marinus Link and the Olympic Dam expansion in South Australia, supporting around 66,000 jobs. We have committed $1.5 billion to get these projects underway, and they will offer relief, particularly to our regional areas.In my wonderful electorate of Reid, I welcome the news that $1.5 million of scoping works have begun for the $100 million infrastructure upgrade to Homebush Bay Drive. This jointly funded federal and New South Wales government project will not only see the start of an important infrastructure upgrade but also create an estimated 210 local jobs. In addition to this, the Morrison government has delivered more than $450,000 to six different road black spots in Reid to improve dangerous roads in suburbs like Lidcombe, Burwood and Concord. The federal governments Roads to Recovery Program delivers $500 million annually to our local councils, and this will be a huge help to our local area. I will keep working closely with our six local councils as they receive further federal funding for community infrastructure and road projects that will help create jobs in our area.Many constituents have recently contacted me to express their renewed support for Australias growing manufacturing sector. As global supply chains were crippled by the coronavirus, Australians innovated and retooled in order to produce the essential items we needed, including personal protective equipment and hand sanitiser. The Australian chemistry industry, which is the third-largest industry in the country, has also expanded domestic manufacturing to keep up with the demand during shortages in our global supply chains. This is not a new issue. Many Australians care deeply about our domestic manufacturing sector, including those who live in my electorate of Reid. The coronavirus pandemic has shown us some gaps in our manufacturing capability and in our supply chains, particularly around medical supplies and equipment. As we move forward in our plan for recovery, our government are more conscious than ever of the need to support the growth of this sector.The Morrison government had been working with the manufacturing sector before the pandemic. Earlier this year we launched a new advertising campaign to promote Australian-made products, reminding Australian consumers of the value of buying home-grown and domestically made products. This ad campaign follows the governments $5 million investment earlier this year to expand the reach of the Australian-made logo. The merits of buying local, Australian-made products has been advocated for in federal parliament since Federation. When we buy Aussie made, we are supporting our farmers and our manufacturers as well as the supply chains that use the market and deliver their products.In my electorate of Reid, manufacturers have often said competing with overseas companies is the biggest barrier to domestic production, not being able to match their lower manufacturing cost. However, Australians have a renewed appetite for Aussie products. People want to support our local economy and will pay for quality products in order to do so. And we know that our quality products will also be well regarded on international markets too. Our governments investment in Australian-made products is more timely than ever as we look to ways to create jobs and strengthen our economy following the financial impacts of the pandemic. The Morrison governments Manufacturing Modernisation Fund is supporting around 200 projects around Australia with a federal investment of $48.3 million. We expect a further 2,600 jobs in the sector will come out of this initiative alone.Manufacturing today is so much more than production in the traditional factory setting. It includes research and design, it encompasses after-sale service, it has a broad reach through supply chains and it offers so many opportunities for innovation and job growth. Many well-known manufacturers are located right on the doorstep in Reid. In fact, our suburb of Silverwater is considered the heart of Sydneys manufacturing district. Id like to acknowledge several outstanding manufacturers in Reid who have received $20,000 through the Morrison governments business growth grants earlier this year—funding which will help expand their capabilities. The grant recipients included manufacturers like Decor Systems in Silverwater, and I had the pleasure of visiting Decor Systems last year; Memphasys, experts in biological separations, located in Homebush West; and Acme Case Co, which is Sydneys oldest packaging designer, and they have been operating since 1913. I would also like to congratulate Disc Brakes Australia, based in Silverwater, who received over $111,000 from the Morrison governments Automotive Innovation Lab Access Grants for the development of the world-first cool drive rotor. Its exciting to support innovation in Australias automotive product development, and even more exciting that its happening in my electorate of Reid.Manufacturing is the seventh-largest employing industry in Australia. More than that, it is the sector that invests in home-grown innovation. It is the sector that opens the door to opportunities for our country. Right now, our Aussie manufacturers hold the key to our economic recovery and growth. They will put momentum behind the governments plan to restore confidence in our economy. Strengthening our domestic manufacturing sector is by no means an attempt to nationalise our industries or pander to protectionism. When we support local production, we produce quality products that will be of value in international markets. It puts Australians squarely on the world stage.In order to support our economic growth, our government has turned its attention to supporting our small and medium-sized businesses through the unique pressures of the pandemic. The JobKeeper program has been a huge help in keeping businesses open and employers connected to employees throughout this very difficult period. An estimated 8,800 organisations in Reid have benefited from the JobKeeper payment. They are businesses like Watergrill Restaurant in Abbotsford and Sass Hair and Body in Concord. Both businesses were able to keep staff on through the COVID period, through JobKeeper. As restrictions have eased, their businesses have seen people coming back in through the doors.We have also announced the extension of the $150,000 instant asset write-off for six months until 31 December this year. By investing in assets, businesses can continue to expand and modernise. It is expected that these measures will support over 3.5 million businesses across Australia. Another business in Reid that has benefited from the support of the Morrison government is Proline Building Commercial in Mortlake. Theyre just one of many other businesses in our area receiving a cash flow boost through the Australian Taxation Office in order to retain employees.What is remarkable is the ingenuity and flexibility of many businesses in our area who adapted while under social distancing restrictions. Many restaurants pivoted to takeaway during this period and have elected to continue to offer these services because of their success. For example, Cucina Expresso in Concord were preparing home cooked meals for busy families which could be bought, taken home and heated up. Even though now they have reopened under the new social distancing guidelines, the meals have been so popular that they have remained on the menu.In recent weeks, I have had the opportunity to visit many businesses in Burwood, Strathfield and Concord, and I look forward to visiting many more businesses in Reid on my return. Many of the business owners I have spoken to are very, very grateful for the governments economic packages. We must also be realistic about the challenges that they will have in the months ahead. We continue to restore consumer confidence for our economy to recover. Our businesses are prepared to operate in COVID-safe ways to ensure that they plan and can meet the unique health and safety risks.","Manufacturing","GRIEVANCE DEBATE","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[4]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr MARTIN (Reid) ","(17:59):"
