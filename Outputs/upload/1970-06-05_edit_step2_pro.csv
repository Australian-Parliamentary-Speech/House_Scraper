Country supporters of rugby league are to be deprived of the opportunity to view on television the test between England and Australia. Whose fault is it that the game is not to be televised - the Australian Broadcasting Commissions or the rugby league executives? If it is the fault of the ABC will the Minister use his influence to have the match televised for the benefit of country supporters?","RUGBY LEAGUE","QUESTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The responsibility for selling the rights of the replay telecast of any football match rests with the organisation concerned. In this case it is the Australian rugby league organisation. As I understand the position, the rights have been sold to a commercial station for SI 5,000. As a result a commercial station will telecast the replay in Brisbane. The Australian Broadcasting Commission is negotiating with the commercial station for the purchase of the rights for Queensland regional stations. I understand also thaI there will be replays in Sydney. I can give no further information.

The Minister for Labour and National Service has been in touch wilh the ACTU on a number of occasions, trying to get ii to see reason and to refrain from persisting in the very stubborn and defiant attitude it has been taking. Unfortunately the real culprit in this matter is the Australian Labor Parly. I think that the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Minister for Agriculture deserve very severe condemnation for their whole attitude in this matter, in inciting the trade unions to defy law and order.

Does the Minister know that due to their dwindling number Commonwealth meat inspectors are compelled to work S to 9 hours a day without a meal break? Will the Minister tell me when the Pub ic Service Board proposes to give a decision on the claim it has had before it for more than 12 months for increased wages for Commonwealth meat inspectors? ls the Minister aware that a complete breakdown is feared in the industry because of these anomalies and other more repressive measures imposed on Commonwealth meat inspectors?","MEAT INSPECTORS","QUESTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/interjection/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is of interest to note that, during the course of the 2 or 3 months in which this Parliament has sat, the Opposition has found any number of matters of great urgency and public importance to bring before this House for debate. But as far as the lifting of the ban on the export of merinos is concerned, no, the Opposition has just been silent, almost as if its members have been frightened to express their own opinions. The facts of the matter are that every newspaper across this country, whether it had a point of view in the first place about the easing or the partial lifting of the embargo, now has a firm point of v ew regarding the attitude of the Labor Party in defying the Government.

If this is so 1 would be very glad to hear of it, and I would be very pleased if the Leader of the Opposition would go to the Australian Council of Trade Unions and tell it that his attitude has changed and that he is against the unions taking this kind of action. We made an announcement and then we delayed action for 9 or 10 months. This gave the industry an opportunity to review its earlier decision. No action was taken to review it. In fact the reply I received was that the industry stood by its earlier resolution that there should be a partial lifting of the ban, on certain conditions, for a period of 12 months. As a result of that decision overseas buyers came to the Sydney sheep sales earlier this year and about 47 rams were sold to a number of countries. Those countries have not been able to collect the sheep which they purchased.As a result of the actions of the Australian Labor Party relations with those countries are in a bad state. The Government stated that they could buy sheep in Australia. Having bought sheep they cannot take delivery of them. The possibility of retaliation of various kinds always exists. We were making excellent progress in our efforts to have Argentina become a member of the International Wool Secretariat. No doubt matters such as this were considered by the industry when it made the decision to lift the export ban, but today our relations with other countries have deteriorated. Mainland China bought 14 rams and still cannot take delivery of them. Does anybody think that mainland China appreciates the action of the Australian Labor Party in not allowing those rams to be delivered?The Australian wool industry has made a decision in this matter. Thirteen of the 16 national and State organisations supported the decision when it was initially taken. The Australian Wool Industry Council, which is the supreme body of the industry, voted in favour of lifting the ban for a period of 12 months, after which the decision could be reviewed. But the Labor Party continues to support the trade unions and to incite them not to allow the law to be enforced. I know that some people say that the Government should take firm action, but a government has to bear in mind the possible consequences of any action it might take.

It is estimated that the Wheat Board will make sales of stock feed wheat in the vicinity of those made last year - between 8 million and 9 million bushels.

I am unaware as to whether one of the airlines was willing to grant the claims at an earlier point of time and that the other was not. I just do not know the answer to that.The thing that is important in industrial relations is that when a claim is made both parties come together for the purpose of conciliating where possible. If conciliation efforts fail the parties should come together to arbitrate and when arbitration is made they should accept that arbitration. There is no reason whatever why there should be any industrial stoppages at all. The reason there are stoppages is the failure of parties to conciliate or more likely the failure of parties to accept arbitration when it is given.","AIRLINE HOSTESSES","QUESTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

There are a number of factors affecting the building industry both as regards dwelling construction and the non-residential sector. I am not aware of the position so much in Western Australia but over a large part of Australia at the moment the building industrty is seriously jeopardised and plagued by industrial troubles which are adding considerably to the permanent cost structure. Some of the most serious troubles, of course, are in New South Wales and Victoria where there has been a prolonged strike of builders labourers. This is having a serious effect and bringing parts of the industry to a halt. Even though this is mainly, but not entirely, in the non-residential sector, its effects are certainly felt in the ordinary building sector.

Having regard to the fact that 54% of the Australian population is in 6 capital cities and having regard to the sparsity of population in the remaining area of Australia, I believe this will be a magnificent achievement. I understand that even in the United Kingdom - a much smaller area with a much larger population - a comparable percentage of people do not have television available to them. I have indicated previously my desire that the country people of Australia should have good facilities - as far as we can possibly make them available - particularly in regard to radio and television.

Also I am very conscious that there have been mass meetings of wool growers across the nation supporting the principle of a single marketing authority for wool. I cannot give an assurance to the honourable member as to whether such organisations as the International Wool Textile Organisation are going to influence the Australian wool growers. I would think it would be a retrograde step if they automatically followed what anybody else said. The user organisations certainly have a right to express a point of view, but I hope that the Australian wool industry will be discerning and make its own judgment as to what it believes is in its best interests as a whole. What is good for the user is often good for the industry, and vice versa. I think the most important thing for the survival of the wool spinner or the wool grower, however, is that he receives a satisfactory return. Without it there can be no guarantee of continuity of the supply of the raw material. This is what gives us all a great deal of concern. The Government would certainly listen to any advice, criticism or recommendation from all bodies concerned, and would take such views into consideration when the industry federation comes up with a recommendation. I think there has been a lot of undue speculation about what is meant by a single marketing authority. Nobody has spelt out in clear detail what is meant by this. In answer to a question in the House yesterday, I said that I did not interpret it as being the abolition of the auction scheme. It may be supplementing, strengthening or altering it. However, this is a matter for the wool industry. The members of that industry have to make up their minds, and I hope they exercise an independent mind in doing so.","WOOL MARKETING","QUESTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In the first instance the Government made this shock announcement. It was debated .in this Parliament. The Minister stated that the industry supported it, in fact promoted it. It was not the industry at all. It was a body which is known to be a Country Party front. I refer to the Australian Wool Industry Council. The matter was then taken to the Senate and the Senate rejected the Governments intention. The Governments decision was bitterly attacked by wool growers. No action was taken by this Government until after the election and then it was taken, one might say, in the stealth of the night. The Government then decided to go ahead.Only one course was open to the wool growers who were opposed to the lifting of the ban, and this was to ask the Australian Labor Party for assistance through the trade union movement. The trade union movement considered the position and in its wisdom made a judgment that until this matter had been decided by referendum or decided properly in this Parliament action should be taken to prevent the export of merino rams. The export of merino rams might be only a minor event in terms of the importance of the national Parliament, but in terms of economics and in terms of principle it could be a major matter. That is why I am moving for the suspension of the Standing Orders. For this Government flagrantly to take no notice of the Senate and to go ahead and try to impose its will on the people and the wool growers of this country is contemptible.","N/A","SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/speech[1]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Quite apart from the confusion which has been allowed to grow up around this matter, and quite apart from the difficulties which surround the industry and divide it on the matter, the producers of the rams themselves are concerned. Because of the complete apathy and lack of action of the Government on this matter the people who have sold rams and the people who have bought them are, it is true, suffering considerable hardship. I can say this with some feeling because 60% of the merino studs are in the Riverina district. This confusion lends weight to the proposal that we put forward. If we are to clear up the confusion it should be done now. After all, what was said earlier has served only to confuse the issue and to confound the entire Parliament, because 56% of the growers, in terms of numbers and organisations, have expressed their opposition to the lifting of the export ban on merino rams. A simple way of cutting the Gordian knot would be to have a referendum. But action has to be taken quickly. There is need to take it now.It has been said that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) has the most tremendous power. It has been suggested that the farmer bodies in Victoria and New South Wales are simply acting as agents for the Leader of the Opposition. This is a piece of nonsense, though it certainly exalts the status of our illustrious leader. But let us be quite clear that when the industry voted on this matter and thereby expressed its opinion it was not concerned about the Australian Labor Party or the Leader of the Opposition; it was concerned with putting its own convictions forward. Yet it has been suggested in this Parliament, even today, that nobody is in favour of the retention of the export ban except the Australian Labor Party and that the Leader of the Opposition intervened in this matter and made decisions about the rams. These fictions should be cleared up once and for all.There is an urgency about the matter, because the industry is divided and the people who produced the rams and the people who bought them in good faith are suffering hardships. Because the Government has postponed a decision we have complete inaction. Debating this matter is one way in which this Parliament can bring about some action and some resolution on it. This is a plea to cut the Gordian knot. I ask that the motion should be agreed to so that this can be done.Surely it is not suggested that the Government is so close to the brink of disaster that it fears to fall, to be hoist on the horns of the banned ram. It has been demonstrated both by the moving of this motion and what has preceded it that there is an urgency to resolve this matter. This can be met by the suspension of the Standing Orders. The only reason that the motion could be denied is that the Government feels that it will have more dissidents in the debate or after it than it has now. I suggest that in the interest of the industry and the individuals concerned the Parliament is in duty bound to accept this motion. It has a responsibility. The 2 New South Wales farmer and grazier organisations and the Victorian Farmers Union, claiming to represent 56.6% of the industry have expressed themselves very definitely. The Senate has also expressed itself. The Government has been in defiance of the majority on this matter. It surely has a responsibility to explain itself. It has a responsibility to resolve an impossible situation. Fifty rams are in limbo because the Government cannot make up its mind on what action should be taken.This motion which has been moved by the honourable member for Dawson (DrPatterson), if carried, will give the Government an opportunity to face up to its responsibilities. Surely the vote on this matter should be a matter of conscience. After all, we are talking about the products of people who have to be considered. We are talking about people who acted in good faith. We are talking about the grower and producer organisations who have said to the Government: Will you resolve this matter for us? The Australian Senate has been quite definite. Simply to shrug this off and say that the whole responsibility for the opposition to the lifting of the ban rests with the Leader of the Opposition is absurd. The responsibility rests with the Parliament; it rests with the Government. I hope that the Government will not go down before the spectacle, as I said before, of being hoist on the horns of the banned ram.","N/A","SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It has taken 3 months for the Australian Labor Party to initiate a move to have a debate in this House on the matter. It has done it this morning only because it had been goaded into doing it because of its guilt about this whole subject matter of not allowing the law to be enforced and acted upon. What the Labor Party is saying is that if the trade unions say something, or suggest how the procedures of the House should be carried out, the Government should automatically bow to the unions. What the unions are saying, on the advice of the Australian Labor Party, is that there should be a debate on this matter.I am not arguing whether or not a debate should take place. It does not concern me greatly. Here, in the closing stages of this session, the Labor Party has moved for the suspension of Standing Orders this morning. It already has listed on the notice paper for discussion a matter of public importance. The Opposition was to go ahead with that debate. But, no; because its members became a little upset at question time and because it realises that it is in the wrong, the Labor Party is asking the Government now to change the whole parliamentary programme to allow its members to try to clear their own names. I see no reason why the Government should agree to the suspension of Standing Orders. This is sought for the benefit of honourable members opposite. Plenty of procedures of this House are available to them to facilitate a debate on this matter. For a period of 5 months, the Opposition has failed to introduce a debate on this matter. No need exists for the Government to have a debate on the subject. We have the law behind us. We have the industry behind us.To show honourable members how weak and pathetic the Opposition is and to illustrate the class of the debate that the honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson) has introduced this morning, I point out that the honourable member referred to the Australian Wool Industry Conference, which is a body made up of all the wool industry organisations, as being a Country Party front.","N/A","SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

But it certainly is not a Country Party front. It stands for well established, recognised industry organisations across Australia. To see a member of the Australian Labor Party using the argument that a referendum should be held to decide the issue is laughable to say the least. How did the Labor Party introduce the original embargo? It was introduced overnight by Executive action. No reference whatsoever was made to the wool industry. It was introduced by statute. Its enactment was an illustration of the doctrinaire principle that we know is followed so often by the Australian Labor Party when in office.Today, honourable members opposite ask for a referendum on the matter. The wool industry has not asked for a referendum. A referendum cannot be held on the partial lifting of a ban for a temporary period. This partial lifting is to be reviewed. That is the point of view of the wool industry. We are prepared to stand behind it. But, no, the Australian Labor Party knows better and says that a referendum must be held. It was not good enough to have a referendum in the first place; apparently the Labor Party has changed its mind now.","N/A","SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/speech[3]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

94,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BARNARD, Lance","JO8","Bass","N/A","N/A",3063,"- This motion is intended to open up for debate the present status and future prospects of the Australian aircraft industry. TheMinister for Supply (Senator Anderson) made a comprehensive statement in the Senate on 9th April 1970 on the aircraft industry. In his defence review the Minister for Defence (Mr Malcolm Fraser) touched on aspects of the industrys future. But the last debate of any consequence on the aircraft industry was in this House early last year during an Opposition urgency motion on defence procurement. During that debate the former Minister for Defence cast grave doubts on the chances of setting up a viable aircraft industry in this country. That argument has been reinforced by the present Minister for Defence. In answer to a question asked by the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) on 20th May 1970 the Minister pointed out the high cost of developing sophisticated aircraft. As examples he used the F14 and F15 now being developed in the United States of America, pointing out that the developmental costs of one of these aircraft and the contract relating to it are of the order of $US40Om a year. It is labouring the point to say that a developmental programme of this nature is beyond Australias resources. Of course, it would not be possible to build in i Australia weapons systems such as the Fill or massive transport aircraft such as the Galaxy. If aircraft of this kind are essential to Australias defences - and I remain to be convinced that they are - they will have to be procured overseas.It is clouding the issue to put up development programmes such as the FI 5 having regard to Australias modest capability and requirements. There are many less sophisticated aircraft relevant to our needs which could be and should be designed and built in Australia. It has been argued that Australia cannot afford to develop and build its own aircraft; that it should buy all its aircraft off the shelf overseas. Even if this were feasible it would still be necessary to maintain and service those aircraft within Australia. This would mean the building up of inventories of spare parts and the maintenance of quite a substantial skilled work force. We give our aircraft a long life span gauged on world experience - about IS years seems to be a fair average. If aircraft are to be maintained and serviced in Australia for this length of time the initial development and production should be done in Australia. It would be self defeating to buy abroad for some cost advantage if there were no bases in Australia for the servicing and maintenance of these aircraft.It can be argued that maintenance and service work with such bread and butter orders as missiles and target aircraft would be adequate to sustain the rudiments of an aircraft industry. This is the sort of tentative industry indicated by the Minister for Supply in his statement on the defence aircraft industry. The Minister said that the industry as now established had a range of technological facilities not inappropriate to the peacetime support of the Services. He said also that the industry had reserve capability for a war situation. What the Minister seemed to be referring to was the excess capacity now apparent in an aircraft industry with the completion of the major programmes which have sustained the industry during the 1960s. It would be completely wrong to suggest that defence orders should be made just to keep an industry going. This invokes the perverse logic of the military industrial complex and all it implies in the distortion of resources. Hut any projection of Australias needs shows a requirement for large numbers of relatively unsophisticated aircraft for both military and civil needs. These can best be developed and built in Australia where they will have to be supported and serviced.The emphasis on getting elaborate weapons systems such as the Fill has in recent years obscured the need for the basic workhorse aircraft which all 3 elements of the armed Services will require. The procurement of helicopters and support aircraft is gathering momentum, as disclosed in the posture statement made by the Minister for Defence in March. Yet the aircraft industry remains in a state of insecurity and indecision about how much of this procurement will flow to its workshops. The Minister for Supply advanced 3 basic objectives for the industry. The first is to maintain basic defence aircraft facilities capable of supporting the Services. The industry has this capacity in excess at the moment. In fact, the only certainty confronting it is the continuing need to service the Mirage and Macchi aircraft. The second objective was to ensure that the technologies of the industry were upgraded in line with the latest developments. This is a major problem area because any industry must languish if its development is fitful and unplanned.The Australian aircraft industry has been a principle victim of the irrational and erratic procurement planning of the postwar years. There have been 4 substantial buildups within the industry since the end of World War EL. Each build-up has stretched the resources of the industry but it has managed to set and maintain high standards. At the same time each programme has brought an accumulation of skills into the industry. However, when each specific programme has wound up there has been no outlet for the designers, stressmen, engineers, draftsmen and other skilled aeronautical personnel. The reservoir of skill and experience has been allowed to trickle away on each occasion. When another major programme comes up this work force has to be re-formed. Inevitably there is a drifting away from the uncertainties of the industry and the reconstituted design and developmental teams are the lesser for this loss of experience and expertise.At the moment the run-down in the industry is reflected in the dwindling of the work force at the Government Aircraft Factories from about 2,800 at the peak of the Mirage project to fewer than 2,000 today. It may be many years before there is a project comparable to the Mirage. The next may well be the successor to the Mirage in the years from 1975 to 1978. Unless other work can be found within the industry there will be a marked waste of essential skills until again a hasty build-up has to be made in the mid-1970s. Even the major programmes have been subject to fits and starts in the placing of orders. Even the Mirage and Macchi orders were broken into haphazard and illogical segments. This lack of continuity has been the major cause of the industrys malaise. Without firm knowledge of forward requirements and what finance is available it is completely impossible to evolve a steady pattern of production and growth. It is absurd to expect specialist skills to be on tap when a sudden decision is made for local production after a lapse of some years.This leads to the third objective prescribed by the Minister for Supply - the need to rationalise the effort of the industry. Closer links between the 3 major components of the industry - the Government Aircraft Factories, the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation and Hawker de Havilland - have been foreshadowed in recent years. In answer to a question placed on notice by the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) the Minister for Defence has confirmed that the amalgamation of the Government Aircraft Factories and the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation is receiving close attention. Sir Lawrence Hartnett has gone further in suggesting that these 2 agencies should be joined with the aeronautical research unit of the Department of Supply to form a new corporation for the development of civil and military aircraft. I am sure that the Minister for Defence will agree that Sir Lawrence Harnett has had considerable experience in building up essential Australian industry. All honourable members will recall the significant part he played in the establishment in this country of the motor car industry. I suppose many of those who now advance arguments against the establishment of an aircraft industry used the same irrational arguments in 1948 and 1949 when the Labor Government, acting on the advice of and with the co-operation of Sir Lawrence Hartnett, set out to establish in Australia a successful motor car industry. It is now the third largest employer of labour in this country. The arguments against the establishment of a motor car industry are now being used against the establishment of an aircraft industry.It seems that some degree of rationalisation is inevitable although its final form cannot be predicted. It is to be hoped that this can be done without dislocation of the work force, which has made a notable contribution to the success of the major aircraft programmes of the 1960s. With regard to the future, there are a number of areas where additional work may be found for the industry. The outlook is not encouraging for local project design. The industry had pinned its hopes on the development of a joint project with the British Aircraft Corporation for a swing wing jet trainer. Much work has gone into this project but it seems there is no prospect whatever of it getting off the drawing boards. The only major project in view is the so-called Project N which is intended to fulfil a variety of military support roles. It has been claimed that this project was so-called because it was the nth design to come off the drawing boards after innumerable paper planes had been flown into the filing cabinets. There may be sound military and commercial prospects for Project N but it is a very hypothetical project at the moment.I referred earlier to the necessary role of the industry in the manufacture of aircraft engines and guided weapons, and in making spares and performing repair and overhaul work. A vexed area of the aircraft industry at the moment is the negotiation of coproduction, offsets and sub-contracting arrangements with overseas manufacturers. There has been some progress made here but the contracts obtained are negligible compared with the glowing words of successive Ministers for Defence about building the industry into the fourth arm of defence. There have been some reasonable contracts negotiated for aircraft components, particularly helicopter parts and jumbo jet parts. But this has amounted to a mere fraction of a percentage of our foreign exchange spent each year on aircraft and aircraft parts. Despite the Governments emphasis on offset and sub-contracting arrangements it seems to have been reluctant to insist on them when the actual terms of the contracts were being hammered out.In summary, there is room for great dissatisfaction about the present state of the aircraft industry and its prospects. There has been a complete failure to work out a forward planning policy assessing future needs and budgeting for them on a 5-year or 7-year basis. This state of uncertainty raises grave doubts about the future of the industry and even its chance of survival. The Opposition believes that it is not possible to opt out of the industry, that it is an essential industry and that it should be made as self-sufficient as possible. The fluctuations between over-commitment and comparative idleness have damaged the industry. It can be put on a footing of competence and confidence only by developing a forward programme which would meet military and commercial needs for aircraft of relatively simple design.Certainly elaborate weapons systems are way beyond Australias reach but there are a number of less sophisticated aircraft which are needed and which can be developed by the Australian industry. There has been a reluctance on the part of the Government to see the aircraft industry in Australia as a viable one. It has maintained its absolute adherence to the purchase of aircraft overseas and its reliance on the technology available in other countries which may not always be available to Australia. The Government has shown a refusal to accept the factual success of European countries with a much smaller population than Australia and certainly with ho greater skills. These countries have been able to design and produce aircraft for defence and commercial purposes with very great success. These reasons-Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Lucock)Order!The honourable members time has expired.","Discussion of Matter of Public Importance","AUSTRALIAN AIRCRAFT INDUSTRY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
95,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FRASER, Malcolm","QS4","WANNON, VICTORIA","LP","N/A",3066,"- The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Barnard) has been quite muted and moderate in the remarks he made about the aircraft industry and indeed in many of the propositions be put forward he could well have been supporting many of the proposals and attitudes to this industry which have been adopted by the Government over a considerable period of time. Perhaps in part the quiet manner in which the honourable member went about his task this morning reflects the alleged and reported split within his own caucus and executive as to whether or not the Australian Labor Party should support this kind of matter of public importance. In one report there seemed to be some suggestion that an attack on the Governments attitude could be construed as wanting to saddle the Royal Australian Air Force with aircraft that could be inferior to those which are needed by the RAAF for its particular roles.I want to pick up one or two of the points that were made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He said that countries overseas - he did not name them but he has done so before, and Sweden is one country - had demonstrated success in the construction of aircraft. Those countries have demonstrated that they can produce aircraft that can fly. But I suggest whether or not these aircraft are successful and whether or not the decisions and judgments these countries have made would be successful would be tested only when those aircraft are pitted in operations against an enemy. The fact that the Swedish Air Force flies aircraft that have been built by the Swedish Government is not a test of the success of that countrys aircraft industry; it is not a test of the success of the policy it has adopted. If there is anyone in this House who wants to take a risk with the personnel and the expertise of the RAAF by suggesting that it might have to or perhaps it should have to adopt an aircraft merely because it is designed or produced in Australia, saddling the RAAF possibly with the second best, he could well be committing us to inferiority in air operations in an area where supremacy of equipment is vital to supremacy of operations. I know that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition did not go as far as this but I suggest that if the analogy of Sweden and other countries is taken too far that could well be a part of the conclusions that one might draw.The Deputy Leader of the Opposition was at pains to point out that Australia should not get into the business of designing or constructing markedly sophisticated aircraft such as the F14 or the F15 now under design in the United States or the Galaxy. He did not say whether or not we should have gone ahead with the AA107 - the advanced supersonic trainer and ground support aircraft. I think his omission to say that the Opposition supported the design and construction of this aircraft in Australia is the most significant weakness in the Oppositions attack because this attack has been hinged on the Governments refusal to proceed with a project which was in fact not viable.I would like to run through the history of this industry to show what is being done, and what has been done and to say what some of our plans - and admittedly these sometimes fall into the area of hope - and hopes for the future may be. There are 3 main production centres. They are the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation Pty Ltd, Hawker de Havilland Australia Pty Ltd and the Government Aircraft Factories.The Deputy Leader of the Opposition indicated that the Government Aircraft Factories employment had fallen to under 2,000. This is not the case. He did not mention the 2,800 employed by the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation and a number over 2,000 employed by Hawker de Havilland. There are well over 6,000 people employed by this industry, so it is quite a significant one. In addition to that there are other significant sub-contractors.The Commonwealth has had a net cost value of about $3 Om invested in the industry. The industry itself has an additional §8m invested. For the last 10 years the turnover has been about $300m. In 1968-69 the turnover was $40m. This again is not insignificant evidence of Government support. The total output has been over 4,500 aircraft, 3,600 aircraft engines, 1,400 guided weapons and 390 jet target aircraft with additional ones, I understand, on order. This, again, does not indicate insignificant Government support for this industry. Production has included the Canberra, Sabre, Vampire, Winjeel, Mirage and Macchi aircraft. The Winjeel, of course, was a CAC design and production, the Jindivik was designed and produced at the Government Aircraft Factories. Export income from Jindvik has been $20m. Export income from Ikara is $30m. These again are not marks of an industry that has been left to languish over a period of years. They are not marks of an industry that has not been able to achieve its own successes.But there is a basic problem. While the Deputy Leader of the Opposition outlined the basic problem he offered no alternative or solution to it. The basic problem is that when we come to order replacement aircraft - it might have been for Sabre and the next time it might have been for Mirage - and when these aircraft are to be produced in Australia we are going to want them within a reasonable period of time. It would not be possible or viable for the Air Force, for example, to replace the Mirage aircraft over a period of 12 to 15 years and so have a phased production of the Mirage replacement over that time. The Air Force would be in a continual state of flux and change, with squadrons changing from erne aircraft to another. It would be operating with 2 types of aircraft. When it makes up its mind that it wants a new aircraft or needs a more advanced aircraft, clearly it is necessary to get that into operational service as quickly as possible. So with defence orders for operational aircraft it is just not going to be possible to phase the orders over a considerable period.This highlights the problem of an industry that is largely dependent on defence orders. It highlights the need for the industry itself to be more aggressive and to show more initiative in achieving orders outside the defence complex. It is very difficult to establish an industry which is entirely dependent on defence orders and have that industry established in a fully viable sense with an even work flow which, of course, is desirable. Hawker de Havilland has, I think, shown more initiative than the other 2 sectors of the industry in achieving orders, even in the exceedingly difficult United States aero-space market. If the rest of the industry can show the same initiative and enterprise, a healthier situation might develop. But if there is any person in the industry who believes that because he designs an aircraft there is an obligation on the Government to buy that aircraft and an obligation on the Royal Australian Air Force to fly that aircraft, that would in some circumstances be committing the Royal Australian Air Force to buying inferior aircraft and committing it to inferiority in air operations. I know that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and his Party would not want that any more than the Government would want it.The present work load of the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation involves production of Macchi aircraft and Viper engines, and this will continue for some time. Production of aircraft frame and spare engines for Mirage and Macchi aircraft will continue for several years. There is also various overhaul and repair work. Hawker de Havilland is sub-contracting for Macchi aircraft and this work will be completed probably some time early next year. It undertakes the overhaul of a wide range of military and civil aircraft and engines. The Government Aircraft Factories are producing Ikara. They are developing a different kind of target drone from Ikara called the Turana. The Commonwealth has, of course, provided over $3m for the develpment of Project N which, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has said, we hope will not only be successful in a military sense but will be able to develop substantial commercial and export sales. This is a specific example where funds provided by the Commonwealth are intended to give the design staff of the Government Aircraft Factories an opportunity to show what they can do and to demonstrate that they can produce a product that is good, that will be commercially and economically viable and that will meet the needs of the Services. This places the onus fairly and squarely on the people in the industry themselves to produce what they say they can produce. If by some mischance - and I hope that this will not happen, of course - Project N is not a success and does not succeed, that the design is a failure, I hope there will not be people in the public and in the Opposition who will say that despite this the Commonwealth must buy this aircraft and, despite this, the Services must have this aircraft. Again, this would be committing us to inferiority, which we could not afford, in an important area of equipment.What we need to be willing to do is to provide an opportunity for the Australian aircraft industry to enter design, to enter production, to build a prototype such as Project N for which we are providing funds in the present circumstances. Then, if the prototype is a success or can be made a success production will commence and proceed. But if the prototype is not a success we have to be prepared to cut the project off and not commit ourselves to a project that has been a failure. If we are not prepared to do this it would be better to stay out of the business altogether rather than end up with equipment that would be inferior to our needs.I have already mentioned Turana, a target drone for the Navy which is under preliminary development at the Government Aircraft Factories. I have mentioned Project N. Funds have been provided for 2 flying prototypes. I have not mentioned so far what we are trying to do to establish the nucleus of a helicopter industry in Australia. I recently announced the intention to purchase a total of up to 149 helicopters for the various armed Services. Of this number 84 will be light observation helicopters. Two helicopters, the Westland Sud and the Bell are equal in technical merit. We have told both firms concerned that they are to come forward with a total project for us to examine which will involve a significant element of Australian production. I hope that all 3 elements of the Australian industry will be involved. When we make a final choice between these helicopters which will involve significant funds, we will be giving a very significant weighting to the firm which is able to come to us with the best local production and coproduction proposals for its particular helicopter. We believe also that the helicopter so chosen should have commercial opportunities and export opportunities. This is where, I think, perhaps for the first time the weight and basis of the policies that were enunciated by my predecessor are coming, to be put to the test. It is not the only example, but I think it might be the most significant example.This is a project and a contract that the Government will be watching most closely. It could have important implications for the future of the industry. But it is important again for the industry not to think that it can be left entirely to the Government to use its weight and leverage in this area. It is going to be necessary for the industry to show that it can be competitive, as Hawker de Havilland has shown it can compete in the United States market. The industry must show that it can be reasonably competitive and not unduly COStlY; that it can produce goods of the quality required and that it can produce the goods in the time scale required. I know that the industry has performed in these ways in the past but I am just issuing the warning note that because the Government is now seeking to use maximum leverage the industry should not therefore leave it entirely to the Government to help it achieve contracts for the industry. The industry must show its own initiative and expertise. I have every confidence that within the 3 segments of the industry this initiative will be shown.We are also undertaking preliminary studies for the possible co-production or the production in Australia of an antiaircraft system, the Rapier. No decision has yet been made to purchase Rapier but if a proposal should be put to the Government that this is a weapons system we require and should have, we would want to be able to see what the local production possibilities are. This is another matter that is under study. We are seeking to sell Macchi aircraft to New Zealand. I hope very much that New Zealand will believe that it is in its interests to buy Macchi aircraft from Australia rather than from Italy or the United Kingdom. In a number of areas we are producing co-production and offset proposals which could have an impact on the industry. The Government is active in supporting this industry. It has, I believe, done a great deal, but the industry itself needs to get out into a wider field to try to achieve much larger commercial orders than has been the case in the past This would do much to overcome the unevenness which is inevitable in defence orders.","Discussion of Matter of Public Importance","AUSTRALIAN AIRCRAFT INDUSTRY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
96,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"KEATING, Paul","NH4","Blaxland","N/A","N/A",3069,"- In raising the question of the depressed state of the Australian aircraft industry and the Governments failure to promote the design and construction of Australian aircraft, the Opposition wishes to bring to the peoples attention the fact that Australia is forfeiting an important segment of its defence capacity because this Liberal-Country Party Government, and its predecessors, have failed to come to the decision that Australia should have its own aircraft industry, and that that industry should, where possible, equip our armed Services with locally manufactured aircraft.The event that reinforced the Labor Partys decision to raise as a matter of public importance the Governments neglect of the aircraft industry were the recent statements by the Minister for Defence (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Minister for Supply (Senator Anderson) concerning the cancellation of the joint Anglo-Australian project for the development and production of a variable geometry supersonic attack trainer known as the AA107. This decision comes at a time when the aircraft industry is at its lowest ebb for many years. The AA107 project, as a case in point, exemplifies the Governments backward approach when it is faced with a proposition that requires a bold yet measured decision; a decision that, if taken, would have lifted the local aircraft design capacity to perhaps the highest level yet attained. The AA107 would have been the first collaborative military research and development programme that Australia had undertaken with a major overseas aircraft manufacturer. Regardless of Australias rejection of the project it seems that the British Aircraft Corporation will press on with the project in collaboration with Macchi of Italy. Contrary to what the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Supply say, the AA107 concept would seem to have considerable market potential.The Australian Aircraft industry is held in very high regard overseas. France, for instance, from whom we secured the license for the manufacture of the Mirage, is very interested in joining Australia on joint research and development projects, as distinct from licence projects. Recently OFEMA, the French aero-space industrys export organisation, sent a mission to Australia to investigate the possibilities in this direction. With the current Macchi jet trainer manufacturing programme nearing completion, 2 of the 3 main elements of the industry - the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation, and Hawker de Havillands will have no appreciable workload as a basis to retain personnel. CAC is supplementing its air frame and engine manufacturing capacity by sub-contract work, service overhauls and spares production. It is also forced to manufacture passenger buses to retain skill. Hawker de Havilland is doing its best to keep its aircraft production capacity alive by servicing military and civil aircraft. It is attempting to supplement this work by hunting for offset and sub-contract work overseas. It also manufactures aluminium pleasure boats as an avenue to retain personnel. The Government Aircraft Factories, the third major component of the industry, were relying heavily on the GAC100 civil airliner project which has now been jeopardised by the withdrawal of the main American contractor, and they now have to fall back on Jindivik and Ikara production plus the minute $3. 5m project N civil light aircraft development. A dire situation exists when defence production establishments like the three I have mentioned are forced to survive on ancilliary work including the production of buses and pleasure boats. In the agricultural aircraft fields we can still remember the Governments rejection of a reasonable bounty for the Transavia Airtruk and, in the light aircraft field, the selling of the Victa Airtourer to New Zealand. I would like to discuss the fallacious fourth arm concept which has been enunciated by the Minister who has also spoken about helicopter production, but it would take too much time to deal with it at this stage.I turn now to the selection of the Macchi as the jet trainer for the RAAF. This was a classic example of the malaise that exists at Government level. In 1963 in reply to anRAAF requirement for a trainer, the local industry offered the Government an Australian design known as the CA31, an aircraft that by all accounts would have fulfilled the RAAFs requirements and more. A decision was put off until finally at the very last moment the Government said that it was too late to produce a locally manufactured product, and they went overseas and bought the Macchi MB326H trainer. This was the greatest slap in the face the aircraft industry here had had till that point of time, but it was typical of the classic Liberal defence approach of last minute panic buying. There was no argument for the selection of the Macchi on a cost basis. Macchi, as licensor, received cost compensation for the research and development element, the tooling costs, a percentage of the normal profit margin, and the cost equivalent of the increased profit, that Macchi would have earned had it not forfeited the learning curve benefit by allowing the aircraft to be made outside its own factories. To add insult to injury the Government bungled the possible Singapore outlet for the Macchi and thus denied the local aircraft industry a much needed workload. The Government is now desperately trying to sell the plane to New Zealand.It is often said that half the problem with local aircraft manufacture is that the RAAF has an inherent dislike of local production. This could be so, but in fairness to the RAAF, it has had a difficult task in trying to assess the roles for its aircraft within the ambit of the Menzies, Holt and Gorton Governments stop gap defence and foreign policy objectives. The coalition in the past 20 years has been inept in pursuing doubtful foreign policies based on interdependence with a major Western power. With the advent of the Vietnam war and the successive problems in that conflict, it is probable that future American administrations will show a rapidly declining interest in the Asian region. In fact, I think it fair to surmise that in a very short space of time American military activity in that area of the world will be restricted to the comings and goings of the United States Seventh Fleet and perhaps assorted diplomatic forays into the countries of the region. The reality of this situation is that Australia with its vast area and natural wealth will be the only Western country in Asia. In these circumstances, it is imperative that we should develop our own defence capacity. As the lessons of the last World War illustrated so vividly, when the crunch comes a countrys capacity to defend itself is inextricably bound with its capacity to manufacture.This Government and its predecessors have been criminal in their neglect of Australias defence industries. Our aircraft industry, our electronics industry, and the other ancillary industries that are so important to a viable defence capacity have been bypassed by the Government. We should take a lesson out of Swedens book in relation to defence planning and, in particular, aircraft manufacture. Sweden, a country with 8 million people, can afford to develop and manufacture its own relatively sophisticated aircraft because it has one clear defence policy, and that is to defend Sweden against the might of Soviet Russia, to the last Swede if necessary. With this clear defence objective, the Swedish Government and its defence forces, have been able to standardise and minimise the variety of equipment so that it has been possible to produce defence equipment far more cheaply that it could have been procured overseas. Australias problem is that the Government has never defined a consistent and continuous defence policy, and therefore it has been impossible to standardise defence procurements. The SAAB Corporation, in Sweden, which is regarded by the Swedish Air Force as a commercial extension of itself, manufactures the aircraft requirements for the Swedish Air Force. The system 37, Viggen and Draken are prime examples.Australia could have the equivalent of the SAAB Corporation if the major components of the aircraft industry here were merged into one or even two units. The only problem then would be to have the RAAF regard that merged organisation in the same way as the Swedish Air Force regards SAAB. Swedens defence requirements are sensibly programmed on a 7-year rolling budget basis, adjustable at 12- monthly periods, to allow defence industries and the aircraft industry, in particular, to plan its production on a full workload basis. The industry is therefore able to secure the learning curve benefits and also the benefits of material procurement in mill size quantities. By comparison, the Australian aircraft industry has had to suffer with intermittent workloads and a lack of production continuity, and has had to build up the labour force on 4 separate occasions. Each time this has occurred there has been a progressive reduction in the classes and skill of labour available.Some time this year or early next year the Government will have to decide upon a replacement for the RAAFs Mirage aircraft. This may be a single multi-role aircraft, or attack and intercept aircraft in 2 separate versions. Whichever it is I sincerely hope that the Australian aircraft industry is commissioned to design and manufacture it either singly or in collaboration with an overseas aircraft manufacturer. The Mirage replacement will be the acid test for the Government to prove once and for all its bona fides as far as the local aircraft industry is concerned. This matter of public importance that the Opposition has moved here today is not just a question of the Labor Party scoring points off the Government because of its neglect of our aircraft industry; but it is a matter of national importance, and national insurance that we awaken the Government to its inadequacy in this area. The Government must make the decision that Australia is to have an aircraft industry, and to have it the industry must have a constant workload. The manufacture of aircraft for the armed services alone would provide this. While the life of the industry trickles away, as it is doing at this very moment, Australia is paying out massive amounts in foreign exchange to buy imported aircraft.If Australia is to acquire independence in the field of aviation it must have its own aircraft industry. In this respect I hope the exercise that the Opposition has undertaken today in this Parliament will be of benefit to the nation.","Discussion of Matter of Public Importance","AUSTRALIAN AIRCRAFT INDUSTRY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
97,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"STREET, Anthony","KVM","Corangamite","N/A","N/A",3071,"- I regret that time will not permit me to reply to all the points raised by the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), but I would like to refer briefly to the matter of the AA107 advanced supersonic trainer and close support aircraft for which the Royal Australian Air Force had an initial requirement of 30. The honourable member inferred we should have gone ahead with this project. During the period of the design study for the AA107 aircraft the RAAF reassessed its requirements in the light of experience that was being obtained in Vietnam. During a recent speech in Melbourne the Minister for Defence (Mr Malcolm Fraser) explained quite clearly why the Australian Government had decided not to participate in this project; it was because the RAAFs experience in Vietnam had demonstrated that for close support operations helicopter gunships had many attractions. The Minister has already announced that we will order them. Concurrent studies within the RAAF indicated that as far as advanced supersonic training was concerned the specially equipped dual-control Mirage aircraft would deal with this requirementSo it seems to me that if we follow through the argument of the honourable member for Blaxland we must conclude that the Opposition wants the Royal Australian Air Force to be required to accept aircraft it does not want, and nothing could be more disastrous to the interests of the Service. The sort of results which would come from the Oppositions determination to make the RAAF dependent on Australian production, irrespective of the wishes or requirements of the RAAF, would inevitably lead to a lower standard of capacity for the Air Force.It seems to me that there is a mistaken belief that an Australian aircraft industry automatically means a factory producing complete aircraft. Nothing could be further from the truth. Such a concept is long out of date. The great overseas manufacturers such as Boeing, Douglas and the British Aircraft Corporation not only arrange for the manufacture of component parts by many different companies within their own country, but in Europe it is practically universal for the design and construction of aircraft to be a multi-national responsibility.The Australian idea of an aircraft industry is probably a legacy of the early days of this industry. Of course, we had an aircraft industry before we had a motor car industry. In those days we had the complete aircraft coming from under the one roof. So far as I am aware, the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation is the only factory in the world which manufactures both airframes and engines. Australians have become used to seeing one factory producing the complete aircraft. This was economically possible when aircraft were a lot less sophisticated and complex than they are today. But the manufacture of modern aircraft, particularly military aircraft, involves many separate industries and trades. To try to get all those industries and trades under one roof makes it extremely difficult to achieve any benefit from economies of scale. Of course, this highlights the major difficulty and disability under which the Australian aircraft industry operates. Our small population and our small requirement in terms of numbers of aircraft, whether for military or civil purposes, makes it impossible to achieve the long production runs of the various components, if the complete aircraft is to be produced. This in turn leads to high unit costs of production and difficulty of achieving export sales.Aircraft normally have quite a long useful life. Therefore an aircraft tends to be still in production after the initial order has been completed by the factory or factories concerned. This in turn makes it difficult to achieve the continuity about which the Opposition seems to be so concerned. If the production of a given type of aircraft is extended over a long period, the RAAF in particular will be faced with having many different types in service at the one time. I personally believe that the future of the aircraft industry in Australia will increasingly be in the component field, with relatively long production runs. This in turn, as the Minister has said, will require that the industry gets out and looks for business and in particular tenders for work outside Australia when it gets the opportunity to do so. It has been shown that we can do this. Hawker de Havilland has been successful in tendering against American opposition for Bell helicopter rotor hubs and delivering them to the west coast of America. This is an outstanding example of private enterprise initiative which could well be followed by other firms.It seems to me that the prime requirement for an Australian aircraft industry should be to have a nucleus of design staff, testing facilities and productive capacity capable of rapid expansion in an emergency to meet the needs of the armed Services. This is the prime requirement. As the Minister said, the work load on the industry at the present time - the industrys production was valued at $300m over the last 10 years and $40m last year - shows that we are maintaining our basic requirements. The Jindivik and Ikara are still in production. Design and development work is being carried out on a pilotless target drone aircraft, Turana. The Government has given the go-ahead for the production of prototypes of Project N. The Macchi with its Viper engine are still in production and like the Minister, I trust that New Zealand will see the wisdom of obtaining its requirements from its nearest neighbour.The Government has announced that its choice of light observation helicopter will be determined by the proportion of manufacture sub-contracted to local industry. This would be a pretty big order. The same opportunity may present itself in the case of medium lift helicopters. Every effort is being made to get work for local industry from United States firms. The Government has announced a co-ordinated programme to promote overseas sales of Australian made equipment and components, and to encourage co-operative research and development projects between Australia and overseas industries. I maintain that these facts alone make nonsense of the terms of the matter of public importance that the Opposition has put before the House.","Discussion of Matter of Public Importance","AUSTRALIAN AIRCRAFT INDUSTRY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
98,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"JONES, Charles","KDV","Newcastle","N/A","N/A",3072,"- What sparked the raising of the present matter of public importance by the Opposition was the decision of the Government to cancel the order which it placed with the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation and the British Aircraft Corporation to design an advanced trainer-ground attack aircraft to the requirements of the Royal Australian Air Force. The RAAF, through the Department of Air, laid down the major requirements and said: This is the type of aircraft we would like you to design. So this Australian organisation which has been in existence for some 35 years went to work on it as a joint defence project with the British Aircraft Corporation. Now all of a sudden, as a bolt from the blue, a decision is made that it does not meet our requirements and the Government wants to cancel the order.The Government has talked about what it is doing for the aircraft industry and what it has done for it, but the general attitude of the Government over the years has been typical of Conservative governments in this country for the past 70 years. In the early 1900s when the Australian Labor Party was moving and working for the establishment of an Australian Navy, a Royal Australian Air Force and an Australian Army, it was the people who occupy the benches opposite today - the Conservative element, whether it was the United Australia Party, the Liberal Party or the Conservatives; the anti-Labor force in this country - who at all times decried the efforts and the capacity of the Australian worker and Australian industry to produce these things. The same thing was said about the shipbuilding industry in the period from 1900 to 1930, and the shipbuilding industry was finally closed down. I do not have to remind honourable members of the criticism that was levelled at the Labor Prime Minister, Mr Ben Chifley, when he and his Government were responsible for the establishment of the automobile industry in Australia. Today it is one of the largest employers of labour in Australia. I acknowledge that it is over capitalised. We have too many motor cars being produced in Australia today, but honourable members cannot deny that it is a first class industry and is able to compete. If it were not so heavily over capitalised with so many different types of motor cars being produced, it would be in a much stronger position.That brings me to the point I would like to make here. The Government has talked for some considerable time about rationalising the Australian aircraft industry. What has it done about it? It has talked about it, but we have never got down to anything practical on this point. To me it appears to be running a commentary by various Ministers for Defence and various Ministers for Supply who make a statement and think that that will tide us over for the next 6 months. They think: That will shut them up. We have got them out of our hair. The former Minister for Defence, Mr A. Fairhall, made a statement in Newcastle on 7th February. In it he said:The major contract, which could amount to $13m, has been signed with the General Aircraft Corporation of California, US, for the Australian manufacture of 100 wing sets and engine nacelles for a 36-seat feeder-route airline (known as the GAC-100).What has happened to it? That contract was signed 18 months ago. They have not driven a rivet yet. They have not cut a plate. No work has been done by the Government Aircraft Factory for that aircraft. The contract being signed shut the industry up for 6 months. That quietened the spokesmen for the industry. That got them out of the Ministers hair. We have had rationalisation statements made by the Minister for Supply (Senator Anderson). We have heard the Minister talk about what the Government is going to do and how it is going to rationalise the Australian aircraft industry. We have heard talk but have seen no progress. Then there was a statement recently by the Minister for Defence (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in which he said:The Government is to set up new machinery to work closely with Australian industry in a programme to achieve increased sales to the American and other overseas defence industries as an offset against Australian purchases of defence equipment.What has been the result? This was an excellent opportunity for the Government to develop an aircraft and use the knowledge and know-bow of one of the largest aircraft manufacturers in the world today, the British Aircraft Corporation. That organisation has produced some of the best aircraft in the recent decade or the last 20 years, aircraft comparable with any produced throughout the world. Its BACIII, is comparable in size, performance and capacity with the DC9. The Royal Australian Air Force saw fit to buy two BACH ls for its VIP flight in preference to the DC9. That again was an excellent opportunity to work in close collaboration with that large organisation which has the know-how and could transfer to the Australian industry the capacity to design aircraft, or to work towards that end. If this had cost a few million dollars then so what? The American Government recently lost $600m in grants to the Boeing company in an endeavour to design a swing wing supersonic transport. It is now a dead project Boeing finally advised the American Government that as far as it was concerned that could not be done at economic rates which would enable the aircraft to compete with the Concorde or some of the other aircraft which may be designed.The Opposition is trying to get this Government to assist an industry which is  not a minor one of insignificant consequence. The aircraft industry is a major industry. Over the years it has employed 18,000 or 19,000 men and women. The peak level of employment at the various establishments operated by de Havilland is about 5,000. But at present, in round figures, it is employing about 2,500 employees, only about 66% of the companys capacity and only 60% of those people are working on aircraft. The remainder are working on other things merely so that the company can retain them. The Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation today is employing some 2,700 men and women. This is about 80% of its capacity. The same thing can be said about the Government Aircraft Factories. They have a capacity of about 3,000 but are employing now only about 2,070. The aircraft industry has the ability to produce, yet the Government is doing nothing about it.A lot can be said about the defence requirements of the Australian forces but I want to talk about commercial aircraft requirements. With the concurrence of honourable members I incorporate in Hansard a table of figures compiled by the Parliamentary Library Research Service relating to imports of commercial aircraft.N/AThe figures relate to aircraft imports in the period 1964-65 to 1968-69. The table discloses that in the case of aircraft with an empty weight exceeding 5,000 lb, there were 314 imported in that 5-year period at a value of $196,698,000. In the case of aircraft with an empty weight of less than 5,000 lb there were 1,493 imported at a total value of $29,086,000. The value of all commercial aircraft imported in that period, together with spares, was $535,857,000.I think the Australian aircraft industry needs support. We should be forcing the airline operators and aviation organisations generally to do something to ensure that the Australian industry is preserved. One cannot deal with all these things in the short time available in this debate. I say that there should be a 4-point policy for this industry. Firstly, military aircraft manufacture should be in accordance with a clear cut Government policy and funding procedure. Secondly, the Government should be planning a light aircraft industry based on the requirements of general aviation and commuter airlines. Thirdly, the Government should aid the aircraft industry with substantial offset payments from overseas. Fourthly, the Services and the commercial airline operators should be forced to make early decisions about the type of aircraft they require so that the Australian aircraft manufacturing industry will be in a position to approach the companies concerned in order to sub-contract the work and to offset payments with a view to Australian industry getting its share. The Opposition accepts the fact that we cannot build 747s and Fills but we could at least build a lot of other aircraft.","Discussion of Matter of Public Importance","AUSTRALIAN AIRCRAFT INDUSTRY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
99,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FAIRBAIRN, David","KDT","Farrer","N/A","N/A",3074,"- The aircraft industry, by its very nature, is subject to violent fluctuations not only in Australia but throughout the world. When theRoyal Australian Air Force needs an aircraft it needs it quickly. These aircraft cannot be produced at the rate of a few each year over a period of 10 or 15 years. The RAAF wants an aircraft quickly and hopes, when it buys it, that it will last a decade or even longer. There always will be periods of stress in the aircraft manufacturing industry when inadequate numbers of skilled workmen are available and there always will be periods of excess workmen when there is a drop in activity after orders are completed.Why do we need an aircraft industry in Australia? There are number of reasons. I suppose the first is that it helps to provide employment. We are told that something like 7,000 people are employed in this industry. Quite a number of them are employed on civilian work and not on aircraft production. We need an industry to provide a nucleus on which to expand in case it is necessary, particularly in wartime. However one cannot foresee the sort of expansion over a long 5-year period such as was the case in World War II because I do not believe that that type of global war will eventuate again. We need an aircraft industry to reduce the cost of purchases of both civilian and Service aircraft. When we say we are producing an aircraft in Australia people tend to think that we are fully producing it. We are not doing this. Although 60% of the basic Mirage aircraft is made in Australia, if we take into account all the avionics probably only about 30% of the final cost of an operational Mirage is incurred in Australia.It has been said that we need an aircraft industry to earn money from exports. In this regard we have had some success in various fields. We would have had much greater success with the Jindivik had it not been for the United States policy that it would not purchase Australian made equipment as against American made equipment unless there was a vast difference in the cost. The Americans wanted to purchase the Jindivik years ago but succeeded in doing so only fairly recently because there was no doubt that it is much better than any alternative produced in the United States. We need an aircraft industry in order to produce spares quickly. When I was Minister for Air a Sabre would have had to be abandoned had we not had local production. It suffered a rather bad explosion. We were able to repair it and get it back into service because we had a local industry. The aircraft would not have been repaired if we had had to get most of the parts from overseas. We need to be able to produce modifications and to service aircraft. Then I suppose we need an aircraft industry in order to be independent of overseas supply and control. This is important, particularly since one or two European countries from whom we have purchased equipment have tried to direct us, in a most ham fisted way, about where that equipment should be used.But there are drawbacks to this policy. The greatest drawback with local production is that you tend to get a set-up in which something designed in Australia almost inevitably turns out to be not as good as best aircraft designed and flying overseas. Then, by pressure of events, the RAAF is forced to take something which is second best. Australia has been particularly fortunate in this respect. I would say that plane for plane the RAAF matches or exceeds almost all air forces operating throughout the world because we have been able to go overseas and take our pick. I would hate us to get down to a state of affairs in which we were forced to use something other than the best, particularly in the important field of combat. Perhaps it is different in the case of transport aircraft or other aircraft of that sort. We have to decide whether we want the RAAF to be just a public relations show for Australian industry or whether we want it to be the best equipped air force in the world. I see that my colleague the honourable member for Northern Territory (Mr Calder) is in the chamber. At one stage he and I were operating in the same theatre. I know that we did not give a damn who made the aircraft we were flying in. All that we were worried about was whether it was better than the aircraft we were facing. At one unfortunate period when I was doing long range unarmed reconnaissance the aircraft I was in was not the best. There is a future for the industry in Australia. It lies in repairs, maintenance and modifications and in a number of projects such as the Jindivik, the Ikara, the Turana and others that are being looked at. It also lies in making components. I believe it is essential that when we place orders for defence equipment overseas we have an agreement that many of the components that can be made in Australia shall be made in Australia. This is not a debate on whether or not we have an aircraft industry but a debate on what is to be the level of activity in that industry.","Discussion of Matter of Public Importance","AUSTRALIAN AIRCRAFT INDUSTRY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

102,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"SNEDDEN, Billy","DQF","Bruce","LP","Minister for Labour and National Service",3076,"- I move:That the Bill be now read a second time.In 1967, an agreement was reached by a national conference, consisting of representatives of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Waterside Workers Federation, the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour, the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority and the Department of Labour and National Service on a scheme for permanent employment in the stevedoring industry. In November 1967 the Stevedoring Industry (Temporary Provisions) Act was enacted to give the necessary legislative backing to enable the permanency arrangements to operate. They were introduced by this means rather than by amendment of the main Stevedoring Industry Act because the Government had decided that the new arrangement should be subject to a trial period before permanent alterations were made in the legislative arrangements for the industry. Following the enactment of that legislation, permanent employment has been introduced into 7 major ports in Australia. Approximately 80% of all the regular waterside workers in Australia are in these ports and are now employed permanently, either by operational companies for whom they work exclusively or by a holding company set up by the various employers, which supplies labour on a day to day basis to operational companies in order to overcome the peaks and troughs of labour demands.The Stevedoring Industry (Temporary Provisions) Act was given a limited life and it is due to cease to operate on 1st July next. The Government had hoped that by the end of the original period of operation of the Act to have introduced legislation which would have provided for the future and permanent arrangements in the industry. However, a number of factors have prevented us from doing so. Firstly, the technological changes which are taking place in the industry with the introduction of container ships, unit load ships and rollon roll-off ships is far from complete. It could be another 2 years before the future structure of the industry becomes reasonably clear and before the permanent level of the work force in the industry can be determined with any precision. Secondly, although only about 20% of the work force is not permanently employed, these workers are spread through a large number of comparatively small ports and there is a need to determine what sort of employment arrangements would be most suitable for them and for the industry. Thirdly, while the permanent arrangements have brought considerable benefits to the work force and while the position as to costs in actual stevedoring operations appears to be reasonably satisfactory - a factor which the Government regarded as crucial - the industrial relations situation in the industry has been far from good. Indeed over the past 12 months it has deteriorated to such an extent that the losses in man hours through industrial stoppages are of the same order as in the pre-permanency days. However, a recent agreement on wages and conditions between the employers and the Federation to which the ACTU was a party includes a no-strike clause on these issues for a period of 2 years. Thus while we hope for and expect a significant improvement in this area, there is a need to see whether it eventuates before making final decisions in relation to the industry.Because of these factors the Government has decided that it would be inappropriate and indeed premature to introduce permanent legislation at the present time. A further period is clearly needed to determine whether any major changes are necessary in the present permanency arrangements as a result of 3 or more years of operation and to work out the sorts of arrangements that ought to apply in the future in those ports in which casual employment still operates. For some it is probable that permanent employment arrangements of the type existing in the present permanent ports will be feasible. In the remainder, it is probable that these will not be suitable but it is obviously desirable that some regular form of employment should be introduced. Over the next 2 years it is my hope that suitable arrangements will be devised for all ports in Australia. Despite the Governments decision not to proceed with permanency legislation it was necessary that legislation of some form be introduced before 1st July because of the expiry date of the Temporary Provisions Act. Before determining what form this further temporary legislation should take I decided it would be desirable to seek the views of all those who have been closely concerned with the industry. Therefore, I have had discussions individually with Mr Woodward, Q.C., with the Chairman of the Authority and with representatives of the ACTU, the Waterside Workers Federation and the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour. These discussions proved most helpful and showed that there was a great deal of common ground among all the parties as to what might be done in the industry. Although I could not accept all the suggestions for amendments to the legislation which were put to me, I believe that what is proposed in this Bill will meet with general approval from all the parties involved in the industry.The present Bill has 4 main purposes. Firstly, it extends the period of operation of the Stevedoring Industry (Temporary Provisions) Act 1967-68. This is essential as all the arrangements which enable permanent employment to operate devolve from this Act and cease to have effect when the Acts term of life expires. Thus to enable the permanency arrangements to continue beyond 1st July next, the period of operation of the Act is extended for a further 2 years, that is, until 1st July 1972. This date also coincides closely with the termination date of the agreement reached at the National Conference in relation to permanency. Thus, it is an appropriate time from which changed and permanent legislative arrangements for the industry should operate. I would hope that well before this date, however, I will be in a position to bring before the Parliament, proposals for the future permanent arrangements in the industry.Secondly, the Bill amends the constitution of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority. At present the Authority consists of 3 full-time members. However, since the introduction of permanent employment there has been a marked diminution in the functions of the Authority. Primarily, this has occurred in the permanent employment ports which as I have said account for 80% of the industrys labour force. The functions of allocation of labour and initial discipline which were major activities of the Authority have been transferred to the employers. Thus, there is no longer any justification for retaining a full-time 3 man Authority in the light of the reduced work load it has to carry. The Bill provides that the functions of the Authority shall, in the future, be exercised by 1 full-time functionary who will be called the Director. He will have all the powers and carry out all the functions of the present tripartite Authority. However, the corporate existence of the Authority is not affected. Furthermore, I wish to stress that the existing functions of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority are not affected by this legislation. True, further ports may become permanent ports over the next 2 years, but this is simply in accordance with the intention and authority of the Temporary Provisions Act introduced in 1967. Thus, I do not anticipate that the enactment of this legislation will have any direct effect on the employment position of ASIA staff.However, it would be wrong to imply that the policy which the Government has been following in this industry, namely of transferring greater responsibility for the management of this industry to the employers will not ultimately affect the Authoritys functions. Over the next 2 years, the Government will be giving detailed consideration to what the permanent role of a statutory authority in this industry should be. It is to be expected that there will be a continuing contraction in the activities of the Authority. It is impossible to say, at this time, the extent of the functions and the number and types of staff that will be required by a statutory authority in the permanent arrangements to be developed in the future. However, I do not expect that any major changes in functions and consequently major alterations in staff levels will take place before this Act expires in 1972. I recognise that the welfare and future of the staff of the Authority are matters of the utmost importance, and that proper provision for any who might be displaced in whatever permanent arrangements are ultimately developed for the industry should be determined well in advance of any such displacement. I have written to the General Secretary of the Federated Clerks Union suggesting an early meeting to discuss this question and have also advised the Secretary of the ACTU of this. However, I reiterate once again that there should be no cause for concern about redundancy on a major scale within the next 2 years.Thirdly, the Bill provides that the National Stevedoring Industry Conference should be given statutory backing and redesignated the Stevedoring Industry Council. Since 1965 when industrial relationships and work performance in the industry had reached an all time low the National Stevedoring Industry Conference under the chairmanship of Mr A. E. Woodward, Q.C., has worked with a great deal of success to improve the situation in the industry. It has been responsible for negotiating the agreement on permanent employment, overseeing its implementation and sorting out the many problems that such a major change in employment relationships must inevitably bring in its train. Of course it would be wrong to suggest that the Conference has been successful in all its activities. There have been disappointments and failures. It would not be an institution comprising ordinary human beings with conflicting interests if it did not have failures. However, there can be no doubt that this Conference, under Mr Woodwards capable chairmanship, has been one of the most successful exercises in co-operation between employers, unions and government, in any industry, let alone this most difficult and volatile stevedoring industry. It has brought about a significant change in employment relationships in the industry and it is largely because of its very existence that the introduction of the revolutionary container shipping system to Australia has been possible without the industrial upheavals that have occurred in most other countries.As I have said, there is a need now to plan for the permanent arrangements which will operate ultimately in the industry. Although the vast majority of waterside workers are now employed permanently, the fact remains that in a large number of small ports 20% are still casually employed and there is a need for schemes for regular employment to be devised for them. The Governments policy in relation to the stevedoring industry is that there should be a continuing effort to make the employment relationships in the industry as near as possible to those in industry generally. This can be done only if there is co-operation from all parties in the industry. The obvious body to undertake the necessary investigations and to advise me on the future of the industry is the National Stevedoring Industry Conference. Furthermore, whatever the final structure of the industry, I believe it to be essential that this should include some standing consultative machinery. I believe that it is appropriate now to establish such machinery on a statutory basis so that its status and role can be sufficiently developed before the permanent structure of the industry is decided upon. I propose that this body should be called the Stevedoring Industry Council. The Bill provides that it shall be constituted along the same lines as the present National Stevedoring Industry Conference. Its functions, which are primarily to advise me on the operation of existing employment arrangements, on the development of new employment arrangements and on such other matters as I might refer to it, are set out in clause 6 of the Bill. Apart from these advisory functions, however, it will have the function of endeavouring to bring about amicable agreement in relation to industrial questions in the industry. It has, over the past 4 years, been doing just this, and this activity is in keeping with the spirit of the recent national agreement on principles for the establishment of dispute settlement procedures.Fourthly, the Bill provides for the correction of a number of anomalies that have occurred as a result of the operation of the Stevedoring Industry (Temporary Provisions) Act 1967-68. While these anomalies in themselves are small, they have created injustices and the Bill remedies these. There are 2 types of anomaly involved. The first relates to the payments for annual leave. Under the permanent employment arrangements, the holding company and operational employers are responsible for the payment of annual leave to their permanent employees. However, in a number of circumstances such an employee may have had a period of casual employment during the leave year for which there is an element in the statutory levy collected by the Authority. It was accepted in introducing the legislation in 1967 that the Authority should reimburse an operational employer or the holding company for any portion of annual leave paid by the company which was attributable to casual employment However, the legislation did not completely cover all examples of such casual employment; nor did an amendment in 1968. The current Bill now corrects the deficiencies. The other anomaly relates to refunds of portion of the levy to employers who employ waterside workers on a permanent basis under special agreements, for example in container terminals, and who under these special arrangements do not use holding company labour nor claim reimbursement of wages from the holding company for the time when their employees are not able to be employed. It has been found that the definition of special agreement for weekly hiring in the earlier legislation does not cover all agreements for employment of this nature and employers covered by some of these agreements have not been able to obtain refunds of the appropriate portion of the levy even though they meet the essential criteria for refunds. The Bill corrects this situation and both in respect of this anomaly and those mentioned earlier, the legislation is made retrospective to the introduction of the initial legislation in 1967.The BDI also provides for employers who enter into new agreements of the kind mentioned to be eligible for a refund of a portion of the levy provided that the Minister is satisfied that such agreements will not adversely affect the general permanent employment scheme in a port and will improve the efficiency of the particular stevedoring operations. Mr Speaker, this legislation merely represents a further development in the process of change in the stevedoring industry which we embarked on in 1965. It is essential that it be enacted now as the present permanent employment arrangements can- not operate beyond 1st July this year unless the Act is extended. I am hopeful that as a result of the recent agreement on wages and conditions, we can look forward to the industrial relations climate being restored to the situation that was achieved in the first 2 years following the establishment of the National Conference. Only such a climate will enable the permanent arrangements for the industry to be worked out in the atmosphere and with the dispassion necessary to ensure their success. The employers and the Federation must realise that the future structure of the industry depends very much on their performance over the next 2 years. I commend the Bill to the House.Debate (on motion by Mr Charles Jones) adjourned.","Second Reading","STEVEDORING INDUSTRY (TEMPORARY PROVISIONS) BELL 1970","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

104,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"SNEDDEN, Billy","DQF","Bruce","LP","Minister for Labour and National Service",3079,"- I move:That the Bill be now read a second time.The Bill changes the sanctions provisions, otherwise called the penal clauses of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Sections 109 and 111 of the Act dealt with industrial stoppages on the basis of the Commonwealth Industrial Courts injunctionmaking power and its power to punish for contempt. The Bill will deal with an industrial stoppage as a breach of an award but before the prosecution may proceed it will be necessary for the parties to have taken advantage of the conciliation or, if necessary, arbitration of a presidential member of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The Bill comes at the end of a long series of discussions that have been held between myself, and my predecessor and the Attorney-General (Mr Hughes) and his predecessor with representatives of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the National Employers Policy Committee. These discussions began in May of last year when the ACTU made representations to the Government about sanctions provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. I want to make it abundantly clear, however, that the legislation that is now before the House has not resulted from negotiations or bargaining by Ministers with either the ACTU or the NEPC; nor does it result from any bargaining between the ACTU and the NEPC. What is in the legislation results from the Governments own decisions. Throughout the discussions that were held between the Ministers and the 2 national bodies, there was no departure by any of the 3 parties from their policies in relation to the penal clauses. The ACTU position remains unchanged. It is that the sanctions provisions of the Act should be repealed. The attitude of the employers remains unchanged. Their policy is that there must be adequate sanctions provisions in the legislation.The Government position remains that sanctions are an essential feature of our system of conciliation and arbitration. However, the Government does not insist on the existing sanctions provisions in the Act. The Government sees the sanctioning process as being one of last resort. The Government wants to see every reasonable effort made to solve disputes between management and labour by the processes of negotiation, conciliation and, where necessary, arbitration. When reasonable efforts have failed and there is strike action sanctions ought to be available. When I put the proposals before the Government which have led to this Bill, I was able to take into account the representations that have been made by the ACTU and the National Employers Policy Committee. The ACTU asked that the sanctions provisions be removed from the Act. This is not being done but I believe that what is now before the House is a responsible and positive response to what the ACTU and the NEPC have put before the Government.Mr Speaker,the essential feature of the Bill is that before action can be taken to use the new sanctions process the Commission will attempt to resolve the issues that lie between the parties. I believe that the existing sanctioning process which involves the use of the Courts injunctionmaking powers under section 109 and its power to punish for contempt under section 111, are no longer appropriate or desirable. I believe they suffer from 2 main deficiencies. Firstly, there is the immediacy of their availability. Secondly, they do not allow the Court to take hold of the dispute between the parties and endeavour to assist the parties to resolve that dispute. This is no reflection on the Court. The Court cannot concern itself with the underlying causes of matters which come before it under sections 109 and 111. Therefore, there is a provision that before a sanction can be sought, the party seeking that sanction must notify the Commission. Furthermore, the Commission will be constituted by a presidential member and he will be required to make every effort to settle the dispute that exists between the parties. Not until he has issued a certificate will it be possible to proceed in the Industrial Court.The giving of this role to only presidential members of the Commission is an earnest of the effort on the part of the Government to ensure that all reasonable steps are taken to solve disputes without the need for their existence to result in the use of sanctions. This is consistent with the Governments aim of encouraging discussion and negotiation between parties in dispute. The Government believes that the status of a presidential member will greatly assist the parties in working out differences between them and thus help to minimise the use of the sanctions process. This is certainly not to say that the Government sees or wishes to bring about any diminution in the role of the lay commissioners. What is now proposed will not bring that about. The very valuable work that the lay commissioners perform will continue to be performed. They will still be called upon to assist in settling disputes between parties including the day to day issues which arise and which may or may not involve the existence of industrial action in the form of strikes and bans.The Government does not believe that sections 109 and 111 are consistent with its aim of trying to have disputes solved without recourse to sanctions wherever this is possible. This means that when the Bill becomes law, the injunction-making powers of the court under section 109 and its powers to punish for contempt will not be capable of being exercised as sanctions against unions or employers for award breaches. Section 109 has been used principally in the past to secure observance of so-called bans clauses of awards and, where it could be shown to the court that orders made in this way under section 109 were being breached, the court could punish such breaches as contempt of the court and impose a fine of up to SI ,000. This is being swept away. In future, there will be I sanctions proceeding and not 2. Moreover, I would point out to honourable members that by clause 13 of the Bill now before the House, all orders made by the court under section 109 in relation to awards and still in existence will come to an end on the Bill receiving royal assent.Section 119 of the Act enables penalties to be imposed for breaches of awards of the Commission. This Bill will develop that section for use as the new sanctions provision and all breaches of awards will be punishable under that same section. This means that if an employer fails to observe obligations placed on him by an award such as, for example, the payment of wages fixed by the award, he will be liable to a penalty under section 119. If a union or an employer breaches an obligation imposed by a clause of an award which says, for example, that the union or employer is not to be party to some form of direct action, it will also be liable for a penalty under section 119. Unions and employers will come within the same maximum penalties for breaches of awards. The important difference is, however, that if a union or an employer is thought to be in breach of a clause of an award such as I have just referred to, it would not be possible immediately to take action under section 119. There will be an obligation to notify a presidential member so that attempts can be made to settle the dispute giving rise to the apparent breach on the part of the union or employer.I should also emphasise that the Bill provides that only a presidential member of the Commission will be permitted to deal with an application for the insertion in an award of a clause which would place an obligation on a union or on an employer not to be party to action that would hinder, prevent or discourage the observance of or the performance of work in accordance with the award The ACTU submitted that penalties imposed by the Industrial Court under section 111 of the Act for contempt of orders made by the court were accentuated because on occasions the court imposed fines for each day on which contempt was found to have been committed. This meant that unions could be fined up to $1,000 a day. The Bill ameliorates this. The Bill provides that where there is a provision in an award that a breach of that award constitutes a separate breach on each day on which the breach continues, the maximum penalty that the court can impose will be $500 for each separate breach, whereas the maximum penalty that the court can impose where there is no such provision in the award will be $1,000. These provisions will apply in respect of all types of breaches whether they be committed by a union or by employers.In its representations to the Government the ACTU submitted that in addition to the penalties imposed for contempt of orders made by the court there was an added burden in the form of the costs awarded by the court in proceedings under both sections 109 and 111. The Government is not prepared to eliminate completely the awarding of costs in sanctions proceedings. This would be to set a most undesirable precedent. However, in 1967 the Conciliation and Arbitration Regulations were amended so as to provide that in connection with proceedings under sections 109 and 1 1 1 costs could not be awarded in respect of more than 1 counsel or in respect of Her Majestys Counsel, except if the court held that the nature of the proceedings was such as to warrant the appearance of more than 1 counsel or Her Majestys Counsel. The Government proposes to have the regulations amended following the passage of this Bill to extend that provision to proceedings taken under section 1 19.Also relevant to costs is clause 17 of the Bill which provides that employees of organisations will be able to appear before the court. Nowadays many organisations of employers and employees engage persons such as industrial officers. Their every day work makes them knowledgeable and experienced in industrial matters and, therefore, the Government sees no reason why they should not be permitted to appear before the court within the existing framework of section 117a. Similarly, the Bill would permit employees of organisations to appear before the Commission and the Flight Crew Officers Industrial Tribunal. Moreover, since the Bill would take away from the Industrial Court its power to order compliance with an award under section 109 and its power to punish breaches of such orders as contempt there will be a reduction of legal costs.There are other related provisions which 1 now mention briefly because they are largely of a consequential nature. Section 109a of the Act will be repealed because it was related to the provisions of section 109 now being deleted. The appeal and reference provisions of the Act will apply to proceedings before a presidential member when he is dealing with matters to which clause 6 of the Bill refers. The new sanctions process thai I have outlined will also apply in respect to the Flight Crew Officers Industrial Tribunal and the Coal Industry Tribunal except that the role of a presidential member will be exercised by those persons who constitute those tribunals. The Bill also proposes an amendment of the Conciliation and Arbitration Regulations to provide for payment of fees and travelling allowance to the person constituting the Flight Crew Officers Industrial Tribunal and to persons appointed by the Minister under the Act to deal with a particular industrial question involving flight crew of aircraft.Regulations prescribing fees and travelling allowance for these persons were notified in the Commonwealth Gazette* on 15th January this year. The Regulations included a provision validating payments made from 13th December 1967, when a person was first appointed. On 21st May the Senate disallowed the regulations on the grounds of the high degree of retrospectivity for which the regulations provided and the fact that payments had been made in anticipation of the making of the regulations. Clause 21 of the Bill provides for the amendment of the Conciliation and Arbitration Regulations in the terms contained in the amendments made by the disallowed regulations and provides that all payments made shall be taken to have been validly made. After the Bill becomes law there will be a fee of $75 a sitting day for the person constituting the Tribunal, $100 a sitting duy for a person appointed by the Minister to deal wilh an industrial question and travelling allowance for each at the rate of $21 a day. Power to amend or repeal the regulations by further regulations is preserved for the future.Mr Speaker,this Bill contains a positive response to representations made to the Government by both the ACTU and theNational Employers* Policy Committee. The Government has not taken a hard line approach lo the matter of sanctions, lt has sought to bring the sanctions process more into line wilh what it believes to be current needs, lt has not resiled from its po1 icy that there must be sanctions. It has once again reiterated thai it sees die sanctions process as a last resort process. The emphasis of the Bill is on the use of negotiation, conciliation and, where necessary, arbitration, to resolve industrial issues between management and labour. The Government does not believe that the existing sanctions process represented by sections 109 and 111 is appropriate any longer. This indicates that the Government recognises the thought and attention being given to our system of conciliation and arbitration at the present time. 1 also have been .giving a very great deal of thought to thai system.There have recently been developed by national tripartite agreement a set of Principles for guidance in establishing and using effective procedures for avoiding and settling industrial disputes. I welcome this agreement. Ii represents an important step forward not merely because it will lead to detailed dispute settlement procedures but also because it is the product of tripartite national discussions. If Government, employers and the trade union movement cun find common ground on principles relating to such a fundamental matter, then the process of translating those principles into detailed procedures at plant and industry level should follow. The principles were worked out between Ministers and the ACTU and the NEPC independently of their respective attitudes to industrial sanctions. They are not linked in any way wilh what is included in this Bill. Their importance is that sensibly used they ought to go a very long way towards making the sanctions provisions of the Bill the last resort which they are intended to be.I take this opportunity to acknowledge the effort contributed by my predecessor and the Minister for Education and Science (Mr N. H. Bowen) when he was Attorney-General in the evolution of the dispute settling procedures. The present AttorneyGenera! (Mr Hughes) has participated with mc in our discussions since November last with the ACTU and the NEPC. I take this opportunity to express my thanks to my 3 colleagues. I commend the Bill to the House.Debate (on motion by Mr Clyde Cameron) adjourned.","Second Reading","CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION BILL 1970","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/subdebate.1/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

106,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BURY, Leslie","JTP","Wentworth","LP","Treasurer",3083,"- I move:That the Bill be now read a second time.It was estimated in the 1969-70 Budget that the Commonwealth would have a deficit amounting to $30m in the current financial year. At the time the Budget was introduced, it seemed probable that the amounts available from loan raisings in Australia and overseas and other financing transactions, which had amounted to $5 12m in 1968-69, would be more than sufficient to finance this estimated deficit.In statement No. 4 attached to the Budget Speech, it was explained that prospects for raising loans overseas seemed poorer than in 1968-69 and that prospects for net loan proceeds in Australia were affected by the fact that redemptions would probably be substantially greater than in 1968-69. At the same time, it was pointed out that it was not possible to estimate in advance with any degree of assurance net loan proceeds or the change in the Treasury note issue, as this would be affected by developments during the course of the year. In the event, it is now clear that net loan raisings overseas will be a great deal less than last year and that, as a result of the high level of redemptions, so too will be net loan proceeds in Australia. In addition, largely as a result of monetary conditions, it seems likely that there will be a substantial decline in the Treasury note issue.Although, on present indications, it appears that the deficit will be close to the Budget estimate, there is a possibility that the amount available from loan raisings and other financing transactions will not be sufficient to finance the deficit. The purpose of this Bill, which is in the nature of a precautionary measure, is to obtain authority to borrow from the Reserve Bank the amount required to complete the financing of the deficit in 1969-70, if this proves to be necessary, and to expend the proceeds of the borrowing for defence purposes.The amount to be borrowed from the Reserve Bank is, of course, a residual. It is the net result of all receipts, expenditures, borrowings and redemptions under other legislation approved by Parliament. Even at this late stage of the financial year, therefore, with large amounts of revenue still to be collected and expenditures still to be incurred and with fluctuations still possible in the volume of Treasury notes on issue, it is not possible to forecast with precision the amount which it may be necessary to borrow from the Reserve Bank to complete the financing of the deficit. Consequently, this Bill follows the practice introduced in 1968 under which no specific upper limit is set to the amount which might be borrowed under the legislation. Instead the Bill seeks authority to borrow such sums as the Treasurer considers to be the likely maximum amount necessary to complete the financing of the deficit.The borrowings for which authority is now sought will be made for defence purposes, and the proceeds of the borrowings will be applied to finance expenditure from the loan fund on defence services. The Bill is essentially a machinery measure to enable the Government to carry out policies approved under the various Acts authorising expenditure, the raising of revenue and financing transactions. In itself, the Bill does not authorise expenditures which have not already been authorised by Parliament. It provides for expenditure on defence services, which has already been authorised by Parliament in the Appropriation Acts, to be charged to the Loan Fund instead of to the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Provision for charging part of our Defence expenditure to the Loan Fund has been made in previous years when the net amount available from loan proceeds and other financing transactions has not been adequate to finance the deficit.

The Opposition does not oppose this legislation. Indeed, we approve of the recommendation made by the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances which investigated this aspect of the payment now being made to certain members of the defence forces. It has been argued that under the Governor-Generals regulations alterations can be made to the payment of allowances for members of the defence forces, but the report of the Senate Committee on Regulations and Ordinances was quite explicit. In its opinion the payment of allowances for senior members of the defence forces should be the subject of legislative action by the Parliament. I note, from the Ministers second reading speech, that bc has accepted that proposition, although the Department maintains that the regultaions were legal and valid. However, the Minister has accepted the recommendation of the Senate Committee that in future pay and allowances should be adjusted as a result of action taken in the Parliament. The Opposition is in complete agreement with this point of view. We believe that these matters should properly be dealt with by the Parliament and for this reason we do not oppose the legislation. We support the point of view expressed by the Minister for Defence when he introduced the legislation. This Bill represents an acceptance of the recommendation of the Senate Committee which was charged with the responsibility of examining this matter.I agreed to deal with the Bill this afternoon because of some of the difficulties associated with the time factor and with the business before the House. Then I was told that there would be two or three amendments proposed by the Government. Unfortunately I ha\e not had time to consider fully the amendments that the Government will move. They were handed to me in the last four or five minutes. I am sure that the Minister for Customs and Excise (Mr Chipp), who is handling this matter for the Minister for Defence, would agree that I have not had a proper opportunity to consider what the amendments propose and their implication, therefore I ask him to take the opportunity to explain the amendments not only for my benefit but for the benefit of all honourable members on this side. 1 conclude by repeating that the Opposition supports this legislation. We believe that the Government has adopted a proper course of action in ensuring that in future the payment of allowances to senior members of the defence forces will be as a result of legislation introduced into the Parliament.Question resolved in the affirmative.Bill read a second time.In CommitteeThe Bill.","Second Reading","DEFENCE BILL 1970","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The amendment in relation to clause 2 substitutes a new clause 2 providing that sub-clause (1.) of clause 1, clause 2 and the proposed new clause 4 will come into operation on the date that the Act receives the royal assent. This will mean that the payment of the allowance authorised by proposed new clause 4 can commence on the date the Act receives royal assent. New clause 4 provides for the payment to the Chairman of the Chiefs of Stiff Committee, the Chief of the Naval Staff, the Chief of the General Staff and the Chief of the Air Staff of an annual allowance at the rate of $1,000 for the period commencing on the date of the disallowance of the regulations and ending on the day before the day on which the amendments to the Defence Act proposed by this Bill will come into operation.The Bill was introduced on 8th April 1970 before the regulations were disallowed by the Senate, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Barnard) would be aware. Under the Bill as then drafted it was proposed that the rates of pay and annual allowance for these officers would be specified in the next Appropriation Act, and provision was made for the Bill to come into operation on a date to be proclaimed so that amendments to regulations could be made and the commencement date of the Act delayed until after the passage of theAppropriation Act. In the meantime these officers would have been paid their annual allowances under the provisions of the regulations. With the disallowance of the regulations the present position is that these officers are receiving pay in accordance with the regulations that were in force before the disallowed regulations were made but the payment of the annual allowance has been stopped from the date of the disallowance of the regulations.The purpose of new clause 4 is to authorise the payment of the annual allowance at the rate of $1,000 per annum from the date of disallowance of the regulations until the day before the date proclaimed for the commencement of the amendments to the Defence Act. Thereafter payment will be authorised by virtue of the provision which this Bil] will insert in the Defence Act and the operation of the Appropriation Act.

117,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"GORTON, John","KH5","N/A","LP","N/A",3086,"- I am advised by thePublic Service Board that the answer to the honourable members question is as follows:As at 19 March 1970 there were approximately 4,700 local employees (i.e., indigenes) employed in Commonwealth Departments in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea.(a) The relevant order by the Governor-General under section8s of the Public Service Act 1922-1968 was made on 6 January 1968 and was gazetted on 18 January 1968. The text of that order was:WHEREAS by sub-section (1) of section 8a of the Public Service Act, 1922-1967, it is provided that the Governor-General may, on the recommendation of the Public Service Board, by order in writing under his hand, declare that the provisions of the Act and of the Regulations specified in the order shall not apply to an officer or employee, or to officer and employees included in a class of officers or employees specifiedin the order.NOW THEREFORE I, Richard Gardiner, Baron Casey, the Governor-General aforesaid, acting with the advice of the Federal Executive Council, do hereby, on the recommendation of the Public Service Board, declare that the provisions of the Public Service Act, 1922-1967, and the Regulations made hereunder, shall not apply to employees, other than overseas employees, employed by Commonwealth Departmentsin the Territory of Papua and New Guinea.The related determination by the Public Service Board under section 8a of the Public Service Act 1922-1968 was made on 31 January 1968. The text of that determination was:The Public Service Board, in pursuance of sub-section (3) of section 8a of the Public Service Act 1922- 1967, hereby determines that the terms and conditions of employment (including rates of payment) of employees, other than overseas employees, employed by Commonwealth Departments in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea, being employees in relation to whom an order is in force under sub-section (1) of that section, shall be those specified in the Public Service (Papua New Guinea) Ordinance, 1963-1967, the Native Employment Ordinance, 1958-1967, or the Native Apprenticeship Ordinance, 1951-1961.(a) The only way in which such an exempt employee of the Commonwealth Service who is not a member of the Territory Public Service may contribute for superannuation is for a certification to be given under section 4 (5) of the Superannuation Act 1922-1969, after at least 3 years service, that at least a further 7 years service is likely. No record has been located of submission of any application by a local employee of a Commonwealth Department in the Territory for such a certification to be given.These employees have not formed an organisation for the purpose of access to arbitration. However, as a matter of policy the application to them of the general terms and conditions applicable to staff of the Territory Public Service - see (4) below - means that benefits obtained in arbitration by local staff of that Service flow to comparable staff in Commonwealth Departments.Exempt employees in the Commonwealth Service, unlike career permanent officers, do not receive promotions, although during their employment they may be advanced to positions above those for which they were initially engaged, depending on working needs and the qualifications and experience of the individual employee concerned.The services of an exempt employee may be dispensed with atany time by the ChiefOfficer of the Department in which he is employed.In accordance with the Public Service Boards determination quoted in 2(b) above, the rates of pay and other terms and conditions of employment of these employees are generally the same as those applicable to local staff of the Territory Administration and Public Service who are doing the same or similar type of work. However, the Department of External Territories is pressing ahead with consultations with the Territory and Commonwealth Public Service Boards and the relevant Commonwealth Departments on the question of the appointment of all eligible local staff of Commonwealth Departments to the Territory Public Service so that they have tenure, career opportunities, and retirement benefits applicable to local officers of the Territory Public Service.Various arrangements are in operation for the training and career development of local staff in order that they might assume increased responsibility for work now being done by officers of Commonwealth Departments - e.g., Communications Officers in the Department of Civil Aviation, Observers in the Bureau of Meteorology and trades staff in the Department of Works. The Department of Civil Aviation recently offered thirty cadetships for local officers to study at the Institute of Higher Technical Education in Lae and sixteen cadets have commenced so far. Other plans include training in the work of Air Traffic Controllers and Flight Service Officers. Development of further schemes for the training of local staff of Commonwealth Departments in the Territory is continuing.","Tariff Board (Question No. 538)","ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE","/hansard/answers.to.questions/debate/subdebate.1[2]/answer[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

128,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"HUGHES, Tom","IIS","BEROWRA, NEW SOUTH WALES","LP","Attorney-General",3089,"- The answer to the honourable members question is as follows:Yes.The compilation of information of this kind is primarily a matter for the Bureau of Census and Statistics. I understand that the Bureau,to which this part of the question has been referred, is taking steps that will enable it to compile and, subject to the requirements of the Census and Statistics Act 1905-1966 in regard to the confidentiality of individual returns, to publish information about companies in various categories of size and in various industries and also about groups of companies under common ownership and control.The views of the Company Law Advisory Committee on the question whether disclosure of turnover should be required were stated in paragraph 20 of the Advisory Committees First Interim Report. The Standing Committee of Commonwealth and State Attorneys-General has decidedthat for the present, companies should not be required to disclose their turnover. The Standing Committees decision took into account, amongst other things, that the Advisory Committee had drawn attention to the need for considerable flexibility in any provision and had indicated that it did not regard disclosure of turnover as a major weapon for the protection of investors.So far as can be ascertained from legislation of other countries, views differ as to the effectiveness of publicity and disclosure to the public as aids in the control of restrictive trade practices and agreements.I have the operation of the secrecy provisions of the Trade Practices Act under continuing review. I am bound to say, however, that as at present advised I have not reached any conclusion that these provisions ought to be amended. The reasons why the Act does not provide a private right of complaint to the Tribunal were explained to this House by the then Attorney-General during the Second Readingdebate on theTrade Practices Bill 1965 (Hansard 30th November 1965,. page 3357). The views I expressed on the matter in that debate appear in Hansard, 25th November 1965, page 3235. So far as I am aware, those countries that provide for enquiries to be made to determine whether a particular trade practice is contrary to the public interest and should on that account be prohibited do not provide for the enquiries to be instituted by private complaint to the body responsible for making the determinations.","Commonwealth Trade Practices Act (Question No. 17)","ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE","/hansard/answers.to.questions/debate/subdebate.1[6]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Pty Ltd in which the society was claiming rates for aluminium welding as apply at the Garden Island Dockyard. During the hearing before Commissioner Winter, the representative of the Company opposed the union approach to having the claim determined by Section 28 notification. The company apparently believed that the claim was of such a nature that it should be the subject of an application to vary the award. The company indicated to the Commission that it would accept short notice of an application to vary the award. On this basis, the hearing of issues involved proceededOn 9th March, the Commissioner concluded that the application must fail in the form in which it was made. On the following day, a meeting took place between workers representatives and management at which management said that it had been established to the companys satisfaction that there was no longer a connection as to wage rates with Garden Island and the company then agreed to pay the rates sought as an over-award payment from 6th February, 1970.In my view, the Commission is best placed to judge how particular disputes before it are dealt with.

Sufficient information had been accumulated in CSIRO and overseas by 1966 for the Commonwealth Government to suggest to the governments in each State that they make arrangements in their own States for cloudseeding operations to assist in drought and bushfire emergencies. This would ensure that the operations could be carried out with most effectiveness by utilising the local knowledge of State officers. An assurance was given that CSIRO, while continuing with its research programmes, would assist the States with advice and equipment and would provide training for cloudseeding operators. This advice and assistance has been given by CSIRO so that the States should be in a position to accept responsibility for operations in their own regions. Equipping of private aircraft with cloudseeding equipment should therefore be a matter for each State government to decide upon. If technical difficulties arise which State officers are unableto handle, CSIRO can be approached by the particular State government for assistance.","Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization: Rainmaking (Question No. 720)","ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE","/hansard/answers.to.questions/debate/subdebate.1[14]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Local manufacturers of switchgear, isolators, fuses and surge diverters rated at voltages above 440 volts must therefore send their products overseas for type testing.The need for a national electrical testing laboratory to test heavy current equipment was recognised in 1 965, when a committee was set up under the auspices of the Electrical and Radio Development Association of N.S.W., to investigate the practicability of establishing such a laboratory in Australia. The chairman of the committee was the Chief of the CSIRO Division of Applied Physics. The committee recommended moving the electrical equipment testing facility of the Sydney County Council to another site in order to provide for present and future needs in this field. This recommendation was accepted and implemented, and the laboratory, now located at Lane Cove, New South Wales provides for practically all low voltage high current tests. Testing facilities for high voltage, high current electrical equipment, up to 22,000 volts and 13,000 amperes r.m s. will become available to manufacturers later this year.

Specialised equipment and teaching aids have been provided in appropriately designed classrooms for deaf pupils. The classroom block attached to the Mawson Primary School is one of the most modern available in Australia. The importance of appropriate training and assistance for deaf children at an early age is recognised and two specially trained pre-school teachers work with deaf and hard of hearing children in Canberra. These teachers give assistance to both pupils and parents. Another preschool teacher is undertaking a special course in Sydney this year to prepare her as a teacher of deaf pre-school children.
