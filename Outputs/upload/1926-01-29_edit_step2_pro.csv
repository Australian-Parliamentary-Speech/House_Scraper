8,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BRUCE, Stanley","F4B","N/A","NAT","N/A",527,"- About twelve months ago the Commonwealth Government was asked by the Government of New South Wales if it would be prepared to subsidize the construction of a proposed dock at Newcastle. The Commonwealth Government offered a subsidy of £120,000, on condition that the dock complied with the requirements laid down by the naval advisers of the Commonwealth. Subsequently it was found that the dock would have to be increased from 13,000 tons to 15,000 tons, and, notwithstanding the original condition that the dock must comply with naval requirements, including a capacity to lift the two new 10,000- ton cruisers, it agreed to increase the subsidy to £135,000. The New South Wales Government has since put forward new proposals involving an increase of the Commonwealth subsidy. Mr. Lang has been told definitely that the Commonwealth would have use for a dock of that character only if it could be shifted, in time of war or great emergency, to any port of Australia where it might be required, and, having regard to the other defence expenditure which the Commonwealth desired to incur if the state of the finances would permit, any increase of the subsidy beyond £135,000 was impossible. There has been no delay on the part of the Commonwealth Government-","PROPOSED DOCK AT NEWCASTLE","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[3]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The  original War-time Profits Act provided for a tax of 75 per cent., and many honorable members contended that it should be 100 per cent. To prevent a long debate on the second reading and in committee, the Treasurer should make the operation of this provision retrospective to the war period, and let his mind become possessed by the atmosphere of patriotism which surrounded the whole nation during the war. If this is not done the Treasurer will lend belief to the statement of the man who said that patriotism was the last refuge of the scoundrel. Not only in Australia, but in other parts of the world, people spoke about bleeding nations, and the sacrifices that should be made for the war. Sir William Irvine said that, if need be, the farmer must put the firestick to his crop. But neither he nor the war profiteers put any fire-stick into their crops in an effort to save the British Empire. They did not sacrifice one penny of their wealth, and they are still drawing war-time profits from 5 per cent., oi per cent,, and 6 per cent, bonds. The Treasurer has now an opportunity to enhance his chance of being placed upon the same plane as Senator Wilson.","N/A","WAR-TIME PROFITS TAX ASSESSMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

S| in. gauge on the South Australian 5 ft. 3 in. . 3 in. gauge railway between Red Hill and the central railway station, Adelaide.The necessity for the execution of these works was fully dealt with on the submission to the House, on the 18th September, 1925, of the ratification of the agreement with South Australia, in connexion with the construction of these lines and the extension of the railway between Port Augusta and Oodnadatta to Alice Springs. The length of the new line from Port Augusta to Red Hill will be 83 miles, and that of the 5 ft. 3 in. gauge line from Red Hill to the central railway station, Adelaide, on which it is proposed to provide a third rail, is about 107 miles. In compliance nee with section 6Q of the Commonwealth Railways Act the plan and all documents furnished by the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner under section 59 of the Act are being laid on the table of the House. The estimated cost of the railway from Port Augusta to Red Hill, including station buildings, signalling, &c, is £734,923, and of the provision of the third rail from Red Hill to central railway station, Adelaide, £380,000. The estimated cost of the additional rolling-stock, required is £104,250. The estimated working expenses of the railway from Port Augusta to Red Hill, including traffic, locomotive, and maintenance charges, and the net amount of working expenses of the Red Hill to Adelaide section, which will require to be borne by the Commonwealth in compliance with paragraphs 12 and 13 of the agreement of the 18th September, 1925, is £63,879. The probable revenue which would be derived from the railway is estimated at £100,755.","Port Augusta to Adelaide","TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILWAY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

59,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CHARLTON, Matthew","JXA","Hunter","N/A","N/A",531,".- This is a small bill, which provides for bounties being granted on goods produced or manufactured in Papua and New Guinea. The products on which the bounty will be paid are specified in the schedule to the Bill. Being tropical products, they will not, so far as I can see, enter into competition with the products of Australia. The principle underlying the bill should, therefore, receive the support of all honorable members, because Australia, being responsible for these territories, should do everything possible for their development. Australia has already loaned to Papua sums amounting to £100,897, of which £93,302 still remains unpaid. In addition, for a considerable time, subsidies varying from £20,000 to £50,000 per annum have been granted by the Commonwealth, the total of these subsidies being £752,000. We cannot for ever continue to grant bounties, and, therefore, . every effort should be made to enable the Territory to become self:supporting. I welcome this measure as a step in that direction. At the same time, I suggest to the Minister that one or two amendments should be made in committee. The bill refers to goods, the produce or manufacture of the territories of Papua and New Guinea. As drafted, it would enable produce from other islands to be shipped to those territories and there manufactured into goods, and so entitle the manufacturers to receive a bounty from the Commonwealth. I feel certain that that is not intended. Our desire is to encourage production in the territories under our control, and we should not permit the products of other countries to be imported to them so that by their mere manufacture into goods the manufacturers would be entitled to receive the Commonwealth bounty. Subject to the amendments which I have indicated  being made in committee,. I shall support the Bill; otherwise, I shall be reluctantly compelled to vote against it. I think, however, that the Minister will see the necessity for an alteration being made.","Second Reading","PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
60,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"YATES, George","L1T","Adelaide","N/A","N/A",532,".- I commend the Minister on having introduced this bill. The commission which inquired into the working of the Navigation Act visited Papua, and in the evidence there tendered before it the complaint was general that Papua received no assistance from the Commonwealth. It was stated that, while conditions governing the employment of labour were imposed on the employers by the Commonwealth, no benefits were conferred. The natives, realizing the advantages of working under Australian conditions, demanded better treatment, including the provision of receptacles for their clothes, and repatriation to their homes on the completion of their term of employment; and, consequently, Papua was at a dis advantage compared with other South Sea islands, with the result that the place was beginning to stagnate. The honorable member for Forrest (Mr. Prowse) will remember that at one place in Papua we visited a sisal hemp farm which was more than 2 miles in extent. In our desire for knowledge, we cut down one of the fronds of the sisal hemp plant, and stripped it. Afterwards, we learned that hemp equal to that produced in any other part of the world can bc satisfactorily grown in Papua. The sisal hemp used in Australia comes chiefly from Java. I consider that we should encourage its production in the Territory under our control. Complaints were also. made that the production of rubber, coffee, cocoa, and other tropical products in the Territory was not encouraged by the Commonwealth. Because of what I heard when in Papua, I asked the Minister last session whether the Government would consider the claim of Papua to preferential treatment. If encouragement is given to these territories in the manner proposed in the bill, it is possible that, instead of the Commonwealth facing an annual deficit in regard to them, there may be a credit balance. If we impose labour conditions, we should also support the men to whom those restrictions apply. This bill is an attempt to do that, and I believe that its effect will be beneficial. If it does what those who gave evidence before the commission hope for, it is probable that our experience in connexion with Papua may, in the future, be very different.","Second Reading","PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

For what period is it intended to grant bounties in respect of the different products of these territories?

65,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MARKS, Walter","KMU","Wentworth","N/A","N/A",533,".- It is evident that this measure has the support of all honorable members.  In 1922, at the request of the then Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes), I visited the mandated territory of New Guinea to inquire into the grievances of the people there in order that they might, if possible, be removed. I went through the territory from end to end, visiting New Britain, New Ireland, Witu Island, Madang and others, and I was greatly impressed with the beauty of the islands. That was my first impression. Next, I realized how heavily timbered they were, and what enormous expense would have to be incurred to clear the country for plantations. But the greatest impression my visit made on me was that the people there felt that they had been forgotten by the Commonwealth, because their products, on arrival in Australia, were subjected to heavy taxation. This bill would remove their cause for grievance in that respect. I sometimes wonder whether we realize how frequently big questions arise from small beginnings. Do honorable members realize that this bill will, perhaps, have a bearing upon a matter that will come before the League of Nations? When I was in Berlin recently, I was confronted with the fact that the return of the mandated territories to Germany would some day have to be considered. A deputation waited upon me in Berlin. It was headed by a man who; but for the war, would to-day be worth £1,500,000 sterling, but who is actually almost penniless. Prior to the war he owned practically the whole of the plantations in the mandated territory of New Guinea. He suggested that in view of the enormous losses incurred in connexion with that territory, a syndicate in which he was interested, together with a Danish and an Australian syndicate, should combine, the Commonwealth Government holding a preponderance of the shares, and that together they should run the mandated territory as a trading concern. He was certain that if that were done, the net return would be from 15 to 20 per cent. on the capital invested. That shows what he, as one of the original land-owners in that territory, thought of its possibilities if it were properly handled. It was put to me then that if Germany joined the League of Nations it would certainly request the return of the mandated territory of New Guinea. Only a few weeks ago we noticed in the press that this question had again come to the fore. Just as we have no right to hold Australia as a white labour country unless we use and fill it, we are not entitled to hold the mandated territory of New Guinea unless we use it. We certainly cannot fill that territory with white people, but we can use it by encouraging the investment of capital from the southern portions of Australia in the growing of products we need. The proposed bounty represents a step in the right direction, and the sooner we proceed to encourage development there the stronger will be our argument, when Germany enters the League of Nations, for the retention by Australia of that territory. I congratulate the Government upon bringing in the bill, and am glad that honorable members on both sides of the House support it.","Second Reading","PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

While I realize that the bill is intended, and wisely so, to extend help to the industries established in that territory, I call attention to one obvious handicap put upon it. Efforts are continually being made to deflect the trade from the northern ports of Australia to those in the south.

81,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FORDE, Francis Michael","F4U","N/A","N/A","N/A",534,"- More than one holds that opinion. The Minister for Works and Railways (Mr. Hill) is reported in Hansard to have stated, on the 2nd April, 1924, that he would remove the sugar embargo, and do away with Arbitration Courts and high tariffs. I do not intend to allow statements of that nature to go unchallenged, and I am surprised that the honorable member for Herbert did not take the honorable member for Forrest to task. It would be suicidal of the Government to be induced by the alleged Country party representatives to abolish the embargo . on the introduction of black-grown sugar. But for that embargo, the sugar industry in Queensland would decline, and there would be hundreds of thousands of unemployed throughout the Commonwealth. No honorable members on the Labour side subscribe to such a policy.. I have visited the mandated territory of New Guinea, and I am as sympathetic towards its development as any honorable member. Therefore, I support the bill, and share the view advanced by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Charlton) that an amendment should be introduced to prevent manufacturers in New Guinea or Papua from importing raw material from other countries and utilizing black labour in the territory for the manufacture of articles to be sent to Australia to compete with goods produced here. What the alleged representatives of the Country party desire is to wipe out the tariff and the embargo on sugar, and allow hundreds of thousands of niggers to be employed in growing sugar in the islands to the detriment of Australia. That would mean ruin to towns in Queensland such as Cairns, Mackay, and Bundaberg. It affords only further evidence of the inconsistent views held by some honorable members who are supporting this composite Ministry. If it had not been for the consistent fight by the Queensland Labour Government and Labour representatives on this side of the chamber, the sugar-growers in Australia would not be enjoying the protection that they have to-day.","Second Reading","PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

He always insists on the carrying out of those promises so far asWestern Australia, South Australia, and Tasmania, are concerned; but he takes a different attitude with regard to the rights of Queensland. It shows that if he were in power no respect would be paid by him to the agreement entered into upon the inception of federation. I am sorry that the honorable member for Capricornia (Mr. Forde) has spoken in the strain that he has. It was gross misrepresentation to say that honorable members on this side had any sympathy with the remarks of the honorable member for Forrest. The majority of honorable members from this side of the House have proved in years gone by that they are in favour of giving the Australian sugar industry fair support. It was not Labour members, but Nationalists, who placed that industry in its present satisfactory position.

Honorable members must admit that if we interfered with the sugar industry we should strike a severe blow at the White Australia policy.

A pinhole sometimes shows the light. We heard to-day an influential member of the Country party strongly advising the Government to take steps to have the Territories of Papua and New Guinea further developed by the growth of sugarcane, which would compete with the Australian-grown product. As a Queensland representative, I feel somewhat apprehensive. Bills that have been introduced in the last few days have clearly shown that the Government is favorable to the employment of black labour. Recently the Nationalist caucus had an acquisition to its ranks in the person of Senator Barwell, who, on one occasion, said that north of an imaginary line, which would come out on the eastern coast, near Rockhampton. Australia could be better developed by black labour. The majority of the big sugar belts in Queensland are north of Rockhampton, and I am wondering whether feelers are being thrown out to gauge the opinions of honorable members regarding Senator Barwells suggestions. Probably some great interests, such as the Colonial Sugar Refining Company or big sugar milling companies, desire to start sugar-growing in the mandated territory of New Guinea, where they can obtain labour for about 6d. a day. Senator Barwell, on the occasion to which I have referred, said,  I am prepared to say what thousands of Liberals throughout Australia think, but have not the courage to say. The honorable member for Franklin (Mr. Seabrook) represents in this chamber the interests of Sir Henry Jones.The ACTING CHAIRMAN (Mr. Prowse). - The honorable member must confine himself to the clause.","Second Reading","PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The honorable member for Wide Bay (Mr. Corser) said that  one swallow does not make a summer, and that I should not blame the Government because of the utterances of the honorable member for Forrest. That honorable member is not the only one who is opposed to the sugar industry. The honorable member for Franklin, on the 7th May, 1924, made an even more startling statement than that which was made this morning by the honorable member for Forrest. He then said -I ask whether we are really getting sugar at the worlds parity.

The honorable member bows every hour of. the day to the god of cheapness. I do not speak against coloured people as such, because I recognize that they have the same right to live as white men. But if in giving employment I am in a position to choose between a white man and a coloured man, I shall always choose the white man. We often glory in the triumphs of our soldiers, and of the sailors who manned our naval vessels in the great war. But we should remember that the men of the mercantile marine played a most important part in it. When the war broke out the British Government demanded that all foreigners and coloured men should leave British boats, because it recognized that the mercantile marine would have most important duties to perform. During the war 15,000 men of Britains mercantile fleet lost their lives, and 7,000,000 tons of shipping was sent to the bottom of the sea. Australia is an island continent, and if there is one thing which, more than another, we should take into earnest consideration, it is the establishment here of an efficient mercantile marine. We cannot establish it if we permit coloured crews to take part in our Australian trade.

We have ample evidence of that in the fact that the right honorable member for North Sydney (Mr. Hughes), after delivering a speech in favour of the amendment, was next day placed across his knees by the Prime Minister (Mr. Bruce), and given a good caning, and was compelled to recant. If the right honorable member could in that way be compelled to change his views, we can easily understand that weaker men on the other side will readily respond to the crack of the party whip. It is just possible that the honorable member for New England (Mr. Thompson) may stick to his guns, and vote with the Labour party on the amendment. If they have not already done so, I should recommend honorable members opposite to read a book I have here by Sir Leo Chiozza Money, in which reference is made to the part played in the war by Britains mercantile fleet.

In his generosity he might also have warned the House about the standard of that output. I have listened with considerable attention and no little pleasure to the speeches upon this bill, and, whilst most honorable members opposite side-stepped the issue with which the measure deals, their remarks, nevertheless, had the merit of being amusing. I congratulate the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Pratten) upon his introduction of the Bill, which represents an earnest desire on the part of the Government to do something for what has been hitherto the Cinderella State of the Commonwealth. I discern in the bill, also, a means of partial relief for portions of Queensland from the inconvenience and distress which sometimes develop, under the present industrial conditions. The assurance given by the Prime Minister will free honorable members of any anxiety as to how the provisions of the Bill may be applied. When the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Charlton) spoke on the second reading, he, apparently, had not been so carefully tutored as were some of his followers who spoke later. Possibly because he knew the depressing tendency of his speech, he essayed to become humorous, and stated that he had in mind the establishment of a Commonwealth service to meet the exigencies of Tasmania. He did not indicate how he would establish such a service. No doubt it would be fashioned after those highly successful State enterprises in Queensland, which, as experiments in the socialization of industry, have placed an overwhelming burden of taxation upon the people of that State.

So far as I can see, the Bill does not contravene the White Australia policy, to which honorable members on this side subscribe their allegiance in as sane and. practical a fashion as do honorable members opposite. We have been told that the conversion of some critics of the bill must have been the result of severe caning in the Ministerial party rooms. But it is significant that all the squealing comes from members of the Opposition. They have declared that, unless this amendment is adopted, the bill will set aside the White Australia policy; in other words, the defence of that principle consists in the preservation of the Seamens Union, the only organization of labour which advocates and canvasses for the inclusion of coloured workers in its ranks. But is any union the final arbiter of the destinies of a White Australia? Most decidedly not! Are not the primary producers, and those Tasmanian residents whose prosperity is partly dependent upon the tourist traffic, entitled to play a certain part in the fulfilment of- that policy? We have seen the conditions that apply to Tasmania operating in the north of Australia, and that experience strengthens our advocacy of this proposal, which is intended to give relief to Tasmania and other States under the stress of abnormal circumstances. I do not propose to discuss the question of sterilization which so thrilled the honorable member for Darling (Mr. Blakeley), but I suggest to him that the brief visits of black crews to our ports will not be as great a menace to Australias racial purity as will the attitude of the Seamens Union in welcoming coloured seamen into its ranks. As a subscriber to the White Australia policy, I welcome, this bill as a means of practical help to Tasmania and other parts of Australia in times of necessity.","N/A","NAVIGATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[3]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
116,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"GREEN, Albert","KF9","Kalgoorlie","ALP; FLP from 1931; ALP from 1936","N/A",540,". - I am surprised at the attitude of the honorable member for Herbert (Mr.Nott). If the majority of the people of Australia consulted only their own selfish interests, as the honorable member for Forrest (Mr. Prowse) does, they would sacrifice the White Australia principle, and allow coloured labour to be employed in the sugar industry of Queensland. In its adherence to -this ideal of racial purity the Commonwealth stands alone amongst the nations of the world, and because that policy is misunderstood abroad, because other nations, and even large numbers of people in the Motherland, are hostile to it, we should do nothing that would even remotely suggest that our allegiance to a great ideal is waning. What is the difference between permitting coloured men to be employed, on Australian vessels trading only between Australian ports and permitting them to work in our industries on shore? After all, it is only a matter of degree. The right honorable member for North Sydney (Mr. Hughes) yesterday, in trying to explain his attitude, said that for years we did not discover the fact that we were permitting apples to be carried from Tasmania by coloured crews, thereby inferring that that happening could to some extent be compared with the Government s intention to permit passengers to be carried to Tasmania on vessels similarly manned. The position is entirely different. I doubt if we could force oversea boats trading with Australia to carry other than their present crews, whether black or white. But we can say as a Commonwealth what men are to be employed in our interstate shipping, and what wages and conditions are to obtain. Our power over that trade is just as sovereign and complete as our power to determine what wages and conditions shall apply to our workers on the land. Even if our own kith and kin overseas do not quite understand the White Australia policy, at least we in this national assembly should stand four-square to it. Indeed, we shall be giving a gre.at deal away from the industrial point of view if this chamber permits Peninsular and Oriental vessels to carry passengers between, say, Sydney and Tasmania. I do not agree with the proposed method of assisting Tasmania, because there are other ways in which this can be done. To prevent any interference with the White Australia policy we should at least prohibit our intra-state trade boats from carrying black crews. This countrys future depends entirely upon the maintenance of the White Australia policy. I have been in China, Java, Central America, and the United States of America. The southern states of the United States of America furnish us with a most striking example of the inter-mixture of races, showing how careful we must be respecting the racial question. When walking along the streets of Vicksburg, over which city  flies the American flag, I encountered thirteen negroes to one white person. The fruits of the work of the colonists of the southern states are now entirely in the hands of the coloured people. They are not to blame, because that condition is the result of the slave system that was voluntarily entered into by British colonists. It was a short-sighted policy, and the consequent inter-mixture of races has caused a narrow class hatred the like of which will never exist in Australia so long as we keep intact the White Australia policy. Honorable members opposite have said that the bill, if passed, will not affect that policy, but we cannot be too careful. Tasmania will receive little benefit if we permit a few passengers to travel on Peninsular and Oriental steamers to and from that State. There are plenty of British boats manned by white seamen ready to help in our interstate trade, and I ask honorable members to stand behind the White Australia policy by accepting the amendment.","N/A","NAVIGATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If there were the slightest danger of the White Australia policy being jeopardised by this measure no honorable member on this side of the House would support it. The Prime Minister in his speech yesterday clarified the position. He pointed out that the bill would not in any way endanger the White Australia policy, and that we could not accept the proposed amendment, because its inclusion in the bill would be an impingement upon the right of British shipping companies to employ whatever crews they desired, and that only in cases of absolute emergency would the Government give effect to this legislation. Honorable members on the other side loudly criticized the measure as having some sinister design on the White Australia policy; but I could not help reflecting that, during the recent British seamens strike, they did not evince any alarm when black labour was employed in removing Australian products to oversea markets. While British ships were held up, there was no hesitation on the part of the Labour party, or its outside organizations, to facilitate the employment of all sorts of coloured labour - black, yellow, or brindle.","N/A","NAVIGATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In that case, there was more danger to the White Australia policy than there is in a bill of this description. A great deal of the opposition to this measure does not arise from a genuine fear that the White Australia policy will be adversely affected. Every measure that is brought down to this House, no matter how remote it may be from the suspicion of party complexion, is used for party purposes by honorable members opposite.","N/A","NAVIGATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[5]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The right honorable member for North Sydney (Mr. Hughes) and the honorable member for Lang (Sir Elliot Johnson), as well as the present speaker (Sir Littleton Groom), have always been proud of the Navigation Act, but now that a bill to amend it is before us we are told that the White Australia policy is not endangered. If that be so, why was it necessary in the original measure to legislate against the employment of coloured labour on vessels engaged in the Australian coastal trade ? It is generally agreed that the Navigation Act protects the Australian shipping industry against the employment of such labour. While I should like to see Tasmania relieved of her burdens, I cannot be a party to legislation which has for its object the employment of coloured crews in vessels calling there. We have been told by the Minister that of the 37 overseas ships about to visit Tasmania, 30 carry white crews.Mr.Pratten. - Of that number seventeen are cargo boats, the balance being one-class passenger boats.","N/A","NAVIGATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
123,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"RILEY, Edward","KYV","N/A","ALP","N/A",542,"- The Governments proposals will not cause any more ships to call at Tasmania, because the overseas shipping is in the hands of a huge combine controlled by Lord Inchcape. That combine was rendered necessary to protect British shipping against the keen competition of German vessels. The German Government granted subsidies to German shipping companies in respect of all trade derived from British colonies. The British combine to-day controls most of the overseas shipping of the world. Not only does it control the deep sea shipping on our coast, but it has also a controlling interest in the Australian interstate shipping companies. It is not likely that the passing of this legislation will affect the policy of that combine, which is out for profits. If the Tasmanian trade does not pay, ships controlled by that combine will not call at Hobart. The mere fact of this bill becoming law will not relieve Tasmania; any relief must come from the shipping companies. The Leader of the Opposition said that if he had the power he would institute a regular Commonwealth steamer service between Tasmania and the mainland. That would prove of direct benefit to Tasmania. The honorable member for Herbert (Dr. Nott), sneered at the idea of any government enterprise proving a success. As a new member of this Parliament, he, perhaps, is entitled to criticize the standard of debate in this chamber, and to lecture on the decorum which should be observed by honorable members. We shall see how he conducts himself as time goes on. I was grieved by the statements of the honorable members for Forrest (Mr. Prowse), Franklin (Mr.Seabrook) and Swan (Mr. Gregory), who said that they would be glad to see the Navigation Act repealed. Any one who remembers the conditions under which the seamen employed in the Australian coastal trade worked prior to the passing of that act, should hesitate before advocating its repeal. The Navigation Act has assured to Australian seamen a reasonable measure of comfort and cleanliness, particularly in regard to the places in which their meals may be provided. If it were repealed, those privileges would soon be withdrawn, because of the competition of foreign vessels. It has been said that fewer ships now trade with Tasmania than was the case some years ago. That is due to the general increase in the tonnage of ships. A few years ago vessels of 10,000 or 11,000 tons were considered large, but to-day the tendency is to provide vessels of 20,000 tons displacement for overseas trade. While it may be true that fewer ships are running, those ships are of a better class.","N/A","NAVIGATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[6]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

There is nothing in the bill about Tasmania, nor about the apple trade, or the various other excuses that have been advanced by Ministers for bringing the measure down.

As I pointed out in my previous remarks, the evidence given on behalf of the shipping companies before the royal commission on the Navigation Act was that they could not be expected to engage in the regular trade if they were to be prevented from taking the cream, of it. I contend that if the overseas companies are to be allowed to scout for the interstate trade, they should be. compelled to make some little contribution in return for that advantage, especially when the overseas vessels are said to be required, so far as the interstate trade is concerned, for a service only needed, in the words of the right honorable member for North Sydney, by the fastidious few. Although in this debate direct reference has been made only to Tasmania, it may be the intention at some future time to apply the bill to any and every part of the Commonwealth which the Government could be induced to regard as suffering from certain disabilities. On page 298 of the minutes of evidence of the royal commission there is a schedule submitted by the steamship companies having reference to the passenger traffic between Sydney and Hobart from the 6th December, 1922, to the 28th February, 1923. The steamers Zealandia and Riverina cannot be regarded as second rate vessels. They are sufficiently commodious to give satisfaction to persons who desire to travel such a short journey.

I admit that to be the case; and there will be similar occurrences even after this measure has been put into operation. The honorable member for Bass (Mr. Jackson) blamed the seamen for unloading black ships. If wharf labourers in future hold up vessels that are manned by black labour will they, under the provisions of the Crimes Act, be deported or imprisoned? I admit the holding up of passengers at different times; but no progress is ever made without a fight, and we shall not preserve our Navigation Act unless, by fighting, we let the public know that it is being whittled away by a brutal majority in this House that was returned to power on a tissue of falsehoods. I protest against this action of the Government. I hope that I have proved, from statistics, that the tourist traffic was not affected because oversea boats were not allowed to call at Tasmanian ports; but that, on the contrary, a greater amount of accommodation was available than was required. If I had the time I could quote statistics in regard to cargo, which would tell a story similar to that told in regard to the passenger service. Those honorable members who are in doubt regarding the passenger and cargo service that is offering in relation to Tasmania should read the evidence of witnesses who are acquainted with the position. When the ex-Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) was appealed to a few years ago he said that this action could not be taken constitutionally. He is now supporting the very action that he at that time said would be unconstitutional.

I wish to tell honorable members that, in my opinion, there was great significance in the last division, which was revealed chiefly by the enlightenment on the purpose of the bill given by the persistent question with which the honorable member for Fawkner (Mr. Maxwell) interrupted the speech of the honorable member for Adelaide (Mr. Yates). The Government might have been frank when it introduced this bill, and have told honorable members what the real purpose of the measure is. That is what it did not do. We learn now that the real purpose of the measure is to enable the Peninsular and Oriental and other oversea boats to be used as strike breakers. I confess that I was somewhat slow in waiting up to that. We have been discussing the bill in the belief that, it represented an honest endeavour on the part of the Government to deal with norma] shortages in coastal shipping. It is really a. strike-breaking proposition. Whether the Government is or is not entitled to exempt oversea vessels from certain provisions of the Navigation Act for the purpose of breaking a strike affecting shipping between the mainland and Tasmania is a question the merits of which I shall not go into at this stage. From its point of view the Government may feel itself justified in such action. The honorable member for Adelaide demonstrated by the evidence presented to the Navigation Commission that there is no need for this measure, because every month of the last year for which evidence was available to the commission, space was available on boats going to Tasmania; The honorable member was persistently interrupted by the honorable member for Fawkner with the question,   Can you say that no occasions  will arise when there will be no boat travelling between the mainland and Tasmania? Then the honorable member for Adelaide, at the same time as myself, woke up to what is really behind this measure. .

It has been admitted by honorable members opposite that the racial aspect of that policy is not affected by this bill. I assert definitely that this bill will help Australia economically. Let me say that during the tourist season certain steamers* are scheduled to call at Hobart to take oversea cargoes from Tasmania. Whether they carry passengers to Tasmania or not they will complete their itinerary. Whether they are manned by white or coloured crews will not alter that itinerary. This bill provides that these vessels may be allowed to take tourists to Tasmania, and thereby, in my opinion, divert some special passenger traffic that now goes abroad.

It was found to be of excellent flavour and well graded as to size and colour, and the syrup strength was satisfactory. In. no tin was any green, mushy, discoloured, or over-ripe fruit seen, and the members of the Board of Trade are at a loss to understand the reasons for the complaints that have been made.

For instance, Mr. Frank Clarke, M.L.C., made serious charges, by which he cast a slur upon the departmental officers who control the exports from this country. Those charges, if true, are very serious ; if not true, those upon whom the slur is cast should be protected. I am not sure whether the Minister has said that he would investigate those charges, but I am under the impression that the matter came up a few days ago in a question on the notice-paper. The charges made by Mr. Frank Clarke - and he, no doubt, is prepared to accept responsibility for making them - were to the effect that exporters, by bribing the Customs officers, were able to send out of this country fruit considerably below export standard, the sale of which would greatly injure Australias good name abroad. If this has happened - and I hope that it has not - it is a serious thing for Australia. But, if the charge is . untrue, steps should immediately be taken to clear the names of the Customs officers against whom allegations have been made.
