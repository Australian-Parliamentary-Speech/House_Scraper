I would like to see some more accurate description of the ground upon which soldiers may be entitled to pensions and benefits. Every honorable member must have received scores of refusals from the Department to deal with cases of merit merely because the injury to the party concerned was stated not to have resulted from warlike operations. With respect to this Bill, while the phraseology is a little different from that in the original Act, it appears that the interpretations of the officials will be much the same. There are many men who were accepted for service abroad, and who were apparently in fit condition. Under the strain of war service, however, disabilities developed, and, upon their return to Australia, they were unable to earn a living, or to earn as good a living as before their departure for the Front. In stating their case for relief, they are now met by the medical report that the injury or complaint which has developed is not due to warlike operations. The wording of the clause before us seems to make it much more difficult for them to obtain relief.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS REPATRIATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The wording of the clause is expressly intended to cover occurrences not necessarily in connexion with warlike operations. It really extends the provision in the Act. It will enable a pension to be granted in cases which the Act does not cover.

The Pensions Department declined to give him any pension, on the ground that he had suffered from rheumatism before enlisting. That was an administrative act, and I do not see how we can make the Statute clearer, because the determining factor in every case must be the Board; but in this instance I had to do that to which I always take particular objection- I had to bring the matter under the attention, of the Pensions Department, and point out that surely the., mans incapacity must have resulted from his employment in connexion with warlike operations.

His widow was not able to obtain any relief from the Repatriation Board. Soldiers should not be put in the position of having to secure the services of members of Parliament to voice their claims for pensions. I know that quite a number of them are quite able to push their own claims, but others are more diffident, and we ought not to allow them to suffer on that account.

I think the Government should assume responsibility for any injury which is suffered by a soldier through having enlisted, and that the competent Board which has power to investigate all cases should he able to deal with them on their merits. The clause as it stands does not cover the numerous cases of men who have been turned adrift unable to earn a livelihood, and whose applications for assistance are refused because the medical officers have determined that before enlistment they were suffering from the various diseases and affections which now incapacitate them. Thus these men are placed in a position entirely different from that which they would have occupied had they not gone to the Front, because it is undoubted that their diseases or affections have been aggravated by their service in the Australian Imperial Force. Every honorable member has met dozens of such cases which are not due to any specific happening during the period of employment in the Australian Imperial Force, but have been aggravated owing to the worry and strain of their service, or to shell shock occurring during their employment in the Forces. At present we are helpless to deal with such cases. I have not heard any one attempt to set up a claim that we should not regard the aggravation of complaints which results in reduced efficiency as being on the same basis as accidents that occur during the time of a soldiers service at the Front. Yet these cases are not covered either by the provision in the Act or by the wording of the clause now before us. We ought to clothe the Board with the fullest power to deal equitably with every case on its merits; but with the limitations imposed by the provision in the Act or by the clause before us, they will not be in a position to do so. My amendment would leave it open for relief to be granted in regard to everything that happened to a soldier during the course of his employment in the Forces. A man may have gone away apparently well, having had no difficulty in passing the medical examination, but because of the conditions under which he served, he may have returned inefficient and unable to do the work he did previously. My amendment would enable relief to be given to such a man. It cannot be given to him under the clause as it stands.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS REPATRIATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I am not pronouncing judgment upon the honorable members case; I simply point out that it is merely a question of the application of the principle to the facts.

Under the wording of his proposed amendment it would be necessary for an applicant for a pension to prove that his incapacity was the result of his employment in the service; that is to say, he would have to prove that he was employed to do a certain act, and that in the performance of that duty he suffered a casualty. The wording of paragraph a of clause 26 is much wider, and is intended to meet cases of the kind that have been brought under notice. There was a ease in Queensland where a man, while on leave,, met with an accident which incapacitated him. Such a case would come within the meaning of this clause, since the casualty would be  an occurrence happening during the period in which he was a member of the Forces. We are going a long way towards meeting many of the cases to which reference has been made. There must be some one to determine the facts, and the Board will simply have to decide whether death or incapacity in fact resulted from an occurrence which happened during the period of the mans employment in the Forces. The clause does not speak of incapacity sustained while acting in pursuance of a military order, but is much wider, since it covers occurrences happening to a man while a member of the Forces.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS REPATRIATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[8]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Defence Department foolishly rejected an offer made by Dr. OHara to place at the disposal of the medical officers examining volunteers in Melbourne his consulting rooms, where they could have been examined under the best conditions. As it was, the men were examined at the Town Hall, and the noise caused by passing trams made it very hard to listen to heart and lung sounds. Two men from the Hospital for Incurables here actually volunteered, and were passed for active service, and in face of that fact the Government are wise in trying to secure that justice shall be done, while at the same time protecting themselves from unreasonable claims. It was very unwise for the Government to make a grant of £4,500 to the dependants of a certain officer, since it raises in the minds of the public a suspicion that those in high positions, with influence to aid them, can obtain what those in more lowly positions are unable tosecure.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS REPATRIATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[11]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Whether a man had the germ of a disease or not when he enlisted, if that disease developed while he was a member of the Forces, his case should come within this clause. I am prepared to admit, with the honorable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney), that it is quite possible that, owing to the difficult circumstances in which the examinations were made, in some instances men were passed who ought not to have been accepted for service. In dealing with thousands of cases, the doctors, no matter how efficient they might have been, were bound, on the law of average, to pass some who should have been rejected. Long before he enlisted, a man might have had in his constitution the germ of a disease, or might have had some slight complaint which did not interfere with his industrial efficiency. Under active service conditions that disease might have been aggravated. The wonder to me is that every Australian soldier who spent any time in Europe did not come back troubled with rheumatism. Is the Board administering the Department to callously shelter itself behind the paltry excuse that a man is disentitled to a pension because, although crippled with rheumatism on his return from the war, he had the germ of the disease in his constitution when he volunteered?

It throws upon each Board the onus of inquiring, not merely into a mans war service at the Front, but clearly also into his condition of health before he went to the Front. That opens a very wide field for investigation ; and, as there will be six separate Boards making investigations, and probably coming to decisions not in consonance with one another, we may expect a crop of injustices to result. There is an immense difficulty once you begin to make limitations as to who shall -benefit and who shall be excluded from benefits, and it would almost pay this country to throw the door wide open and allow everybody who can prove incapacity within a certain period of the close of the war to share the benefits of this legislation. Otherwise we shall have some men receiving benefits under the law who, perhaps, are jot as much entitled to them as are men who have been excluded. It is not as if there was to be one body dealing with all the cases. There will be six Boards or Commissions, and the common experience of those accustomed to juries is that a verdict given by one set of men would be scouted by another set. Different bodies of men look at things from different angles, and draw different conclusions from the same facts. The Government would, therefore, be wise to withdraw the clause for further consideration, because as it stands it will undoubtedly lead to an immense amount of trouble and; which is worse, work out unjustly.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS REPATRIATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[13]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The men who volunteered for the Front had to submit to medical examination. They were passed by medical men as fit for active service. _ In some cases, they were on active service for four years or more. They come back, and ask for certain benefits under Acts that we have passed; and then it is discovered, under medical examination, that they have some constitutional defect which, the doctors say, originated prior to their enlistment. Because of that, they or their dependants are not to be entitled to the benefits of this measure. That is a most cruel way to deal with men who have served just as faithfully and well as have any others. In the medical and other professions, differences of opinion arise, and it is not easy to assign an actual date to the beginning of a disease in the human body. Medical testimony will be found equally divided in many cases as to whether the trouble originated in the pre-war period or during the war.

Under the principal Act, the pension was assessed upon the average earnings of the soldier during the twelve months prior to his going to the Front. Many boys of eighteen enlisted, whose earnings prior to enlistment were probably nil. Applications were made by the mothers of those boys who were killed at the Front. The applicants were told that, as in many instances the boys had earned nothing during the year prior to enlistment, only the minimum pension of 7s. per week could be granted. When those boys went to the Front, they did mens work. I know an instance of a boy who enlisted on his eighteenth birthday, was four years at the Front, and was killed. When his mother applied for a pension, she was asked what his average earnings were in the year before he went away. As he had been at school, she had to tell them that his earnings were nil. I have not been able to read this Bill carefully, and do not know whether a similar provision is contained in it. I cannot find anything of that nature in it, but we must make it absolutely clear that the same pension must be paid in the case of every boy who went into the firing-line as is paid in the case of a man. The provision to which I refer was one of the greatest anomalies in the old Act, and I sincerely hope it will not be perpetuated in this Bill.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS REPATRIATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[15]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In one case, two young fellows before going to the Front had had some experience in engineering, and when they returned after some years fighting they started a motor engineers business in partnership. They are careful, steady men; but when they applied for assistance, the answer they received was to the effect that it was not within the scope of the regulations, on the ground that, prior to enlisting, they had not owned and conducted a similar business. It is true that, before enlisting, they were not in business for themselves, but were learning as paid employees. Why should young soldiers who are enterprising enough to start business, but who have not sufficient money to provide all the necessary tools, be debarred from advantages enjoyed by other members of the Forces? In another case, two young fellows, before enlisting, had been engaged on a newspaper for years, and the owner of the paper has stated that if they had not gone to the war they would have been made partners. Since their return to Australia, these young men have been offered, by a sleeping partner, an interest in this newspaper. The matter was brought before a member of the Cabinet, who told me that the men would be able to get assistance; and on that assurance they purchased the interest offered. For any advances made, they are prepared to give the full security of this interest, and also their gratuities; but they are informed that, under the existing Act and regulations, assistance cannot be given them.I should like to know whether if this Bill passes, there will be vested in the Commission power to give assistance in cases of this kind; if not, it is my intention to move an amendment.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS REPATRIATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[25]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

There is no doubt that under the present Act there are cases of very grievous harship. Men desire to be established in the businesses which they would have been following if they had not gone to the war, but under the present Act are unable to get the assistance necessary to enable them to do so. Many men who previously worked for their fathers or others in a variety of businesses would by this time have been partners had they not enlisted ; but simply because they were not actually established in the businesses before they enlisted they are refused the benefits of the Act. I am glad to hear that the Commission and the Boards will be enabled to take a wider view in the administration of the Act, the whole spirit of which is more generous than that of the old Act. According to this clause, the Commission is given power to make recommendatons for the granting of assistance to - the incapacitated fathers of deceased or incapacitated Australian soldiers who were, prior to the enlistment of the soldier, dependent upon them.It seems to me that unless this provision is very widely administered it will fall far short of what is desired. I am prepared to admit that to strike out the words  who were prior to the enlistment of those soldiers dependent upon them  might lead to some cases of imposition, but I draw attention to the limitation imposed by the words.  There are cases such as that mentioned by the honorable member for Perth (Mr. Fowler) a few moments ago, and his remarks apply not only to mothers, but to fathers. I think that an incapacitated father, although he may not have been dependent on the soldier before enlistment, ought in certain circumstances to come within the scheme, and the Government ought to make certain that such cases will be met.Amendment agreed to.Amendments (by Mr. Poynton) agreed to -That the words in sub-paragraph iii(a)  widows and were, prior to the enlistment of those soldiers, dependent upon them, be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof  either widowed, divorced, or deserted.That the word  and  in sub-paragraph iv. be left out; that the words  or step-mothers, in sub-paragraph v., be left out; that the following new sub-paragraph be inserted : - and (vi.) any person who was, prior to the death of an Australian soldier, recognised as his wife, although not legally married to him.Clause, as amended, agreed to.Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.Clause 48 amended to read as follows, and agreed to: -The Commission may appoint Local Committees within a State or Territory.The persons to be appointed as members of a Local Committee shall be selected in the prescribed manner.Subject to the regulations, a Local Committee shall have power to raise and control funds for the district for which they are appointed, and to disburse those funds within that district for the granting of assistance and benefits to any of the classes of persons specified in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of the last preceding section, or to any relative or person not specified in paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) of that section who was dependent upon any deceased or discharged Australian soldier prior to his enlistment, or for any other purpose prescribed by the regulations.A Local Committee shall have such other powers as are prescribed. 4a.

193,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"WEST, John Edward","KZA","East Sydney","N/A","N/A",1503,".- I have on more than one occasion brought before honorable members the need for the more thorough auditing of public accounts. Under the Bill as it stands, the auditing of the accounts of the Local Committees may be done by some person not under the control of the Auditor-General. In my opinion, that officer is the sole authority . who can properly satisfy Parliament and the country of the correctness of public and quasi-public accounts. As one who a few years ago took a great part in forcing the Government to be more particular in requiring the auditing of the accounts by the Auditor-Generals Department, I suggest that in this clause the words  as prescribed should be left out, and the words by the Auditor-General substituted for them. I do not wish to say anything about discrepancies that have occurred in the past in connexion with war funds. The Committee is aware that the auditing of the Wool Committees accounts is done by a person who is not under the Auditor-General. I have nothing to say against outside auditors, but the accounts of that Committee and of all similar bodies should be audited by the Auditor-Generals Department. I have positive evidence that some of the outside auditors have not been as careful as they might have been. Had all the accounts of the kind I have in mind been subject to audit by the Auditor-General, many improper transactions would not have continued as long as they did, because under the Audit Act there would have been a constant supervision, whereas actually the auditing was done when accounts were being closed, or upon an annual statement. Nothing can be better than the prevention of crime, and the Minister in charge of a Department, who cannot be supposed to over-! look every detail of administration, has a guarantee, when provision is made for the auditing of accounts by the Auditor-General, that the money which he obtains from the Treasurer will not be wasted. Parliament should be very jealous for the proper accounting for moneys expended at its direction. The magnitude of our expenditure is in itself a special reason for very careful auditing, and the Auditor-General should control the auditing of all accounts of Government expenditure. After all, the purpose of the audit is to satisfy the Government that the accounts of these Committees are properly kept, and the moneys handled by them devoted to the proper purpose.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS REPATRIATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[28]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Hill) is to make provision for those men who, prior to the war, were not engaged in farming or in some business calling. A man who was a farmer before the war is placed on the land on his return; the man who was in a small business before he went to the war is placed in business again on his return, and the man who wielded a pick and shovel before he went overseas is given a pick and shovel on his return. The farm labourer who worked for a weekly wage is, on his return, put on the land, and placed in a position to become his own employer, but what is done for the man who, before enlisting, worked for a saw-miller for a weekly wage? He is sent back to the sawmill under the old boss who was having a comfortable time while his employee was away fighting. In his remarks, the Minister (Mr. Poynton), as is often done by honorable gentlemen on the front bench, dealt with details, getting quite away from the vital principle at issue. We admit that there are obstacles in the way of the adoption of our proposal, but we are quite prepared to agree to any safeguard the Minister may think fit.These returned men should be given an opportunity, and I shall give an illustration of what I mean. When I was in the country the other day, I was in conversation with a number of men wearing military badges who were working at a saw-mill at a railway siding. They were engaged by an employer at a weekly wage, and I asked them whether, if provision were made for an advance from the Repatriation Department to enable them to purchase an engine, a bench and a few drays, they could not run a plant of their own. They replied emphatically in the affirmative, and said they would be only too glad to undertake the work on their own account if they could obtain the necessary capital. It is to cover such cases as this that we are endeavouring to incorporate this amendment in the Bill. We do not desire the measure to be amended in such a way that any one could come along and ask for an advance to launch some wildcat scheme, and we are quite agreeable to accept any reasonable safeguards. The bulk of the men . in the Australian Imperial Force before they went to the war were working for others. What have the Government done for the bulk of them? That is a question I desire the Government to consider, and I also appeal very strongly to those honorable members in this Chamber who are wearing military badges to support this reasonable proposition.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS REPATRIATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[35]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The proposal in the amendment is confined to cooperative businesses, which, after all, are voluntary associations of men carrying on industries for the benefit of themselves and the whole community. It is to be regretted that the co-operative system has not become more widely established in Australia. Objections may be raised to this proposal, and although the amendment may not be in the form the Government desire, the principle is a perfectly sound one. Criticisms have been made concerning the Repatriation Department or the administration of the Act, because proper (provision has not been made to advance money to soldiers who desire to start in business. Although many of the men who went to the Front were employees before they left Australia, as stated by the honorable member for Wimmera (Mr. Stewart), there are many who would by now have been in business on their own account if they had not gone abroad in the interests of Empire.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS REPATRIATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[36]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I am glad that this amendment has been moved by the honorable member for Echuca.

It is. simply, a. scheme to enable returned soldiers in certain, districts to combine so that they will secure the same help that is given to those who go on the land. Every man will then have a chance of entering into some concern that will be of advantage to himself: The honorable member- for Indi (Mr. Robert Cook) referred to what is being done in the way of vocational training at Wirths Park. Very fine work is being done there, simply to enable these men to become servants of other men-. We want to make them masters, not servants. I am surprised at. the attitude of the honorable member for Wakefield (Mr.- Foster), who waxed very eloquent on behalf of vested interests1. If these men- are given- an opportunity they will form themselves- into little companies, which will be an absolute success; The Government never had a better opportunity than -the present, to enter into this undertaking in- the- proper spirit. Little groups- of men trained at Wirths Park could be given contracts for some of the houses being built to-day. They are actually building those houses, but are only getting wages- out of them, while somebody else is reaping- the profits. There are scores of saw-mill hands working in forest areas who only need to be advanced about £250 each, instead of the £2,500 advanced in other cases, and then the Government can let them as many contracts as they like to cut timber for the housing scheme. That decidedly should be done. The men are absolutely efficient, and know the job of saw-milling quite as well as the men who run the mills. These are some of the small schemes which this measure should be passed to promote. We should give returned men facilities to establish manufacturing undertakings in some of the decadent mining towns, and by that means the whole of the. existing housing problem could be solved. The houses I looked at the other day are costing about £700 each. The Government could obtain houses equal to them for half, or even a quarter, of the money in some of the mining districts. Those centres are admirably suited for small co-operative companies run by returned soldiers. I hope . the Government will see to these things, which are necessary in the interests of the men who cannot possibly go on the land. Tie honorable member for Wakefield spoke of the men on the land.

It is dangerous to compel the men to be discharged from the sanatorium. I understand that if the pension is paid to men while they are inmates of an institution, the bulk of it is retained by the institution. In Victoria, the Department has adopted a very bad policy by sending the men who were at Mont Park, where tubercular cases were treated, to the Austin Hospital for Incurables, and placing them in the Kronheimer wing, which is the finest part of the institution. It is bad for the soldiers to be kept amongst incurables, and the policy is bad for the people, because it prevents other incurables from obtaining admission. The hardships experienced overseas caused many of our men to develop tubercular troubles, and I believe in doing everything possible to help them. I approve of paying the pension to them, but I do not like the provision that they shall not get it until they are discharged from the institution. It is better for them to be in a sanatorium, because they have a better chance of recovery, and are not so much a menace to the community.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS REPATRIATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[44]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The object I have in view is to enable tubercular patients who are not able to work to get the same attention as they would be able to get if they were living at home amongst their own people, if in the opinion of the medical officer of the institution there was no special danger to the community in allowing them to return to their homes. The reason for the provision that patients must remain in an institution for six months is that in that period they may learn how to avoid spreading contagion to others. I am assured by the Medical Superintendent that it is quite safe for these patients to mix with other people so long as they have been properly trained to look after themselves. At any rate, whether or not there is a danger in what is proposed, the present position is that the man who has money may go to his home, whilst the man dependent upon the low rate of pension at present paid has to remain in the institution, and in his own judgment has not the same chance to recover as he would have if he could join his own people in his home.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS REPATRIATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[45]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The present Pensions Department has already done three-fourths of this work, and has done it exceedingly well. The only reason which the Minister has assigned in favour of the creation of a new Department is that it will effect economy in the matter of time. From my stand-point, it will have precisely the opposite result. It is proposed to take from a Department which has all the necessary machinery at its disposal work which it is now performing, and to give it to a Department which has no machinery whatever.

The newspapers tell us. every clay- that men. have returned from the war physically wrecked and mentally deficient. I cannot speak of other States, but in Queensland there is no place to which these men can be sent, in order that they may be restored to health and made the reputable citizens many of them were before they left for the Front. Many of them are drinking about the big cities, .and I should like the Repatriation Department to provide an asylum to which they can be committed, instead of permitting them, as at present, to bc sent to gaol. It is the wish of. every honorable member; and of all the people of Australia, to do the right thing by these men. It grieves me to think that soldiers, who. have made this country safe for. us all-- and but for whose services things might have been very different to-day-- should, in their broken state, be sent to gaol. The police magistrate in Brisbane was very pained when I pleaded for a man who, after four years fighting, had been arrested as a vagrant. He said,  There is nowhere else for me to send- this, man but to gaol. Of course, the man was down and out. He was .covered with vermin, and a complete human wreck. It behoves us to do what we can for .these men. I know that those at the head of the Repatriation administration, both in the States and in the Central Department, are < sympathetic, and I appeal to them to.. get to work as early as they can, to save this human wreckage, and, if possible, bring it back to normal civil life. If these men could be sent to a military hostel, where they would enjoy a certain amount of freedom, but be kept from the cursed drink, some of them. would be reclaimed, and .if only 5 per cent, of them were thus saved, it would be a good thing for them and for the country.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS REPATRIATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[52]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
