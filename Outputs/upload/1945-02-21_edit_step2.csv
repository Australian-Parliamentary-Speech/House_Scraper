I was not a member of the House during the period that he occupied a seat, consequently I had not personally made his acquaintance; but I know of his work, and of the high personal esteem in which he was held by his fellow members.It was, however, more particularly in the sphere of local government that Mr. Dennis gave outstanding service. He was for 36 years a member of the Northcote Council, and twice during that period occupied the position of mayor. He represented the council on the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works for many years, and acted as vicechairman of the board. He was also closely associated with church and sporting club organizations, and his loss will be severely felt throughout the district in which he resided. Our sympathy goes out to the widow and family of one who has left behind a valuable record of public service. I move -That this House records itssincere regret at the death of Mr. Samuel Dennis, a former member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Batman, places on record its appreciation of his meritorious public service and tendersits deep sympathy to his widow and the members of his family in their bereavement.","N/A","DEATH OF MR.

As the Prime Minister (Mr. Curtin) has pointed out, the great bulk of a long period of public service rendered by the late gentleman was rendered in municipal politics; though he was in this House for a period of three years. In addition to his work in municipal affairs, he was a man with very close and a variety of interests in church work, and in sporting bodies. Ina dozen ways he showed himself to be a good citizen. He is, perhaps, one of many proofs which we have had in Australia, that the foundation of a healthy public life is healthy, disinterested, honest local government. He played his part in that respect, and left behind him, particularly in his own city, a record which any man might envy.Mr.FADDEN (Darling DownsLeader of the Australian Country party). -The Australian Country party associates itself with the sentiments that have been expressed, and the motion that has been moved and seconded.Question resolved in the affirmative, honorable members standing in their places.HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL.Mr. CURTIN(Fremantle - Prime Ministerand Minister for Defence). - I desire formally to announce that His Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester, accompanied by Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Gloucester and their two children, Prince William and Prince Richard, arrived in Australia on the 28th January,1945.His Royal Highness was sworn in as Governor-General and Commander-in-Chief in and over the Commonwealth of Australia,at Canberra, on the 30th January.MINISTERIAL CHANGES.Mr. CURTIN(Fremantle - PrimeMinisterand Minister for Defence). - I formally announce that, consequent on changes which have been effected in the organization of Commonwealth departments of State, the Ministry is now constituted as follows: -Prime Minister and Minister for Defence - The Right Honorable John Curtin.Minister for the Army (and Deputy Prime Minister)- The Right Honorable F.
