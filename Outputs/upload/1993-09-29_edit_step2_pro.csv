2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,"The Clerk",10001,"N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","—Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows:To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.We the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully submit that:The U.N. declaration on the elimination of all forms of intolerance and of discrimination based on Religion and Belief.(a)Denies the Freedom of Religion guaranteed in the Australian Constitution(b)Is designed to impede or oppose the Biblical life and ministry of the Christian Church(c)Is being introduced as law to bring changes to our nation that were rejected by the people in the last Referendum on the Constitution.We therefore ask the Senate to take all steps to have this Declaration disallowed from the HREOC Act 1986.And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.The petition of the undersigned citizens respectfully showeth:1. That the declaration by the Attorney-General, dated 8 February, 1993 of the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, made under subsection 47(1) of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986, be disallowed by members of the Senate.2. As the terms of the Declaration are vague and imprecise and its potential impact is unclear, (particularly in the area of the authority of parents over children) and3. That it is doubtful whether the Australian situation warrants the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission being given power with respect to religious freedom beyond those contained in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which is already incorporated into the HREOC Act.And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.The petition of the undersigned strongly oppose attempts by the Government to increase the level of the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) and to decrease the threshold at which graduates begin to repay their HECS debt.Wherefore, your petitioners, request that any further changes to the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) be referred to a committee that will assess the impact of fees and loans on higher education.To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.We the undersigned respectfully call upon the Federal Government to phase out aerial spraying in accordance with recommendation 89 of the report of the Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in Australia.To the Honourable President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The Petition of the undersigned shows:The legislation passed in December 1992 to count the increases in the value of shares held by pensioners as income, even if the shares are never sold to realise the gain:(1) Is unjust.(2) Has its most detrimental effect on pensioners with small holdings.(3) Only affects Australian Stock Exchange listed shares.(4) Discourages small scale investment in Australian companies.Your Petitioners request that the amendments in the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (no 3) 1992 relating to unrealised capital gains on shares should be repealed.And your Petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.The Commonwealth Threatened Species Bill recognises that Australia has the worse extinction record of native mammals of any country on Earth in recent history and that species extinctions are still occurring at an alarming rate.Your Petitioners ask that the Senate should support Commonwealth Threatened Species legislation which uses the full powers given to it by the Australian Constitution and which provides the necessary financial resources to halt the loss of species on this, the oldest continent on earth.And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.To the Honourable the President of the Senate and the Senators in Parliament assembled:The humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:That the Senate consider proposing amendments to the Child Care Act with regard to the current policy on Attendance Recordsbecause:The Attendance Records are impractical for Family Day Care services.Family Day Carers homes are not set up with separate office facilities, as Child Care Centres are.Children who are transported to and from school may require the parent or responsible person to sign four times each day for each child.Carers are responsible for making sure parents sign their children in and out each day.The issue of accountability is not addressed by the Attendance Records.We wish the Minister to look at proposed amendments. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Senate consider these amendments.And your Petitioners as in duty bound, will ever pray.To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia opposes the increase in excise of 7 cents per litre on leaded petrol and 5 cents per litre on unleaded petrol resulting from the Budget. This rise in petrol tax:1.discriminates against low income families and those living in rural areas2.increases business costs and will cause further unemployment3.adds further to the price of an already heavily taxed product4.breaks Mr Keatings election promise not to put up tax.And your petitioners therefore pray that the Senate oppose these increases in petrol excise.To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:We, the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully submit that:The United Nations declaration on the elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion and Belief:prohibits all forms of religious discrimination, thus potentially restricting the freedom of Australians to make any choices on the grounds of their belief;could lead to US-style prohibitions on public Christian prayers, Christmas carols, or nativity scenes;has the potential, according to the NSW Attorney-General, to restrict greatly the freedom of religious groups.and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child:gives wide rights to children in Articles 12-16, including the right to privacy and freedom of association;gives only the legally-weak term respect for the rights of parents in Article 5;could result in Government-assisted rebellion against parents who want to set limits for their children in their childrens best interests.Your petitioners therefore pray that the Senate will:Act to disallow these two international instruments from the HREOC Act.And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.To the Honourable, the President and the members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:We the undersigned call on the Senate to support the granting of a narrowcast broadcast licence, to allow Radio 6PRs talk back programs to continue broadcasting.We understand that the failure of the Minister to grant this licence will result in job losses and the cancellation of vital afternoon talk back programs.We believe that the Honourable Minister for Communications, Senator Bob Collins, should give his immediate and special consideration to the granting of a narrowcast licence to allow the vital role 6PR plays in Western Australia to continue.And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/petition.grp/proctext/interject/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

22,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator WATSON","VJ4","(Tasmania)","LP","N/A",1353,"—I wish to speak about a matter which a distinguished lawyer has raised with me. It concerns the response from Mr Dennis Rose QC, an eminent QC from the Attorney-Generals Department, which was made during a hearing before the Senate Select Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Mr Geoff Petersson became most concerned when a person of Mr Roses eminence passed what he saw as a slighting remark about his professional ability.I have raised this matter with Senator Cooney, who is the chairman of the committee. He tells me that the committee will be producing a report shortly, but cannot specify the exact date. It is right and proper that the record be put straight as soon as possible and I feel correction cannot await the uncertain date of the report. Accordingly, I now take steps to put the record straight for the benefit of Mr Petersson.I have a letter that was sent to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs relating to its reference on the constitutional validity of the provisions of the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993. The letter reads:At the hearing of the Committee in relation to the above reference on Thursday 9 September 1993, during the course of his giving evidence, Mr Dennis Rose may have, perhaps inadvertently, misled the Committee when referring to a submission to the Committee prepared by me on behalf of the Taxation Institute.At page 15 of the transcript Mr Rose is reported as saying:Mr Morris talked of the opinions that have been given and the opinions by Dr Howard and himself and Mr Petersson. I suppose one can regard that last one as the Taxation Institute opinion. I am not aware of Mr Petersson having any expertise in constitutional law. It may be that he does but I am not aware of it.I find it surprising that Mr Rose could have stated that he was not aware whether I had any expertise in constitutional law given that I have worked closely with Mr Rose over the 17 years in which I worked as a lawyer in the Attorney-Generals Department between 1972 and 1989. During that time I held various senior positions in the then Advisings Division (now Office of General Counsel) working within that Division in the Constitutional and Financial Branch, the Constitutional, Broadcasting and Administrative Branch, and the Constitutional and Electoral Branch. During that period I spent two years as Principal Legal Officer, Assistant to the Solicitor-General assisting in the preparation of cases and opinions, many involvingquestions of constitutional law. During the time I spent in the Advisings Division, Mr Rose held positions of Branch Head and Divisional Head. On more than one occasion, Mr Rose and I occupied adjacent offices.I think it is fair to say that by any measure I have had considerable experience in dealing with, and advising on constitutional law matters over a long period of time. Whether this experience may be said to give rise to expertise in constitutional law is another matter. However, Mr Roses response implies that he is unaware as to whether I have had experience in advising on constitutional issues. This is clearly not so.I would respectfully request that your Committees report should note my concern.Yours faithfully,Geoff PeterssonTechnical DirectorThat letter is from Mr Petersson of the Taxation Institute of Australia. I thank the Senate.","N/A","PRIVILEGE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

62,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CRANE","UW4","(Western Australia)","LP","N/A",1356,"—I rise to support Senator Panizzas motion to refer the operations of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, ATSIC, the Aboriginal Legal Service, ALS, and any other body, company or corporation which receives funding from ATSIC with particular regard to accountability, et cetera to the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. I will not read out the details of the motion.I support Senator Panizzas motion because of a number of things which have been brought to my attention with regard to ATSIC and which, I believe, need investigating from the point of view of the accountability and the management of that body. As Senator Panizza highlighted in his speech, a number of leaders in the Aboriginal communities in Western Australia also support this motion. I particularly refer to Robert Isaacs, a prominent Aboriginal in Western Australia, who also happens to be on the shire council of Gosnells.I want to highlight a couple of points here about the accountability, the spending, the functioning and the operations of ATSIC. The first issue brought to my attention—which, I am told, is fairly typical of what is happening in many instances—revolves around an effort by a group of Aboriginals to develop a business in a country town in Western Australia. I will not name that country town because people will know who I am speaking about and those individuals could be put under some unfair pressure.That group endeavoured to get assistance through ATSIC to purchase a tyre business in which they had worked for a number of years in conjunction with the owner, who wished to sell the business. After some 18 months of effort, toing-and-froing and not being able to get satisfactory answers as to what had happened to their application, how it was being accounted for and how it was being processed, finally, that particular operator had to sell the business.It seems to me to be not quite right that a group of Aboriginals, who were totally self-supporting but who needed some capital assistance to give themselves the opportunity to become commercially viable in their own business, was denied that assistance purely and simply because of the financial management and accountability processes within ATSIC. Even to this day, as far as I am aware, they have not received a satisfactory answer to their problem.The other points I wish to raise in this debate come from some documents which were given to me—or to use the commonly used term from the newspaper, were leaked to me—just last week. They refer to the operations of ATSIC in Western Australia. I find the issues I raise particularly despicable and disappointing.Western Australia has some 1,300 Aboriginal families currently seeking assistance to get into their own homes or to get a roof over their heads. These documents were presented at the meetings of ATSIC commissioners from 9 to 12 August 1993. We see in terms of community housing development that of the $48.6 million allocated to Western Australia for Aboriginal housing, only $40.8 million was spent. One must ask, when you have a situation where, as I said, there are some 1,300 Aboriginal families currently seeking to get their own homes or a roof over their heads, why $8 million was returned to the Commonwealth.I put on the public record that I believe that three most important things in dealing with Aboriginal problems or concerns that we have in this nation are housing, health and education. The first is housing. I think it is absolutely imperative that this particular aspect be addressed in a sensitive and fair manner and that it be done in such a way that it caters not only for the community Aboriginals who, basically, live in the north or central Australia, but also for regional Aboriginals and for those termed `fringe dwellers. I do not particularly like that term, but that is the term that is used consistently.It was recently reported that in Kalgoorlie one-third of the Aboriginals under the age of 40 had passed on in the last 18 to 20 months. We can see that this question of housing is, indeed, a very important one. It is something that I believe this committee could look at in terms of accountability, functions and expenditure, and in terms of why, when we have this serious situation in Western Australia, this money was returned to the Commonwealth.I have already mentioned the housing situation. In order of importance, the next matter is health. I believe that housing and health are linked inextricably together. Next on my list is education. These documents highlight that of the $11.7 million which was allocated for health in Western Australia, $700,000 was not spent. Substance abuse is another problem that, unfortunately, the Aboriginals have had to deal with. Some $1.4 million was spent in this area.On the other side of the coin are major Mabo bids. This document shows quite clearly the governments position as far as Aboriginals are concerned. The emphasis is not on the matters that I raised, which are very important and which Aboriginal people consistently bring before me and Senator Panizza and other colleagues of mine in Western Australia. This document says:The Government has decided that;the $10 million is to be removed from the Commissions global allocation in 1994-95 . . .It goes on to say something which I find absolutely disgraceful:Atsic may retain the $10 million as part of the Commissions contribution to the Mabo response IF:(a) the Ministers for Finance and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs can:(i) Define activities on which the funds can be spent; and(ii) provide for consultation prior to the expenditure of the funds between the Minister and ATSIC; and(b) the Commission accepts that Mabo expenditure within ATSICs budget would not be limited to the earmarked $10 million.I think this highlights very clearly the importance of this inquiry. First of all, we are seeing the government directing that $10 million be taken out of ATSICs global allocation, which could and would be spent on such things as housing, health and education, and holding a gun at its head, threatening, `Unless you spend the money this way, we will take it away from you. You will not get it. The government is hiding behind ATSIC and trying to make ATSIC the bad boy for what I believe in many instances to be the false expectations that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has built up around the Mabo decision. I emphasise that for the vast majority of Aboriginals there are far more important things than Mabo.I grew up in a country district and spent the whole of my primary school career attending a school at Bindi Bindi, where there were more Aboriginal children than there were children of European origin. I got to know Aboriginal people pretty darn well. They taught me a lot of things that today I feel very privileged to have learnt. Hopefully I taught them one or two things.I believe that this motion by Senator Panizza is not only important but crucial. It is not only Senator Panizza who is asking for this reference, supported by his colleagues; it is also many Aboriginal people who feel that they are being misled and thwarted by some of the things that have been happening.They cannot understand why in Western Australia, for example, as I have mentioned, when those 1,300 people want to get a home, a roof over their head, that $8 million is returned to the Commonwealth. They cannot understand why in terms of the operations of ATSIC—and I must say in its original format the only basis on which I personally supported it was that it would give Aboriginals some independence, a say in how they sorted out their destiny—we see the government through the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) saying, `Unless you spend this $10 million on Mabo related claims, burn it up with lawyers and in the legal processes—in most instances for little or no return—`we will take the money away from you.I support this reference very strongly and believe that this Senate needs to give it strong support. I move:That the debate be now adjourned.Question resolved in the affirmative.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1[2]/debate.sub2/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

67,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MARGETTS","DX5","(Western Australia)","GWA","N/A",1359,"—I thank the minister. Just to put my own thoughts in perspective, I will reiterate some of my opening remarks with regard to the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill 1993. The stated purpose of the original Development Allowance Authority Bill 1992 was unclear other than to encourage expenditure on the lease of new capital or the upgrading of existing capital in certain large enterprises. It must be remembered that the cost of imported capital has already decreased as a result of decreases in tariffs. Employment creation was obviously not a criterion.The Commonwealth legislation claimed that the allowances were for industries with an effective rate of assistance of less than 10 per cent. Up until 2 September 1993, 80 per cent of projects registered are in the manufacturing and mining sectors. To give honourable senators an idea of what the allowance was meant for, let me quote the One Nation statement:The Government wishes to build on this advantage and promote an early upturn in investment in new plant and equipment for projects which offer particular benefits for Australias competitiveness in world markets.The broad criteria intended to identify such projects relate to the absence of any substantial assistance or protection. This was mentioned in relation to the rate of assistance being less than 10 per cent. The broad criteria state:.positive facilitation by State and local governments in relation to such matters as project approval processes—For that read fast-tracking—and, where appropriate, the economic and efficient pricing of inputs under the control of public utilities and statutory marketing authorities. Where a need for similar or complementary action at the Commonwealth level is identified, it will be taken.employers and employees committing to management and industrial relations arrangements which promote the achievement of world best practice.How does this link with the states actually work? In Western Australia it came out in a report called The WA Advantage . I was somewhat horrified at the time because, according to that report those projects which would be disadvantaged would be the ones that would not receive special attention and administrative assistance. Those were projects with a capital investment of less than $50 million; those employing less than 100 people—that is, the majority of Australian businesses; those producing for the local market; and those not requiring significant infrastructure to be provided by the state.This is one of the major rubs. The state government in Western Australia, in linking with the Commonwealth legislation, said, of the projects to be identified, that one of the identifying criteria was the creation of significant infrastructure which was required by the state. That is assistance, but somehow or other it did not get added in. If, as part of the criteria, the state were required to provide cheaper inputs like electricity and water, that is also assistance, but this somehow or other did not get added into the 10 per cent. The other criterion was that those people who were disadvantaged were those who were not requiring an environmental clearance, including many who were helping to repair the environmental damage. The other people who were disadvantaged by this package were those not impacting on Aboriginal reserves, national parks or areas of major land use conflicts.The way it worked in Western Australia was that the Commonwealth legislation worked in with Western Australian legislation which actually singled out large, imposing projects which had major environmental impacts or major impacts on Aboriginal land, or which required large amounts of state government assistance. The way the actual legislation worked in Western Australia was contradictory. In other words, apart from fast tracking and reduced tariffs on electricity and water in Western Australia, the selection criterion was that the community had already contributed to the projects infrastructure costs.Considering that in Western Australia there are already a number of other built-in subsidies, such as reduced royalties, it would appear that the development allowance has already defeated its own purpose. In other words, this so-called development allowance is operated as a job shedding subsidy to industries which are already heavily subsidised by the community, even without costing in the environmental costs of such subsidies. In the absence of any real information that such an allowance is not simply allowing large corporations to benefit even more at the expense of employment, the Greens (WA) senators cannot support the expansion of this scheme.","N/A","DEVELOPMENT ALLOWANCE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[1]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
68,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator WATSON","VJ4","(Tasmania)","LP","N/A",1360,"—The purpose of the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill 1993 is to extend the development allowance to projects in the motor vehicle and printing production industries. Somewhat surprisingly, there is a further amendment to this amendment bill to extend the proposed definition of the `ancillary printing plant to include units placing inserts into magazines, newspapers and periodicals—an amendment which, to the cynical eye, has all the elements of pressure from particular vested interests.The Senate will be aware that the principal act had its genesis in the February 1992 One Nation statement. The development allowance measure currently before the Senate provides a tax deduction of 10 per cent on eligible plant during the first year of installation or use. The allowance is in addition to the generous depreciation allowances. Eligible projects must have a capital cost of over $50 million and be approved by a special statutory authority called the Development Allowance Authority.The governments objective at the time was to provide an incentive to promote an early upturn in investment, especially in the state-of-the-art technology involving new plant and equipment and, thus, the shedding of jobs—in summary, projects which offered benefits to improve Australias competitiveness in world markets. That was the theory through the One Nation statement.But even then, in 1992, the Liberal-National Party coalition had a number of difficulties with the original bill. Firstly, it discriminated against projects with a capital cost of less than $50 million. Secondly, it did nothing for investment in plant and equipment in the poorest areas of the economy—those that need fixing. But due to its haste of passage and shortly after its enactment, the principal act, not surprisingly, was amended because it was too restrictive. It needed to allow a greater flexibility to permit the aggregation of two or more joint venture projects involving new and existing plant. In other words, it was so hastily conceived that it was unworkable.A change was effected to permit a combination of long-term lease arrangements with short-term owned equipment. We have before the Senate today an amendment to the proposed amendment to extend the allowance to include the motor vehicle industry and the print media. We are extending it even further to allow installations to include the newspaper folding machines so that these big newspapers can get a bigger segment of the advertising market; they will be able to compete with others because their costs of production will be much more efficient.By the end of June 1993, registered projects were worth something like $14.5 billion. That might appear to be a significant figure but, compared with the estimate, it fell far short of the original figure. While the government is still confident—this government is always confident—of reaching the much touted figure of $130 billion, the attainment of such a venturous goal is dependent on the overall level of confidence in the global economy. That is certainly beyond the par of the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). The next two years do not indicate an environment of strong growth to sustain such an optimistic outcome. We are used to predictions of optimistic outcomes and the subsequent revelation of those outcomes not being achieved.During the election campaign, the Prime Minister gave great prominence to the impact of this alleged $130 billion investment that would bring in the much needed recovery. In fact, the new measures introduced in the amendment bill originated during the heat of the 1993 election campaign when the Prime Minister, in desperate measures, was determined to try to woo back the business vote to his government. Mr Keating believed that a sharp reduction in the corporate tax rate to 33 per cent, plus an extension of the development allowance to include the motor vehicle industry and the print media, would catch the corporate vote. But we have now found that there has been a bit of a sting to the 33 per cent corporate tax rate because it has created a whole lot of anomalies.Those anomalies are giving rise to further pieces of legislation which will shortly be debated in the Senate. They include draconian measures to tighten up fringe benefits; one will have to spend $1.27 to get a $1 deduction. There are a lot of inconsistencies. The issues have not been thought through and this is one of them.I wish to use the second reading debate to foreshadow a committee stage amendment whereby the Liberal-National Party coalition, in a sense of fairness and equity, will be seeking to remove the $50 million threshold—a threshold that excludes small business from this very generous concession which is being granted to the larger corporations involving the publication and the print industry. As explained earlier, in addition to the normal depreciation deduction, qualifying corporations are entitled to an extra deduction equal to 10 per cent of the eligible expenditure before the determination of taxable income.Good taxation law requires an adherence to the concept of neutrality and equality in that, in the determination of taxable income, all taxpayers in the same industry should be entitled to the same deductions and they should be assessed on the same taxable income. But it is not so. This government positively discriminates against the smaller operators and positively discriminates in favour of the big barons. This amendment is all about giving a special concession—a special benefit—to those entrepreneurs big enough to spend $50 million plus in greenfield development that will make them world competitive.What are these industries in the print media—I will exclude the motor vehicle industry because I think it has an entitlement because it is starting to export—going to do to our export income? How much income is generated from the overseas sale of big Australian newspapers in a particular year compared with the income generated from the iron, coal, wheat, wool and other industries? It is a special concession to the vested interests of those who have been able to get to the ear of some prominent people in government. It is quite unfair.The Liberal-National coalition seeks to take away this discrimination. I am horrified that the smaller parties cannot see the fairness of this particular scheme. Are they in favour of the small person? Are they in favour of small business? After all, these are the areas which are keeping people in employment. It is the big firms that are shedding the jobs. I do not mind companies becoming more internationally competitive, but let it be in terms of the legislation that we put before this house, a house which supposedly looks after peoples interests, neutrality, fairness and equality. We should make sure that when we pass legislation it will reflect that degree of fairness and not give a competitive edge to the big players vis-a-vis the small players.This parliament rightly recognises that there are special circumstances for disadvantaged people—the poor and the needy—and these taxpayers need special consideration. But in this bill there is a deliberate discrimination in favour of the rich and powerful who will be able to use this generous tax concession to further improve their profits and their market share as against the smaller operators who are competing. I think the oppositions amendment that I am foreshadowing, which removes that threshold, deserves support.Where there is positive assistance through the tax mechanism, the larger corporations will be able to reduce their unit costs and improve their competitive position over the smaller and generally less financially secure firms. Admittedly, if this amendment is successful, they will have to move very fast because of the time constraints. But at least it would let us give the right appearance and let them have the opportunity, if they can move, to take advantage of a concession that is given to the rich and powerful.I certainly hope the Senate will endorse the amendment proposed by the opposition in the interests of equity and fairness and not give an advantage to those who are already in a powerful state. After all, this amendment defies the original intent to make industry world competitive in order to increase export income. The government would be moving against one of the very important tenets that helped get it elected—that is, to make Australian industry world competitive. I urge the Senate to support the amendment that I now foreshadow.","N/A","DEVELOPMENT ALLOWANCE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
69,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator McMULLAN","5I4","(Australian Capital Territory-","ALP","Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services)",1362,"—I am at a bit of a loss as to whether I should make a passionate speech in response to Senator Watsons foreshadowed amendment or a reasoned and responsible response to what were otherwise considered second reading debate speeches by a number of honourable senators. In reality, I should make my response to Senator Watsons impassioned pleas at the committee stage, but I will make some comments now and try not to unduly extend the consideration of the Senate by speaking twice on the matter.The Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill 1993 is not in itself a major amendment. It has the potential to have some significant positive economic benefits and it is therefore welcome. To the extent that it will create an incentive which leads to further major investment in Australia and therefore generate jobs, exports and the economic success that we need to assist and increase the rate of recovery in the Australian economy, it is a welcome measure.I thank the Senate—including individuals in other parties who may, if they were in government, have proceeded otherwise—for the support given to the fact that this is at least an attempt to engender more investment and create more jobs for Australians. While in this chamber we disagree, sometimes vehemently, about the most appropriate mechanisms for achieving economic growth and creating jobs for Australians, we share the objective that it is a desirable outcome and a necessary and proper responsibility of the government to be concerned about seeking to encourage public and private investment—in this instance, private investment—in a way that will create jobs for Australians.That is the essence of this amendment. It reflects commitments which we made during the election campaign. I was surprised to hear an indication that this was in some way in conflict with our election commitments because it was an explicit commitment that we made during the election campaign. We are honouring that election commitment. I think it is something we should have done, and it is something we are obliged to do after having made that commitment.I will not take the time of the Senate unnecessarily by reiterating those things which are central to the Development Allowance Authority concept itself, which is not being essentially changed by this bill. It is merely amending the principal act to extend the development allowance to projects in the motor vehicle industry and certain printing production aspects of projects in the print media. I think there is a very reasonable prospect that this will lead to even further welcome investment, as the Development Allowance Authority already has, and as the potential in the areas covered by the original bill would suggest. I am sure that, notwithstanding differences that senators may have about matters of detail, it will be welcome to the extent that it engenders new investment and new jobs. Therefore, I commend the bill to the Senate.Question resolved in the affirmative.Bill read a second time.The bill.","N/A","DEVELOPMENT ALLOWANCE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

72,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator McMULLAN","5I4","(Australian Capital Territory-","ALP","Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services)",1363,"—Senator Watson said that he was horrified at the thought that the minor parties might not support him. I suspect that some of his colleagues, if they ever thought they would be in government, would be horrified at the thought that they might support this amendment. The last thing they would want is for this amendment to be carried.I in no way reflect on Senator Watsons integrity in putting forward the proposal because we have debated these sorts of issues too often; I understand the approach he takes on this matter. But the opposition collectively puts forward rhetoric to the effect that it wants to reduce outlays, but it involves proposals that will always cost a lot of money. We get rhetoric that it wants to reduce the public sector, but in the form of proposals that will always require massive increases in the administrative burden.We are talking about a fundamental change to the nature and whole purpose of the proposal at great cost to revenue. The proposal will not produce the benefits which are the underlying rationale for the Development Allowance Authority, which are not just to generate investment and jobs, as fundamental as that it is, but to do so in a way that encourages large scale, world competitive investment to assist Australia in the increasingly competitive international environment in which we find ourselves.Regardless of what happens in the GATT and the outcome of international trade negotiations, communications and technology changes mean inevitably that countries will have to compete internationally. There will be more competition in areas that we do not currently envisage. The old boundaries of geography are breaking down and we need to provide assistance, within the limits of our capacity, to investors in Australia to use this as a base from which they can compete successfully in that environment. We are increasing the cost beyond that which the government believes is responsible in budgetary terms—there has been a significant increase in revenue forgone for the government—and we are reducing the focus and targeting of the benefit.For those reasons I do not believe this is a responsible amendment in the circumstances. We want a tax system that effectively encourages investment and generates jobs. We now have before us a proposal that would be a very significant cost to revenue without the consequent economic benefits that the Development Allowance Authority proposal is designed to have.","N/A","DEVELOPMENT ALLOWANCE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
73,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator WATSON","VJ4","(Tasmania)","LP","N/A",1363,"—I remind the Senate that a number of the earlier benchmarks have been revised to accommodate the new entrants. This is where it differs significantly from the original One Nation proposal. Those benchmarks were removed admittedly as a result of pressure during the heat of an election campaign. Both the motor car industry and the print media were previously excluded from the development allowance in the 1992 legislation because they failed the eligibility test in the principal act. The mechanics of the matter are that both industries now have until either 30 December 1993 or 28 days after this act receives royal assent, whichever is the latter, to lodge the application.I admitted during my speech on second reading that if the Senate accepts this amendment, the smaller operators will have to act pretty speedily. So the concept that was raised in the very thoughtful contribution of my colleague Senator McMullan was that it would cause a problem for the deficit, et cetera. There will not be too many people who will be in a position to actually take advantage of this situation. Again, it is a question of fairness. So I remind the Senate that the initiatives will assist the development of greenfield site projects.Such amendments should be viewed with suspicion by the smaller operators, particularly in the printing industry, who will see their share of the market eroded as a further result of the lower costs of production by those who have access to capital and who now have access to this very generous concession—a concession that is not available to the smaller, though maybe entrepreneurial, more successful competitor.The government is trying to further entrench the newspaper and other print media in the hands of what I might call an entrepreneurial elite. The problem I see with this amendment and another reason why we believe it is fair and equitable to extend it to all people to ensure that we do not give a positive discrimination in favour of the entrepreneurial elite is the criterion of contributing to export income. The government has deliberately removed such a benchmark—it was admirable in the One Nation statement—to suit particular vested interests. I do not think this is fair to the rest of Australia and those other participants in the print media.Question put:That the amendment ( Senator Watsons ) be agreed to.Bill, as amended, agreed to.Bill reported with amendments.","N/A","DEVELOPMENT ALLOWANCE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

82,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MARGETTS","DX5","(Western Australia)","GWA","N/A",1365,"—I move:At end of motion, add:, but the Senate:(a) notes that:(i)the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for the Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage provides limited compensation for expenses incurred for clean-up operations, preventative measures, damage to property and economic loss; and(ii)the Convention supplements existing mandatory and voluntary compensation regimes and will increase the amount of compensation for oil pollution damage available to Australian interests for claims involving quantifiable economic loss to $120 million, increasing to $400 million when the amending Protocol to the Convention enters into force; and(iii)a major oil pollution incident in an environmentally sensitive area such as the Great Barrier Reef may substantially impact upon tourism, commercial fisheries and other marine-based industries and the claims for compensation arising from such an incident may go beyond the scope of the Convention compensation regimes, particularly claims for non-economic loss and claims by indigenous groups;(b)recognises actions by the Australian Government to accord the highest possible level of environmental protection from shipping activities to Australian coastal waters including:(i)the response to the report, Ships of Shame—Inquiry into Ship Safety, by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure;(ii)the preventative measures taken by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority including the introduction of compulsory pilotage in the Great Barrier Reef area; and(iii)the review of Australias national contingency plan to respond to marine oil spills;(c)recommends that Australia continue to develop effective means to include in an international comprehensive liability regime compensation for environmental harm and non-economic loss from marine based oil pollution; and(d)resolves, that there be laid on the table of the Senate, by the Minister for Transport and Communications, on or before the last sitting day in 1994 a report setting out developments in this regard.The Protection of the Sea (Oil Pollution Compensation Fund) Bill 1993 and the three cognate bills provide for the legal regime that will enable Australia to become part of the International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution. While the Greens (WA) are not opposing the legislation, we are moving this amendment to the motion to express some of the concerns raised by the environment movement to the convention and the two protocols.As has been said before, the convention establishes a fund for the compensation of oil pollution damage. The fund has a number of problems. Firstly, the fund, even if the 1992 protocol is adopted, limits claims for compensation to $400 million. Whilst this may seem a significant amount, this is the maximum that can be claimed for any one spill. Some have estimated that the clean-up bill for the Exxon Valdez spill alone was $US3 billion. The figure of $400 million would have to cover all economic and commercial losses, as well as clean-up and remediation costs.Secondly, the fund defines oil pollution damage in a way that excludes compensation for non-economic loss and damage to the environment. This also excludes the possibility of Aboriginal groups claiming for loss and damage to areas of cultural and spiritual significance and for loss of natural resources for non-economic purposes.Thirdly, the convention does not establish a provision for liability by negligent acts or omissions. The convention is about compensation; it is not about prevention or liability. It does not alter the actions of shipping companies who use flags of convenience to register substandard or poorly maintained vessels, nor does it provide a disincentive for Australian based companies who profit by placing Australias environment at risk in this way.The Greens (WA) recognise that the limitations expressed above are not able to be rectified in this legislation. However, that does not mean that Australia should not try at both the national and international level to use its best efforts to protect and preserve the environment and safeguard the rights of indigenous people.In particular, we would like to acknowledge the very successful work of Australias international negotiators in implementing the compulsory pilotage scheme in the Great Barrier Reef. The introduction, under international law, of such a regime demonstrates that Australia has a significant role to play in the development of an international regime for environmental liability.I would like to add that the rest of Australia is not included in such a pilotage scheme. In Western Australia we have a very significant reef at Ningaloo which is not covered by any such pilotage. There are many other sensitive areas around Australia which suffer the same risk. It is not that pilotage itself prevents an accident, but it reduces the risk significantly. Therefore, we are not actually doing anything which will necessarily stop the risk of this happening in most parts of Australia.We are very pleased that the government and the opposition are supporting the motion before us today. The Australian Democrats are also supporting the motion. Indeed, it was Senator Coulter, in his second reading speech on 20 May 1993, who outlined his major concerns about the convention that have resulted in this motion today. The motion picks up the major concerns outlined by Senator Coulter and we acknowledge the work of Senator Coulter on this matter.The Greens (WA) acknowledge also that the motion before the Senate is not as strong as it perhaps could be. We also acknowledge that part 3 of the motion mentions neither national action nor land based marine pollution. In the first part, we acknowledge the views of both the government and the opposition that Australia should not go it alone in developing a comprehensive liability regime. While we acknowledge this position, we do not support it. Rather we feel that with this motion the Senate makes it clear that Australia, and the nations of the world, must pursue at an international level the vexed question of liability for environmental harm.This does not mean that we will abandon attempts by organisations such as Greenpeace Australia and the Australian Conservation Foundation to promote the necessity for uniform national laws covering marine pollution from both land based and sea based sources. Indeed, it is useful to place on the record the need for such legislation and suggest that it is appropriate that the final report of the Resource Assessment Commissions inquiry into coastal zone management, soon to be presented to parliament, be given serious consideration by the government to the repeal of the various acts implemented by the Offshore Constitutional Settlement in 1980. The restriction of the motion dealing with marine based oil pollution and not land based pollution has been done to avoid any need for the matter to be referred back to cabinet due to land based marine pollution being a matter of a different department.The final matter at issue relates to the presentation of the report to the minister. The Greens (WA) are not opposing the legislation because we realise that it is the international convention that contains the problems. We commend the amendment to the Senate and thank the Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Collins, and the shadow minister for their support on the motion.","N/A","PROTECTION OF THE SEA (OIL POLLUTION COMPENSATION FUND) BILL 1993 PROTECTION OF THE SEA (IMPOSITION OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO OIL POLLUTION COMPENSATION FUND-GENERAL) BILL 1993 PROTECTION OF THE SEA (IMPOSITION OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO OIL POLLUTION COMPENSATION FUND-CUSTOMS) BILL 1993 PROTECTION OF THE SEA (IMPOSITION OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO OIL POLLUTION COMPENSATION FUND-EXCISE) BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I want to make three points reiterating some of the points that she made in her speech, which, as she said, I made back in May. We are concerned that there are limitations under this regime. It is quite conceivable that there could be losses which far and away exceed the amounts covered. We recognise, however, the danger to fuel imports for a small nation like Australia if it should seek to have unlimited liability. For those sorts of balancing reasons we have supported this legislation.We are also concerned about the non-economic loss. Senator Margetts has pointed to traditional uses of the environment which may be damaged. I do not think one need even extend into the Aboriginal area how the sheer enjoyment of the environment by many people can be damaged in non-economic ways. There is no compensation within this legislation for those sorts of losses.The final point I would like to make is that at the request of some of the conservation groups, I was responsible for sending this legislation to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science, Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. I want to put on the record that I believe the Senate committee system, which allows people to come in and have an input into legislation at the very point at which it is being debated in this parliament, is a very important one. It is a very important part of the democratic process.But in this particular case those conservation groups which had indicated an interest in appearing were rather lax in coming forward and one group failed to appear altogether. If this Senate has provided that mechanism for such groups, a mechanism that I strongly support, I think they need to recognise that the business of the Senate is complex and time consuming, and they need to respond to those opportunities. I was quite disappointed that in this particular case that opportunity was not fully taken up and accepted. Having said that, I support this amendment put by Senator Margetts.","N/A","PROTECTION OF THE SEA (OIL POLLUTION COMPENSATION FUND) BILL 1993 PROTECTION OF THE SEA (IMPOSITION OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO OIL POLLUTION COMPENSATION FUND-GENERAL) BILL 1993 PROTECTION OF THE SEA (IMPOSITION OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO OIL POLLUTION COMPENSATION FUND-CUSTOMS) BILL 1993 PROTECTION OF THE SEA (IMPOSITION OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO OIL POLLUTION COMPENSATION FUND-EXCISE) BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

89,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator REID","VI4","(Australian Capital Territory)","LP","N/A",1368,"—The opposition does not oppose the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy) Amendment Bill 1993 and will not take much time to present its position because this bill flows from the bills that have just been passed by the Senate a minute or so ago.This bill will enable the Australian Maritime Safety Authority to collect funds from the industry to enable an immediate response to an oil spill to take place in circumstances where funds may be recovered from the person who caused the spill, but where the recovery of those funds would occur, in many instances, at some considerable time in the future and the need for a response to the oil spill is very immediate indeed.As I understand it, the industry has been cooperative in supporting this legislation. I would term those in the industry as good citizens for the way in which they have responded to this suggestion. It is hoped, of course, that it will never be necessary for this fund to be called upon and used, but it is important that the fund be available so that in the event of the sort of spill that is envisaged in these circumstances an immediate response can take place.The bill accords very much with the coalitions maritime, safety and environmental protection policies. Again, our position was put down in the speeches on the second reading of the bills that have been passed both in the other place and in this chamber. It would be repeating them to speak further to this bill now. As I indicated, the opposition does not oppose this bill.","N/A","PROTECTION OF THE SEA (SHIPPING LEVY) AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

94,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator SHORT","DJ4","(Victoria)","LP","N/A",1369,"—The Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill 1993 seeks to amend the Australian Citizenship Act of 1948. Firstly, it seeks to insert a preamble, to quote the government, `giving recognition to the significance of Australian citizenship. Secondly, it seeks to amend the citizenship act to abolish the current oath or affirmation of allegiance and to replace it with a so-called pledge of commitment. Thirdly, and consequent upon that second amendment, it seeks to remove all reference to allegiance to the Queen as head of state from the commitment made by new citizens on taking the grant of citizenship.So far as the last of those three objectives of the bill is concerned, this is not the first time that the Labor government has attempted to delete reference to the Crown from the oath and affirmation. It was attempted in 1973 and again in 1984. On both those occasions the attempt was defeated in the Senate. In 1984 it was defeated by the coalition with the support of the Don Chipp led Australian Democrats.I very much regret that in 1993, when this issue and this bill are again being debated, the indication is that the Australian Democrats will not be maintaining their opposition to the deletion of reference to the Crown—the centrepiece of our constitution—from the wording of the, be it called an oath or an affirmation or a pledge, that new citizens are required to make. I do hope that, in the course of this debate and before a final vote is taken on the bill, the Democrats will reconsider their position.At the time of its introduction into the parliament on 6 May this year I said, on behalf of the coalition, that we considered this bill to be premature and that it was designed to pre-empt the debate—in particular, the republican debate—on possible changes to our constitution. I stressed that so long as the Queen remains our head of state and the Crown remains the centrepiece of our constitution, new citizens should continue to be required to state publicly their allegiance to the Crown and, therefore, to the constitution and all the institutions that underpin our nation.The Senate, at the coalitions initiative, referred the bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for consideration. That committee produced a divided report. The majority of the committee, being Labor senators, supported the bill. The coalition members of the committee—Senator Vanstone, Senator Kemp and Senator OChee—expressed their opposition. Nothing that occurred in that committee and in its public hearings has allayed the coalitions concerns about the bill or has in any way altered the coalitions formal position of total opposition to the bill at this time.In saying that, I emphasise that the coalition is not being negative or reactionary about the matter. We are simply saying that these matters should follow a due and orderly process of consideration. If the Australian community opts, in time, for a change in our constitutional arrangements, if in time we decide to replace our existing constitutional monarchy with some form of republican structure, that will be the time to make the relevant changes to our oath, allegiance or whatever form of words we use, but not before then.With this bill, the government has put the cart before the horse. It has done so quite deliberately. It is a deliberate, calculated attempt by a calculated, opportunistic government and Prime Minister to hijack the republican debate. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has totally misread the mood of the Australian public on this and, in his desperate push for a republic, has quickly proved himself to be the most divisive Prime Minister in Australias history. That will come back not just to haunt him and his government; it will be of very grave concern to the future of the Australian nation and Australian society.The coalition will not have a bar of contributing to that division. I note in passing in that respect that the Australian public seems to be waking up to the Prime Ministers secret agenda on this issue. He should very carefully heed the result of the latest opinion polls on the republic issue published in todays press. A poll taken last weekend after the Olympic bid decision was announced showed a very significant swing against a republic since the last poll was taken, with a majority of Australians now favouring the retention of our present constitutional arrangements.As well as that issue, there are other very important reasons why the coalition is opposed to this bill. I will elaborate on these in more detail a little later. However, in summary, the citizenship act needs a total rewrite. This bill makes no attempt whatsoever to tackle the basic weaknesses and deficiencies in the act. As I say, it is essentially another attempt by the Labor Party to force the pace of the republican push and to pre-empt the outcome of the emerging debate on constitutional issues.It represents a further significant weakening of the commitment required of new citizens. A `pledge—which is the word now being used to replace the oath or affirmation which is going to be abolished—involves very much less commitment than an oath or affirmation. The wording of the proposed pledge itself is a significant weakening of the present situation. It contains no reference to the head of state, to the constitution or to any of our other basic institutions. Rather, it makes vague allusions to `Australia and its people and contains such ambiguous concepts as `democratic beliefs.The legality of those phrases, let alone their essential meaning, has been questioned by many eminent persons. One of those who has expressed very grave concern about the changes being announced—not just in the legal sense but more particularly in the symbolic sense—is the very respected clergyman, the leader of the Anglican Church in Australia, Archbishop Peter Hollingworth. He recently wrote that what is being proposed in this bill `is a matter of deep symbolic and civic importance to us as a nation. He wrote:There is good reason for changing words or formulae if they give a wrong impression, or the original meaning has changed or if there is widespread objection based on conscience. But does the existing Oath of Allegiance offend in these ways?The swearing of an oath goes right to the heart of human belief. To take an oath is to highlight the solemn seriousness, power and efficacy with which a persons own word becomes endowed.He makes the point very well and very strongly—I will not continue with all of the article—that the changes being proposed in this bill do not represent changes for the better in that respect; that indeed they represent a `removal of significant traditional linchpins in our society without having something of like substance to put in its place. Those words by Archbishop Hollingworth are ones that we should all heed very carefully.The coalitions position on the question of citizenship has been very clear for a long time. Our last policy statement on the matter was made in 1988 and our position has been essentially unchanged since then. We pointed out that it was essential that the requirements of acquisition and awarding of citizenship should be strengthened to ensure that intending citizens understand more fully the meaning of their commitment to Australia.We made the point then that, compared with most other countries, Australian citizenship requirements are amongst the least rigorous in the world. Indeed, it is interesting to compare them—even our existing ones, let alone the changes now being made—to, say, the United States situation. To become an American citizen, an applicant must have been physically present in the United States for at least half of the required five-year residency period.Every applicant for what the Americans call naturalisation—we use the term `citizenship—has to go through a two-stage process. First of all, the applicant has to demonstrate an understanding of the English language, including an ability to read, write and speak words in ordinary English language usage. People who are aged or who have particular disabilities are exempted from that. The applicant for citizenship has to demonstrate a knowledge and understanding of the fundamentals of the history, the principles and form of government of the United States.At the preliminary hearing, the first-stage hearing in his citizenship approach, the applicant may be represented by a lawyer or a social service agency. There is a 30-day wait after the preliminary hearing. If that preliminary hearing is favourable to the applicant, there is a final hearing before a judge, who then administers an oath of allegiance. The American oath of allegiance reads:I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state or sovereignty, to whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; that I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform noncombatant service in the armed forces of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform work of national importance under civilian direction when required by the law; and that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; so help me God.I am not suggesting that in Australia we follow the American wording to that extent. The point I make, though, is that a new citizen of the United States is required to make a very strong commitment. This bill seeks to remove an already insufficiently strong commitment in Australia for new citizenship. We are weakening that commitment still further and I think that is a very dangerous trend.As well as that, though, the coalition has for a considerable period advocated a major overhaul of the current citizenship act to better reflect Australian citizenship as a privilege which has an overriding and unifying commitment to Australia and its basic structures and principles. We have also proposed the incorporation of a statement which spells out clearly the rights and obligations of citizenship during the citizenship ceremony in order to reaffirm that overriding and unifying commitment.We are not by any means on our own in that sense. Earlier in my speech I mentioned the words of Archbishop Hollingworth. Many other people and bodies have spoken even more directly about those issues. A very important report—the so-called FitzGerald report entitled Immigration—a commitment to Australia which, I regret to say, this government has ignored—was produced in 1988 by the Committee to Advise on Australias Immigration Policies. In this very notable report the FitzGerald committee made a similar recommendation to that which the coalition has in mind. It produced a draft suggested declaration to be adopted at citizenship ceremonies, linking the grant of citizenship with respect for fundamental institutions and principles in Australian society.The FitzGerald committee also recommended that ways be examined to restrict certain public benefits to non-citizens as a means of enhancing the value of citizenship. There are very considerable, difficult and sensitive issues involved in that, but I do think we need to look at ways of making citizenship more attractive to potential citizens who may be deciding whether to take up citizenship.That FitzGerald report also recommended that a group of eminent Australians be appointed to advise on further ways of making Australian citizenship a more meaningful commitment to Australia and of encouraging its acquisition. We on this side of the chamber have always felt that that recommendation has considerable merit and that it warrants follow-up action. Accordingly, in January earlier this year the Leader of the Opposition, John Hewson, announced that a coalition government would establish a national council on citizenship to advise on a clear and unambiguous statement of the rights and obligations of citizenship in the context of a multilateral society.Another very important critic of the existing citizenship act has been the very eminent, very distinguished and universally respected former Governor-General of Australia, Sir Ninian Stephen. In a very important address to the Alfred Deakin Society on 26 August of this year—the Alfred Deakin lecture—Ninian Stephen described our existing citizenship act as `a masterpiece of legislative incoherence. And he is absolutely right. The act is almost incomprehensible. It has enormous deficiencies. It does not really set out at all who are Australian citizens and what is required to be an Australian citizen.For example, the only reference in the existing act to a citizen in the sense of defining who is a citizen is in section 10, which deals with citizenship by birth. That section states that someone is a citizen if that person was born in Australia after 26 January 1949, which was about the date of proclamation of the Australian Citizenship Act. Indeed, 1949 was the first time we had a citizenship act as such. In the current act the only reference to citizenship by birth occurs in section 10 and it relates only to post-January 1949 births. That is a classic example of why this act needs major change. The act is arcane, incomprehensible, unfriendly and does not set out clearly who are citizens.For all of those reasons and, in particular, the point that the bill is premature at this time given the state of debate on our constitutional arrangements, we on the coalition side are totally opposed to this legislation. To proceed with it in advance of any change in our constitutional arrangements would be divisive, pre-emptive and of questionable legality. The citizenship act requires a complete overhaul—not the partial, piecemeal, confused, politically motivated and divisive amendments being proposed in this bill. For all of those reasons, the coalition very strongly opposes this bill in its entirety.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
95,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator SPINDLER","0X4","(Victoria)","AD","N/A",1372,"—The Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill seeks to replace the current oath or affirmation of allegiance with a pledge of commitment, omitting reference to the Queen in doing so. In contrast to the oath or affirmation by members of parliament, the oath for new citizens can be changed by legislation. This is what the bill seeks to do.As has been stated, the main argument against replacing the current arrangements with a new pledge of commitment is that it is a first, and fairly significant, step towards making Australia a republic. The Australian Democrats support the move towards a republic, but that is quite different from the consideration that applies to this bill. One needs to consider whether it is appropriate at this particular time to take this step. If it were a step that affected the substance of government in Australia, I think the position that the Democrats are adopting, which essentially is one of support, would be different.The view we take is that a reference to the Queen and the swearing of allegiance to the Queen in a new citizenship ceremony is somewhat of an anachronism. We believe that new citizens who have entered Australia intending to make this country their home see Australia as the country to which they swear allegiance. It is Australia that they want to make their new home. To them, I believe, reference to the Queen is of some historical interest but, in terms of everyday life, in terms of pledging their commitment to their new home country, it is not of great relevance.In my case there is a personal element. I am probably one of the few members of this chamber who, as a newcomer to this country some time ago, has actually taken the oath. I recall that when I came in 1949 I determined very clearly and very strongly that this was going to be my new home. I applied for citizenship even before the time had elapsed that would formally have entitled me to take that step.When I took the oath in 1952, I carefully considered the words. I must admit that it surprised me a little to find the reference to the Queen in that oath. I had come to Australia, I had not come to another country, and I did not expect to find the monarch of another country, even if she was called the Queen of Australia, to be the head of the community to which I was pledging my allegiance. My commitment to Australia was as strong then as it is now.I believe that the words of the new oath have a poetic simplicity which goes back tothe fact that former Senator Tate used the work of poet Les Murray in wordsmithing the words of this new pledge of commitment.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

97,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator SPINDLER","0X4","(Victoria)","AD","N/A",1372,"—That may or may not be so. Les Murray has contributed significantly to the final result, which reads:From this time forward,I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people,whose democratic beliefs I share,whose rights and liberties I respect, andwhose laws I will uphold and obey.To me the words are a very noble statement. If individuals wish to add in the first line `under God`, it is their choice to do so. I believe these words are significant and represent a significant commitment on the part of new citizens. In considering the wording, and in being a member of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which had a reference on this matter, I felt—and the Australian Democrats felt—that it would perhaps be useful to look at a variant to emphasise more the commitment that new citizens are making. I put forward a wording which read:From this time forward,I . . . pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people,whose democratic beliefs I share,whose rights and liberties I respect, andI swear by Almighty God that I will faithfully observe the laws of Australia and fulfil my duties as an Australian citizen.In the end, after long and careful consideration, we decided that it would be difficult to improve on the words that originated from poet Les Murrays efforts, but the concern that there should be a stronger commitment to the citizenship obligations of new citizens remained. Therefore, I have moved an amendment which I understand will be supported by the government, and hopefully the opposition, the Greens and Senator Harradine, inserting the words `undertake to in the preamble to the oath. The preamble would then read as follows:. . . Australian citizenship represents formal membership of the community of the Commonwealth of Australia; andAustralian citizenship is a common bond, involving reciprocal rights and obligations, uniting all Australians, while respecting their diversity; andPersons granted Australian citizenship enjoy these rights and undertake to accept these obligations—the two words `undertake to represent my amendment—by pledging loyalty to Australia and its people, andby sharing their democratic beliefs, andby respecting their rights and liberties, andby upholding and obeying the laws of Australia . . .I think it is important that we recognise that we live in a period of change, that we are attempting to forge a national identity, and that we are attempting to forge a multicultural society that accepts diversity even as it builds this new identity. I believe that from time to time in this period of change we need to take steps that move us ahead towards that new identity, and that from time to time we need to discard symbolic relics of the past which might intervene in this attempt to forge a new community.I am taking this change to the preamble a little further by asking the minister to give an undertaking to introduce regulations that this preamble will be read at every citizenship ceremony and, in addition, that the citizenship certificate will be amended to include the words `having undertaken to fulfil the responsibilities of a citizen. As I have said before, I believe that new citizens do take extremely seriously their obligations to their new country. I think the oath, the preamble and the ceremony should reflect that.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
98,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator KNOWLES","TH4","(Western Australia)","LP","N/A",1373,"—Today we are debating the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill. As we have heard from Senator Short and Senator Spindler, the bill seeks to replace the current oath or affirmation of allegiance with a pledge that will not include a reference to the monarch.Many people around Australia are extremely concerned about this not so subtle move to a republic without any public debate. It is ironic that for the second day in a row I am standing in the Senate accusing this government of doing things without public debate. Yesterday the issue was the UN declaration on religious freedom; today we are talking about a major change to something that is most significant to many people in this country. But, this government refuses, yet again, to take the issue to the people. I do not know what has happened to this government over the period of 10 years but it has become more and more aware of the need not to take its changes—I will not call them reforms; `reforms suggests that something good will come out of it; they are absolute blatant changes—to the public.I know that the minister at the table may well say to me, `But we had a Senate committee. That was all very well, but the Senate committee inquiry was not held over an extended period. Most people to whom I have spoken were totally unaware of its existence. They did not have an opportunity, according to the way they view it—which is the important factor—to contribute to the debate, and here we are in a situation whereby they will be run roughshod over yet again. I just think that the whole situation is totally and utterly unsatisfactory and so do the people out there, who are the ones who will be affected by this measure.I do not say that there are not a number of people out there who think that it might be extraordinary to pledge allegiance to the Queen. There are people out there; it would be stupid of me to the deny that. But the fact of the matter is that those very same people also find it quite extraordinary to think that they do not even have to pledge allegiance to the constitution under the proposal that has been put forward to us today. They look at comparisons with other countries. Take United States, for example, which Senator Short mentioned earlier. The situation there is very different. They have to pledge allegiance to a whole range of things, which makes this oath or affirmation look like something that would be said in kindergarten.I just find that this whole thing is being treated with absolute and utter disrespect. I think it has been marginalised and minimised in terms of its importance to this country. Therefore, a very important factor that we must consider is creating opportunities for people to debate this. Let us have due consideration given to any changes that are made and not just have them rammed through the parliament in the way that this measure is.One of the overriding and important observations about the whole debate on the oath of citizenship is that it needs to be made more relevant to Australian society. If the government is so sure that it has the support of the public, why cannot the public be allowed to decide the nature of a solemn oath when people become new citizens of this country?It was interesting that a little while ago Senator Spindler made mention of Mr Les Murrays contribution. Senator Short and I said to him that that very same man, Les Murray—the poet—now thinks that this is wrong. I will just give him what he said. Mr Murray is a poet and a former literary editor. He is best described as a poet who has an enduring admiration for the quality and sanctity of Australian rural life. He is also a man who displays such attitudes as devotion to the Australian rural scene, respect and affection for the ordinary country man, and a conviction that modern society relinquishes at its peril the values that are enshrined in the land and the lives of those who live in intimacy with it. I will quote Mr Murray—and I must emphasise that the words are not necessarily parliamentary. He said that the government has `stuffed up his original poem by turning it into `bureaucratic gobbledegook. They are his words.If Senator Spindler thinks that Mr Murray is still in favour of this when he uses that type of terminology, I would be awfully surprised. Mr Murray did not support the pledge in its current form and said Australians would not support Mr Keatings vision for a republic if a referendum were held now. I assume that if a referendum were held for the so-called `pledge of commitment it would suffer a similar fate because it is so wishy-washy. Let us face it, that is part of the problem and that is the concern that is being expressed to the people of this parliament today. Mr Murray also said, `Not unless they—Australians—`trust it—the republic—`and they sure cant trust the one they are being offered at the moment.That is the problem that Mr Murray is identifying. That is the real crux of this issue. They do not trust what the government is doing. They do not see that it is a relevant thing to be just ramming down their throats. These are the people who will be affected, but these are the very people that this government refuses to consult. I suspect the reason the government wants to radically change the oath and affirmation through legislation is that it knows that no-one can trust the bearer of the changes. I think the question is: what is it that the government is dreading and fearful of in relation to this issue?The current oath is very different. I want to put it on the record. It states:I swear by Almighty God—in the affirmation it is `I solemnly and sincerely promise and declare—that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Australia, her heirs and successors, according to law, and that I will faithfully observe the laws of Australia and fulfil my duties as an Australian citizen.People have had that opportunity to take either the oath or the affirmation and feel that there is some commitment in it. The proposed affirmation states:From this time forward,I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people,whose democratic beliefs I share,whose rights and liberties I respect, andwhose laws I will uphold and obey.One only has to read them to see the difference.Some of the ethnic communities to whom I spoke only two weeks ago today said to me that they believe that this just diminishes the significance of such an important occasion for them. If they are saying that, what do Australian born and bred people feel about it? They, too, feel as though it just diminishes the significance of such an important occasion.I just want to put on the record the fact that there are many reasons why we are opposing this legislation. Senator Short has given a very comprehensive list of reasons why we are opposing this legislation—from a technical viewpoint, an emotive viewpoint and from the angle of significance to this country. I want to report to the Senate that there are real people out there who are not happy, who have not been consulted, who want to have a say in this and who feel that this government is denying them that right. They are the people who will be affected and they want to be consulted.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
99,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator PANIZZA","JI4","(Western Australia)","LP","N/A",1375,"—I rise very briefly to support my colleagues on the stand that the coalition has taken in relation to the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill 1993. I would like Senator Spindler to know that I am part of a migrant family. I did not have to take the oath because I was born in Australia—but only just. So I am fully aware of what those migrating families went through—the advantages and disadvantages and whatever else went with it.I find Senator Spindlers remark that the present oath is a relic of the past quite insulting. There are many migrating families, like my mother and father, who were proud at the time and are still proud today—in the case of my mother; my father has passed on—that they took the oath they did. If we are going to change how Australia is run—whether it is run by constitutional monarchy or as a republic—we should do it all at the same time. We should not try to get the republic in by the back door or in any other way by starting off with the oath and going on to the flag—the flag of which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was ashamed the other day in Monaco. The Australian flag was thrown around when Sydney won the bid, and the Prime Minister was reported in the Australian as being ashamed. What a day to be ashamed of the Australian flag!Last night Senator Faulkner gave us a long description of his visit to the Western Front with the diggers. Those diggers had no trouble in identifying themselves with the Australian flag and Senator Faulkner, in his good description, did not tell us that those people were ashamed of the Australian flag and needed a change.Let me return to the subject of change, and put on record—and it is public knowledge that I have done this for quite a long time with my party and anyone else who cares to listen to me—that I am very relaxed on the issue of a republic. If Australia decides to become a republic after a proper and informed referendum, I will accept that. Of course, if we change to a republic we may change the flag and if Australia wants to improve the flag after a proper referendum, I will support that. The only real condition I have on the flag is that the Southern Cross never comes off it; that was where I was born and that is where I still live. But all those things need to come after a proper debate.In his second reading speech the minister said:In the past . . . the Government has sought to promote community discussion of issues relating to our national identity.I have already mentioned national identity, and the Prime Minister thinks we have not got one. If he has not got a national identity, that is his problem. I have an identity and I think 99 per cent of Australians have an identity. He said:. . . the Government has sought to promote community discussion . . .If it has, my constituents have never heard about it. As Senator Knowles said—and she is responsible for the ethnic affairs portfolio—her constituents did not know about it. I think the Prime Minister and the government have failed to create any discussion whatsoever.Let us go a bit further into what the government is trying to do. The minister said:Citizenship proclaims and defines national identity. The Government believes the time is right to change. . .The time is right to change. The Prime Minister might think the time is right to change and so might some, but not all, of his ministers; certainly not all of his backbenchers think the time is right to change; even the Governor-General has doubts as to whether the time is right to change. Ask the people whether they think the time is right to change, not whether the Prime Minister, the government or some of its ministers think it is.The minister went on to say:The current Australian Citizenship Act . . . is principally concerned about the process of acquiring . . . citizenship. This is inadequate.Why is it inadequate? The main thing about acquiring citizenship is taking on the obligations of Australia as well as its privileges, and do not tell me today that the present oath we have does not cover that. As I have said, there are many who were proud to take the oath in the past. I think Senator Spindler would have been happy to take it to get into a better country. Unfortunately, he had to leave his last one and as the years go by, he might have some doubts about whether he has come to a better country, but I am sure that he does not regret it, just as I do not regret it on behalf of my parents. If we are to have a change, let all Australians think about it and come up with the solution.Here is the minister, on behalf of the government, carrying on about freedom of speech and religion, and equality of opportunity. He said:Australia is one of those few countries which actually relishes its diversity. Under the umbrella of an overall commitment to the nation and its uniting values and institutions, a society of great richness . . . As the multicultural society we are, it is proper that the pledge of commitment be one which will be equally meaningful to all our people.He is saying, on the one hand, that he wants to unify us all and, on the other, he seems to go off at a tangent and wants diversity.If this minister—and those opposite might find what I am saying amusing—wants us in Australia under one flag, perhaps he could explain to us why in Kununurra, Western Australia, a government department, namely, Social Security, which has two equally high flagpoles out the front, continually flies the Australian flag on one and the Aboriginal flag on the other. I believe it is a disgrace for a government department to fly another flag at equal height to the Australian flag. At some time I would like an explanation from the minister responsible and, if he does not believe me, he can go and have a look at it.I believe that it is far too premature to be doing something like this. As I said before, if we are going to change the constitution, let us do it all in good time. The minister also said:The pledge calls upon applicants to make a commitment of loyalty to Australia, the nation and its people. This contrasts with the present oath or affirmation of allegiance, which is made to a sovereign by a subject and has its origins in feudal times.How stupid can you get? This very parliament, it can be said, has its origins in feudal times. If we want to throw out anything that has its origins in feudal times, I say let us throw it all out, not selectively what the minister in charge of this bill is responsible for. If we want to use feudal times as an argument, we can go on forever.I would also like to address the point that people migrating to this country demand to take a certain oath. I have not heard too many who come to Australia from republics, other kingdoms or whatever, make a demand as to the sort of oath they will take. I believe that what they want to do is become citizens of Australia for the advantages they can get from Australia, otherwise they would not have migrated here in the first place. They may have entered this country on a resident visa or with PR status, seen what sort of a country Australia is and the opportunities that are here, and decided to become citizens. I have not heard too many immigrants saying, `No, I will not become an Australian citizen because I dont like the oath of allegiance, and I believe it is a fallacy to say that.I would like to take a poll on that because I believe it is a totally stupid argument. When one wants to join a club or when one is a junior in a club, one does not demand that the rules change so that one can be admitted as a special person. I believe that if one wants to be admitted to a club—and I think Australia is a pretty good club to belong to; my family considers that it has been a pretty good club to belong to—one takes the rules as they are. In time, if Australia decides to change its flag, its constitution and its head of state, let it be done then, and not before, in bits and pieces and by trying to put it all over Australian citizens. I totally support the position that Senator Short and others have so ably pointed out to the Senate.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
100,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CALVERT","5F4","(Tasmania)","LP","N/A",1377,"The Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill which we are discussing in the Senate today is not a bill which in any way relates to democracy. It is not a bill which in any way relates to the will of the Australian people. It is nothing more than a blatant attempt by our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) once again to impose upon the community his will, and his agenda alone. If I remember correctly no public outcry instigated this bill. There were no representations that called for changes. Rather, our Prime Minister decided that in his endeavour to push Australia towards a republic he would pre-empt any constitutional referendum and any decision of the parliament and, as usual, impose his own views.When the proposed new oath and affirmation of allegiance was announced by the Prime Minister in his usual press release method, on 17 December 1992, he stated that the new oath and affirmation would better reflect the contemporary reality of Australia and our nation aspirations. It should be remembered that once again these comments were made without any public support. Naturally, when Labor was returned to government following the March 1993 election, one of the first bills to be introduced to the parliament was this Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill which, as we have heard today, deletes all reference to the Queen and any reference to the constitution or any of our other institutions from the oath of allegiance required of people on being granted Australian citizenship.We would have thought there would have been a few other higher priorities on the agenda, such as getting the budget through parliament and a few other things like that. Nevertheless, this was one of the first bills we saw after the election. If we are to judge in any way the merits of the governments proposal, I take this opportunity to place on record through Hansard the exact wording that will be used by our new Australian citizens. It has already been quoted by Senators Knowles and it reads:From this time forward, under God,I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people,whose democratic beliefs I share,whose rights and liberties I respect, andwhose laws I will uphold, and obey.This pledge of commitment which represents the governments proposals is an extremely poor attempt to give our new Australian citizens any understanding of what it means to be an Australian citizen. More particularly it in no way reflects the many obligations and responsibilities which accompany such an honour. There is no doubt this bill is an attempt by the Prime Minister and the Labor Party to continue their republican push and, by doing so, to pre-empt any outcome of the debate which is occurring in Australia today.As can be seen from the newspoll released today, the initial support for the republic is quickly dwindling. That is because the Australian community has had an opportunity to come to terms with what exactly it means to be part of a constitutional monarchy. According to the figures, only 39 per cent of Australian citizens support the concept and 44 per cent are against a republic. I have no doubt that this trend will continue. Our Prime Minister has absolutely no right to pretend that he represents the views of the majority of Australians on this issue. The decision by the Labor Government to delete any reference to the Queen or to our constitution from the oath of allegiance is totally unfounded whilst Australia remains a constitutional monarchy and whilst the debate which is occurring at present continues.This bill is another attempt by the government to divert the attention of this parliament, and perhaps the media, away from the other critical issues that are facing our country today. We do not need to be reminded that we have the worst unemployment problem this country has ever known. We have young people who are facing the prospect of no future whatsoever. We have a business community that has stagnated. Our international trade figures continue to reflect doom and gloom.These are not the times when the government should be looking at these matters; it should not be bringing these red herrings into the parliament. What is more important in this day and age is that the government should be directing its energies towards resolving the real issues this country is facing at the moment. That has not occurred because the government does not have the answers. It proved over the last decade that it does not have the answers.The issue of whether Australia should become a republic and result in the removal of our monarch as the head of state is still to be resolved. Our Prime Minister has failed to demonstrate why our existing form of government is in any way flawed when the latest figures clearly demonstrate that he is losing the argument. Piecemeal measures such as this bill which pre-empt such debate will serve only to divide the Australian community further.When I speak on this matter of citizenship, I do so with a certain amount of personal experience. I was the elected head of a local government area in Tasmania. I conducted hundreds, if not thousands, of personal and collective citizenship ceremonies in my then municipality of Clarence, which is now the city of Clarence. During all that time, I never once met a prospective citizen who was concerned about the oath or affirmation that they were going to take. All they were worried about was being a good citizen of Australia, and they were very proud to partake in that ceremony. I can recall only too well the numerous occasions on which I saw pride in the eyes of individuals when they repeated the words which obviously meant so much to them, coming to a country where they could be free.I have been out of that job for some seven years now, but it is amazing the number of people who walk up to me in the street, or when I am at social functions, and say, `Do you remember me? You naturalised me. I remember that ceremony; it was a wonderful occasion. At the ceremonies in our city, people were presented with a native eucalyptus tree. I usually asked them how the tree was going and, in most cases, they said that it was growing well. They look after it; it symbolises the event and reminds them of the happiness and pride they felt at the ceremony.As Senator Panizza said earlier, the receipt of Australian citizenship is probably the most important event for any migrant who has chosen to call Australia their home. As such, the oath or affirmation of allegiance should be a meaningful occasion for the new citizen which reflects their loyalty to Australia. There is not one person who applies for citizenship without the knowledge that the Queen of Australia is our head of state. Therefore, I believe that we will create confusion in prospective migrants if we ask them to make a pledge of commitment that in no way refers to that head of state.Because this bill is piecemeal and because it does not reflect the result of a referendum, our Queen will be referred to in a number of oaths but she will not be referred to in the citizenship ceremony. Senators know that, when enlisting for the defence forces, there is a requirement for an oath or affirmation to Her Majesty the Queen to be taken. Similarly, there is a requirement under section 42 of the constitution that members of the House of Representatives and members of this place make an oath or affirmation of allegiance to the Queen.This bill will guarantee nothing more than a situation where we have different statements of allegiance by different categories of Australians. This is hardly the evidence of a well thought out and considered initiative. Rather than strengthening our existing citizenship oath, this new legislation will merely weaken it. The pledge which is contained in the governments proposal reflects much less commitment than the oath or affirmation which was previously used. A pledge makes no reference to our head of state, our constitution, or any of our other basic institutions. It completely ignores the heritage on which our nation was originally founded. The vague allusions contained in the pledge to Australia and to its people, or to other concepts such as democratic beliefs, create no sense of sureness in the prospective citizen.The bill fails to address the real issue of concern in the Citizenship Act: it does not reflect in the true manner what it really means to be an Australian, or the privileges and obligations which accompany that citizenship. There is no reference to a unified Australia. There is no reference to our values, our principles and our basic institutions.Because the Australian Citizenship Act has not been altered substantially since 1948, the coalition has called several times for a full review and overhaul of the citizenship act. During consideration of this bill by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, a former Governor-General, Sir Ninian Stephen, described the act as follows:Not only is it an extraordinary example of legal and bureaucratic language, but it is extraordinarily inappropriate for its title.As part of our commitment in the lead-up to the last election, John Hewson announced that a coalition government would establish a national council on citizenship which would be chaired by a prominent Australian and which would overview the whole question of the rights and obligations which accompany the honour. The coalition believes that this parliament should support legislation which strengthens the citizenship act and that this should be a matter of priority.Since assuming the role of Prime Minister, Mr Keating has repeatedly attempted to deride and undermine our national symbols. He has even had the gall to attempt to rewrite our history. His recent outburst over the Olympic Games further demonstrates his willingness to ignore reality. When I witnessed members of the Australian community celebrating the selection of Sydney to host the 2000 games, it was quite obvious from the way they proudly paraded the Australian flag that they had no intentions or thoughts of changing this particular act, the flag or anything else—they were just proud to be Australian.The strengthening of public opinion behind the status quo demonstrates to me that Australians are valuing more and more their stability and our constitution. They will eventually reject, in no uncertain terms, this attempt to push our country into a position of instability. It could be that our Prime Minister inherits his derision of our past from his Irish ancestors, but the overwhelming majority of Australians from varying backgrounds are proud of our nations background and the manner in which we have developed.It is not surprising that this bill allocates a further $230,000 to be spent in the 1993-94 financial year to promote this so-called new pledge to the Australian community. Let there be no doubt that this quarter of a million dollars of taxpayers money will not be used to push the pledge but will be just another excuse to push the republican cause at the expense of all else. It is nothing more than a slush fund for our Prime Minister to push his ideals.Whilst on the subject of funding by this government, I have had a lot of representations regarding the governments allocation of hundreds of thousands of dollars to the republican committee with the sole aim of pursuing the governments agenda, yet not one cent of taxpayers money has been allocated to support our Australian constitution and our Australian way of life.This bill is divisive. It does nothing to address the real issues facing Australia. It creates two classes of Australian citizens: those who were born in Australia and therefore have an allegiance to the Queen; and those from overseas who will not.However, the main reason why this parliament should reject this pledge is that it totally pre-empts the outcome of any debate by the community and a change to the pledge without the input of the Australian people will show once again that this parliament is more concerned with Mr Keatings agenda than with the wishes of the majority of Australians.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
101,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BISHOP","SE4","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A",1380,"—I rise to speak with a feeling of some anger. This morning I attended a citizenship ceremony in Canberra because a friend of mine was making an extraordinarily important decision in his life to become an Australian citizen. He was not a new settler; he had been here a long time. He loves this country and he wants to be a citizen of it. Interestingly enough, the person who drove me to the ceremony has lived here for 40 years and is also in the process of becoming an Australian citizen. One could say that it is one of the most important days of ones life when one makes a decision to become a citizen and to swear ones allegiance and loyalty to a new nation, to uphold its rights and duties and to give ones pledge that one will honour the country that one is becoming a citizen of.This ceremony was held in a dirty, dingy little room in a building in Civic. Only 22 people were in this ceremony because something like ten ceremonies had to be performed today. There was an apology from the person officiating that those people who had sworn on the Bible could not keep it because of budgetary measures in the department. When we stood up to sing the national anthem there was a sense that we could not even afford to have a decent tape of it to sing to. There were more apologies afterwards.This is the nations capital. As I sat here and heard earlier in the day from those on the government benches what I can only describe as cant—superficial language and superficial arguments as to why we should remove the whole concept of owing fealty and allegiance to an individual, and about getting rid of the concept of taking the oath or affirmation and replacing it with something called a commitment when one is pledging ones loyalty for the rest of ones life to this great nation—I thought once again that the attitude is downright un-Australian. We have a Prime Minister who is un-Australian. We win the Olympics and he comes home and says that we are all second-rate. We had just taken on the world and said that we are proud and have won and he comes back and says that we have to change everything because we are all second-rate. The only person who is second-rate in this whole equation is the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). As my colleague Senator Calvert has said, the so-called modest advertising budget that will be made available to go out and advertise—allegedly—this change in how one becomes a citizen will just be more of the unintentional or unrecognised hidden funding for the republican push and the changing the flag push of the Prime Minister.I have great faith in the good, sensible Australian people. They love this country, they love their national symbols and they are proud of them. They are proud of the sacrifice that others have given in the name of the nation and under that flag. At the end of the day, it is always well to remember that it is us who bring credit to our flag and not the other way around. The flag is there for us to rally to, not for it to bring glory upon us. If there has been a failure to take the Australian reputation and its symbols to the rest of the world and have the rest of the world recognise what they mean, the failure is the failure of the person in whom we have placed executive power—the Prime Minister. It is his responsibility to say that he is proud of his country and his people, but he cannot even do that. He cannot even fly his own flag on his automobile. What sort of a leader is that? He puts himself first and Australia second. This is just part of the continuing subterfuge of finding more money to promote the great crusade to become King Paul I of Australia.As I sat watching that citizenship ceremony this morning, I thought to myself, `This is the nations capital. This ceremony should be taking place in the nations parliament. Heaven knows, we have plenty of empty space around here. It should have been attended by the minister, not just an official. No member of either the government or the opposition was invited to speak, as happens when I attend citizenship ceremonies in Blacktown or Parramatta, where it becomes a bipartisan thing and everybody welcomes in the new citizens.These were proud, marvellous, new Australians. There were little people; there were people who had been here a long time before taking that decision; and there were people who had clearly come more recently. But they all had one thing in common—they wanted to be Australian. What a wonderful thing to want to be—to become part of the best country in the world. Yet what did we give them? A shabby room, no Bible to take home because of budgetary cuts, the feeling that it was a second-rate occurrence and nobody to speak officially from those who have been elected. I could see the pride within them because they had fulfilled their ambition to become an Australian citizen. I thought they deserved better and I think we should seriously look at having those ceremonies in this parliament. Two hundred people were to be done today. What a gathering and what a celebration that could have been. If only we could think first about how good we are, how strong we are and how magnificent it is to decide to become an Australian citizen.Debate interrupted.Sitting suspended from 12.45 to 2 p.m.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Is the minister aware of a recent survey by the Australian Bureau of Statistics which found that more than one in four households rely on social security payments for their main source of income?

103,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CROWLEY","ZF4","SA","ALP","N/A",1381,"—First of all, I think it is important that the Senate understands what one in four families being in receipt of social security payments really means. Senator Newman failed to say that families in receipt of the family assistance as well as those in receipt of the family allowance supplement receive funds from the same source.Senator Newmans question conveys the understanding that all of those families are social security pension beneficiaries. That is a misunderstanding of the payments to those families. Approximately 90 per cent of Australian families enjoy a family allowance payment that is also paid in the same way. I urge Senator Newman to be cautious in respect of what those statistics mean.Amongst other things, the assistance given to help rear children is a fair recognition by government of the importance of children. That is why we have the family payment and the family allowance supplement. When the family allowance supplement was introduced, the government did something that the opposition never did: it set benchmarks for the assistance of children. Those figures have been set; they are indexed; and they are there forever. I suspect that the opposition, if it ever were in government, would not remove them. So it is important to understand the meaning of that simple statistic which Senator Newman dropped into this place.In response to the second part of Senator Newmans question, it is quite clear from dealing with any people at all in the community that people who have a sense of confidence, a sense of their own place in the world and a sense that they are making decisions about their own lives are the ones who manage better. That is what this government recognises. It recognises the right of people to be assisted and the right of people to be able to stand on their own two feet, define their lives and make choices. That is the exact analogy of what the Prime Minister is saying to this country. When this country is standing on its own two feet, defining itself, confidently facing the rest of the world and winning Olympic bids, it is meeting the challenge that is faced by women in this country. Senator Newman should know that. As women are defining themselves and becoming more confident, so is the nation.I see an entire parallel; so do thousands of Australians. I am shocked that Senator Newman does not. She is misrepresenting this statistic and she simply does not understand that confident people make the best choices. I have no doubt at all that most Australians are very pleased that Australia stands proud, as is this government.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[1]/answer[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

That is one thing of which we are very proud. We have set benchmarks for the payments to families. We will not leave families or children abandoned, and this government recognises that.

Previously, the sale of these weapons to private collectors and museums was permitted, provided that the weapons had been rendered inoperable and the buyer had police permission.I directed my department to review its policy for the disposal of the surplus weapons following representations from the Australian Police Ministers Council through the Minister for Justice. Their request for a review of the policy followed an incident where a non-working weapon was made operable after it was sold by Defence. Apart from destruction, there is no known method for rendering a weapon irreversibly inoperable.Under the revised policy, surplus weapons will be destroyed. Exceptions will only be made for, firstly, the domestic sale of working weapons to government agencies; secondly, export sales to foreign governments of working weapons in accordance with Defence export controls; and, thirdly, the domestic disposal of rendered weapons to government controlled museums, subject to approval of the local police force.I recognise that this decision may inconvenience legitimate collectors and some private museums. However, this point must be placed and balanced against the communitys desire for the tighter control of guns.A number of collectors had ordered and paid for weapons from Defence when this decision was made to stop all sales pending the review. Defence will refund this money. Advice from the Attorney-Generals Department is that Defence liability to prospective buyers will be limited to the amount that they have paid.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[2]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I think John Brown was right when he said that the tax was an `antiquated, philosophical dogma of the ALP, where Labor appears to have ceased its social maturation process and reverted to the worst aspects of envy and class warfare.

Therefore, I accept that the Senate has conferred on it, quite properly, powers under the constitution. Although this house was originally envisaged by the founding fathers as a states rights house, that disappeared very quickly when political partisanship came into this chamber, as inevitably it must. Therefore, what this chamber has evolved traditionally as its historical role is that of a house of review but, again, that has always been governed to some extent by party discipline.I must say to Senator Kernot that some of the problems in terms of the powers of this chamber, the House of Representatives and the broad question of mandates would be better served if we had simultaneous elections rather than a hangover from elections several years ago which can well not reflect the meaning of the people. Under simultaneous elections it would be hard for a government to argue, where people voted separately in two elections held on the same day, that they did not intend a more diffused power structure.The one thing I would like to see Australia avoid is the United States situation where the relationship between the executive and the two houses of Congress currently pertains and where total gridlock has tended to cripple the government over the past few years. I would not like to see this chamber head in that particular direction and I do not think that most people in this chamber would like that. Whilst we have acknowledged that this Senate has had certain rights and privileges, et cetera conferred on it, all politics also operate by way of convention and historical practice as well.The change that we have seen in this chamber has only really occurred in the past few months.

145,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator McMULLAN","5I4","ACT","ALP","N/A",1386,"—As most senators would be aware, one of the important aspects of the retail sales activity in the Christmas period is that it also leads to a surge in employment in that period; a very important surge in employment for many ordinary Australian families and their children who, as students, are seeking part time jobs, and for the unemployed for whom, although the jobs may be temporary, they are nevertheless extremely welcome.The ABS publication says that last December, Australias retail sector created an additional 35,000 to 40,000 seasonal jobs—jobs additional to the underlying pattern of an increase in employment. December 1993 has the potential to see an even bigger seasonal boost than in previous years. The governments fiscal policy is designed to provide an additional stimulus just so that there will be more available for people to spend in the retail stores this year, while laying down a firm schedule for reducing the budget deficit in the medium term.The key ingredient of that additional stimulus is the personal income tax cuts scheduled for 15 November. That will contribute at least $300 million in extra retail outlays to pump into the retail stores this year. It will be a great tragedy if the intransigence, the lack of cooperation—the sorts of problems that Senator Ray so articulately outlined in the Senate—and the fiscal irresponsibility of the Senate were to lead to the situation where those personal income tax cuts could not go ahead on time.If the medium-term reduction strategy is still being held hostage by the Senate, the government will not be in a fiscally responsible position to go ahead with the bringing forward of those tax cuts, and those extra jobs over Christmas will be in jeopardy; they will be at risk.There are significant concerns about the loss of the tax cuts to those ordinary Australian working men and women, because they deserve them. The bring forward to which this budget contributes is important to those families; it is important to those individuals. Over and above that, it is a very fundamental economic stimulus to create more of those seasonal jobs over Christmas that are so important but which may not be of concern to the complacent opposition, which is concerned just to play spoiling tactics.The tax cuts are very important to ordinary Australian men and women and their children and I hope we can get a responsible passage through the Senate of the budget measures so that the tax cuts can come into effect on 15 November, economic stimulus can be generated and those jobs can be created.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[6]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I think it has become the stuff of urban medical legend recently that obstetricians all over the country are leaving their specialty to practise in gynaecology and fertility, but that claim simply is not true.Last week I met with the President of the Royal Australian College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists as part of my regular consultations. I would suggest that the president, Dr Hinde, might have a bit better idea of what is happening in his specialty than Senator Herron. Dr Hinde informed me that it was not true. He said that, while the increased cost of medical defence was putting a great deal of fear into the specialty, they had not been leaving it yet, but they might in the future if something was not done.In terms of Senator Herrons exact remarks, it is certainly true that in the USA there has been a greatly increased tendency for people to take out cases against obstetricians, although there is no evidence of increased cases here. I think there are two reasons why the medical insurance funds have put up the premiums for obstetricians so much. One is that they were shockingly underfunded in recent years and they have had to try to make up for that underfunding in a short period of time. The second is that while the number of cases has not been great, it is true to say that sometimes the payouts, the damages awarded, are very large indeed. While the college of obstetricians is prepared to concede that there is a danger that people might leave the field in the future unless we do something about it, it is certainly not of the view that such an exodus has already occurred.I intend to look very carefully at a study which hopefully will be published by about March of next year on this question and to try to deal with it in the first half of next year. Obviously we do not want obstetricians to leave in the future. It is a specialty that is of vital interest to all of us. I think the Medicare data shows how silly is Senator Herrons claim that half the obstetricians left in the last few years.In the four years from 1988 to 1992, Medicare data shows that there was a decline of only 3.7 per cent nationally in the number of specialists who perform more than five confinements or caesareans annually. The number of obstetricians practising in Australia in 1984-85 was 722 full time and 151 part time; a total of 873. By 1992-93 that was 748 full time, 167 part time and 18 others; a total of 933. Far from half leaving, the numbers went up.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[8]/answer/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

Senator Troeth asks: how can any tax stimulate employment? What we are doing to stimulate employment goes to the general macro-economic approach in which we are arguing, in this particular year, that we should have a budget deficit of $16 billion—and that will certainly have a stimulatory effect.It is also true to say that if we took taxes off all businesses, there would be some growth in employment. But there would also be a massive shortfall in revenue to any government. It is always easier to say, `If you do not have a tax covering this or that particular industry, you will have wider employment. The main factor in the governments thinking is to make sure that the tax falls fairly right across-the-board and that the tax mix is right. That is something that Senator Troeths party has no conception of at the moment because of the policy vacuum that exists.Those opposite do not know whether they support direct tax or indirect tax. They will not even address the question of deficit reduction. They have no idea what they are going to do in relation to that.

174,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator SCHACHT","4J4","SA","ALP","N/A",1389,"—The government wants to reiterate its congratulations to all concerned with the successful Sydney bid. That has been stated by the Prime Minister and by all members of the government, and I think it is certainly a bipartisan or tripartisan position of all of us.We anticipate that, on present indications and at the present rate of expenditure, by the time of the Olympic games in the year 2000, we will have spent between now and then around $200 million on Olympic sports in Australia. The minister anticipates that because we have the Olympic games, there will be a much wider participation of Australians in sports in those Olympic games.I think most of us would be aware that, because we are hosting the Olympic games, we are automatically eligible to enter a team in all the team sports and do not have to go through the prequalifying rounds. This will mean that Australians will be able to see many more of their citizens participating in the Olympic games in every sport for the first time. In many sports which some people in Australia might call minor we will have an Australian team participating. As a result, the minister anticipates that we can expect increased funding to take account of that excellent outcome of hosting the Olympic games in Australia.We also recognise that in order to surpass our excellent effort on the last occasion that Australia hosted the Olympic games, 1956, when we won 13 gold medals, we have to get more people participating in sport. That will have to be a joint Australia-wide program between the federal government and the states. The minister has already indicated her keenness to have discussion with the states about preparing appropriate programs to encourage an increased participation of Australians, particularly in many of those sports at the Olympic games in which we will now be eligible to have teams.As far as the recommendations of the Senate committee are concerned, I will have to take that part of the question on notice and come back to the honourable senator with a direct response. But I can assure her that the government is very enthusiastic about ensuring that as many Australians as possible are able to participate in the preparations for the Olympic games, and also that we use this to make Australia a fitter society than it is at the moment.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[10]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This answer requires more than the available time to complete, but let me go to the main reasons as headings and not develop each of them as full arguments.We are improving our exports; the figures which came out today show an increase in exports at a much higher level. That is pleasing because the exports that we have performed better at are exports in the elaborately transformed manufactures section; that is where there is the most value added.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[11]/answer/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

179,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COOK","RF4","WA","ALP","N/A",1390,"—I know that it is good news, and I know that those opposite are merchants of bad news who are talking down our export performance. When the facts are put objectively, they do not like the truth. However, let me make the point that Australia has been increasing its exports of elaborately transformed manufactures—that is, the highest value added products that we can produce in this country which provide highly skilled work opportunities for Australians.That is where we are succeeding in broaching new market opportunities in Asia and the rest of the world. That is because of the micro-economic reform that we have conducted as a country, the improved efficiency of our industry, the reform of our labour market and the ability of Australian entrepreneurs to seize on this and win new markets for themselves. The other thing that has to be remembered is that the world is still, largely, in economic recession.I refer to the locomotive economies of the world, the ones we have traditionally relied on to lift economic performance globally. The economy of Japan will probably return, in the year ending 30 March 1994, a negative growth of about half a per cent. The locomotive economy in Europe is Germany. This calendar year the German economy will contract by about two per cent. The United States, the other great pillar of economic growth in advanced industrialised economies in the world, is batting along at about a 2.3 to 2.5 per cent growth.It is salutary to recognise that the growth figure for Australia as at 30 June 1993 was 3.3 per cent—at the head of the OECD table. That is to say, in the face of the world economic recession that has bedevilled the West, Australias rate of growth is the highest of any developed country in the world. Let us hear a comment of approval for Australia. Let us hear a bit of economic patriotism from those opposite. Let us hear a bit of analysis that encourages Australians to take advantage of the massive export opportunities that are growing in the Asia-Pacific region. Then this question can be seen for what it is—an attempt to slight those who have performed well for Australia and to confuse the rest of the community.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[11]/answer/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

If so, can the minister inform the Senate what the government is doing to promote the interests of Australian rice exporters?","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[12]/question/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
181,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COOK","RF4","WA","ALP","N/A",1391,"—I have seen reports in several newspapers today that the Japanese government is considering opening its market for the importation of rice. Northern Asia has suffered a poor winter and with adverse weather conditions, both in Korea and Japan, the rice harvest in both those countries is coming in at well under the anticipated level of consumption. It may well be that, this year, the Japanese government will be looking to import two million tonnes of rice. Australia would be a prime source of supply to fill that market gap.The good news is that Australian rice growers have in store sufficient stocks to meet whatever demand is called upon to be supplied into that Japanese market. The Australian government has, of course, consistently registered with the government of Japan the need for it to open its rice markets and to regard the Australian product as a product that it can draw upon to meet the needs of its own consumers. We are competitive as a rice supplier in the world, both in terms of price and in terms of the quality of our product. Indeed, it can be said that Australian grown rice suits the needs of Japan almost more than other rice from any source. It is not, however, appropriate for a government to be grateful that weather conditions have created a marketing opportunity. While one should take advantage of that marketing opportunity, there are some structural issues about the Japanese market that need to be addressed here.This time last week I was in Tokyo. I met the Prime Minister, Mr Hosokawa; the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Mr Hata; and the Minister for International Trade and Industry, Mr Kumagai. In my role as trade minister, I put to all three of them that it was important that Japan cease its policy of self-sufficiency and adopt a policy of food security, that is, not to try to produce all their food needs domestically but, rather, to have a mix of imports and domestic production as well and open their market accordingly.Secondly, the issue that begs for a comment here is the issue of the Uruguay Round. Both the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Industry and Trade in Japan are firmly committed to the completion of the Uruguay Round by 15 December. They reassured me solidly on that point. But for the round to properly be completed with a balanced outcome across all sectors and in a fair way, it is important that the issue of agriculture be addressed. Specifically, in Japan and Korea that means addressing the closed rice market. The views that Australia has consistently argued—that the market should be opened—were again put by me as a means of successfully concluding the Uruguay Round. That means a commitment by Japan for comprehensive tariffication of its market barriers for rice across the board without exception. In view of this shortfall in domestic production, I hope that can be something that the government seizes on as a positive signal to help complete the Uruguay Round this year and reduce the price for Japans own domestic producers in the interests of freer trade.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[12]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

190,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator SCHACHT","4J4","SA","ALP","N/A",1392,"—Last week I had the honour of presenting awards, on behalf of the Australian government, at a function hosted by the Business and Professional Womens Club of Canberra as part of the ACT small business week. During my speech, I referred to the published research, entitled Employment patterns and practices in small firms in Australia: an assessment of skill deficiencies and training needs , undertaken by Professor Alan Williams of the University of Newcastle. In his research he found that, of the more than 11,000 businesses surveyed, 38 per cent were owned and operated by men, 33 per cent were owned and operated by women and 28 per cent were jointly owned and operated by men and women.He also indicated that there was a marked shift towards women owning and running their own firms. If this trend continues, it is anticipated that certainly by the middle to the latter part of this decade a majority of small or micro businesses in Australia will be run and owned by women. We still do not have enough research on why this is occurring, but it is quite clear from anecdotal information around the place that women are more successful at running their own businesses than men.We believe that women are better at customer service and industrial relations. From what I have been told in discussions with the financial institutions, women are more cautious in their financial arrangements. They are better managers of the finances of a small business. They more thoroughly prepare their business plan for their small businesses than do men. One banker told me that if he had to choose between lending money for a small business to a man or a woman, he would lend to the woman because, on balance, according to the figures available, women are more likely to be more successful in running a small business.I think this is one of the significant changes in our society that has not been recognised. As small business is already providing the biggest part of economic growth and employment growth in Australia, we have to give due recognition to the fact that it is women who are doing it to ensure that we get the job growth for all Australians.The only area where we would like to see some increase in womens activity is the area of export oriented industries. A survey by the export access program shows that only about two per cent of those businesses that are successfully into export are actually owned and run by women. That is one area in which we would like to see an improvement in womens participation. Overall, this trend is very good for women but, above all else, it means a good outcome for Australia.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[14]/answer/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

194,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CROWLEY","ZF4","SA","ALP","N/A",1393,"—I am aware of the article by Sheryle Bagwell in todays Australian Financial Review . In that article, Ms Bagwell cites a tabloid newspaper which spoke of a search for Mr 2000, the executive who will be given the massive task of running the Sydney Olympic Games organisation. Indeed, one could say that the Olympic bid team was not back in Australia one day before Mr Fahey and Mr Baird were contesting for the position. It looks as though Mr Baird lost out to Mr Fahey. Perhaps it will go the other way; we will wait and see.Sheryle Bagwell says that she could not find a head-hunter willing to put any money on there being a woman chief executive for the Sydney Olympic Games organisation. Sadly, that is still not surprising. Despite the enormous gains made by women over the last decade, there is still not one woman chief executive at the helm of any of Australias top 200 companies. The top 10 companies do not have one female board member. Women make up only 1.3 per cent of senior managers.As illustrated so graphically at the Trust the Women launch the other day, there are still too few women in our parliaments. This has been mirrored so far in the management of our bid for the Olympics. According to Ms Bagwell, while there were women on the honorary committee, there were none on the bids executive board.I fully support the call that women be fully represented on the new 11-member board of directors which is to choose the new chief executive for the games organisation. I also want to see women making up 50 per cent of the many thousands of employees who will be an integral part of Australias massive games effort.I am also very keen to see young women fully participating in the games. Honourable senators opposite would know, as do my colleagues, that I have never supported the appointment of women to any position except on the basis of merit.

No-one else in the world, besides former President Reagan and Senator Ian Macdonald, still believes that that is the way one goes about raising revenue and funding jobs. Apart from the ways in which Senator Ian Macdonald significantly misquoted me, the situation is simply as follows. The budget is predicated upon conservative assumptions about growth which indicate that 100,000 jobs net will be created in the next 12 months. That is what most people expect and that is what the trends are consistent with at the moment.This particular measure has several objectives, as have most tax measures, as Senator Watson at least would know. It is quite clear that on the evidence available this measure will raise some revenue. It is a revenue raising measure—that is not very remarkable; it will do so. It is true that it also has some distribution and equity aspects.I do not apologise for the fact that it is a tax measure that has some distribution and equity measures. I do not see any reason why I should apologise. I understand why Senator Ian Macdonald is upset because it has some distribution and equity measures and he is always leaping to the defence of the upper income people rather than being concerned about ordinary Australians whose tax cuts he is conspiring to delay. Any reasonable assessment of Senator Ian Macdonalds economic analysis would quite clearly indicate that he is way out of step with any economic analysis of these measures.","N/A","ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

208,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator McMULLAN","5I4","(Australian Capital Territory-","ALP","Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services)",1395,"—It would blush at the interpretation that the honourable senator has just put upon it. Of course, as Senator Robert Ray and I have said several times, every industry in Australia would rather pay less tax and, if there were no tax on the industry, every industry could establish how it could probably create more jobs. That is undoubtedly the case. However, one would have to get more revenue from elsewhere, which would have an adverse effect elsewhere. One has to realise that we need to balance the competing objectives that governments have to raise revenue and to fund the necessary services of government, including the construction projects that Senator Hill despises which create hundreds and thousands of jobs here and around Australia and about which I am very pleased.It is true that this measure also has equity implications. It is true that this measure does something about stopping up income rorts. If that is a problem for Senator Ian Macdonald, let him explain why. I think it is a very good thing. This measure does raise revenue. It is consistent with an overall budget strategy that will generate 100,000 jobs this year. I admit that that is not enough; I wish there were more. But the net effect of the budget will be to create 100,000 jobs.It does Senator Ian Macdonald no credit to analyse one bit in isolation, but nobody should be surprised about that. Nevertheless, it is a measure which in terms of equity, revenue and overall logic takes a logical place within the overall budget deficit reduction and employment creation strategy. It will continue to be a part of that and for that reason I welcome it.","N/A","ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

His party was going to impose a tax that, in administrative terms, was much more wasteful in time and effort and resources for any small business than the FBT that we are talking about today.

Those opposite have the temerity to argue here that a limited FBT, an adjustment to the FBT, will have a drastic effect on small business when they were going to tax 900,000 small businesses and have every small business proprietor spending every Sunday night doing the bookwork for the GST. When Senator Ian MacDonald, as the shadow minister for local government, was asked about the impact of the GST, he could not explain on three different times in the one day whether or not there would be a GST on water, on rubbish collection and on local government. He got his coalition in a terrible mix-up trying to explain all of that.That was an attack on small business, yet members of the opposition get up here and say that they are the champions of small business. I would have to say that, of all opposition senators, only one is genuine about small business and that is Senator Boswell who consistently raises practical issues about small business with me and with the government. He speaks to those issues in this place as a petitioner of small business. I suspect that Senator Boswell has not been on the front bench for a long time because he could not support a GST on small business which members opposite were very up-front about supporting.For those opposite to talk about the impact of FBT on small business, when we know what they were going to hit it with had they won the last election, is just extraordinary.

218,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BISHOP","SE4","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A",1398,"—I listened with interest to the contribution of Senator Schacht dealing with an issue which is dead. The GST is no longer our policy and is irrelevant to the debate. The debate in this chamber concerns the imposition of tax by this government on small business. This is the government which said that it would not impose any new tax and then has proceeded to do so. Budget paper No. 1 states that sales tax, customs and excise, would be up 9.1 per cent. Other taxes, fees and fines, would be up 10.4 per cent. This is the government that was not going to impose any new taxes and which is increasing indirect tax by 9.1 per cent.If that is not good enough, it has a backdoor version as well. Today there was a draft ruling by the Commissioner of Taxation defining local council car parks as commercial car parks for the purposes of the fringe benefits tax for parking arrangements. In other words, by not having the ruling system subject to the parliament and tabling and disallowance, by discretion, the government is able, through its agency, to get further taxes imposed and collected by the Commissioner of Taxation. There is no way in the world that a local government car park which is provided for the benefit of shoppers and other community benefits is a commercial enterprise in terms of the legislation that was debated in this chamber.Again and again we see more taxation imposed by the government which said that there would be no new taxation, by both direct means, through the budget bills, and indirect means, through the use of the new ruling system. That is exactly the point that Senator Ian Macdonald was making and he made it very well. The answer that was given by Senator McMullan was poor and the other contributions that were made by Senator Schacht were irrelevant.On the bottom line, this government must be held accountable for the imposition of new tax when it fibbed to the Australian people and said it had no intention of introducing it. Indirect tax is up by 9.1 per cent in terms of collection, and from other fees and charges it is up an additional 10.4 per cent, an increase by any persons understanding.","N/A","ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We think it would have helped the tourism industry. It was widely disliked by many people in the tourism industry. We had a very public fight with the tourism industry before the election, but we stood by our guns. Before the election, even many people in the opposition might have thought that it would be a lot easier to cave in to the tourism industry and to back off on the GST on tourism.

Of course, the tourism industry will always be extremely sceptical of this government now that it has this threat.Being on the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, week after week I see all of these tax policies weaving their way through our committee. One of the reasons—and it goes to the core of what Senator Macdonald was saying—why we get these taxes is that very few people in the Labor government, and particularly people in Treasury, have much idea of what makes small business tick. Senator Ferguson and I were discussing a question to the Minister for Science and Small Business, and that is, `How do you really get a small business in Australia?. We were going to ask Senator Schacht. Of course, the answer is, `Give him a big business and just wait.If the government continues to try to introduce all of these little taxes which impose new liabilities—and shock liabilities—on these small businesses, it will destroy the very engine that drives Australia and the small business sector. I believe Senator Schacht when he says that he cares about getting new small businesses going, but we really have to spend some time out there in the community. Those of us who work in Canberra for hundreds of days a year do not get to do that very often. If we do go out there and see the impact that these taxes have on these small businesses, we will realise that we are very much killing the goose that lays the golden egg.","N/A","ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1/speech[5]/talk.start[6]/para","N/A","N/A"
230,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator LOOSLEY","BS4","(New South Wales)","ALP","N/A",1399,"—I would like to take up the final point that Senator Campbell made in his contribution to the debate because I think it was a valid one. It was in terms of the amount of time that we are obliged to spend in Canberra, particularly in this chamber, dealing with various matters. That does prevent the vast majority of us from doing other things we would prefer to do in terms of staying in contact with our constituencies, including the small business constituency, which is very important in Australia as a generator of investment, jobs and economic growth.Part of the reason we have to spend so much time in the national capital, in the Senate chamber, is the gridlock that has enveloped the Senate since the chamber resumed after the election of 1993. Circumstances have changed. We heard today that five straight election losses have caused the coalition to embark upon a totally negative campaign of destruction and vandalism. That is the main reason we are obliged to spend so much time here in Canberra in this insulated and isolated political environment. There is no doubt about that. If one looks at the amount of time spent on frivolous and fatuous points of order during question time, on nonsensical notices of motion and so on and so forth, one can see that gridlock in the American style grips the Australian Senate already. That is one of the main reasons we are not able to stay in touch with those parts of the Australian constituency which are of greatest significance.This debate has to be seen in the context of tax policy overall—in the context of taxes having come down since 1983 from the high period of Fraser, Howard and Stone when taxes routinely were over 60 per cent. They have dropped dramatically. We can now say, with absolute clarity and certainty, that the OECD has made the observation that Australia is the lowest taxed country in the western industrial world. That is not an assessment of the Australian government, although the government is happy to endorse and underline it. That is an assessment of the OECD—the lowest taxed country in the western industrial world.We had another wonderful exercise by the coalition, in this immediate debate subsequent to question time today, of yet another post-mortem where it publicly agonised again over why it lost the general election. It is an exercise in delusion to say, as some have said during the course of the afternoon, that it was simply the GST. I was pleased to hear Senator Bishop, as shadow leader of the opposition, yet again announce what opposition policy is—the GST no longer applies.That raises the question of which parts of Fightback still do apply. Is it still committed, for example, to the destruction of Medicare? That was a costly mistake that the coalition made in trying to sell that to the Australian people. The Australian electorate will never accept the destruction of Medicare. I would be particularly interested in Senator Herrons view on that. I know he is on record in the Senate as saying that the American health system is the best in the world for those who can afford it. I think I quote him accurately in that respect. So we are happy to contest that ground yet again.In industrial relations circumstances, is the coalition still committed to the destruction of the Australian trade union movement? It was when it went into the 13 March election and it was judged for it.","N/A","ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1/speech[6]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

All I have done during the course of this debate is take up points that have already been made by those opposite in their contributions—a simple matter of making judgments in respect of tax policy overall. It is true that in the context of the general election last time around much of the small business community not only voted for the ALP for the return of the Keating government but also actively canvassed the vote for the return of the Labor government. That is not something that happens routinely in Australian politics. It was unusual in that circumstance but, given the sorts of contributions we are seeing opposite, it would not surprise me in the least to see that repeated in 1996.Senator Campbell says he reminds himself every day of 13 March. That was a very honest observation. I commend him for it. If I were in opposition for the beginning of the second decade, I would remind myself of 13 March 1993 every day that the parliament sits and every day of political activity because there are some useful lessons to be learned.

I draw the Senates attention to introduction of FBT on luncheon expenses. I seem to remember similar fairly hysterical claims, particularly by those opposite, when that measure was introduced. There were demonstrations around the country—in many cases addressed by those opposite—about the tens of thousands of jobs which were going to be lost in the hospitality and restaurant industries. It is interesting that over the last 10-year period the number of jobs in the hospitality industry has grown by more than 100,000. So where is the enormous loss of jobs as a result of that measure?I am simply drawing to the attention of the Senate the fact that on that occasion we had very extravagant claims from the hospitality industry and from those opposite about the detrimental effect of a tax measure. I do not know what that measure raised in tax, but it was certainly a significant amount. I suspect that the FBT on luncheon expenses, given the number of people who appeared to be having fairly lengthy lunches, would certainly raise more in revenue than the FBT applying to car parking.But with these sorts of issues, we have heard cries of some of the alleged inequitable measures that affect lower income earners—The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Chapman) —Order!

In reply to that question, this line in the Hansard of last night was quoted:Half the obstetricians in Australia have given up obstetrics in the last five years.It was a very grubby exercise by the minister to attack me in that way. He would well know what was said in the Medical Journal of Australia of 16 August this year, which I was quoting from. I will read the extract. It states:After two recent cases in Western Australia, the (then) President of the Australian Medical Association . . . , Mr Michael OHalloran, quoted in the media figures which demonstrate that less than half the 80 or so specialist obstetricians and gynaecologists in Western Australia practise obstetrics, and further, that there are only three privately practising obstetricians in Western Australia who are less than 40 years of age.That article was entitled `Obstetrics in crisis? It continues:At the present time in Australia, there are approximately 2000 medical providers of obstetric services, of whom about 750 are specialists and the rest general practitioners. There are currently about 1100 members of the RACOG. Thus only about two-thirds of them currently practise obstetrics.If the minister knew anything at all about the subject, he would have been aware that that was what I was referring to. There is a crisis in Australia in relation to that. It is no good jumping up and quoting the figures from the Royal Australian College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. As we can see from these figures, there are more than twice those numbers among general practitioners who are practising obstetrics.It is all very well to do a bit of political point scoring, but the reality is that there is a crisis and it has to be addressed. In reply to that question, the minister—I will give him his due—said something about addressing the litigation fees that are driving people out of obstetrics. It is not surprising that the minister should undergo such a grubby attack because at a function held by the Australian Private Hospitals Association—which I think all his Labor colleagues should be aware of—he said, `I have no philosophy.The kneecapper of the New South Wales Right, the arm twister, the oleaginous prevaricator who goes around quietly running the engine, the one who successfully got rid of a former leader of the Labor Party and then switched sides and got rid of the previous leader of the Labor Party, is now supporting—for a time—the temporary leader of the Labor Party. I think it has been a totally grubby exercise on his part, but I suppose I should feel honoured as a quiet, retiring, second row backbencher on this side of the parliament that a minister should use the convenor of the Left wing of the Western Australian branch of his party to carry out this grubby exercise.","N/A","PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/speech/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

246,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COLLINS","OF4","(Northern Territory-","ALP","Minister for Transport and Communications)",1402,"—I move:That these bills be now read a second time.I seek leave to have the second reading speeches incorporated in Hansard .Leave granted.The speeches read as follows —TAXATION (DEFICIT REDUCTION) BILL (No. 1) 1993Mr. President, this bill is part of a package of bills designed to replace the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993, which was introduced into the Senate on 7 September 1993. That bill contained the Governments key Budget taxation measures.As part of its campaign to obstruct the passage of the Governments 1993-4 Budget, the Opposition referred the Deficit Reduction Bill to a Senate Committee. The Committee was asked to determine whether, by combining measures dealing with several subjects of taxation, the bill contravened section 55 of the Constitution.Parliament has been passing taxation bills combining several subjects of taxation since at least 1984. Only now has this been raised as an issue.The Governments senior legal advisers, and Parliamentary Counsel, gave advice to the Committee that the Deficit Reduction Bill was clearly valid and that none of its measures imposed taxation.The Senate Committee concluded, correctly, that only the High Court can determine issues of constitutional validity.The Committee also concluded that there was a risk that the bill would be declared invalid. This conclusion was contrary to the advice of the Governments Chief General Counsel and of other experts who presented their views to the Committee.The Government does not accept the Committees conclusion. Moreover, the Committee gave no reasons for its conclusions and gave the Government no guidance as to how to split the bill.Views put to the Committee that the bill is invalid fall into two categories.first, that any increase in the formal rate of a tax is an imposition of tax. This view draws an illogical distinction between a rate increase and an enlargement of a tax base.second, that any increase in liability to taxation is an imposition of tax. If this argument is accepted, then most of the tax laws passed over the past 50 years are also invalid. This is an absurd argument.The Government is entitled to rely on the clear and unequivocal advice of its legal advisers.Nevertheless, the Oppositions actions on the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill have created considerable uncertainty.The Government has decided to remove that uncertainty and withdraw the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill and to re-introduce the Budget measures in a package of related bills.Apart from the measures included in the `test case bill, the re-packaged bills would not be challenged by those who argue that the only amendments in the package which impose tax are those which increase a rate of tax.The Government has deliberately rejected the extreme view that any increase in the incidence of a tax is an imposition of tax. It has, therefore, refrained from structuring these bills to avoid a challenge from this quarter. If that view is correct, then virtually all of the Commonwealths tax laws are invalid. It would be pointless to address those concerns without rewriting the corpus of all the existing tax laws.The bills comprised in this package are:the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bills (Nos. 1 to 3) 1993; and5 sales tax bills.Each of the bills has been marked with a `T to signify that they are not bills which impose taxation.The Government also believes that the constitutional issues must be resolved once and for all, so that the Parliament can focus on the substance, and not the form, of Government initiatives. To allow the issue to be settled quickly, and without affecting the integrity of the Budget package, one of the bills (the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 2) 1993) has been drafted as a test bill to facilitate a High Court challenge. This has been done by combining 2 minor rate increases involving different subjects of taxation. These measures do not affect revenue until after 1 July 1994.I turn now to the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1) 1993, which contains the following measures:Increases in the Medicare levy low income thresholds.Removal of the concessional treatment that applies to the taxation of unused annual and long service leave.Changes in the taxation treatment of excess domestic travel allowances and expenses and certain non-deductible expenses.Denial of income tax deductions for car parking expenses for self-employed persons.Changes in the taxation treatment of credit unions.I turn now to a more detailed discussion of these measures.Medicare levyThis bill will amend the Medicare Levy Act 1986 to increase the low income thresholds below which people will not be required to pay any levy.For 1993-94, individuals with taxable incomes of up to $12,688 and couples and sole parents with family incomes of up to $21,366 will not be required to pay the levy.There will be no change to the provisions which increase the threshold for couples and sole parents by $2100 for each dependent child or student.The estimated cost of the increased low income thresholds is $30 million in 1993-94, $60 million in 1994-95 and $45 million in 1995-96 and 1996-97.Unused annual leave and unused long service leave paymentsThe bill will remove the concessional tax treatment that applies to lump sum payments of unused annual leave and unused long service leave made on termination of employment.Payments in respect of unused long service leave accrued on or after 18 August 1993 and payments in respect of unused annual leave made on or after 18 August 1978 will be taxed as normal income. However, there is no change to the tax treatment of these payments if the taxpayers termination of employment is as a consequence of bona fide redundancy or invalidity or is under an approved early retirement scheme. Neither is the concessional tax treatment of long service leave accrued before 18 August 1993 affected.The proposed amendments ensure that the tax system does not discourage taxpayers from using their leave entitlements for their intended purpose.The estimated gain to the revenue is $80 million in 1993-94, $180 million in 1994-95, $165 million in 1995-96 and $180 million in 1996-97.Taxation of credit unionsThe bill will remove the exemption from income tax for income in the nature of interest received by credit unions on loans made to their senators and will allow credit unions to be taxed as cooperatives where they satisfy the requirements for that treatment. To give credit unions time to adjust to the new measures, there will be a phasing-in period.The measure will remove the competitive advantage credit unions enjoy as a result of the special tax treatment given to them, and is consistent with the Governments general approach of ensuring tax neutrality between business enterprises.The estimated gain to revenue is $25 million in 1995-96 and $30 million in 1996-97.Non-deductible expensesThe income tax law will also be amended to allow deductions to employers for expenses incurred in providing their employees with a range of benefits such as entertainment, club fees, leisure facilities, travel expenses of accompanying relatives, Higher Education Contribution Scheme payments and Student Financial Supplement Scheme payments. These expenses have previously not been deductible.Benefits of this nature, if provided to employees, are fringe benefits under the fringe benefits tax law. However, the taxable value of these benefits is reduced to the extent to which they are non-deductible to employers under the income tax law.This amendment, which will apply from 1 April 1994, will allow a deduction to employers for these expenses under the income tax law. In consequence, it will subject these benefits to a fringe benefits tax liability.The estimated gain to revenue is $435 million in 1994-95, $240 million in 1995-96 and $240 million in 1996-97.Excess domestic travelThis bill will amend the fringe benefits tax law to create a new class of fringe benefit based on the amount of a travelling allowance received by an employee for travel in Australia which is in excess of a prescribed amount. The amount will be prescribed by regulation and will be set following consultations with interested parties.The income tax law will also be amended to disallow expenditure incurred by employees or self-employed persons on travel expenses (ie. accommodation, food, drink, and expenditure incidental to travel undertaken in Australia) which are in excess of the prescribed amount.These amendments will apply from 1 April 1994.The estimated gain to revenue is $60 million in 1994-95 and $45 million in 1995-96 and 1996-97.Car parking expenses for self-employedThe bill will also amend the income tax law so that, from 1 July 1994, a tax deduction for the cost of car parking for persons other than employees will be denied in certain circumstances. This will place car parking by self-employed persons on a comparable tax basis to car parking for employees.A deduction for car parking expenses incurred by self-employed persons will only be denied where certain conditions apply. The rules for determining the non-deductible amount of a car parking expense in this bill are similar to the rules applicable to employers in valuing a car parking fringe benefit.The estimated gain to revenue of this measure is $70 million in 1995-96 and $35 million in 1996-97.The bill will come into operation on the day on which it receives Royal Assent.Full details of the amendments are contained in the Explanatory Memorandum being circulated to honourable senators.Mr President, I commend the bill to the Senate.TAXATION (DEFICIT REDUCTION) BILL (No. 2) 1993This bill is the second in the package of bills which replace the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993.This bill contains two of the taxation measures announced by the Treasurer in the 1993-4 Budget and which were previously contained in the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993.These measures are:the increase in the rate of fringe benefits tax; andthe change in the taxation treatment of friendly societies, including an increase in the rate of tax on their life insurance business to bring it into line with the rate of tax on similar business undertaken by life companies.This bill has been deliberately designed to facilitate a challenge in the High Court on the constitutional issues raised before the Senate Committee that considered the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill. It does this by combining two rate increases, for different subjects of taxation, in the same bill. The Governments legal advisers believe that this bill is constitutional but the Government considers that any uncertainty in this area must be resolved quickly.The measures in this bill will have no practical effect before the middle of next year, and will have only minimal revenue impacts. Therefore, there is time for the constitutional issues to be tested without affecting taxpayers.I turn now to a more detailed explanation of the two measures.FBT rate of taxThis bill will amend the Fringe Benefits Tax Act 1986 to increase the current rate of fringe benefits tax from 48.25 per cent to 48.4 per cent. The increase will take effect from1 April 1994 and will maintain the alignment of the FBT rate with the top marginal personal tax rate and Medicare levy rate. The increase reflects the increase in the Medicare levy rate, from 1.25 per cent to 1.4 per cent, on 1 July 1993.The estimated gain to revenue is $9 million in 1994-95 and $8 million in 1995-96 and 1996-97.Taxation of friendly societies and other registered organisationsThe bill will change the taxation treatment of friendly societies and other registered organisations.It will phase-out, over three years from the 1994-95 income year, the concessional tax rate for friendly societies in respect of their life insurance and certain other insurance business.As a consequence of that change, the bill will, from 1 July 1994, extend to friendly societies the same entitlement to deductions as is allowed to life insurance companies for the costs of getting in their life insurance premiums.Another change will increase, from 1 July 1995, the rebate available to holders of friendly society life policies who are assessed on bonuses. This increase is a consequence of the phasing-out of the concessional tax rate.The estimated gain to revenue from these measures is $25 million in 1995-96 and $69 million in 1996-97.The bill will come into operation when it receives the Royal Assent.Full details of the amendments are contained in the Explanatory Memorandum being circulated to honourable senators.Mr President, I commend the bill to the Senate.TAXATION (DEFICIT REDUCTION) BILL (No. 3) 1993This bill is the third in the package of bills which replace the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993.It incorporates changes to the timing of the first stage of the tax cuts announced and legislated for in 1992, the deferral of the second round of those tax cuts, and the introduction of a low income rebate.I turn now to a more detailed explanation of the provisions.Personal tax cutsThe amendments contained in the bill will change the timing for the commencement of the two stage reduction in the tax rates announced in One Nation on 26 February 1992.The first stage will now commence on 15 November 1993, seven and a half months earlier than scheduled. The bill provides that the second stage of tax cuts will commence at the beginning of a financial year to be fixed by regulation.Because the first stage of the tax cuts will commence on 15 November 1993, the bill contains the new composite rate scales to apply for 1993-94 and the first stage rates for the 1994-95 and later income years.The new rates to apply from 15 November 1993 will benefit taxpayers with taxable incomes in excess of $20,700.The tax cuts will cost the revenue $1.55 billion this financial year. The ongoing cost to revenue of the first stage of the personal tax cuts is $2.9 billion in 1994-95 and $3.12 billion in 1995-96.Low income rebateThe bill will also provide a rebate of up to $150 to taxpayers whose taxable income for 1993-94 and subsequent income years is less than $24,450. The new rebate will mainly assist those taxpayers who do not benefit from the One Nation tax cuts.Taxpayers with a taxable income of up to $20,700 will be entitled to a rebate of $150 in their assessments for the 1993-94 and later income years. The rebate will reduce at the rate of 4 cents in each dollar of taxable income in excess of $20,700 and completely phase-out when taxable income reaches $24,450.The estimated revenue costs for this measure are $530 million in 1994-95, $515 million in 1995-96 and $500 million in 1996-97.This bill will not come into operation until the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1) 1993, and the 5 sales tax bills in this package, receive the Royal Assent.Full details of the amendments are contained in the Explanatory Memorandum being circulated to honourable senators.Mr President, I commend the bill to the Senate.SALES TAX (CUSTOMS) (DEFICIT REDUCTION) BILL 1993Mr President, this bill is the fourth in the package of bills designed to replace the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993. This bill, together with four other bills in this package, will give effect to changes to the sales tax law announced in the 1993-4 Budget.The Government does not accept that any of the bills in this package imposes tax. Nevertheless, it has structured the sales tax bills so as to put the matter beyond challenge by those who would argue that an increase in a formal rate of tax is an imposition of tax.For constitutional reasons, sales tax is imposed by four Acts. Those Acts impose sales tax to the extent that it is:a duty of customs;a duty of excise;a tax on in situ swimming pools;a tax that is none of the above.This bill modifies the Sales Tax (Exemption and Classifications) Act 1992 to the extent that that Act deals with tax imposed by the Sales Tax Imposition (Customs) Act 1992.Mr President, I now turn to the three sales tax changes covered by this bill, and the other sales tax bills in this package.The first change will increase all sales tax rates by one percentage point, with effect from 18 August 1993. This is expected to raise $435 million this year and $585 million in 1994-95. A further one percentage point increase for all sales tax rates will come into effect on 1 July 1995.The second change will increase the rates of sales tax on wine, also with effect from 18 August. Compared with beer and spirits, wine is lightly taxed. While it is presently subject to sales tax, it does not carry any excise.It is proposed to increase the rate of tax on wine with an alcoholic content of greater than 1.15 per cent from 20 per cent to 31 per cent.The rate of tax on low-alcohol wine, that is wine with an alcoholic content of 1.15 per cent or less, is to increase from 10 per cent to 21 per cent. Some low-alcohol wine is currently taxable at 20 per cent and its rate of tax will increase to 21 per cent in line with the proposed increase for all sales tax rates.The gain to revenue from this measure is estimated to be $70 million in 1993-94, $95 million in 1994-95, $105 million in 1995-96 and $110 million in 1996-97.The last sales tax change will vary the rate of tax applicable to luxury motor vehicles, also with effect from 18 August 1993. Luxury vehicles are currently taxable at 30 per cent on their entire wholesale value. The current sales tax treatment results in a substantial pricing distortion: the addition of one dollar to the wholesale price of a passenger motor vehicle now priced at the threshold would increase the sales tax liability by $4873.It is proposed to remove this distortion by applying a split rate of sales tax to luxury motor vehicles. Broadly, the ordinary rates of sales tax applicable to motor vehicles will apply up to the wholesale luxury threshold. A rate of 45 per cent will apply to that portion of the wholesale value over the luxury threshold.The gain to revenue from this measure is estimated to be $5 million in 1993-94 and $10 million in 1994-95, 1995-96 and 1996-97.Full details of the amendments are contained in the Explanatory Memorandum being circulated to honourable senators.Mr President, I commend the bill to the Senate.SALES TAX (EXCISE) (DEFICIT REDUCTION) BILL 1993Mr President, this bill is the fifth in the package of bills designed to replace the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993. This bill, together with four other bills in this package, will give effect to the changes to the sales tax law announced in the 1993-4 budget.This bill modifies the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1992 to the extent that that Act deals with tax imposed by the Sales Tax Imposition (Excise) Act 1992.The bill will give effect to the same changes I mentioned in my second reading speech on the Sales Tax (Customs) (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993.Full details are contained in the Explanatory Memorandum being circulated to honourable senators.Mr President, I commend the bill to the Senate.SALES TAX (IN SITU POOLS) (DEFICIT REDUCTION) BILL 1993Mr President, this bill is the sixth in the package of bills designed to replace the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993. This bill, together with four other bills in this package, will give effect to changes to the sales tax law announced in the 1993-4 budget.This bill modifies the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1992 to the extent that that Act deals with tax imposed by the Sales Tax Imposition (In Situ Pools) Act 1992.The bill will give effect to the increases in the general rates of sales tax as they apply to dealings with in-ground swimming pools.Full details are contained in the Explanatory Memorandum being circulated to honourable senators.Mr President, I commend the bill to the Senate.SALES TAX (GENERAL) (DEFICIT REDUCTION) BILL 1993Mr President, this bill is the seventh in the package of bills designed to replace the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993. This bill, together with four other bills in this package, will give effect to the changes to the sales tax law announced in the 1993-4 budget.This bill modifies the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1992 to the extent that that act deals with tax imposed by the Sales Tax Imposition (General) Act 1992.The bill will give effect to the same changes I mentioned in my second reading speech on the Sales Tax (Customs) (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993.Full details are contained in the Explanatory Memorandum being circulated to honourable senators.Mr. President, I commend the bill to the Senate.SALES TAX ASSESSMENT AMENDMENT (DEFICIT REDUCTION) BILL 1993Mr President, this bill is the last in the package of eight bills designed to replace the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993. This bill, together with four other bills in this package, will give effect to the changes to the sales tax law announced in the 1993-4 budget.This bill will make consequential changes to the Sales Tax Assessment Act 1992 to give effect to changes to the sales tax treatment of luxury motor vehicles.Full details are contained in the Explanatory Memorandum being circulated to honourable senators.Mr President, I commend the bill to the Senate.Debate (on motion by Senator Reid ) adjourned.","N/A","TAXATION (DEFICIT REDUCTION) BILL (NO. 1) 1993 TAXATION (DEFICIT REDUCTION) BILL (NO. 2) 1993 TAXATION (DEFICIT REDUCTION) BILL (NO. 3) 1993 SALES TAX (CUSTOMS) (DEFICIT REDUCTION) BILL 1993 SALES TAX (EXCISE) (DEFICIT REDUCTION) BILL 1993 SALES TAX (IN SITU POOLS) (DEFICIT REDUCTION) BILL 1993 SALES TAX (GENERAL) (DEFICIT REDUCTION) BILL 1993 SALES TAX ASSESSMENT AMENDMENT (DEFICIT REDUCTION) BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I will only outline the significant parts of this bill, as a number of the amendments it contains are merely technical or made as a result of other legislative amendments.Last year, amendments were made to the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 to simplify and streamline the procedure for enforcing determinations of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in the Federal Court. Briefly, that procedure provides that the determination, on being registered in the Federal Court, becomes enforceable as an order of the court after 28 days, unless the respondent to the determination applies for review of the determination within this period. I am concerned that this strict 28 day time limit may cause injustice in some circumstances, so I have introduced amendments to allow the Federal Court to review a determination outside this 28 day time limit in exceptional circumstances.The bill will make a number of amendments to the Privacy Act.The procedures for making a representative complaint and for enforcing determinations under the Privacy Act will be replaced by new provisions modelled on last years amendments to the Disability Discrimination Act, the Racial Discrimination Act and Sex Discrimination Act. In addition, the amendments I have just outlined to allow a respondent to seek the leave of the court to have a determination reviewed outside the usual 28 day period, will be included in the Privacy Act.The bill will also clarify that compensation awarded by the Privacy Commissioner to a complainant as part of a determination can include compensation for loss or damage suffered by way of injury to feelings or humiliation. This will bring the Privacy Act provisions into line with the position under the Crimes Act 1914 (in relation to spent convictions) and the Disability Discrimination Act, the Racial Discrimination Act and the Sex Discrimination Act.These amendments will ensure greater consistency in the legislation administered by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.The bill will amend the rules under the Privacy Act governing disclosures of credit information by credit providers to state and territory government authorities administering schemes which assist low-income earners to obtain mortgage credit. It was brought to the Governments notice that the Privacy Act, as it is currently structured, does not sufficiently cater to the information needs of a number of states that operate, and effectively underwrite, mortgage assistance schemes. The amendment will resolve the information needs of the governments without unreasonably infringing the privacy of individual borrowers.I am introducing an amendment which will delay the commencement date of the superannuation amendments which were inserted in the Sex Discrimination Act in 1991. These provisions were to commence in June this year in order to give superannuation funds time to develop options to allow existing members to transfer to non-discriminatory schemes. The guidelines to be formulated by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to assist funds to develop non-discriminatory options were not finalised in sufficient time. Accordingly, I have introduced an amendment to delay commencement of the provisions until 1 July 1994 to allow time for the funds to be in a position to comply with the new regime.The amendments to the High Court of Australia Act 1979 will change the administrative structure of the High Court by amalgamating the existing offices and responsibilities of the Clerk of the Court and the Registrar into one office which is to be called the Chief Executive and Principal Registrar. This will streamline the administration of the court by avoiding duplication of the functions currently performed by the Clerk and the Registrar. The Chief Justice has specifically requested and approved these amendments.I commend the bill to the Senate.I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill.OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY (MARITIME INDUSTRY) BILL 1993Australians and the Australian economy pay dearly for work-related fatalities, injuries and industrial diseases. The Industry Commission, in its recently released draft report into workers compensation in Australia, has noted that every year there are at least 500 deaths, 200,000 injuries and an unknown number of people who fall ill principally because of hazards they have been exposed to at work.The monetary costs are estimated to be of the order of $10 billion annually.Employees, their families, employers, insurers and society in general all bear this burden.Non-monetary costs, such as the pain and suffering of an injured employee or the loss of a loved one killed in a work-related accident, cannot be calculated.In the Australian shipping industry alone, over the past 5 years there has been an average of 1,000 injuries a year reported to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. Many of these injuries could have been avoided.The purpose of this bill is to make the maritime industry a healthier and safer industry to work in.The bill has two key elements:Firstly, it establishes a consultative framework for the ship operator and maritime industry workers to cooperate in developing a safer working environment and better work practices.Secondly, it sets out the duties of care to be observed by all who work on board ships and offshore industry mobile units. This element, in effect, codifies the common law.Mr President, over the past decade or so, all Australian states, territories and the Commonwealth have developed new style OHS legislation based on International Labour Organisation Convention No 155—the Occupational Safety and Health Convention 1981.This national approach was reinforced in 1985, when this government established the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission to provide national coordination, facilitate national action and raise public awareness of OHS issues.The arrangements set out in the bill are based on the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991 and are similar to the arrangements provided under the occupational health and safety laws of the Australian states and territories.Last year, parliament passed legislation introducing a new workers compensation scheme for seafarers. One of the vital elements of that scheme is its mandatory rehabilitation arrangements, aimed at getting injured workers restored to health and back to work as quickly as possible.The new OHS arrangements will complement the new seafarers compensation legislation by addressing the causes of accidents and thus reducing workplace injuries.To reinforce this complementary element, the administration of the new maritime OHS arrangements will be combined with the administration of the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1992.The authority will have its functions expanded to reflect its new responsibilities and its name will be changed to the Seafarers Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Authority.Mr President, I will now describe the major features of the bill.General duties of careThe provisions contained in Part 2 of the bill set out in general terms the mutual responsibilities of ship operators, employees and contractors, as well as the responsibilities of manufacturers and suppliers of plant and substances used on ships.In essence, all parties must take all reasonable steps to ensure that the workplace and the work performed there do not endanger the safety or health of the workers, or of any other person in the vicinity.Included in the employers responsibilities is the important requirement to give employees the necessary information, instruction, training and supervision to perform their work safely and in a way that does not risk their health.Mr President, as part of those responsibilities, industry employers and the maritime unions have been jointly developing industry-wide training packages suitable for use on board ships.I congratulate the industry on this initiative, which will allow seafarers to keep up to date with their OHS training during their off-duty periods.Workplace arrangementsThe bill provides a framework for employers and employees to cooperate and consult in addressing health and safety matters in the workplace. It does this through the establishment of designated work groups and health and safety committees, and the selection of health and safety representatives.The workplace arrangements provide mechanisms for the health and safety representatives of the shipboard work groups to work with shipboard management in ensuring safe working practices and in identifying and eliminating work hazards.I do not intend to describe these arrangements in detail. However, it is important to note a number of aspects in relation to the powers of a health and safety representative.The representative has the power to issue a provisional improvement notice requiring the person in command to take corrective action to stop or to avoid an unsafe practice.If the person in command and a health and safety representative cannot agree on the solution to a problem, the bill provides for intervention by an inspector.In addition, if the representative believes there is an immediate threat to health and safety, the representative may order a cessation of the activity in question. This action can only be taken in an emergency and only if a supervisor cannot immediately be located.The cessation of work must be immediately reported to a supervisor so that an assessment can be made as to whether it is safe to resume the activity.Standards and codes of practiceAn important aspect of the bill, in terms of the governments commitment to encouraging a uniform national approach to OHS, is that it provides for the adoption of suitable standards and codes of practice which have been declared by the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission.However, account will also need to be taken of the standards imposed on shipping by international maritime safety conventions and international labour conventions, through the Navigation Act.InspectorateWhile the legislations co-regulatory approach, which I have already outlined, emphasises cooperation in ensuring health and safety in the workplace, there needs to be effective enforcement of standards. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) will have inspectorate responsibilities under the bill.AMSA has extensive experience in dealing with health and safety matters on Australian and foreign ships in its administration of the Navigation Act and the judgement and skills of AMSAs marine surveyors are widely acknowledged throughout the industry.AMSA is developing appropriate OHS training courses for its surveyors, to reinforce their existing knowledge and experience.AppealsThe bill provides for appeals against the decisions of inspectors. Appeals may be made to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, referred to in the bill as the `reviewing authority.SanctionsThe bill provides that financial penalties can be imposed on employers or employees who breach the legislation.Manufacturers and suppliers will also be liable to prosecution and fines for contravening the legislation.If a health and safety representative abuses his or her powers, the representative can be disqualified for up to five years.ConclusionMr President, over the past decade the Labor Government has introduced a number of far-reaching reforms for the shipping industry and the waterfront.These reforms have resulted in large productivity gains and significant improvements in industry sector competitiveness.In the shipping industry, there has been nearly a 40 per cent reduction in crew sizes on modern ships, compared with the situation ten years ago.This bill is another step in the reform program. It will bring the maritime industry into line with the modern OHS arrangements applicable in the states and in Commonwealth employment, ensuring a safer working environment for seafarers.This, in turn, will further reduce costs to the maritime industry and the many industries it serves.I commend this bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY (MARITIME INDUSTRY)CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS BILL 1993Mr President, this bill makes a number of consequential amendments to the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1992.They relate to changes to the name, functions and constitution of the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Authority. The authority will now be called the Seafarers Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Authority, to reflect the expanded range of responsibilities which it will perform upon enactment of the Occupational Health and Safety (Maritime Industry) Bill 1993.The provisions of this bill are described in detail in the explanatory memorandum.I commend the bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum.MARITIME LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1993The purpose of this Bill is to complete the process of bringing Australias maritime zones into line with those to which Australia is entitled under international law as reflected in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The Bill makes changes to existing law in four principal areas. These are establishment of rights in an exclusive economic zone, adoption of a revised definition of the continental shelf, assertion of rights in a contiguous zone and adoption of new international legal provisions for the drawing of territorial sea baselines.The principal legislation to be amended is the Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973. The Bill amends, in a consequential way, a number of other pieces of legislation.At present the Seas and Submerged Lands Act refers to the 1958 Geneva Conventions on Territorial Sea and Continental Shelf. References to those Conventions are no longer appropriate. In 1982 a new United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea was adopted and signed by Australia. Australia has not yet ratified the Convention. That Convention, however, now has 56 ratifications and is likely to enter into force in the near future (it needs 60 ratifications to do so). It is, apart from the provisions relating to mining of the deep seabed, generally accepted as reflective of international law. The Government considers that in relation to maritime zones the Convention should govern Australian practice.At present, consultations are taking place under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations with a view to overcoming some of the difficulties that have arisen under the Convention in relation to the provisions dealing with deep seabed mining. If these consultations are successful Australia and other developed States will be in a position to give serious consideration to ratifying the Convention and hence ensuring that it is universally accepted as the law on the subject. It is therefore appropriate, at this time, for Australia to amend its domestic law to bring its practice in relation to maritime zones into conformity with that provided for in the 1982 Convention. As I indicated earlier Australia considers the maritime zone aspects of the Convention to be reflective of customary international law.Australia has, over the years, gradually asserted its various maritime entitlements under international law. Thus, in 1983 certain territorial sea baselines were proclaimed and in 1990 a 12 nautical mile territorial sea was established in place of the previous 3 nautical mile territorial sea. As long ago as 1979 Australia established a 200 nm fishing zone. The current Bill will complete the process of bringing Australias maritime zones up-to-date. It replaces operative provisions in Commonwealth legislation which refer to the 1958 Conventions with references to the 1982 Convention.The Bill makes clear that Australia asserts the full rights to which it is entitled under international law in a 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone. As stated in the preamble to the Bill, the rights that Australia has in such a zone include not just sovereign rights over both living and non-living resources but also jurisdiction as provided for in international law in relation to the establishment and use of artificial islands, installations and structures, marine scientific research and protection and preservation of the marine environment. The sovereign rights and the jurisdiction which a coastal State possesses in its exclusive economic zone in regard to these matters are set out in detail in the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention, the relevant parts of which form a schedule to the Bill. It will be for future legislation to deal expressly with matters such as pollution control in the exclusive economic zone.The Bill also adopts the definition of the continental shelf in the 1982 Convention. The 1958 Convention defines the outer limit of the continental shelf in terms of a depth of 200 metres or beyond that to a depth capable of exploitation. This open ended definition has proved unsatisfactory and customary international law has recognised that the limit of the continental shelf is the edge of the continental margin, and that it does not include the deep seabed. The 1982 Convention contains in Article 76 a precise definition of the continental shelf. This is a minimum 200 nautical miles regardless of the physical configuration of the shelf. Beyond that distance, where the configuration of the continental shelf allows, however, the limit may extend to a distance not exceeding 350 nautical miles from the baseline or 100 nautical miles from the 2,500 metre isobath. This limit is calculated either by reference to the depth of sediments or the distance from the foot of the continental slope, defined by gradient. Adoption of the 1982 definition will enable Australia to claim a larger total area of continental shelf than under the 1958 Convention. The gains made by adopting the new definition outweigh any potential minor losses and will bring Australian legislation into conformity with internationally accepted principles.The Bill also for the first time in Commonwealth legislation deals expressly with a contiguous zone. This zone extends from the limit of the territorial sea to a distance no greater than 24 nm from the territorial sea baselines. It is a zone in which a coastal State can exercise rights of control to prevent infringement of customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws and to punish infringement of the above laws committed within its territory or territorial sea. It is envisaged that specific legislation such as the customs or quarantine legislation will in due course be amended to assert more fully the rights to which Australia is entitled in such a zone.The Bill amends in a consequential way a number of Acts as set out in Schedule 1. These amendments mostly relate to the definition of `continental shelf in those pieces of legislation so as to remove references to the 1958 Convention. One amendment of particular note is the alteration of the adjacent area boundary under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act in relation to Tasmania and Western Australia. This will ensure that the operation of that Act extends to all the areas of continental shelf which Australia is entitled to claim under the 1982 definition. The existing adjacent area `picture frames which are used in certain offshore area legislation do not extend far enough in those two areas.The relevant parts of the 1982 Convention are set out in schedule 2 to the Bill and will form part of the revised Seas and Submerged Lands Act.Mr President, the passage of this legislation reflects the need for Australia with its significant interests as both a coastal and maritime State to position itself to take advantage of developments in the law of the sea. Australias action in this regard will promote further consolidation of coastal and maritime State rights and obligations as set out in the 1982 Convention.I mention that the Bill does not affect the offshore constitutional settlement. The States and Northern Territory are consulted in relation to maritime issues and I expect this to continue.The Bill will have no direct financial impact.I present the explanatory memorandum for the Bill.I commend the Bill to the Senate.Debate (on motion by Senator Reid ) adjourned.Motion (by Senator Collins ) agreed to:That the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 and the Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 be listed on the Notice Paper as separate orders of the day.","N/A","LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1993 OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY (MARITIME INDUSTRY) BILL 1993 OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY (MARITIME INDUSTRY) CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENT BILL 1993 MARITIME LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

269,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator REID","VI4","(Australian Capital Territory)","LP","N/A",1413,"—Today we are discussing the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill 1993, which contains proposals by the government to change the oath of allegiance given by Australians who take out citizenship in this country. To say that this is premature is an understatement indeed. It is well ahead of its time. If Australia were ever to become a republic, one might then change the oath of allegiance. Until that time occurs, there is no requirement, no need and no reason to change the oath of allegiance.The only reason the government is bringing this up now through this bill is to allocate to itself nearly a quarter of a million dollars to use towards its pro-republican campaign. That is what would flow from the passing of this bill. A sum of about a quarter of a million dollars would go to the government towards the support of its republican campaign so that it could continue to undermine the stability of this country in the way that it has been attempting to do in recent times. The government is using the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill 1993 as a vehicle to allocate that money to itself.One of the most significant things that a person could ever do in his or her life would be to take out citizenship of another country. It is not something that I have had to do; it is not something that I would ever expect to do. But I have been to a number of citizenship ceremonies. One cannot attend a good citizenship ceremony without being impressed by the significance of the occasion and by what it must mean to a person to do that.There are people who take out citizenship in this country because they have had to flee the country they were born in. They have had to find somewhere else to live. They would virtually have had to be without a home and without a country to belong to before they found somewhere else. This has gone on since the Second World War. A number of people came here, particularly from Europe, because they were displaced persons.Anyone I have ever spoken to who has taken out citizenship has been moved by the occasion and the circumstances. I think of the boat people who have come here from Vietnam in more recent times. I do not believe that any one of us sitting here could contemplate or understand the feelings of people who have fled their country of birth to travel to this country in boats that are unfit to leave a wharf in the first place.Some people live here for many years before they finally take out citizenship. Having lived in this country for perhaps a long time while retaining citizenship of another country, people find it a very emotional experience when they finally make the commitment that Australia is where they belong. Some people have come here as young people to make a life for themselves; others have come here with young children to make a life for their family in this country because of the stability and opportunities that it offers.A citizenship ceremony, which has all of these emotions present in the air, is a very solemn, happy and moving occasion. All of that suddenly seems to be going out of the window, particular this year. I refer to the way in which the citizenship ceremonies are being run, at least in Canberra. I can only conclude that it is at the direction of the minister that the occasion should be downgraded and that the circumstances in which the ceremony takes place should no longer be presented as significant, but as a mere routine bureaucratic arrangement.Since I have been in the Senate, the ceremonies in Canberra were held in the theatrette at the National Library. They were very simple, but moving occasions and very worth while indeed. One of the members of federal parliament from this electorate always took part and was invited to speak. For many years Australian native plants have been handed out to those who have received their citizenship as a mark of the occasion. I think that still occurs. It was an occasion where people really felt that something important had occurred.More recently, the citizenship ceremonies have been held at the Community Centre in Dickson. That also is a very suitable place and a nice occasion. I have been to a number of excellent ceremonies there that I and those who have taken out citizenship have enjoyed. Those involved have felt that they were doing something and that their commitment to this country was being recognised.I took part in an excellent citizenship ceremony in the open at Commonwealth Park in Canberra on Australia Day this year. It was a great occasion. There was a citizenship ceremony at a Lions Club dinner, and I also attended one to mark Refugee Week at which the ACT Chief Minister officiated. All those who took out citizenship on that occasion were refugees.Twelve other ceremonies have taken place at the offices of the department in Canberra and in the room about which Senator Bishop spoke earlier today. In fact, today 10 groups totalling 200 people are going through that room because the space is not big enough to hold a ceremony for all 200 people at once as there is in the Dickson Community Centre, in the theatrette of the National Library or in this building, as has already been pointed out.There are plenty of places in Canberra where one could hold a citizenship ceremony for 200 people with a little style, unlike the way it was done this morning in Canberra. Ten separate groups came in and out every few minutes, people were given a plant and they were sent on their way. No other people were invited to take part in the ceremony or to speak or to be in any way welcoming to the participants. I can only conclude that it is a deliberate policy of the Government to downgrade the nature of the ceremony. It has culminated today in this bill, which deals with changing the oath of allegiance.I also wonder why this bill is being brought in today. It is not urgent. One would have to say that it is to fill in time in the Senate—presumably while the government attempts to get its budget program in order. Why else would we be having this rushed through today when there are, according to the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, so many other things that ought to be dealt with? Every night when he has been on the news in recent times—petulant little man that he is—he has preached about the Senate holding up the budget and business generally and the Senate not doing this and that.The Treasurer keeps abusing us for not dealing with important legislation. Yet today this bill to change the oath of allegiance is the No. 1 priority of the Government. Let the people of Australia note that. The republican push and changing the oath of allegiance are much more important to this government than any of the other things that it keeps talking about. Let us not forget that.There is no necessity to change the oath of allegiance at present. Nothing before us deals with changing the oath that we as members of parliament take when we are sworn in after each election. The reason is that in order for us to do so the constitution would have to be changed. Nothing before us changes the oath that a member of the armed services takes when entering the forces. I can only conclude that taking out citizenship of this country is less important to the government than any of these other things. I do not accept that as reasonable or correct.This oath should not be changed unless there is a change to the structure of this country. I can see that one would have to change it in that event. In other words, if we became a republic, the oath as it presently stands would need to be amended. But that is not the case. For some reason, we have this matter before us today when the Treasurer keeps abusing the Senate for not dealing with the important business of the Government. He should be told what we are actually doing today.Someone should tell the Treasurer that this morning we passed nine bills. It was a pretty good morning in the Senate. I am not suggesting that they should not have been dealt with. The protection of the sea bills were important and warranted the attention of the Senate. But we are now considering the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill 1993 as the next most important thing to be dealt with.The bill does not deal with things such as dual nationality, which is important and has some substance; it just deals with changing the oath of allegiance to fit in with some other agenda. I refer to the oath and the pledge, as it is called, for the future. The present oath of allegiance is as follows:I swear by Almighty God that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Australia, Her heirs and successors according to law, and that I will faithfully observe the laws of Australia and fulfil my duties as an Australian citizen.That recognises the constitutional structure of this country and its institutions. Within it the person taking out citizenship makes his or her own personal declaration: `I will faithfully observe the laws of Australia and fulfil my duties as an Australian citizen. That is what one would expect it to say.The pledge that we are now given contains no commitment—nothing! It states:From this time forward, under God,I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people,whose democratic beliefs I share,whose rights and liberties I respect, andwhose laws I will uphold and obey.There is absolutely no substance to it, and anybody reading it would know that. One can only wonder why the government would come forward with a pledge in that form.It is worth having a little look at the words that we are discussing. The oath of allegiance, which is a solemn appeal to God and a solemn commitment to some person to some thing, is being abandoned. It is an attestation of the truth of what one is saying and of the binding character of the promise to testify on oath. An oath of allegiance has some significance and depth to it.I agree that the word `pledge is a solemn promise. But the word `pledge has other meanings—such as a pledge of aid; a pledge or a security for the payment of debt. Although it has a meaning of promise, it is not a word used in that fashion and it is not a word that has any real depth or meaning to it. We are not talking about such a concept when talking about taking out citizenship of this country. One can have a `promise—I accept that word—which is a declaration with respect to the future that one will do or not do, or give or not give something. In my opinion, a promise has much more meaning to it.The term `to swear an oath, as it is worded at the present time, means to make a solemn declaration with an oath of allegiance to Almighty God. It does not have the same meaning when used by many people who make the affirmation, which states:I solemnly and sincerely declare that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Australia, Her heirs and successors according to law, and that I will faithfully observe the laws of Australia and fulfil my duties as an Australian citizen.The commitment to this country should recognise the constitutional status of the country. It should show some understanding of what a person is doing in taking out the oath of allegiance and making ones commitment to this country.Under the new wording, the oath of affirmation becomes:From this time forward,I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people,whose democratic beliefs I share,whose rights and liberties I respect, andwhose laws I will uphold and obey.I heard another form of words recently that I think is worth bringing into the debate. It was given by emeritus Professor Ralph Elliott in a radio program in Canberra when he was asked what he thought about the change in the words. Acknowledging the Labor Partys attitude to this—which I think is probably not his own—by leaving out reference to the head of state, his suggested words were:I hereby solemnly promise (before God) to be a loyal citizen of Australia, to obey its laws, to cherish and safeguard its democratic institutions, and to foster mutual respect between the country, all its people and myself.That is a much more personal way of wording the commitment. It puts much more of oneself into it than the words that have been given to the Senate to consider today. I am not suggesting that Professor Elliott would change the present oath—I certainly would not—but at least that type of wording is a far more personal commitment than the words given to us today, which I regard as totally inadequate.As I have indicated, there are two aspects to this matter; the words themselves and the complete lack of depth and meaning to the pledge that is presented, and the governments attitude towards the ceremonies which are conducted to enable people to take out citizenship. I hope the Senate will throw out this bill. The matter could be looked at at an appropriate time when, if ever, there was to be a change in the constitutional status of this country. This has not yet occurred and will not occur.The bill before us at this time has no place in the Senate. There is no requirement and no need to change the oath of allegiance for Australian citizenship. I ask the government to withdraw the bill and to not bring it forward either in this fashion or at all until such time as it would naturally fit into a constitutional change in the country. I think the mere fact that the other oaths I have mentioned are not being amended and are not being capable of being amended indicates that there is no real substance to this, other than to try to boost the governments republicanism push and to enable it, quite wrongly and quite falsely, to get hold of taxpayers funds to help them push this along.There are other people who want to speak in this debate and there are other reasons that people have given as to why the matter should not be dealt with. To me it is quite simple and straightforward and the wording proposed I find appalling in any event.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
270,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator McKIERNAN","1I4","(Western Australia)","ALP","N/A",1416,"—Unlike some of the previous speakers, I consider the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill to be an extremely important piece of legislation because it is dragging this nation state of Australia into the 21st century. It was only 45 years ago that this country established its own right of citizenship. I was a mere child at the time this happened. It took a further 25 years, and it was under the Whitlam government, before the oath was changed to reflect the monarch as the monarch of Australia.Here we are 20 years later—one can hardly say we are galloping along to reform—actually making changes that are relevant to Australia in 1993. They probably were relevant to Australia in 1973, but because of the way the parliament was structured at the time it could not happen. It can hardly be said that what has been proposed in the chamber this afternoon is revolutionary.I claim to have more authority to speak in support of this measure than the vast majority of my colleagues in this place or the other place. I am one of the few elected representatives of the parliament of Australia who has gone through a citizenship ceremony. I have not been as lucky as those who were born in this wonderful land. I came here by choice. But I am perhaps luckier than most because of where my mother was as at the time of my birth. That is a different story and we will not canvass an argument about the two.I had to think long and seriously in my adopted homeland before I took the oath of allegiance—before I became a citizen of this country. I had made the decision long before I took out citizenship to remain permanently in this land. The hardest decision I had to make was whether to pledge allegiance to the Queen. The oath says the Queen of Australia. They were the words of the oath that I used. We should recognise that people around the world recognise Queen Elizabeth II as the Queen of Great Britain, or even more specifically, as the Queen of England. The oath says `Queen of Australia. We do have a Queen of Australia because it is in our law, but we do not have an Australian queen.This is an extremely important piece of legislation for multicultural Australia in 1993. It has taken a long time to get here. I am aware that there were two previous attempts to bring about this change under the administration of Bob Hawke. Both those attempts failed. I certainly hope that on this occasion the Senate will make the decision to endorse this bill and send it off to the House of Representatives. Sixty days after receiving royal assent it will become law and new citizens who take the oath next year, when it effectively becomes law, will be espousing words that truly and honestly reflect modern day Australia and not the anachronism of colonial Australia from where this developed. Australian citizenship has been in existence for only 45 years.There are number of other points that I want to say about this matter. I am going to remove myself from the republican debate because I do not think it is the republican debate that we are talking about at the moment. That debate is happening in our society all over the place.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

274,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator McKIERNAN","1I4","(Western Australia)","ALP","N/A",1416,"—The republic has been a wonderful success in Ireland. The republic has nothing to do with the IRA. Senator Herron is quite aware of that from his visit to Ireland. It was not the IRA that upset Senator Herron when he visited his relatives. That is something we can debate.The republic in Ireland has been a success because it can develop as a nation. Previously, Ireland has been held back as a nation because it was being controlled from outside. The same thing happened to Australia for many years and many other parts of the world, including South Africa and Canada. It was mentioned by a previous speaker that there is a private members bill on the floor of the Canadian parliament talking about the changes to the Canadian oath.This is extremely important to the 990,000 Australians who have not taken that big leap to vow allegiance to this country or, as it presently stands, to vow allegiance to Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia. There are people, many of whom come from my birth place, Ireland, who just cannot bring themselves to swearing allegiance to Queen Elizabeth II.There are many Italians whom I know of who cannot bring themselves to swearing allegiance to Queen Elizabeth II because they, like most of the Australian population, recognise that Queen Elizabeth II, her gracious majesty, is Queen of England. They do not recognise her as Queen of Australia. We do not see her frequently, and technically speaking she is the Queen of Australia only when she is actually in Australia.I would hope that when this bill is enacted and becomes law those 990,000 people recognised in the 1986 census will take the step to make the final commitment to this country. I hope that they will go through with the ceremonies that all of us as members of parliament attend from time to time. I hope that in the next few years there will be so many people taking Australian citizenship that the venues for the ceremonies will not be big enough to cater for them.My local authority in Western Australia, the City of Wanneroo, holds perhaps the biggest citizenship ceremonies in Western Australia. We have handled up to 300 people at a time. We do not hold ceremonies in halls, but then Western Australia is blessed with magnificent weather. It seems that I have been blessed in terms of my birthright and living not only in Australia but particularly in Western Australia and in the magnificent City of Wanneroo. We hold magnificent ceremonies out in the open air on Australia Day. When this new oath comes in next year I hope that not just 300 people but 400 or 500 people at a time will take out Australian citizenship. The people referred to in the 1986 census will have the opportunity to make a complete and total commitment to the land that we as migrants have chosen to live in.It has been alleged that the new pledge will be weaker than the present oath. I certainly do not see it that way, but then I am an agnostic anyway and I have a problem with taking oaths. How meaningful are oaths to people like me in the community? I know that some people put great store in the taking of oaths and I do not denigrate them for that. Their wishes will be complied with under new provisions in the bill.Basically, there is absolutely no difference between a pledge and an oath or affirmation. Some of us, when taking office in this place, go through such a process rather than taking an oath. Certainly, there is no difference in law. I do not know why people are getting a head of steam up about whether we call it a pledge or an oath. Because the government was concerned about allegations that were made, it sought advice from the Attorney-Generals Department. That advice reads:Neither the term `oath as currently used in the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 nor the term `pledge as proposed to be used in the act has any technical legal meaning.The term `pledge does have a technical legal meaning relating to the delivery of goods as security. However, it is clearly not being used in that sense.The advice also makes reference to the Macquarie Dictionary . The advice reads:Oath is defined, in the relevant sense, as 1. a solemn appeal to God, or to some revered person or thing—I did not write this—in attestation of the truth of a statement or the binding character of a promise; 2. a statement or promise strengthened by such an appeal.Pledge is defined as a solemn promise of something, or to do or refrain from doing something.Both words therefore connote a solemn promise.The Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill provides for two forms of pledge—the first includes the words `under God; and the second does not include those words. People will be able to chose which form of pledge they want to make. Each pledge will have the same meaning and same standing in the laws of Australia.In my opening comments I made reference to my birthplace. It is not only people from my birthplace who have problems with pledging allegiance to Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia. My wife also had the same problems. Finally she took the decision and became an Australian citizen, pledging her commitment under the oath as it was written at that time. But even she, born in London within sight of Buckingham Palace, the Queens residence, had problems in pledging allegiance to the Queen when becoming a citizen of her adopted homeland. This is despite the fact that she was brought up to recognise the sovereignty of the Queen. Of course, everybody knows that London is the capital of England and as a child she recognised clearly and plainly that the Queen is first and foremost the Queen of England.The fact that the Queen is the Queen of Australia is only a secondary consideration; it is only really words on paper. We can surround the Queen with bunches of wattle or whatever, but that fact will remain. Countries with access to modern forms of communications—be they newspapers, television or radio—recognise the Queen as the Queen of England or the Queen of the United Kingdom but not the Queen of Australia. This bill, which hopefully will be carried shortly, will bring Australia into the 21st century.In conclusion, I thank all those people in my home state of Western Australia and in other parts of Australia who signed petitions, which were presented in this place, calling for this action to be taken. This in itself is an indication that the parliament can respond to the wishes of its citizens.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

The government is seeking to change the oath of allegiance and to replace it with a pledge. One has to ask: why would a government wish to do this? Is this change in the interests of the Australian people or perhaps is it really in the interests of people from other countries? What is the real reason for this legislation? The Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill is designed to lessen, to weaken and to water down the commitment that people make to this country, to our constitution and to our head of state.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

Give it to anybody but the Australian parliament; that is what is going on.This government is gutless, it is weak, it is unwilling to stand up to defend the basic principles of democracy which it enjoys. That is what this weak, gutless pledge is all about. I will tell honourable senators how gutless this pledge is: I could give this pledge five times before breakfast and another 10 times before lunch and it would not mean a thing.

But if an Australian goes to another country and applies for citizenship in that country—he would not even have to receive it—he would automatically forfeit his Australian citizenship.

287,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator OCHEE","EU4","(Queensland)","NP","N/A",1419,"—Sorry, he is weak as water with Australian citizenship. This government is a disgrace for what it is doing with this so-called pledge. Senator Reid has stated very adequately all of the technical weaknesses with this legislation. I want to talk about a few other things in relation to commitment to this country. I was at dinner on Monday with a group of very influential Australian businessmen. They were all ethnic Chinese, but they were Australians. One of them said to me, `We have so many problems in this country and I cannot believe that this government wants to turn Australia into a republic. He said, `Not only is it thoroughly irrelevant, but for Gods sake do not turn this country into a republic; I just came from a republic and that is why I am here.My grandfather in China was a staunch nationalist. That meant he was interested in overthrowing the Ching Dynasty. He finally got his way in 1911. He got a republic, and about 20 years later he found himself thrown out by the communists because the republic suddenly flipped around. He did not like what he had got. So where did he come? He came to Australia. Why did he come to Australia? He came here because of the stability in this country. That is why my family and I are here.Many of us, for example, Senator Herron and Senator Panizza, who are both in the chamber today, come from countries other than England or have ancestors who come from countries other than England. We are here because of the benefits and advantages of being an Australian under the Australian constitution and under the Queen as Queen of Australia.But the mob on the other side somehow seem to think that they can just change history, change the world, change the country and promise everybody that everything will be great. It is interesting that those opposite make a lot of play about Australia being part of Asia. Let me tell them, as an ethnic Asian Australian, that Australia is not part of Asia and never will be part of Asia. Geographically we are a separate continent and, more importantly, we are completely different culturally. No matter how many ethnic Chinese we get in this country, we will still never be part of Asia. The people who come here come here for what Australia is now, not for what they have left.It is peculiar that the mob opposite, who prattle a lot about Australia being part of Asia, were particularly silent this week when Cambodia, which was a communist republic in Asia, reverted to being a constitutional monarchy. Mr Keating and some of the people on the other side seem to think that we have to change our constitution and our oath of allegiance so that we can become a republic in the mistaken belief that we will become more like Japan, which is a constitutional monarchy. They even have the crazy idea that, if we change the oath of allegiance and insert this rubbish put before the chamber today, we will sell more wool overseas. They will tell you anything. But the problem with this mob is that their promises always fall short of what they deliver. They will sell you their grandmothers—but they will send her COD. The mob opposite have to be the weakest bunch of people ever to occupy the government benches.When this country is in a financial and economic crisis which is without parallel, when they bleat every night on the television about the need to get the budget passed, what do they do? They bring before the chamber this nonsense of a bill. Senator McKiernan had the audacity to come into this chamber and say that it is one of the most important bills that will be dealt with by this parliament in this session. What a lot of hogwash! It is not blarney that Senator McKiernan brings to this chamber, it is bull—bull and unadulterated bull. I have not seen more bull since I opened a Santa Gertrudis sale about a month ago. It is bull from one end to the other. That is all we seem to get from this government.I am steadfastly opposed to this bill. I am steadfastly opposed to weakening the requirements that we have of people who seek from us the benefits and advantages of citizenship of this country. I say: Australia for Australians. I welcome to these shores with open arms people who want to become Australians first and foremost. People who want to weaken the test and requirements of Australian nationality are unpatriotic. This bill is unpatriotic. Most importantly, this government is unpatriotic, not only in what it does but also in what it fails to do—to address the real issues of this nation. That is why it ought to be thrown out.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start[7]/para","N/A","N/A"

290,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COONEY","SF4","(Victoria)","ALP","N/A",1421,"—He has put the coalitions position very well. He has said that he is steadfastly opposed to the bill and its contents. Let us look at what the opposition is opposed to. The opposition is opposed to recognising that Australian citizenship represents formal membership of the community of the Commonwealth of Australia.People on the opposition benches are steadfastly opposed, to use Senator OChees words, to the proposition that Australian citizenship represents formal membership of the community of the Commonwealth of Australia. They are opposed to the proposition that Australian citizenship is a common bond involving reciprocal rights and obligations, uniting all Australians while respecting their diversity. They are opposed to the proposition that persons granted Australian citizenship enjoy these rights and accept these obligations. They are opposed to people who are going to become Australian citizens pledging loyalty to Australia and its people. They are going to oppose that proposition when they oppose the bill.They are going to oppose the proposition that there is an obligation on people who become Australian citizens to share the democratic beliefs of Australia and its people. They are opposed to the proposition that people who become Australian citizens should respect the rights and liberties of Australia and uphold and obey the laws of Australia. They are opposed to a pledge which says `From this time forward under God. They are opposed to the proposition that people who want to become Australian citizens should swear: `I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people, whose democratic beliefs I share, whose rights and liberties I respect, and whose laws I will uphold and obey. Why should anybody be opposed to those propositions? Senator Sherry represents the state of Tasmania; I hope that the people of Tasmania would believe they were part of Australia and had an obligation to uphold the democratic rights of everybody in Australia—people who are citizens.The present oath swears allegiance to the Queen. What we swear under the present oath is that we will be subjects, but under the proposed oath we would swear that we will be citizens of a country. I think there is a big difference in those propositions.This bill does not make Australia a republic. It does not make the Queen anything that she is presently not, that is, Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia. It does nothing in respect of either of those things. It does not make Australia a republic nor does it take it towards being a republic and it does not remove the Queen from her present position as Queen of Australia. What it does is emphasise to people who want to become Australian citizens the sorts of things they should keep in mind and expect when they do become citizens. Why would anybody oppose this quite beautiful pledge:From this time forward, under God,I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people,whose democratic beliefs I share,whose rights and liberties I respect, andwhose laws I will uphold and obey.Senator Kemp, for whom I have the greatest of respect and who sat on the committee which looked at this, will explain why he is opposed to those sorts of things. Knowing him, I know that, deep down, he is not opposed to the sorts of things that this pledge and this oath provide for.This bill is very short, with 10 clauses. It contains an oath. If people do not want to take the oath to swear under God, they can make a declaration which reads:From this time forward,I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people,whose democratic beliefs I share,whose rights and liberties I respect, andwhose laws I will uphold and obey.They can do that on the basis of a preamble which emphasises Australia, emphasises those great qualities of Australian life—the democratic beliefs that we all hold strongly, the respect we have for rights and liberties, the determination we have to uphold and obey the laws of Australia.I cannot see—and I think it is important to keep repeating this—why anybody would be opposed to doing that. It is a bill that I would have thought would have had the support of everybody across the board. It is a bill which former Senator Tate had much to do with. He is a person who needs to be given praise and acknowledgment for the work he did on this Australian citizenship bill. He is a person who is deeply religious, a person dedicated to Australia, a person who is one of the most respected senators ever to serve in this Senate and a person who produced this bill with all those aspirations that it manifests.I will just say something about my good friend and associate Senator McKiernan, who was taken to task for swearing allegiance to the Queen to serve in this parliament. Senator McKiernan has made a great contribution while he has been here. He has an Irish background. He would not be alone in Australia, I hope, in having some connection with that great and magnificent country. The suggestion that he in some way swore allegiance as a means of obtaining something that he would not otherwise have obtained casts an aspersion on his character which is completely undeserved. He is as loyal and as great an Australian as any other person in this chamber, and I think that ought to be stated.The other point he made is right. This is an important bill. We cannot go around being economic rationalists all our lives and we cannot go around being what is a derivation of that, that is, social rationalists who say, `There is no way we can improve the present situation except by eliminating more things that go to manifest the greater aspirations of the heart and soul of the human condition. We cant have that. It is unimportant that we should want to become citizens, that we should want to emphasise our citizenship rather than our subjugation to the Queen. That is what we do when we swear the present oath of allegiance.This is a very important bill. If one looks at its terms, it is very hard to see how people can vote against it. As I say, it has nothing to do with the republic. It has nothing to do with in any way insulting the Queen, a monarch for whom we all have great love and respect. That is irrelevant to the present debate. It is not irrelevant to the present debate that people who vote against this will be voting against the propositions that are set out in clause 3 and the schedule in clause 8. The schedule contains that pledge—that beautiful form of prayer almost—that people who want to become Australian citizens are asked to take and which manifests very clearly what is expected of them and which is very understandable.The pledge must be very plain as to what people are doing, very understandable in the context of where it is sworn and very clear as to what it means. People do not swear allegiance to any particular person who may or may not be in a country. Rather, they swear that they will be loyal to Australia and its people; that they will be loyal to Australias democratic beliefs, which they share; that they will be loyal to the proposition that rights and liberties should be respected; and that they will be loyal to the proposition that laws that Australia or the states of Australia proclaim will be upheld and obeyed. It is a very simple, very effective, wonderful pledge and one that is historic.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

The Whitlam government attempted to change the oath in 1973 to one that read:I swear by Almighty God that I will faithfully uphold the Constitution of Australia, observe the laws of Australia and fulfil my duties as an Australian citizen.That was defeated, quite rightly, in 1973. In 1983 the Hawke government came in again with an amendment to replace the existing oath with this pledge:I renounce any current citizenship and allegiance to any State other than Australia. I swear by Almighty God that I will faithfully uphold the Constitution, obey the laws of Australia and fulfil my duties as an Australian citizen.Again that pledge was defeated, and it was removed from the bill by an amendment in the Senate.

One thing about Senator Schacht is that he is a political animal. I do not say that in a derogatory sense. He is one of the men who sets the pace for the Labor Party. I do not want to cast any aspersions on Senator Schachts character. `Political animal is a term that is used fairly significantly around this place. But even Senator Schacht would have to see that he is on a hiding to nothing.I know Senator Schacht feels passionate about the republican issue. The debate on it has changed around. It is running out on Senator Schacht. Forty-four per cent of Australians are against it now and 39 per cent are for it. Once a debate turns around, it is a hiding to nothing. Senator Schacht will have to put his best foot forward to pick this up. I do not think the people of Australia want it. They have thought it through now. It is nothing to do with the royalty; it is about the Westminster system.The people of Australia have thought this through. They think this Westminster system may have a few problems, but no-one can find a better system in the world. Through the smokescreen they are starting to see the governments attack on royalty and now they are starting to think, `Gee, we could lose the most precious thing in Australia—our Westminster system. We could de-power the Senate. We could emasculate the states. All this is up for grabs. All this can be put in a package to change our constitution. That is where the government is going to go down the mine. People do not want a change. They are very happy with the Westminster system. They are very happy with the Senate. They are very happy with the states and with the state representatives having the right to do the job that they were elected to do. Now we have replaced this oath with a pledge of commitment which reads:From this time forward, under God—and I acknowledge God in this place, as I always have—I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people,whose democratic beliefs I share,whose rights and liberties I respect, andwhose laws I will uphold and obey.Technically, I suppose, there is nothing wrong with that pledge; it reminds me of a bit of poetry. The National Party and the Liberal Party believe that the bill is misguided because it spurns the enduring traditions that are our inheritance.I ask again: why do we always have this fetish in Australia with denying our past?. What is wrong with our past? We have proud traditions. We have grown up from a little nation into a proud nation that has the greatest rights and traditions in the world, yet for some reason that I have never been able to understand—and maybe Senator Schacht and I can discuss this privately; he might be able to explain it to me—there is a fear amongst the Labor Party politicians that there is something wrong with our past.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/debate.sub1/speech[5]/talk.start[4]/para","N/A","N/A"

Under the coalition governments of the past, Queensland led this nation in creation of jobs, in creation of wealth and in creation of most other things—something that this government has destroyed. All this government can claim is that it has caused one million people to be unemployed. The National and Liberal party governments in Queensland were governments of prosperity—something this government does not understand. The pledge of commitment, like the governments republican proposal, is founded on the Labor Partys belief that our institutions do not necessarily have to reflect our national identity.Senator Faulkner said in his second reading speech that the pledge of commitment would capture the current way in which the Australian people view their national identity and that this would continue to develop a special Australian identity. I think people are very happy with the identity that they have. I have been overseas from time to time and I have never had a problem with knowing that I was an Australian, and I have never felt ashamed of it. I do not know whether government senators do. I have always felt proud to be an Australian.This is the same language that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) uses when he attempts to justify his push for a republic. He has said that it is hardly radical to suggest that our constitution should be remade to reflect our nations values and aspirations. Senator Faulkner and the Prime Minister are wrong. They are proposing to change traditions and institutions that are precious to us all. They seem to have this in mind. They are proposing to change traditions and institutions that have been developed over hundreds of years in favour of pledges dreamed up by their own ministers and Treasury frontbenchers.

The oath said that in feudal England the king as liege lord was bound to maintain and defend his people in return for service and obedience. That is nothing like the oath that people take today.The role of the oath has changed since then, but the oath that was taken in 1824 by Timothy Pitman, the first person naturalised in Australia, is a recognisable predecessor of the oath or affirmation that new citizens take today. That is another tradition that we have and the Labor Party is so keen to change. The long history of our oath of allegiance gives it weight, depth and feeling. Many residents who choose to become citizens find it deeply moving that they are reciting an oath that links them to our great traditions and to the hundreds of thousands of immigrants who took the oath before them.It is a great privilege to be allowed to come into Australia. Very few people ever ask me to try to get them out of Australia. I would say most of my time in constituency work is spent trying to bring people into Australia. I have never heard anyone say to me, `I want to come into Australia but I am not prepared to take that oath, so if I have to take that oath just forget me and Ill go and live in Canada. I do not think any person on this side, or any senator on the other side of the chamber—if they were totally honest—would say that immigrants had come to them and said, `Look, I do not want to take the oath.I was proud to take a similar oath as a member of parliament when I came here for the first time. It was the same oath that had been taken by Mr Curtin and Mr Menzies, Prime Ministers of Australia. I felt proud to recite, with my hand on the Bible , that oath that previous Labor and Liberal Prime Ministers had taken.Senator Faulkner and the government now want to discard the oath of allegiance with all its historic associations and replace it with a pledge that really does not have a great deal to recommend it. I understand that Senator Tate flew to Taree and got Mr Les Murray to draft a new pledge, but I gather Senator Tate did not particularly like it.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/debate.sub1/speech[5]/talk.start[7]/para","N/A","N/A"

That is not the governments decision to make. The government is trying to lead the debate but it is not its decision to make. That is the peoples decision, and when they have made that decision, or if they make that decision—and I do not think they will—the government would have every right to introduce this piece of legislation and change our oath of allegiance. The fact remains that the Queen is head of Australia. The government might not like it and might do everything that it can to oppose it, but it does not alter that fact. The government is getting too far in front of itself by bringing this legislation in now.It is a sort of vague and insubstantial statement; it does not really mean a great deal. One of the justifications that Senator Faulkner put forward was that some residents are reluctant to apply for citizenship partly because they do not see the present oath or affirmation as being adequately Australian in character.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/debate.sub1/speech[5]/talk.start[10]/para","N/A","N/A"

311,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BOSWELL","YE4","(Queensland-","NP","Leader of the National Party of Australia)",1423,"—That was the argument put by the other side. The question emerged as a political concern in the early 1980s when the Fraser government decided to institute national consultations on citizenships. The consultations produced evidence that suggested that a large number of permanent residents were not taking out citizenship because the governments 1983 bill was directed toward encouraging residents to take out citizenship by reducing the language requirement from adequate to basic and by reducing the residency requirement from three to two years. But what was discovered in that exercise was that people were concerned that if they took out citizenship in Australia, they would have to renounce their original citizenship and that that would not allow them to go back. That was one of the main reasons for that inquiry concluding that people were not taking Australian citizenship. So it had nothing to do with the Queen or an Australian oath of allegiance.The latest Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs figures show—and I think Senator Cooney or someone opposite used the figure—that around one million eligible residents were not Australian citizens. These raw statistics conceal the fact that figures are obscured by a large number of British, Irish and New Zealand residents in Australia who believe that they are part of the British empire and part of the Australian political process and do not therefore have to take that extra step.Debate interrupted.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/debate.sub1/speech[5]/talk.start[11]/para","N/A","N/A"

May I say at the outset that I am very proud to stand here as a new senator representing the state of Tasmania and the people of Australia generally. It is with a degree of humility that I take up this task but it is one that I will endeavour to perform to the fullest extent. Hopefully, I will meet the expectations the public have of their elected representatives in this parliament.My pursuit of political life is born out of my working class background and the struggles that have confronted ordinary Australians over the time that this country has developed. They are struggles that I will continue to pursue during my time as a senator in this chamber.I was born in the west coast mining town of Queenstown, Tasmania. My father worked as a fitter and turner at Mt Lyell copper mine and my mother was from a farming family in the north of the state. I attended school at the Hagley Farm and Prospect high schools. However, I was no great scholar and left school at the end of my third year of high school.I had many jobs after leaving school, and at the age of 15 I headed for Queensland to work in shearing sheds in the outback.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/debate.sub1/speech/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

320,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MURPHY","FX5","(Tasmania)","ALP","N/A",1426,"—Yes, and it was a good place too. During my time in Queensland I learnt to be a shearer. This became my job and life for the next 14 years. This was a period of great learning for me and contained many lessons about life. It was a time I enjoyed enormously and remember fondly. I worked throughout most states of Australia and met some wonderful characters and made many great friendships.It was also my first real introduction to the trade union movement, something that was to have a profound effect on me in time to come. In the late 1970s I returned to live in Tasmania, with my interest in politics growing by the day. I joined the Labor Party in 1982 and became heavily involved in the Tasmanian branch of the ALP from that time on. In 1989 I became state secretary of the Australian Timber Workers Union, which is now a division of the CFMEU, the Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union, a position I held until elected to the Senate.This provided me with the opportunity to represent workers in an industry where employers had neglected to address matters such as training and education, that had pay rates that were not commensurate with the tasks performed, and where there was no recognition of skills and no career advancement opportunities. During my four years as secretary I saw many changes that were brought about by the efforts of the union—changes that not only improved conditions for workers but also improved the whole work process and led to greater productivity and efficiency within the industry. I believe I can say quite categorically that none of those changes would have occurred without the efforts of the union. I would like to congratulate the leadership of the union at both the national and state level on the great contribution they made and to thank them for the support they gave me.Of course, not all employers would accept such processes. One example of this is the APPM dispute that occurred at Burnie. For the first time in a long time in Australias industrial history, workers were confronted with the type of bastardry that the opposition would have us believe does not exist in this country—where an employer sought to deny workers the fundamental right to be collectively represented and organised. To their great credit, the overwhelming majority of those workers took the issue on and fought for what was right. They should be commended for their effort, their unity and their commitment to protect that fundamental Australian democratic right.Obviously, industrial relations will be an area of keen interest to me. It is with the knowledge of the APPMs of this world that I have often noted, and with some amusement, the continual castigation of the trade union movement by members of the opposition. This action, plus the industrial relations policy it went to the election with, simply does not gel with the calls it now makes for fairer treatment of the working class Australians. It is policies such as those and the actions of many of Australias employers that maintain my commitment to the trade union movement. I will do whatever I can to ensure its survival and the continuation of its role of representing workers of this country. In saying that, I do not imply a disinterest in or lack of understanding of the concerns and aspirations of Australian business, nor a disbelief in profit making or business success. I do understand and recognise these things because I know that without successful businesses there is no employment.Of course, the opposition still clings to the belief that we have to get rid of unions to free up the labour market and allow bosses to sit down with their workers individually and supposedly work out a fair deal for all. However, one of the major problems with that approach is the management in many of Australias companies and businesses. Because of their lack of foresight, initiative and general incompetence, to them a free labour market means reducing wages and conditions of workers and not working smarter or developing new products or, indeed, seeking new markets or improving the quality of products they produce. Of course, this leads to claims about the current industrial relations system—the system that is supposed to give unions all power.I would like to give an example of how it does not and how employers are exploiting workers even under this presumably restrictive system. This example involved four unemployed sawmill workers who, in seeking work, had a proposition put to them that they could set up their own business and operate their own sawmill. The proposer of this deal would sell them the logs necessary to cut the timber and then would on-sell the finished product for them. Of course, they had no money to start with, so the proposer would lend them the first months rent for the sawmill as well as some other money for outgoings.They were informed that they could not draw wages until the mill made a profit but, in the meantime, they would receive $20 a week from this new found friend to pay for their petrol, et cetera, ensuring that they could still collect social security. This continued for nine months and, according to the bookkeeper—who just happened to be the proposer—the mill never made a profit, despite all of the timber being sold and no wages being paid.It is that sort of thing that really leads me to maintain a great commitment to what is right for workers in this country. Those workers were not members of a union at the time. They finally sought the assistance of the CFMEU and, even under the current system, the union had great difficulty in doing something about it because of the way the deal was set up, the way this person was technically avoiding the law.The matter was reported to the Department of Industrial Relations and also to the Department of Social Security—with little result. The union is now taking the matter to court to try to bring about some justice for these workers, who were trying to create an opportunity for themselves and who were being blatantly ripped off by some grub of an employer.I could outline numerous such circumstances that occurred just during my time as a union secretary. So imagine how these types of employers would operate under the free labour market system being proposed by the opposition! John Howards proposed office of employee advocate would have been the only area of employment growth and would have probably become one of the largest industrial relations departments in history. Even then, it would still not have been able to deal with the exploitation that would have occurred.It should not be forgotten that the people of Australia rejected the oppositions industrial relations policy on 13 March. They were not prepared, even in the face of difficult employment times, to support policies which would have made things worse: they would have reduced their wages, put more of them out of work and placed them in a position of great vulnerability. As honourable senators are aware, the current system, whilst not perfect, has delivered stability and, in many respects, fairness; however, it can and will be improved.The government is currently reviewing industrial relations legislation and, much to the disgust of those on the other side, it is consulting the trade union movement, along with industry. We recognise that, to have a process that can deliver in the interests of the country, we must take account of all views. The opposition, on the other hand, would not have done that. It would have simply legislated to outlaw unionism as Australians know it today. It would have reduced the current award system to a state of worthlessness; indeed, I believe it would have ultimately abolished the award system.Given the outlook for employment growth in the short-term future, the exploitation of Australian workers would have gone out of control. We would have ended up with a society of haves and have-nots. And what would that have done for the economy? Not much, I think. People would be less able to save, with less to spend, and the result would be additional job losses to those already occurring through productivity and efficiency gains. This is not what Australia needs, and that is why Labor won the last election—because Australians believe in a fair go.Whilst on the issue of fairness, I feel it appropriate that I speak about the achievements of 10 years of Labor in government and, in particular, about the current budget. When we came to office in 1983, Australia was an inward looking, protectionist, inefficient, uncompetitive country with double digit inflation, double digit unemployment and a confrontationist industrial relations system that had industrial disputation at record levels. We had poor education and training levels—","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/debate.sub1/speech/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

322,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MURPHY","FX5","(Tasmania)","ALP","N/A",1426,"—Yes, Senator Panizza, the ACTU has done a lot to improve the lot of business in this country. We had a Third World pattern of exports and a government—the Fraser government—that chose to ignore the potential trade opportunities within the Asian region. A decade later the Australian economy has been transformed. Certainly we still have high unemployment, but the rest of the picture is dramatically changed. Our economic fundamentals have been dramatically improved through building a much more competitive economy, along with a cooperative approach to industrial relations; greatly enhanced levels of education and training, research and development and export assistance; a much more competitive business tax system; and a government that is promoting and pursuing trade opportunities in Asia as well as the rest of the world.We now have the lowest level of inflation in 30 years; interest rates which are the lowest in 20 years; international competitiveness up by over 30 per cent since 1983; industrial disputes at the lowest level ever recorded; productivity increasing at a healthy 2.5 per cent per annum; exports of manufactured goods rising at 20 per cent per annum; service exports that now represent 20 per cent of total exports; and many small and medium manufacturing companies which are competing in overseas markets. In short, we have a much more innovative, productive and competitive economy than 10 years ago and, as a result, Australia is better placed to advance the welfare and living standards of its people. We have also built a much fairer Australia, with those on low incomes and those in need receiving greater assistance through better targeting of welfare and community services.The government, during its 10 years in office, has been about vision and a clear sense of direction. We set out to transform the Australian economy, and we have. Australia is on a fundamentally different path now to that which it had followed for most of this century, and Australians have accepted this change in direction. Even the opposition, which governed Australia for most of this century and made it what it was up to 1983, has fully accepted this change, and its criticisms are not about the directions we have taken, but rather that we are not demolishing quickly enough the structure it put in place.But where do we go from here? The governments objectives are straightforward enough. They are: to increase the rate of economic and employment growth, thus increasing real incomes and reducing unemployment; to enhance the level of our domestic savings, which is an essential element of addressing our balance of payments problem; to continue the process of making Australia a creative, innovative manufacturing nation; to improve the international environment for our export industries by new and improved international trade arrangements; to establish a new vocational education and training system which will better meet the needs and priorities of industry; and to continue to enhance social justice in our society. Therefore, there should be no doubt about where the government is taking the nation. The record shows that we are headed in the right direction.These measures have been continued in the latest budget which, despite all the claims, maintains a fairer society and yet continues the program of returning this countrys economy to a stable and vibrant position for the future. Of course, we have not solved all of our problems, and one of the fundamental issues that we must continue to address is that of unemployment. Although we have put in place substantial labour market programs for the next 12 months, including the continuation of programs such as newstart, jobclubs, LEAP, NIES and so on—which have been very successful in getting people into full-time work—we cannot rest there.Personally, I believe there are some areas that must be given special consideration. In particular, we should look at imports which come into this country. I do not believe we can continue to allow imports to come into this country without a greater requirement for identification of the country of origin. The buy Australian program must be revitalised and the loopholes that allow the current system to be rorted must be removed. We must be able to guarantee Australians that when they seek to buy Australian they really can buy Australian. This is a matter I intend to pursue with some vigour, particularly in the area of forest products, which represent around 10 per cent of this countrys imports.Obviously, part of the process of addressing import replacement will be business investment and development. However, a lot of Australian companies seem to be sitting on their hands in this respect. But there are now good reasons why investment should commence: profit shares are at quite high levels and rising; and the gross operating surpluses of trading enterprises are at high levels compared to this stage of recovery from the previous downturns in the mid-1970s and 1980s. It is also 22 per cent higher than it was in March 1983 when Labor came to office. Real unit labour costs have been virtually stable. All this, coupled with low inflation and interest rates and further business tax concessions in the budget, has provided a better business investment outlook for the future.The budget measures are, of course, important. Together with business tax concessions announced in the One Nation package, they form a comprehensive array of incentives. They also provide a very competitive tax regime compared to those of our trading partners, even our Asian trading partners. The new company tax rates are 33 per cent, down from 39 per cent—something the opposition was going to increase to 42 per cent had it won the election. I must say that there have been some interesting comments from business about that.The strategy on which this years budget has been based is to enhance growth in the short term through further expenditure for job creation and tax cuts, which will lead us into a longer term recovery that will come as the world economy picks up. What I now find difficult to understand—in fact, almost inconceivable—is the current position being adopted by the opposition in respect of this budget. On the one hand it claims to want fiscal responsibility, yet on the other it is opposing the governments revenue raising measures. I can understand its disappointment at losing the supposedly unlosable election, but Australians should now judge it for the reckless disregard it is showing for the welfare of this nation.Another area of concern to me is our economic relationship with New Zealand. While I believe it is necessary and important, I find it difficult to accept the imbalance that lies in the employment related area. I know that the Senate has conducted inquiries into some aspects of this, but the problem still seems to exist. Regardless of the explanation, I do not see why the people of New Zealand should be treated differently from people from other countries when it comes to working in Australia, or vice versa for that matter. It should be noted that, on current figures that can be identified, the New Zealand work force in Australia represents about two per cent of our current unemployed people, and I believe this is unacceptable.I would now like to turn to two other key issues facing Australia today. The first relates to land rights and native title, which have been highlighted by the recent Mabo decision. In essence, this decision provided us with the opportunity to appropriately address something that has been wrong for so long. The unfortunate thing about the debate is that some interest groups have tried to politicise it. All sorts of instant experts have come out of the woodwork, none more notable that Hugh Morgan of Western Mining. He made all sorts of statements about land claims but there was one claim he was not telling us about—that was the greatest claim jumping exercise in Australias mining history, and he lost. However, regardless of all the politicising and disruptive tactics of some, the government will introduce legislation that will do something genuine about this longstanding and unacceptable situation. I hope that all honourable senators will support such steps.Finally, I would like to speak about Australia becoming a republic. This is something I have supported for a long time, not because of any disrespect for our historic links with Britain or the monarchy; rather, I support it for the reasons that it should occur. This country has developed socially to the point where it is necessary for us to become a republic if we are to gain a sense of completeness. For me, it is the only way that a full sense of pride can exist for all of Australias people. It will be like the completion of a long journey or making the final payment on something one has never owned. Regardless of peoples views, I do not think anyone could reject the notion of having an Australian as head of this country.Surely the most recent event of Sydney winning the 2000 Olympic Games brings home the importance of having a head of country and, indeed, a flag that would truly be our own. I am sure it would seem odd to other countries that, following our competing against Manchester, England, for the Olympics, we then turn around and have the Queen of England open our Olympics. There are no valid reasons why we should not become a republic. We should get on with the job and instil even greater pride in this great country.In closing, I would like to thank my wife, who is here tonight, for the support she has given me and to congratulate her on becoming the first woman to be elected as a state secretary of a union representing workers in the timber industry. I would also like to acknowledge my trade union colleagues who are here tonight and to thank them for travelling so far and for making that effort. I would simply like to say to them, `Keep up the struggle; the workers need you. Of course, to my two staff members here today, Vicki and Yvette, I thank them for the tolerance they have shown during my preparation of this speech.Honourable senators —Hear, hear!Debate (on motion by Senator Schacht ) adjourned.Debate resumed.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/debate.sub1/speech/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"
323,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BOSWELL","YE4","(Queensland-","NP","Leader of the National Party of Australia)",1431,"—I take this opportunity to congratulate Senator Murphy on his maiden speech. Obviously, if he can pull such a crowd from Tasmania as is in the Presidents gallery at the moment, he must have been a very popular unionist, and I congratulate him once again.Before Senator Murphys initial contribution we were debating the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill 1993. I was saying that there are about one million people in Australia who have immigrated to Australia and who have not become Australian citizens. Sixty-one per cent of those people have Irish, British or New Zealand origins. As I said before, those people felt that they were part of the society and part of Australia, but had not become Australian citizens. A further study showed that 40 to 60 per cent of residents from non-English speaking Mediterranean countries, north-western Europe and Third World countries became citizens almost immediately. Overall, 80 per cent of those people from those countries became Australian citizens.The study showed that the most important reason why people did not become citizens was that many countries did not allow dual citizenship. I suppose people needed to feel that if they were not satisfied here, they could go back to their original country. The study also showed that the oath or affirmation were not significant reasons why migrants did not become Australians. The myth that has been perpetrated from the government side of the house that they did not become citizens because they had some fear of, or opposition to, taking the oath of allegiance is simply not correct. The government believes that it has a monopoly on history.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[1]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

It is significant and important and, in respect of the development of the Australian identity, it is a great bill. I hope the Senate has the courage to pass this bill. I note that the report from the committee indicated that the majority of the committee supported the bill, with the Australian Democrats representative, Senator Spindler, abstaining. I understand that Senator Spindler will be moving a minor amendment which the government will be happy to support. Therefore, I trust that, with the support of the Democrats and maybe the other minor parties in the Senate, this bill will be carried.The opposition has vehemently opposed this bill from the beginning, in the committee and here again today in the Senate chamber. I find that an astonishing attitude to take. I note from the report of the committee that opposition senators want a complete review of the total act and then they will look at something in the future. Obviously, that is an attempt to disguise their own opposition to any change to the oath of allegiance and to this bill.The opposition does not desire to give any credit to this government, the Democrats and other people in the community who want, in an evolutionary way, to move forward the development of the Australian identity. Opposition senators want to oppose it because they are petrified that the present government—in particular, the present Prime Minister—may get some political credit and some community recognition for these proposals. This is really a political campaign to ensure that the present Prime Minister and the government are denigrated in every way possible. What we see today—and it is in this report of the committee—is quite astonishing in that those opposite again assert that this bill is a disguise, a front and a diversion from the real issues.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[2]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

338,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator SCHACHT","4J4","(South Australia-","ALP","Minister for Science and Small Business and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Science)",1432,"—Those opposite keep saying it. It is in the minority report—it says that it is a diversion. We have heard them all the time saying this is the number one issue, which we have never denied, but that the only issue those opposite want to deal with is the economic issue and they say all of these other issues are diversions. The Australian people are quite happy to participate in either side of the debate. They can deal with it. If Australian people had listened to the oppositions view back in the 1890s, we would never have got Federation. In the early 1890s we had the worst economic crises in this countrys history and, at the same time, we developed the Federation. We were able to have referendums to establish the Federation of Australia, despite Australia going through the worst economic crisis since white settlement began.So it is astonishing that those opposite can assert now that issues such as this are a diversion. I think this parliament is quite capable of dealing with many issues. I still think opposition senators are stupid. I would not mind their saying that they are opposing this on other issues, but to say that it is a diversion, that people cannot handle this issue or that those opposite cannot handle it, is just absurd. The parliament is here to handle many different issues every day.This simple bill contains what we now call the pledge of commitment as a citizen of the Commonwealth of Australia, as well as the preamble, as amended by the Australian Democrats, which reads, `recognising that Australian citizenship represents formal membership of the community of the Commonwealth of Australia; and Australian citizenship as a common bond, involving reciprocal rights and obligations, uniting all Australians, while respecting their diversity; and persons granted Australian citizenship enjoy these rights and undertake to accept these obligations by pledging loyalty to Australia and its people, and by sharing their democratic beliefs, and by respecting their rights and liberties, and by upholding and obeying the laws of Australia.The Bill sets out the pledge of commitment that people swear when they become citizens of Australia at citizenship ceremonies around Australia. I, like every member of this chamber, have attended citizenship ceremonies at which people have taken out citizenship under the existing oath of allegiance. I believe—I have certainly had anecdotal evidence given to me; I cannot prove the numbers—that there are migrants in this country who will not take out citizenship because they want to swear allegiance to Australia rather than appearing, as they see it, to swear allegiance to the Queen of England. There have been reports in the press that, in the last few months since this legislation was introduced into the parliament, people turning up at citizenship ceremonies to become citizens of Australia have been upset that they cannot use the new oath of commitment. This is an indication that people want to be loyal to Australia and want to be able to take that pledge.The opposition is not interested in those people. It wants to use an oath of allegiance that is clearly written for the 19th century. This is indicative of where the politics of the opposition are. Its politics are the politics of the 19th century. It cannot cope with progressive, evolutionary change in respect of the identity of Australia, the feeling of pride that Australia can stand alone and the belief that Australians want to identify with their own symbols and not the symbols of another country.That in no way denigrates the role and standing of Her Majesty the Queen of Australia and Queen of Great Britain, but is a recognition of the fact that this country is evolving its own identity. All honourable senators opposite want to stop that because they have another political agenda. They just cannot conceive, and do not have the graciousness to say, that the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the present government may be doing the correct thing in respect of Australias national identity. They do not want to concede to the government what they consider to be political capital.As I have said in previous debates, these are the politics of the permanent opposition. I have said before that this is the first time since federation that members of the non-Labor side in the Senate have not had ministerial experience. That is the truth. Nobody opposite has had to accept ministerial responsibility and the responsibility of being in government. Opposition members have ended up like the Labor Party unfortunately was in the 1950s and 1960s: satisfied with being in permanent opposition, collecting the money for being here, but not really wanting to be in government. That is where opposition members are at.Those opposite are adopting procedures in this place that reflect the fact that they form a permanent opposition. They cannot conceive that they could be in government again, and that is why they have adopted this attitude towards this bill.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[2]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

Unfortunately for them, they are still sitting on the other side of the chamber.I return to this important bill. Once the Senate passes this bill and its provisions are publicised and made available, I anticipate that many more people will come forward to take out citizenship in Australia. They will see that this oath of commitment is, for them, a commitment to Australia and the society they want to be a part of rather than, in the case of the present oath of allegiance, a swearing of allegiance to a head of state on the other side of the world.Again, I in no way want to denigrate the role of Her Majesty the Queen. Unfortunately for her, some of the carryings-on of the other members of the royal family in recent times have not added great lustre to the monarchy in Great Britain. I suppose that in all modern families these days we have to accept that, though we may try for perfection in our family lives, these things occur. But Her Majesty has carried out her constitutional functions without any criticism.Honourable senators opposite would have noted that the other day Her Majesty the Queen authorised the Prime Minister to say that she would accept whatever advice is given by her ministers in Australia. This was a natural, proper and appropriate constitutional comment. I agree that there was nothing sensational about it. Of course, some people opposite would have hoped that the Queen had not said anything other than what was entirely appropriate.This bill, which will be carried this year, will be another step forward in what will be an ongoing debate in this place and, above all else, in the community about how Australians see themselves and what sort of function they want for their government during the rest of this decade. I notice that Senator Boswell quoted a particular opinion poll today. I do not get too carried away about opinion polls, which can have us 15 per cent ahead or 15 per cent behind on this issue.There will be a considerable amount of toing-and-froing over this issue. That is why it cannot be rushed. I have never argued for there to be a rushed debate. It will take some years. The people of this country need to feel confident that when ultimately a referendum is put to them they will understand all the ins and outs of what they are voting for.Another issue involving national symbolism is the national flag. Mr Coates, the President of the Australian Olympic Committee, made an interesting comment in the last couple of days. He indicated that he thought it would be useful to have, even by the time of the Atlanta Olympic Games, an Australian flag without the Union Jack that is totally identifiable with Australia. He pointed out to his critics, including Mr Howard, that he has marched four times behind the existing Australian flag at Olympic opening ceremonies.Mr Coates pointed out that he finds it a confusing symbol. He hopes that by the time of the Atlanta Olympic Games—","N/A","AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[2]/talk.start[5]/para","N/A","N/A"

He also remarked that the republic is an issue to be decided by the Australian people. He said that of course the Olympic Committee would accept whatever the decision of the Australian people may be. But his personal view was that a new flag for Australia without the Union Jack would be preferable. Of course, in the year 2000 he would like to see an Australian citizen, as the Australian head of state, declare open the Olympic games. It is all part of the public debate and it is ongoing.I conclude by pointing out that honourable senators opposite are in a lather over some aspects of this debate.

People in the community always know that when it comes to substance and interest in the broader issues the Labor Party, not the opposition, is the one doing things. I suppose that some of this may be sentiment and some of this may be emotion. Arthur Calwell—he was not a successful Labor leader by any means, but a successful minister for immigration who established the immigration program that has brought millions of people from around the world to make this a multicultural society and a much better society—once said about his personal philosophy and the identification of the Labor Party that `we are Labor because we are Australian, and we are Australian because we are Labor.At some university that remark may not be, in philosophical terms, absolutely correct but, in emotional terms, it sums up what the Labor Party and Labor movement is about. It sums up our identity as Australians and why we are proud to take on the debate about our identity and not afraid to raise the issue of change for the future in an evolutionary way.If the opposition keeps boxing itself into a corner we will be more than happy. Those opposite may think that our fifth election win was a mistake, but the way they are going on they will make it certain that we will win the sixth and the seventh election so that we will still be in government when Australia is declared a republic on 1 January 2001. This bill, which I hope the Senate carries, is another important step forward for Australias changing national identity.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[2]/talk.start[10]/para","N/A","N/A"

I oppose the bill that the government has brought forward.Senator Schacht mentioned Arthur Calwell in his closing remarks. Despite the fact that I am a Liberal, I acknowledge the fact that Arthur Calwell was a great Australian. Arthur Calwell had many features. There is an interesting quote in Hansard to show what a great supporter Arthur Calwell was of the Australian flag.There was a debate between Arthur Calwell and Mr Menzies during a debate on a bill relating to the flag in 1952. One member referred to the blue in the flag as the blue which reminded him of the clear Australian sky. Arthur Calwell said the blue in the flag reminded him of the Eureka flag. Arthur Calwell was a very strong supporter of the Australian flag as was Dr Evatt, Ben Chifley and Curtin. The history of the Labor Party, right up until the time of Paul Keating, regarding national symbols was at one with the Australian nation.In this debate we see how Labor is not only constantly dumping on Australias history but also constantly dumping on Labor Party history. It was Dr Evatt who described the Australian flag as the most beautiful flag in the world. There is a very famous quote from Dr Evatt relating to that.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[3]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

355,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator KEMP","WW4","(Victoria)","LP","N/A",1435,"—Senator Reynoldss knowledge of Australian history is weak but her knowledge of Labor Party history also shows significant gaps. It was a great irony that Senator Schacht chose to lecture us about what he saw as a foreign queen. It was Senator Schacht who moved the motion at the Hobart conference to make Australia an independent nation, as he called it.It was Senator Schacht who also brought down quite an interesting report entitled, A review of Australias efforts to promote and protect human rights . When we are debating the independence of Australia, I invite Australians to look at that report because in that report Senator Schacht, the mover of the republican motion, also advocated a recommendation that Australians have access for domestic disputes to UN committees. For the first time since the passing of the Australia Act of 1986, when the Australian legal system became self-contained, Senator Schacht decided that the government should open up appeals by Australians in domestic disputes to foreign judges. Senator Evans has called this the new internationalist agenda.Senator Schacht claims that he treasures the independence of this nation and comes into this chamber and lectures us about the need to make Australia more independent. There is an interesting page in this report where Senator Schacht refers to the need to make a declaration under article 41 of the ICCPR, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. By signing this particular article and removing the reservation, other countries for the first time have the right to make complaints against Australia and those complaints will be judged in a foreign court with foreign judges.I put it to Senator Schacht that there are many paradoxes in his character. He has been constantly opposed to censorship. I remember him constantly chiding Senator Walters over this matter but he wanted to censor political advertising. He wanted to censor the publication of Odgers.Senator Schacht reached the height of hypocrisy when he moved motions about the independence of Australia. He has reversed the philosophy of the Australia Act of 1986 and he has opened up the Australian legal system to foreign courts. I dare say that he will be recalled, to the extent that he will be recalled at all in Australian history, as the man who reversed the philosophy of the Australia Act and for the first time involved foreign judges in our legal system. So he should not speak to us about the independence of Australia.There is another different point of philosophy that came through in Senator Schachts speech. His concern was with what he called the developing Australian identity. That is the code that Senator Schacht and his colleagues use to say that they are unhappy with the current Australian identity. One can hold that view. I do not hold that view.I put to Senator Schacht that a lot of Australians are very proud of their country, very proud of their history and very proud of their current identity. They do not believe, unlike the Paul Keatings and the Senator Schachts of this world, who are so worried about our current identity, that we need to develop it further. Certainly over a period of time things change and people change. I put to Senator Schacht that to suggest that something is wrong with the current identity of Australia is a philosophy or view not shared by most Australians.The subject of this debate is the oath. I congratulate my colleagues Senator Short, Senator Reid and Senator Boswell for the contributions they have made and the way they have analysed the oath which the government is wishing us to change to and the way they drew attention to the features where this oath seems to lack coherence. There aretwo areas of the oath I find quite extraordinary. The first is—and Senator Bolkus will remember this—that there is nothing in this oath which suggests that we should be forswearing all other allegiances or putting Australia first and foremost.I would have thought that if those opposite were going to come into this chamber and try to beat the patriotic drum—I must admit that given Senator Schachts record of encouraging foreign judges to become involved in Australian disputes, it is a beat which sounds distinctly discordant to my ears—it would not be unreasonable that the section of the oath which the Labor Party removed in 1986, which had the phrase `forswearing all other allegiances, might have been incorporated. But of course it was not.It was interesting that when Mr Abbott from Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy appeared before the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs he put some views that there should be some amendments to the current oath. He suggested that the words should be along the lines of `forswearing all other allegiances. When a representative of the Australian Republican Movement came before the committee I put to him, to make it clear, that this oath should be assertively more Australian. He said that he did not feel that was needed; in fact, he felt that could be regarded as a divisive element. If we are really wanting to beat the nationalist drum, surely those words, which have been part of the oath for a large number of years, should be included? Senator Short read the American oath to the chamber. It includes the phrase:I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state or sovereignty.That is an assertively American republican oath. Of course, in Australia, under the somewhat equivocal nationalism of the Labor Party, such a sentiment is not acceptable. We see in the current oath that there is no element of any loyalty to any particular institution, constitution or head of state. That is another weakness of the oath of allegiance.It is interesting, because of the nationalism that Senator Schacht tried to manifest in here, that there was a debate in the cabinet about whether the word `nation should be included in the oath. Those great nationalists in the Labor Party—Mr Keating and his ministers—reflected on whether it was really politically correct to include the word `nation in the oath. Former Senator Tate was kind enough to inform the committee investigating this bill that the Labor Party felt that the word `nation did not have the right resonance for the current period. Again, it shows just how equivocal the Labor Party is on these particular issues.Senator Cooney said that he felt this debate we are having today should not be confused with the republican debate. I think Senator Cooney was wrong. This is entirely part of the republican debate. Anyone who, like myself, has a great respect for Senator Cooney and the contributions he makes to debates would listen to his comments and think about them. But Senator Schacht made the point that the oath is indeed part and parcel of the Labor Partys republican push. It is part of that wider debate. We do not know what sort of republican constitution the Labor Party wishes to put forward to the Australian people. I believe, with good reason, that the Australian people are becoming increasingly nervous about the sort of republic that Mr Keating would have in mind.One person put it to me that the case against the republic could be summed up in two words—President Keating. I think it is a telling point that people are concerned about what sort of country Australia will become led by a man who has lowered the standards of his office to an all-time low, who attempts to politicise every major activity in this country, who speaks about our past history in a way which I think repulses most patriotic Australians and who goes home to Ireland and says he is returning home.I will tell the Senate where my home is. My home is here in Australia. When I return home, it is to my home here in Australia; I do not return home to Ireland. I make that point without any disrespect to my Irish grandparents who came out to Australia. They undoubtedly brought with them a lot of the Irish spirit which we so admire. But Ireland is not home to me. It may be home to Mr Keating, and I think most Australians wish that he would go home, and go quickly. Our home is here in Australia.It showed the quality of the man when Mr Keating came home after Australia won the Olympic Games—which gave all of us a great boost; what a great achievement it was—and immediately attempted to politicise the games. He tried to enlist the Olympic Games to the wider Labor agenda. The government backed off that particular issue pretty rapidly when the Australian public, through talkback radio, made known its view of Mr Keatings contribution to this issue.The oath of allegiance is part of a wider debate on the republican issue. It is a desperate attempt to remove what the Labor Party sees as an offensive symbol in the oath of allegiance. I have to say that no people are faster to swear allegiance to Her Majesty than members of the Labor Party when they win office. When Mr Keating stabbed Mr Hawke in the back he was quickly up to Yarralumla to swear the oath of allegiance as Prime Minister. There was no concern or hesitation in the Labor Party at that time about any oath which contained a reference to Her Majesty.I want to make a couple of final points. As a member of parliament I make a habit of attending as many citizenship ceremonies as I can, as indeed do Senator Short and my colleagues here. I have always been impressed by the diversity of people who are becoming Australian citizens. I spend some time speaking to them and listening to their views. Not one of them has ever expressed any concern about the current oath, and I have been to many citizenship occasions. This is a total furphy raised by the Labor Party in an attempt to pit Australians against Australians.We are involved in a major debate about Australias constitution. Australia today is a very tolerant, peaceful, multicultural society—a society which I believe is probably the envy of most countries around the world. Indeed, Tina Turners song, which was played before the rugby league grand final, could equally be applied to this country—it is Simply the Best . We have come as far as we have because we have constantly built on the foundations of our history. I do not believe there has been a generation of Australians which has not been intensely proud of this nation and wanted to build it further.There has never been a leader in Australia who has not been proud of this country, who has been confused about the countrys identity and who has not felt a sense of pride when he sees the Australian flag flying—except Mr Keating. That is Mr Keatings great contribution to this country after 92 years of democracy and federation under a constitutional monarchy. We are, as I have said before in this chamber, arguably the worlds oldest continuous democracy. We have come this far because of the inherent values of the Australian people which we have cultivated and nurtured; because of the institutions and systems of government which we have developed; the role played by our churches and so forth.What we are seeing is an attempt by the Labor Party to denigrate the past—those things that have gone before and created this country that we feel so proud of, the things that have enabled us to win the right to host the Olympic Games. In fact, the only person confused about the Australian flag at the IOC occasion, when we were given the Olympic Games, was apparently Mr Keating. The rest of the Australians there did not suffer Mr Keatings particular confusion, and indeed felt that great flush of pride which pulsed through the nation on hearing that Sydney had been chosen to hold the Olympic Games.In the broad sweep of history this will not be seen as a major development. It is a pity that this bill has been brought forward, and it is a pity for this reason: it is another divisive, nasty attempt by the nastiest, most divisive Prime Minister in Australian history to pitch Australians against Australians. When Mr Keating goes home to Ireland and he feels that flush of pride, he should understand that when Australians come home they, too, feel that flush of pride. They feel a great pride in their own history. The Labor Party spits on our history at its peril.This debate has a long way to run. I regret the way Mr Keating is running this debate. The only way the debate can be run is to say, `We have a better constitution which will improve the lot of the Australian people. He can run that debate, but I say,`When you run that debate do not spit on our past.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[3]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

I had intended to vote for this measure at its second reading stage. There is no-one in this chamber who would not agree with me that the Australian Citizenship Act needs amendment. Of course it needs amendment.This was adverted to in the dissenting report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs by Senator Vanstone, Senator Kemp and Senator OChee. They quoted Sir Ninian Stephen as saying that the act is an `abysmal document, that not only is it an extraordinary example of legal and bureaucratic language but that it is extraordinarily inappropriate for its title. The dissenting senators went on to say, `We believe it is inappropriate to make piecemeal amendments prior to such a full-scale review. I am inclined to the view that the amendment being put is not piecemeal. There are certain features of this bill—leaving aside the pledge—which many people would not have any objection to and which would improve the bill.I have listened to the republican debate and I am concerned that there is now an attempt to call into aid certain questions, certain issues that should not be called into aid, namely, the amendments to the Australian Citizenship Act. There is also an attempt to call into aid religion to sustain a particular position on the republican issue. That would be the most inappropriate action for anyone to take because it only heightens and fosters what we least need in this community—sectarianism.I listened to what Senator Cooney had to say. Senator Cooney, who is Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, assured the Senate that this was not part and parcel of the governments program to achieve a republic.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[4]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

Certain issues have not been adequately canvassed in that arena thus far. I go to the question of land and the rights of the Crown, and to various other key matters which have been discussed but which need mature consideration.I am prepared to agree to this matter going through the second reading stage, provided that we get official indication from the minister, as Senator Cooney has indicated, that this measure is not part and parcel of the republican push. I say that because I recall this debate last year and, quite frankly, it did not hit me as being part and parcel of a republican push. I recall speaking to our former colleague Senator Tate about the wording that is now proposed for the pledge of allegiance. I would like to see some of that explained in the committee stage as well.There is a need to have incorporated into the principal act a preamble that sets out what the actual meaning of citizenship is and what it represents. There is an attempt to do that in clause 3 of the bill. It would be illuminating for the Senate to consider that in the committee stage. Unless I hear from the minister in his reply that Senator Cooney was wrong in assuring the Senate that this was not part and parcel of the republican debate, I will support this measure at the second reading stage.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[4]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

It is the governments intention to agree with the amendment circulated by Senator Spindler to clause 3 of the bill; that is, that the third phrase in the preamble be amended to include the words `undertake to before the words `accept these obligations, so that the full text of that phrase will now read, `persons granted Australian citizenship enjoy these rights and undertake to accept these obligations.We do so because we feel that the amendment proposed by the Australian Democrats strengthens the commitment that one has to make to citizenship and to Australia as a nation. It does so by demanding an active act rather than the passive words that were in the text and that are in the text now. I indicate that we support those and, hopefully, those words will be passed by the Senate.Senator Spindler also requested that the preamble should be read at citizenship ceremonies. I undertake to ensure that the act is implemented in such a way that the regulations pursuant to it provide for the preamble to be so read by ceremony administrators.I also agree with the third proposal of Senator Spindler which is to adjust the citizenship certificate to include the words `and having undertaken to fulfil the responsibilities of a citizen. I think they also are words that demand an act on the part of those who are being granted citizenship.Having said that, and given that there does seem to be some degree of support in this place for the new oath of allegiance, let me say at the outset that the government sees that, with the passage of this legislation, this parliament will be doing a number of things. It will be reflecting the nature of our changed society. It will not be taking that act of republicanism that Senator Harradine was talking about. It is not a formal recognition of a republic Australia.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[5]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

It does reflect the nature of the society that we now have in Australia. It is a changing society. It is a society which now consists of some 140 different ethnic communities. It has changed enormously and radically in the last 20 to 30 years. It is working extremely well, and it is working well because not only is the composition of that society so diverse, but also this parliament has a deliberate policy—and a bipartisan one at that—that has as its benchmark an inclusive approach to our society. It says to people of different religions and different ethnic backgrounds, `We respect your right to celebrate your religions and your diversity, and we will ensure that there are mechanisms in place to ensure that you can enjoy those rights, privileges and religions in a way that is tolerated, supported and recognised by the rest of society.The approach we are taking is inclusive and to that extent we can be compared with many other parts of the world which take an approach to migrants coming to live in those countries which excludes them from full participation in the society in which they live. I have just spent some time in Europe and I have been able to witness the difference between this country and others when it comes to how migrants and people of different ethnic backgrounds are included in the life of the societies of such countries. I have seen the racial tensions that exist in other parts of the world. It is not very hard to analyse those tensions and those societies, and to appreciate that when you start excluding people—when you start oppressing them and repressing them when they want to enjoy and maintain the sorts of traditions that they have lived with for generations—you will get those sorts of racial tensions.We in Australia have an inclusive approach and when it comes to an act like the citizenship act and the rights of citizenship we are once again inclusive. We do not, for instance, bar people from application forever, nor do we bar them from application to rights of citizenship for eight to 10 years as some countries do. We say to them, `Come to Australia, spend time here, prove yourselves as good citizens and after a short period of time you will be entitled to the rights of citizenship. That is an important aspect in ensuring that people feel as if they are part of a society and have a commitment to the core values of the society.That is the other aspect of what makes our society so strong. Being part of Australia does not only mean that you can enjoy those traditions and religions and ethnic backgrounds, it also involves a commitment to a common core set of values and principles and institutions. We need such a commitment. We need to have that spelt out. The citizenship pledge, which we have had in legislation for decades—one that has had change in the past—needs to reflect those core values, those core principles of the institutions that we hold as fundamental to our society.By putting up this particular piece of legislation the government is updating the legislation in such a way that it does reflect the bonds that are common to all Australians and that unite Australians. To that extent, it needs to be a distinctively Australian commitment. It is one of a series of national symbols that we have in Australia and as such is a symbol—","N/A","AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[5]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

The opposition lost the last election, not only because its economic policy was out of sync or out of tune with the aspirations and the needs of the people, but also because it did not have a social policy with which society could bond. Its policy did not recognise sufficiently the nature of women in our society or the nature of the multi-cultural aspects of our society.Those opposite have been barricaded into the values of the 1950s. Some of them are smart enough to know it and they are not getting involved in this particular debate, but a lot of them do not. Once again, they have been led from behind, led by the rural rump, led by those who really have not had a new idea—a new concept—for decades. What we have seen this afternoon, as we saw yesterday and as we will probably see tomorrow, is the opposition delving into the garbage bin of rhetoric. That is all those opposite have—no substantive new ideas, no grasping of the reality of where this society is going and no grasping with the concept of where we are and what our imperatives now are.We are no longer six states and two territories competing against each other for markets. We are now one nation competing with Asia and the rest of the world for markets in the fields of technology and of commerce. We are now living within a world which no longer has people staying in one part of the world and not moving. With technology and with communications the world is moving very quickly. Money is moving quickly, financial corporations are moving quickly, jobs are moving quickly and, with that, people are moving quickly. The only force in politics and the only force in our community that has not grasped that is the opposition.It has been barricaded into the past. It lost the last election because it has not responded to that social change and it is in danger of doing the same again—not because next time it will not have a social policy but because next time it will have an anachronistic social policy, one that does not take into account what sort of society Australia is and what the needs of that society are.Those opposite have come in here this afternoon lost in those arguments and in the rhetoric, talking about antiquated values, but for most of the time, what have they done? They have abused the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). They have set out to abuse the Prime Minister personally and denigrate him, saying that he is lower than life and whatever. This is the same person about whom they were saying these same things this time last year and it is the same person who gave them a hiding at the election earlier this year. He gave them a bath because he tapped into what Australians are thinking and what direction Australia is now taking.I have no doubt—and I did not support the Prime Minister when he was making a run for the leadership—that he will be remembered as a pioneering Prime Minister, one of vision, one of guts and one who was prepared to make the changes to fit Australia in a way that would make it adequate and appropriate and fit to fight the battles of the end of this century and into the next century. He recognises both the economic imperatives and the social imperatives, and no degree of abuse from the other side will undermine that reputation which he will have into the future. No degree of abuse from the other side will detract from the fact that there is an irreversible tide in the electorate moving in the same way as the government is moving, in the same way as the Democrats are moving and in the same way as other forces in this place are moving, but which is not being responded to by the opposition.As I say, we need to have an oath of allegiance which reflects the core values of Australia and which is a bonding instrument, and we can do so without any disrespect to our sovereign—absolutely none at all. No-one from this side and no-one from the Democrats who has participated in the debate in this place or outside of it has said anything negative about our sovereign. She is the Queen of Australia and whilst she is that we will go through the processes and we will pay allegiance, as the Prime Minister did when he went to Yarralumla to be sworn in, as we all did, in conformity with the law in the country. Our obligation is to the law as it stands. But the reality is that there is an anachronistic situation in that we in Australia swear an allegiance to the head of state of another country.I was at a dinner last night in Parliament House where the first toast was to the President of Lebanon, who was there as the official guest. The next toast was to the Queen of Australia. I hoped that the person next to me, the President of the National Assembly of Lebanon, really appreciated how the Queen of England found her way into the proceedings of the night. It is an uncomfortable situation, but it is part of the law and as part of the law we obviously observe it.Senator Short has mentioned the need for a revision of the Australian Citizenship Act. I want to place on record the governments appreciation, and my appreciation, for the work that former Senator Tate did in crafting this amendment, with the assistance of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and cabinet. Senator Tate took a very deep interest in this proposal. We should recognise the work that he has done, and I gladly do so. I see the amendment that Senator Tate initiated on this oath as being very fundamental and one that has been able to be proceeded with without the need to address other aspects of the act. It is one that the government has been keen to ensure would proceed without being hindered by other considerations in respect of the Australian Citizenship Act, so we are proceeding with it.Very early in my time in this portfolio I said that I have been considering the rest of the act and how that also needs to be reassessed by government. I agree to a certain extent with the words of Sir Ninian Stephen that the act needs a fair degree of updating. Some of the basic principles of the act are fundamentally right and they do allow us to manage the process of citizenship in a positive way. I am looking at ways that the act can be reviewed and I expect that before Christmas I will be able to make some announcement as to how we can proceed on that broader issue. I have made those comments before today, both domestically and overseas, and there is nothing new in them.I see this amendment as fundamental and one which can and should proceed. This amendment recognises and reflects a changed Australia. It reflects the sort of Australia we now have. It also acts as a very fundamental instrument which reflects a need for common values, common institutions and common principles. As a consequence, the government and I personally are very pleased to be initiating this sort of change to our legislation.Question put:That the bill be now read a second time.Bill read a second time.The Bill.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[5]/talk.start[4]/para","N/A","N/A"

He said that it was necessary that our oath, pledge or whatever other phrase will be uttered by migrants who assume Australian citizenship recognise the `core values and institutions of the country.Given that the constitution sets out the core legal and constitutional institutions of this country, why is it that this particular pledge, which the government is putting forward in this bill, seeks to completely ignore one of those core institutions, which of course is the constitutional monarchy, as contained in the Australian constitution? Does the minister believe that the constitutional monarchy, as contained in the constitution, is not a core institution of this country; or does he believe that this pledge has missed one of our core institutions?","N/A","AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The governments position has been that both in the preamble, where we talk about upholding and obeying the laws of Australia, and in the pledge where, once again, there is reference to upholding and obeying the laws, we anticipate, as part of the core values and core institutions of this country, that those values and laws will be adhered to, particularly the laws.Senator OChee asked whether the Queen is an institution within the Australian constitution. I think everyone acknowledges that the Queen has a very important part in the constitution. What we are talking about though is swearing allegiances to the democratic beliefs, rights, liberties and laws of the country. In terms of an oath of allegiance for citizenship one does not have to take the next step and swear an oath of allegiance to the Queen. We obviously recognise that the Queen is part of our constitutional make-up, but what we are saying is that when one swears an oath of allegiance to obtain citizenship, one does not have to go through a specific act of swearing allegiance to the sovereign.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

He, like I, has probably noted that the vast majority of citizenship ceremonies are conducted by local authorities—a core institution in our society. Unfortunately, it is not a core institution that is recognised by our constitution, and that brings to the fore another anomaly in a constitution which is now close on 100 years old.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
372,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator OCHEE","EU4","(Queensland)","NP","N/A",1444,"—Having heard Senator McKiernans persuasive words, I am starting to think that this pledge is more and more defective every moment. Not only has the pledge left out the Queen, who is part of our constitution, part of a tripartite system of government, but Senator McKiernan tells us that this pledge has left out other key institutions of this country.The point is this: the minister gave us an explanation that we had to have a pledge that recognised the key institutions of this country, yet the ministers explanation for leaving out the Queen is that there is a reference to the laws of this land. The laws of this land are very important, but there is a hierarchy of norms in this country. The laws are part of a set of institutions, but we have to recognise that there is an institutional process for creating those laws. If we merely say that we are going to abide by the law, that is a fairly meaningless statement. If you do not abide by the law, you get put in gaol. It is so fundamental that I just cannot understand why the minister still chooses to leave out any reference to the constitutional monarchy.The minister has told us that this has absolutely nothing to do with the republic. Why then does he oppose the reference to the Queen in this pledge if it has nothing to do with advancing the republican cause? I can see my friend Senator McKiernan over there straining like a greyhound in the slits looking forward to the passage of this bill. I know what Senator McKiernans views are and I respect that they are different from mine. But the minister cannot escape the fact that this bill has an ulterior motive—and that is to advance the cause of the republican movement by weakening the adherence of Australian citizens and new Australian citizens to the institutions of this country.At a time when we should be seeking more national unity to overcome the adversities which face our nation, it is particularly disappointing that this government seeks to bring into this parliament massive changes to citizenship in this nation through the change of the oath of allegiance.

I have said before and I say again that this legislation is defective, and I do not believe that the bill should stand as amended. I really feel that for this bill to stand as amended is as ludicrous as the spurious arguments we have heard that the Labor Party changed the White Australia policy. We know that is a nonsense, in the same way that the suggestion that this bill stand as amended is a nonsense. This bill is technically defective in failing to address the fact that we have a core institution in the constitutional monarchy which is not recognised. I know that brings a great deal of disappointment to the minister, but it is a fact. It is a fact that the wording of this bill has overlooked the wishes of a large number of Australians.So when we come to look at the question of whether this bill stand as amended, I say that this bill should not stand as amended. Although we have had amendments from Senator Spindler—and good amendments they were, and I support them; and Senator Spindler raised or foreshadowed similar amendments in discussions with us in the committee—I say that this bill still is not good enough. That is why I argue that this bill should not stand as amended.I say that this bill should not be accepted by the committee of the whole because of its manifest defects, its manifest omissions and because it seeks to divide one Australian from another. I know that may be perceived as a policy argument, but we now have a bill in a new form from the original form we had. I was hoping that we may have had some amendments that might have improved the bill and really taken into consideration what the minister said about recognising core values in this country, but we did not have those amendments. So I have a right and an obligation to stand before the committee of the whole and say that the bill should not be accepted; that the committee of the whole should not accept this bill because, in its current form, it still overlooks all those issues that I have raised during the course of my speech.I know it may pain the minister and some of his cohorts on the other side, but I would be failing in my duty if I did not point these things out. There is enormous danger when we have the tyranny of the barest majority. One always opens the way in issues such as this to intolerance, to racism and to bigotry—and some of us have lived with the consequences of those for far too long.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[5]/talk.start[7]/para","N/A","N/A"

The minister might like to take that on board.The same applies to the next line of the pledge, which refers to the rights and liberties of Australia and its people. The final line is: `whose laws I will uphold and obey. Presumably, if the wording has any meaning, that refers to the laws of Australia and its people. Who are we talking about? Are we talking about the Australian government or some other institution, or are we talking about some laws that the people themselves may have thought up? If so, what are those and so on. It is a very loose wording and it is on that basis that the essential legality of the wording has been raised with me as questionable.

The current form of the pledge talks about allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia. According to the Macquarie Dictionary , the term `allegiance means the obligation of a subject or citizen to the sovereign or government; duty owed to the sovereign or state; observance of obligation; or faithfulness to any person or thing. The new form talks about loyalty to Australia and its people. One of the problems with the word `loyalty is that it generally attaches to a person. That person is to be the person who symbolises and epitomises, in a constitutional sense, the countrys core values.I ask the minister: has the government considered the legal implications of changing the form of words where `allegiance applies to a person who symbolises and constitutionally epitomises the country to the words `loyalty to Australia? What does the word `Australia mean in the new pledge? That is what I would like to know. I am seeking this information generally. The minister might also advise the chamber as to whether, in the event that there is a republic and a president of the republic, it is the intention of the government to change this pledge to return it to `allegiance to in reference to the president of the country.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[12]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I will quote what he said from the Hansard :. . . `I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people. This is the affirmative, positive act indicating a solemn commitment, an allegiance to Australia and its people. `Australia is used there in a very simple expression but it has various levels of meaning. Obviously, there is the political entity, the Commonwealth of Australia. Loyalty is being expressed to that political entity, the name by which we are known amongst all the nations. But there is also a geographical and physical sense, which should not be totally discounted—the place. There is a commitment to Australia as the place where we are fortunate to be, the sunburnt country . . .Senator Tate goes on:. . . the land abounding in natures gifts of beauty rich and rare. In other words, we could have used the term `Commonwealth of Australia, but that would have been too restricting. `Australia is just used in its simplicity with these various levels of meaning. So the loyalty commitment is meant to evoke obligations to Australian society, the political entity and the land itself, the place where we are.I think that covers Senator Harradines point. I think Senator Tates comments also cover the point about precedents. It is a loyalty to the political entity, the land itself and the place where we are, and that encompasses the institutions of Australia in those senses. There is no intention to go on and do the things that Senator Harradine is worried about.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[13]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

As Senator Harradine has pointed out, that replaces an allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, her heirs and successors. As Senator Harradine again quite rightly points out, allegiance in that sense requires obedience to the laws duly passed. The Queen is head of state not just of Australia but also of each of the individual states. So allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, her heirs and successors requires obedience to the laws of the Commonwealth and each of the states. The wording which has been substituted in its place relates to the laws of Australia.My concern—and I hope the minister can address it—is that this seems to leave out an obligation to obey the laws of each of the states, which are not mentioned in this provision. It would appear that the substituted wording does not catch the full meaning of the allegiance or obedience which is required in the existing oath of allegiance. I ask the minister whether this matter has been examined and on what basis is there an argument for saying that this proposed wording may include an obedience to the laws of each of the states, which are not expressly mentioned here and which are separate governmental systems?","N/A","AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[14]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

400,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator SHORT","DJ4","(Victoria)","LP","N/A",1449,"—I did not want to delay matters by speaking on those previous areas. I wish to make absolutely clear in this third reading stage how strongly opposed the coalition is to this divisive, pre-emptive and very dangerous bill.I wish to pick up a couple of things that have been said since the second reading debate. In particular, I refer to a remark made by Senator Spindler in his contribution on the second reading of the bill. In support of the bill and the removal of the reference to the Queen in the oath or affirmation, he said—if I got him right—that we should be rejecting this symbolic relic of the past.Senator Panizza, who followed Senator Spindler, found that remark very highly offensive. I also find that remark very highly offensive. Like Senator Kemp, who also spoke in the second reading debate, I am insulted and very angry at the recent attempts by the government and some of its supporters or fellow travellers to rewrite the history of this country. That is what has been going on here for a lengthy period. This government has become a past master at attempting to rewrite history. It is attempting to rewrite immigration policy, our multicultural policy and a whole host of other policies that really go to the core of our history and the values that have built this nation.The remark made by Senator Spindler, perhaps unconsciously, adds to that. But even worse, Senator Spindler is simply wrong. The symbols that we are referring to are not relics of the past. Even Senator Bolkus accepted in his remarks just a while ago that the Queen still is central to our constitutional system, which is the whole framework on which our society, government and parliament are based.The symbols referred to by Senator Spindler and by other speakers, particularly government speakers as a matter of denigration, are the present basic living symbols of our present basic living institutions. They are not just symbols; they are part of the essential working framework of this nation. Those symbols, those essential parts of our basic framework as a nation, do nothing at all to detract either from the multicultural nature of our society or the perception of our nation. On the contrary, what they do is enhance and enrich those great values, attitudes and attributes of our nation.Many of us in the Senate—I know the minister does—spend a great deal of time talking with a very wide range of people across the spectrum of Australia. I spend a great deal of time talking with the leaders and average members of the so-called ethnic communities of non-English speaking backgrounds in all states and regions of Australia. In my discussions with those people, I have never had any view at all expressed to me on any concerted basis on the question of the reference in the existing oath and affirmation to allegiance to our head of state, to our Crown, to the centrepiece of our constitution.Indeed, to the extent that I have heard comments proffered to me, they tend to be the opposite; they tend to express a great pride in the act of citizenship—and rightly so—and what these people are swearing allegiance to. The government, without any grounds for doing so, is sweeping away very prematurely those living symbols; they are not in any way relics of the past.It distresses me very greatly—I will come back to this a little later in relation to Senator Harradines request for an assurance from the minister about this—to see this bill being used in such a blatant way and as part of the push for a republic agenda. That is what all this is about. This is a deliberate, calculated attempt to hijack the republican debate and to pre-empt the outcome of it.In that desperate, headlong rush to achieve his personal ambition and agenda, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is running some very grave and dangerous risks that are causing great potential damage to this country. It distressed me greatly—I am sure it distressed every Australian greatly—to hear that, during the Prime Ministers recent visit to Ireland, he was reported as saying just a few days ago that he is a republican because he is a Catholic. I have seen no refutation of that comment.In other words, the Prime Minister, in his personal push towards building an agenda for an Australian republic is resurrecting the ghost of sectarianism that blighted this country through much of our history and which, thank God, we got rid of decades ago. When the government starts to do those sorts of things, to use this chamber, this forum and this bill to achieve its agenda, it is about time we said, `Hey, hang on. Lets have a long, hard and careful look at this. The whole approach to this is offensive to most Australians. It is disgusting, dangerous, divisive and, above all, un-Australian.The minister, Senator Bolkus, very rightly talked about tensions in other parts of the world. I could not agree with him more on that point. He is correct to compare our tolerant, inclusive, multicultural society with those tensions overseas and to draw attention to the fact that we have the great virtue of having escaped those tensions in Australia because we have done it right. We in this country must do everything that we can to preserve that tolerant, harmonious, enriched and diverse yet united society. It is our greatest gift and treasure.What is this government doing? It is seeking, through this bill and in other ways, to divide the Australian people, not to bring them together. It is seeking to pursue policies which endanger our tolerant, generous and united nation. It is not only this bill that is doing it, although it is an important part of the agenda. Look at the governments handling of Mabo and all the legislation and debate surrounding that. Look at its handling of industrial relations issues and a myriad of other things. They all add up to a very long list of very divisive approaches.Senator Harradine, in his very wise comments, sought assurance from the government, through Senator Bolkus as the minister, that this bill be not part of a republican push. I may be wrong, but I do not think Senator Harradine received that assurance. But even if he had, what earthly weight could he place on it? There can be no doubt that it is an integral part of the Prime Ministers headlong personal rush down the republican road at any cost—regardless of the cost to social stability, social harmony and the basic tolerance of our great nation.If it is not part of that agenda—I put this to Senator Harradine and other members of the Senate—why bring on this obviously contentious and very sensitive change at this time? There is no urgency for this bill and there is no urgency to change the oath or affirmation of allegiance. There is no pressure to do so from the ethnic communities or any other sections of the Australian community.Given that we are now in the middle of an ongoing and emerging debate about the future constitutional arrangements for this nation, the obvious and proper course of action would have been to let that debate run its course, to await the outcome of that debate and to find out the wishes of the Australian people to see what the clear majority of the Australian people feel about it. If they want to change our constitutional arrangements, so be it; that is fine.But the Australian people need to decide that, not be pre-empted and hijacked in the process by a government which represents, at best, less than a majority of the Australian people. The obvious, proper and logical course would have been for this issue—the question of the oath of allegiance and, particularly, the deletion or continued inclusion of reference to the Queen as our head of state and the cornerstone of our constitution, which is the cornerstone of our nation—to be considered after we had concluded the debate and reached our views as a nation, a community and a people on whether we want constitutional change involving the Queen.We are putting the cart before the horse in debating this matter in this way and with this timing. There can only be one logical reason for that, which is that it is part of the republican agenda.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/debate.sub1[3]/speech[1]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

402,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator SHORT","DJ4","(Victoria)","LP","N/A",1449,"—As Senator OChee says, it is an important part of the republicanism movement by stealth. The fact is that this bill is highly divisive within the Australian society and nation. It is premature in terms of the ongoing debate that we have. As I said, only when there is clear evidence of the need for change and a clear majority support for that change should we contemplate making the changes envisaged in this bill. There is not that need or clear majority. Indeed, the contrary is the case.To proceed with this bill and these changes at this time is a course which I believe this government and, more particularly, the Australian people will rue because it will be part of a divisiveness that this nation can desperately do without. For all those reasons, I reiterate in the strongest possible terms the coalitions total opposition to this bill.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/debate.sub1[3]/speech[1]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

A countrys historic heritage is one of the most valuable possessions it has. It is part of a countrys culture and substance. That does not mean to say that at every time in a nations life we must try to retain everything that it had in the past.That is what I meant when I made those remarks. Those remarks have apparently caused some distress to Senator Short and other honourable senators. I meant no disrespect to the Queen. But the fact is that the Queen is not part of the future of Australia. She is not here and she is not part of our national life at this stage. We must move on. The message is, in taking the action that the Senate is likely to take tonight, that we must point to the future and say that we must be loyal to Australia, to Australians and to the future of Australia and not loyal to a person who is essentially the monarch of another country.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/debate.sub1[3]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The question that may arise is why have a head of state at all. A head of state is supposed to be a person who represents the core values of our society. That person should be looked up to. That person is regarded as impartial and free from the partisan, political shenanigans that go on in a country.Originally I felt that the words that were proposed in this amendment to the Australian Citizenship Act were far better than the words that are currently contained in the act. Having heard what Senator Short and the minister have said, my problem is with the question of to whom do we pledge allegiance. It is all very well to say that we pledge allegiance to Australia and its people but who is it that represents the core values, the constitution, the ideals and protects the people and, indeed, the parliament. That person is the head of state. That person can be the Queen of Australia or the president of Australia.I believe that this matter needs further consideration. I suppose it will go through tonight.

I specifically noted the commitment to avoid activities in areas likely to have a high conservation value, pending assessment of these areas for determination against agreed reserve selection criteria. I further advised that funding assistance for assessments of old growth forests and wilderness was available from the Commonwealth and requested advice on priorities for assessment in NSW.On 31 May 1993, I wrote to the Hon George Souris MP, the NSW Minister for Land and Water Conservation, seeking support for old growth studies in NSW as a matter of priority.(7) The NFPS was developed co-operatively with the States and Territories and it remains the Governments intention to implement it in as co-operative a manner as possible.(8) The NFPS is only meaningful if Governments who are signatory to it remain committed to, and actively implement, the policy initiatives contained within the Statement. It is up to all signatories to honour the commitments they made when they signed the Statement. I believe that Compartments 1402 and 1312 are likely to have high conservation values.

418,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Senator Cook","RF4","QLD","ALP","N/A",1454,"—The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senators question:(1) The Minister is aware of Mr Mollisons statement.(2) The figure of 93 per cent is not correct.The correct figure depends on the definition of cancer used. There are at least 100 different forms of cancer in chickens. The most common form, seen in birds of less than 22 weeks of age, is Mareks disease. The more common cancer in older birds is called leucosis. There is an effective vaccine for Mareks disease and commercial layer flocks are vaccinated, and in addition are from leucosis free stock. The frequency of leucosis in layers is less than 1%. Backyard and free range chickens also suffer from these cancers, usually at a much higher rate than commercial layers.(3) Most chicken meat in Australia comes from broilers slaughtered before 7 weeks of age. These birds have a low, even negligible cancer rate.Assessment of the potential health implications to consumers of the presence of cancer in battery hens shows that there is no association between the consumption of chickens in general and human health risk, and none between the consumption of battery hens with, or without, cancer.There are no risks because virus diseases of animals, including chicken cancers, are species specific. Very few virus diseases will cross species barriers, and then only between closely related species such as monkeys and man and sheep and cattle.The risk to consumers from eating chicken meat from battery hens is extremely low because, in addition to the species barrier, the meat is cooked before eating. Most bacteria and viruses are destroyed within a few minutes at 70(o)C. In addition the concentrated acid in the stomach and intestinal enzymes of the consumer will further degrade and inactivate viruses.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[3]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
