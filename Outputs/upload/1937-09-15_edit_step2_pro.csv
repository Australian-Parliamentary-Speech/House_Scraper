The Development and Migration Act 1926, made provision for the preservation of the existing and. accruing rights of Commonwealth and State public servants appointed to the staff of the commission, but did not specify what those rights were. In 1928, the Officers Rights Declaration Act was passed specifying the rights preserved to Commonwealth officers appointed to the staff of the commission, but no action was taken to specify the rights of State officers appointed to it. This bill indicates the rights which it. was intended to preserve to State officers under the Development and Migration Act.Under the Commonwealth Public Service Act, an officer of the State Public Service who transfers to the Commonwealth Public Service is entitled to have the period of his employment by the State counted for the purposes of computing sick leave and furlough, provided, of course, that his service with the State and the Commonwealth is continuous.In the case of certain officers whose service with a State, with the Development and Migration Commission, and subsequently with the Commonwealth Public Service has been continuous, the period during which they were on the staff of the commission represents, under the law as it now stands, a break in such continuity. This means that for purposes of sick leave and furlough, the service of these officers is regarded as having commenced only from the date of their appointment to the Commonwealth Public Service after the abolition of the Development and Migration Commission.","Second Reading","COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC SERVICE BILL 1937","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

They are to be distinguished from drugs in that they are biological products. Perhaps the two most familiar examples of these substances are diphtheria anti-toxin, which is an example of a substance prepared by bacterial action, and insulin, which is an example of a substance prepared from animal glands. The object of the bill is to ensure that these substances shall be of the right strength and purity, because it is recognized that they are very potent, and would be capable of working great havoc in the community if they were defective in quality. The bill, therefore, proposes to ensure that they shall comply with the following basic requirements : -They shall be true to a determined standard, that standard having an official and legal status ;They shall be free from contamination, more especially from bacterial contamination ;They must be properly and safely packed; andThey must be accurately labelled as to dosage.The standard adopted is that fixed by the League of Nations. It is international in its acceptation, and is recognized everywhere the League of Nations is recognized. The bill applies only to importations and exportations ; it does not apply to serum anti-toxin and vaccines manufactured at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, which are covered by laws and regulations designed to ensure their absolute purity, and compliance with standard requirements.The bill provides simple machinery giving the Minister power to licence importers so as to give official supervision over the channels of importation, and to supervise the preparation of these substances for export. Every container of these substances must state clearly what it contains, the biological formula for its manufacture, and the standard dose, together with a statement that the contents are free from contamination, and comply with thestandard laid down and recognized. The subject could be amplified at great length, but it is sufficient to say that, in effect, this is a bill which extends that kind of protection which is afforded by the Pure Foods Act to foods, and the Pure Drugs Act to drugs, to those biological preparations which are so extensively used to-day, and upon the purity of which the health and lives of our citizens depend.","Second Reading","THERAPEUTIC SUBSTANCES BILL 1937","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

A Member when proposed and seconded shall inform the House whether he accepts nomination.The Clerk shall then ask,  Is there any further proposal?, and if, within two minutes thereafter, there is no further proposal, the Clerk shall say  The time for proposals has expired . No Member may then address the House or propose any other Member, and the Clerk shall, without question put, declare the Member so proposed and seconded to have been elected as Speaker, and such Member shall be conducted to the Chair by his proposer and seconder, and shall take the Chair of the House as Speaker.If more than one Member is proposed as Speaker the Clerk shall, after the second proposal and after each subsequent proposal (if any) is made and seconded, ask  Is there any further proposal?, and if, within two minutes thereafter, there is no further proposal, the Clerk shall say  The time for proposals has expired .When the time for proposals has expired, debate may ensue, but it shall be relevant to the election.No Member shall speak for more than five minutes.At any time during the debate a Motion may be made by a Minister rising in his place, and without notice, and whether any other Member is addressing the Chair or not  That the Question be now put .The Clerk shall then put the question, without debate, That the Question be now put . In the event of the numbers being equal the Question shall be decided in the negative.Upon the carrying of tie Question  That the Question be now put , or upon the cessation of the debate otherwise, the election shall be proceeded with as provided in this Standing Order.Before the House proceeds to a ballot the bells shall be rung as in a Division.When only two Members are proposed and seconded as Speaker, each Member shall deliver to the Clerk a ballot-paper in writing, containing the name of the candidate for whom he votes; and the candidate who has the greater number of votes shall be the Speaker, and be conducted to the Chair.When more than two Members are so proposed and seconded, the votes shall be taken in like manner, and the Member who has the greatest number of votes shall be the Speaker, provided he has also a majority of the votes of the Members present; but if no candidate has such majority, the name of the candidate having the smallest number of votes shall be excluded from subsequent ballots, and a fresh ballot shall take place; and this shall be done as often as necessary, until one candidate is declared to be elected asSpeaker by such majority, when such Member shall be conducted to -the Chair.If at any ballot it is impossible by reason of the equality of votes to determine which name shall be excluded from subsequent ballots, a special ballot shall take place at which there shall be submitted only the names of those candidates who have received equal votes. At such special ballot each Member shall write on his ballot-paper only the name of the candidate he wishes to retain. The candidate whose name appears upon the smallest number of ballot-papers shall then he excluded from subsequent ballots,At any time after the result of the first ballot is declared, but before the commencement of the second or other subsequent ballot, a candidate may withdraw his name from the election which shall then proceed as if he had not been nominated.) If by reason of equality of votes a ballot or special ballot is rendered inconclusive, the Clerk shall so declare, and unless by a withdrawal another ballot or (as the case may be) another special ballot is rendered unnecessary, he shall cause such other ballot or special ballot to be taken. If after the counting of votes the equality continues he shall so declare. Thereupon the sitting shall be suspended for 30 minutes and when the House reassembles the votes shall be taken again, unless this is rendered unnecessary by a withdrawal.Whenever at any stage a withdrawal leaves only one candidate remaining he shall without further voting, be declared elected as Speaker, and shall then be conducted to the Chair.Having been conducted to the Chair, the Member elected returns his acknowledgments to the House for the honour conferred upon him, and thereupon sits down in the Chair, and then the Mace (which before lay under the Table) shall be laid upon the Table.The Speaker having been congratulated, a Minister shall inform the House at what time the Governor-General will be pleased to receive the House for the purpose of presenting the Speaker to His Excellency, and the sitting of the House shall then be suspended until that time.Before proceeding to any business, the Speaker, with the House, shall present himself to the Governor -General; and, on returning, shall pass through the Chamber, and, having resumed the Chair, shall report his presentation to the Governor-General.Standing Orders proposedto be repealed -A Member, addressing himself to the Clerk (who standing up, points to him, and then sits down) shall propose some otherMember, then present, to the House for its Speaker, and move,  That Mr............... do take the Chair of the House as Speaker. 8.. If only one Member be proposed and seconded as Speaker, he shall be called to the Chair of the House without a Question being put.Such Member, on being called to the Chair, shall stand up in his place, and express his sense of the honour proposed to be conferred upon him and submit himself to the House.If more than one Member be proposed as Speaker, the Clerk shall, in the order in which the Members shall have been proposed, put the question  That Mr............... do take the Chair of the House as Speaker; which shall be resolved in the affirmative or negative.Having been conducted to the Chair, the Member elected returns his acknowledgments to the House for the honour conferred upon him, and thereupon sits down in the Chair, and then the mace (which before lay under the Table) shall be laid upon the Table.A Member having congratulated theSpeaker,a Member of the Government shall inform the House at what time the Governor-General will be pleased to receive the House for the purpose of presenting the Speaker to His Excellency, and the sitting of the House shall then be suspended until that time.The Speaker, with the House, shall present himself to the Governor-General ; and, on returning, shall pass through the Chamber, and, having resumed the Chair, shall report his presentation to the Governor-General.This motion does not cover all the re- commendations of the Standing Orders Committee because, as appears in the committees report, there was a reservation by one member. What that reservation related to I do not know, but I do not think that there can be any difference of opinion regarding the advisability of adopting the new Standing Orders relating to the election of a Speaker and Chairman.","Election of Speaker","AMENDMENT OF STANDING ORDERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The honorable member for Bourke (Mr. Blackburn), being a member of the committee, is familiar with what transpired. Those clauses, however, are not covered by the motionI have just moved.As honorable members will have seen from the report of the committee, the proposed new Standing Orders relating to the election of a Speaker and Chairman are designed to prevent the occurrence of a stalemate by the introduction of a method of voting by ballot in the event of a contest. I remember, as also, no doubt, does the honorable member for Bourke, the rather farcical situation that arose in the Parliament of Victoria when it became practically impossible to elect a Speaker under the old rule. The difficulty had to be overcome on that occasion by members agreeing to withdraw from the chamber, and to hold a meeting of all parties in order to determine by secret ballot what candidate they would support. The new rules suggested by the committee seem to be admirably fashioned to prevent the occurrence of difficulties of that kind. While they provide for nominations on the floor of the House, and for the election of a Speaker and Chairman in that way if there is only one candidate for each office, they also provide for the election by ballot in the event of a contest. This allows an immediate result to be achieved, and is more in keeping with the dignity of Parliament.","Election of Speaker","AMENDMENT OF STANDING ORDERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I took that step with the object of safeguarding my position, because I realized that when the committees report was submitted to Parliament I would find in it many suggested alterations of which I did not approve. As the Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons) is now present in the chamber I wish to know if he approves of this business being brought on at this hour. The Deputy Leader of the Op position (Mr. Forde) was notified of this measure only this afternoon, and he has not had time to inform any honorable members on this side of the intentions of the Government.

A. Member when proposed and seconded shall inform the House whether he accepts nomination.I take it that that is part of the procedure followed at present.

The impression conveyed by the Attorney-General was that there was nothing contentious in the proposed alteration. He particularly failed to make any reference to this alteration.Paragraph e reads -No member shall speak for more than five minutes.That also is a new proposal. Even in determining the merits or demerits of the candidates who are offering for the position of Speaker, an honorable member will be permitted to speak for not longer than five minutes. Some honorable members may consider that that is sufficient; I do not. Consequently, I shall not agree to such a limitation being imposed.Paragraphf reads -At any time during the debate a motion may bo made by a Minister rising in his place, and without notice, and whether any other member is addressing the Chair or not  That the question be now put .The Clerk shall then put the question, without debate,  That the question be now put . In the event of the numbers being equal the question shall be decided in the negative.Upon the carrying of the question That the question be now put, or upon the cessation of the debate otherwise, the election shall be proceeded with as provided in this Standing Order.That again is a new provision. Paragraph rj reads -Before the House proceeds to a ballot the bells shall be rung as in a division.Paragraph h reads -When only two members are proposed and seconded as Speaker, each member shall deliver to the Clerk a ballot-paper in writing, containing the name of the candidate for whom he votes; and the candidate who has the greater number of votes shall bc the Speaker, and hu conducted to the Chair.In this case, the ballot-papers are to be handed to the Clerk. It is customary in all ballots for scrutineers to be appointed to check the counting of the votes. No such provision has been made in this Standing Order. These ballot-papers are not to be available to the representatives of the candidates for their perusal, consequently, I do not approve of that change being made. The opportunity should be provided for those who are interested to satisfy themselves that the ballot-papers have not been counted in an irregular manner. Paragraph i reads -When more than two members are so proposed and seconded, the votes shall be taken in like manner, and the member \v,ho has the greatest number of votes shall be the Speaker, provided he has also a majority of the votes of the members present; but if no candidate has such majority, the name of the candidate having the smallest number of votes shall he excluded from subsequent ballots, and a fresh ballot shall take place; and this shall bc done as often as necessary, until one candidate is declared to be elected as Speaker by such majority, when such member shall be conducted to the Chair.Paragraph j deals with an equality of votes. It reads -If at any ballot it is impossible by reason of the equality of votes to determine which name shall bc excluded from subsequent ballots, a special ballot shall take place. at which there shall be submitted only the names of those candidates who have received equal votes. At such special ballot each member shall write on his ballot-paper only the name of the candidate ho wishes to retain. The candidate whose name appears upon the smallest number of ballot-papers shall then bc excluded from subsequent ballots.I can find no further provision to meet the contingency of an equality of votes again resulting. That is quite likely to happen. The candidates could continue to  go to the post  so long as the votes were properly regimented; and they would be in this House.","Election of Speaker","AMENDMENT OF STANDING ORDERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[22]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

At the same time, the public would regard the proceedings as strange if the sitting were suspended to enable a determination to be reached in connexion with the most important position that this House has to fill. I want to know what reasons are advanced for the suspension of the sitting for 30 minutes. The proposed Standing Order provides that when the House re-assembles the votes shall be taken again, unless this is rendered unnecessary by a withdrawal. That does not place the position in a very favorable light. I am certain that if a candidate for election as Speaker returned to the chamber after the sitting had been suspended for 30 minutes, and withdrew his nomination, a certain degree of suspicion would attach to his withdrawal. Paragraph m reads -Whenever at any stage a withdrawal leaves only one candidate remaining, he shall without further voting, be declared elected as Speaker, and shall then be conducted to the Chair.I should have thought that the next paragraph would have provided, in the case of continued equality of votes, for a further suspension of the sitting for 30 minutes, but there is no such provision. Therefore, it could happen, as the result of the adoption of this suggested new procedure, that equality of votes would continue. After all the procedure contained in this recommendation, with the suspension of the sitting thrown in, it is quite possible and competent for honorable members to be just as equally divided in their votes after the resumption of the sitting as they were before it. What would happen then? Apparently there is no answer to that question.","Election of Speaker","AMENDMENT OF STANDING ORDERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[30]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I think I was appointed because of some experience I have had in the matter of Standing Orders. The Standing Orders were considered very elaborately at a great number of meetings and the one now before the House gave the committee considerable trouble. In my opinion, as proposed, it is a very good standing order, and one that the House should adopt. So strongly did I feel on this point that I went, as I believe others did, to the Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons) and asked that he should bring the matter before the House before it rose. This will be the last meeting of this Parliament and, if the Standing Order is to be of any value in the election of the new Speaker in the next Parliament, it is necessary that it should be passed now. I am not able to speak for the honorable member for Hindmarsh or for the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Curtin), who are absent, but I believe that I was not the only member of the Standing Orders Committee from this side of the House who approached the Prime Minister upon this matter. The House realizes of course, that we have had no complete revision of the Standing Orders since first we provisionally adopted Standing Orders in 1903. All attempts at a complete revision have been fruitless. It is realized - I realize at any rate - that the whole of the proposed new Standing Orders are not likely to be speedily passed by this Parliament, but I do think, from my own experience in this House and elsewhere, that it would be excellent to adopt this Standing Order, which provides for the election of the Speaker. I regret that it has come to us late, but I understand the matter was mentioned last week.

In the opinion of the committee, the best possible means of settling that issue is that now proposed. Only theSpeaker has a casting vote under our Constitution. The situation foreseen by the honorable member for West Sydney (Mr. Beasley) might arise in an open election in. the House.When this subject was under the consideration of the committee two defects in the present system were . apparent - a major and a minor defect. The major defect is that the Speaker is a government nominee. The choice of the Government becomes the choice of the House, and the Speaker is chosen on a party division. If a secret ballot were necessary, the Speaker would become, in a very real sense, the choice of the House. The minor difficulty is that the officer in charge of the proceedings at the election of the Speaker, being an officer of the House, is not a member of the Parliament, and is not, in the nature of things, entitled to demand from honorable members the same respect as would be required by a presiding officer who is the choice of the House. In this Parliament, and also in another Parliament, I have seen the Clerk of the House put in a most unfortunate position in connexion with the election of Speaker. The former Clerk of this House was put in the unhappy position of having to accept a motion that an honorable member be no longer heard.The proposal now submitted by the Standing Orders Committee would obviate both  difficulties. A secret ballot would ensure that the choice of the presiding officer would really be the choice of the House. The Clerk of the House could not, of course, be given a casting vote. No provision is made in the Constitution for _ such a situation ; nor is there any pro.vision for lot3 to be drawn. The Standing Orders Committee was of the opinion that, in the event of a position of equality persisting after the second ballot honorable members should be given an opportunity to think about the subject before a further ballot was taken, and in a different atmosphere. It was for that reason that the suspension of the sitting was recommended.The honorable member for West Sydney should realize that both the honorable member for Hindmarsh, a member of his own party, and an ex-Speaker of the House, and the late honorable, member for Darling Downs, Sir Littleton Groom, also an exSpeaker, approved of this proposal. I believe that all honorable gentlemen would approve of it if they would approach it dispassionately and on its merits. Unless this proposal i3 adopted now wc shall probably find ourselves at the inception of the sitting of the next. Parliament in a similar position to that which faced us at the inception of the sitting of this Parliament. I suggest, with respect, as a comparative tyro in the House, that such a situation does not become the dignity of the House; nor does * it tend to increase the esteem in which Parliament is held by the people. It is not calculated, either, to cause the public, or even honorable members, to believe that the Speaker is actually selected for his personal capacity, and not merely because he is a government nominee. I arn sure that any Speaker would be happy to feel that he had been really selected by the members of the House, and was not beholden in any way for his position to the party in power, in which case, a weak man might show a tendency to lean, towards the Government party. We have had ample evidence, of course, that you, sir, have discharged the duties of your high office with absolute impartiality and very high ability indeed. I have felt pleased and proud to sit under your chairmanship in this House. A weaker man might have felt obligations to the Government, and might have been disposed to defer to the wishes of the Government, with the result that government supporters might have enjoyed privileges not accorded to honorable members of the Opposition. We should avoid any situation of that description.The object of the Standing Orders Committee was to provide, within the limits of the Constitution, for such apersistent e.ase of equality as might easily arise with this Parliament constituted as it, is at present, for 37 honorable members might vote on either side. In such a case, the only possible means of reaching a decision would be by the common sense of honorable members. I, myself, favour a. secret ballot for the election of Speaker for the same reason that I favour a secret ballot for the election of candidates for Parlia- ment, so that a man may, without fear, favour, or affection, feel free to cast his vote for the best man available. The merit of the. proposal now before the House is that it achieves that end.This is an urgent matter. If .this proposal is adopted now it will- enable the new procedure to be applied at the opening of the new parliament. I am sorry that suggestions of bad faith have been made in this matter.","Election of Speaker","AMENDMENT OF STANDING ORDERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Sometimes half-a-dozen reports are submitted in one day. As the Standing Orders Committee was not unanimous on this point I urge that honorable members be given an opportunity to debate the question. It would not be wise for the Prime Minister to rush this business through in the dying hours of the Parliament. Had this business been put on the notice-paper for a particular time, honorable members would have had an opportunity to consider it and might have been prepared to diffusa it. At any rate they would have had a. chance to peruse the report. Further, the report could have been considered at special meetings of the parties. Honorable members might suggest that this is not a subject for party consideration, but surely the provisions of the Standing Orders are of vital consequence not only to members of the Labour party but also to the members of other parties in the House. I urge the Prime Minister to agree to the postponement of the consideration of this report which, I find, contains 41 printed pages. I doubt whether it has been read by more than three or four members of the House, and it should not he expected that the House would accept it without comment in the dying hours of the Parliament. I am as industrious as any other member of the House, and I have not had time to read the report. There is just cause for asking the Prime Minister to agree to a postponement, of the consideration of the report until such time as honorable members have had adequate opportunity to consider it.","Election of Speaker","AMENDMENT OF STANDING ORDERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

For these delays the Commonwealth has not been responsible. Both agreements are nearing the final stage, outstanding matters having been reduced to comparatively minor details. They will be submitted to Parliament at the first opportunity after their completion.We have now reached the end of the proceedings of the present Parliament. I take this opportunity to offer to you first, Mr. Speaker, my deep thanks for and my appreciation of the manner in which you have presided over our deliberations during the last three years. To-day a very high compliment was paid to you by the honorable member for Bourke (Mr. Blackburn), who in another sphere occupied the position that you occupy in this sphere, when he said that it was an honour and a privilege to him to sit and serve under you. You have brought to the discharge of your duties not only ability but also impartiality. The recent disagreement between you and me emphasized the impartiality of your decisions. You have not recognized party, but have done your utmost to uphold the dignity of this Parliament. Therefore, I am confident that I speak on behalf of all honorable members when I thank you very sincerely for all that you have done. Whatever limitations may be imposed upon my later remarks, both personal and political, I am in a position to wish you, at any rate, well.The. sentiments that I have expressed in regard to you, I extend also to the Chairman of Committees (Mr. Prowse).We all owe a deep debt of gratitude to the officers of Parliament for the assistance that they have rendered to us. TheClerk of the House was recently promoted to that position. On behalf of members generally, I express appreciation of his ability and impartiality, and thank him for his assistance. I have been associated with the present Clerk of the House throughout my political career whether in the State or in the Commonwealth Parliament. I was associated with him back in the days when he was Clerk Assistant in the smaller Tasmanian Parliament, and during all these years his work has been marked by efficiency and impartiality. I take this opportunity to congratulate him on his recent appointment and to wish him long years of success. To those associated with him and to all other members of the staff of this House, whether their spheres of duty are inside or outside the chamber, I offer my thanks and appreciation. Politicians are very much indebted to them for the assistance that they give. Furthermore, I may be permitted to say at this juncture, because as we approach the general elections the close of these proceedings is different from the normal conclusion of sittings, that I extend my thanks to the whole of the Public Service of the Commonwealth of Australia.When the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Curtin) was leaving this Parliament a week ago to embark upon the election campaign, I expressed my sentiments towards him. We all have the greatest respect for the Leader of the Opposition. Although he is a political opponent, we regard him as being a personal friend, and wish him well personally, although not politically.This has been a strenuous Parliament. We have had to face difficult problems and, at times, party political feeling has run fairly high, but at the close of it we are in a position to say that whatever views we have of the politics of, our opponents, we have a high personal regard for them. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, at the close of this Parliament, I want to thank all, you Mr. Speaker, the Chairman of Committees, officials, members of the Opposition and, particularly, the officers of Hansard, who, with great efficiency, embellish and polish our speeches so that they look worth while for us to present in our constituencies. I pay that particular tribute to the Ilansard staff because they have been of very great help to honorable members.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The success of parliamentary institutions depends on the conduct of the business in Parliament, and that in turn depends to a great extent on the personal attributes of the presiding officers. We realize, as an Opposition, that your position is onerous and that your duties at times are irksome. When feeling runs high in debate it is often extremely difficult to maintain order, but we believe, as an Opposition, that you have always endeavoured, to the very best of your ability, to act impartially. You have done credit to yourself and to the exalted position which you occupy.Although the Chairman of Committees and I disagree violently on tariff questions, I am glad to say he has done his work as chairman ably and well, and has endeavoured to sec members of the Opposition- as frequently as members on the Government side of the House.It would be extremely difficult for you, Mr. Speaker, and for the Chairman of Committees, to discharge your duties in Parliament without the able services of the Clerk of the Parliament, the Assistant Clerks, the Serjeant-at-Arms, and other members of the staff. In paying tribute to the ability of the present Clerk I extend to him our very hearty congratulations upon the attainment of his high position. I also wish to offer a meed of praise to his predecessor in office, Mr. Parkes, who, having reached the retiring age during the life of this Parliament, has laid down his duties.

It is really remarkable that in all the confusion that sometimes occurs in Parliament, with cross-firing and interjections, they are able to compile such intelligent reports of our speeches for us to read the next day. We are particularly fortunate in this Parliament, also, in having such a courteous and capable staff of attendants. Frequently four or five signals must appear at a time in the attendants alcove, and I have been amazed at the speed, accuracy and unfailing courtesy of the attendants in replying to the calls made upon them. They seem to be able to produce, with the utmost promptness, anything that honorable members may desire, except suitable missiles to cast at an opponent.We are indebted to the staff of the Parliamentary Library. Mr. Binns and his capable assistants render invaluable service to honorable members by their researches, and their ability to provide us with information for the preparation of our speeches.Although in the heat of debate feeling runs high at times between honorable members on one side of the House and those on the other, and although we, as an Opposition, strongly oppose Government supporters on certain matters of policy, we leave this Parliament without carrying away with us any personal animosities. The Labour party faces the elections with a feeling of confidence. We hope that when. Parliament re-assembles we shall be sitting on the other side of the House and honorable gentlemen opposite will be on this side of it, in which event we trust they will be able to extend the co-operation that is expected of a reasonable opposition in order to assist an enlightened government to put its proposed legislation on the statute book.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/speech[2]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
229,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"PAGE, Earle","C7E","Cowper","CP","Minister for Commerce",1149,". - I promised the honorable member for Echuca (Mr. McEwen) some time ago that I would obtain for him information regarding the recent conference of millet-growers. A meeting representative of broom millet growers in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, the broom manufacturers in New South Wales, the New South Wales Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Commerce, was held at the office of the Department of Commerce in Sydney, to-day. Questions affecting the disposal of existing stocks, and proposals for dealing with future elops, were discussed. Arising out of the discussion it was resolved that an Australian Broom Millet Advisory Committee, consisting of not more chan two growers, and not more than two manufacturers from each State, should be formed, with an independent chairman nominated by the Department of Commerce. The purpose of the committee will be immediately to gather all available information regarding present stocks and crop prospects for the coming season. It will then meet again with the object of determining reasonable prices for millet, having regard to the estimated quantity available, manufacturers requirements and market prospects. Some concern was expressed by delegates regarding the possibility of a surplus of broom millet being carried over into 193S. It was therefore decided that ali available information about the present position and future prospects .should be circulated by the Department of Commerce to growers organizations as soon as possible for the guidance of growers in planning their sowing programme for the coming season.I desire to associate myself with the remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Forde) who congratulated you, Mr. Speaker, and the Chairman of Committees, upon the manner in which you have carried out your duties. I also desire to express my appreciation and thanks to the officers of the House, to the Hansard staff, to the attendants and all those associated .with the conduct of Parliament, for the assistance they have rendered during the session. I also desire to thank honorable members in all parts of the House for their assistance.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
230,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CASEY, Richard","JWE","Corio","UAP","Treasurer",1149,". - Yesterday the honorable member for Echuca (Mr. McEwen) asked for particulars regarding the operation of the act in which £100,000 was voted for interest and sinking f-nd in connexion with funds made available to local bodies for public works. Honorable members will recall that the Commonwealth Government was anxious to assist in making provision for the unemployed in the States. There were two methods, and only two, by which this could be done. One was a grant to the States from revenue, and the other was to allocate loan moneys to the States. It soon became apparent that both methods were becoming increasingly difficult, because the Commonwealth Government did not have any appreciable amount of surplus revenue from which to make grants, and the making of loan moneys available was a dubious advantage, because all loan moneys come out of the same pool, and the more loan moneys made available by the Commonwealth, the less is available for the States. A scheme was therefore devised under which the Commonwealth Government set aside from revenue £100.000 a year for ten years, for use by local bodies in the States on condition that the States set aside a similar amount. This scheme, under which £200,000 a year was made available, came into operation a year ago, and has proved, in practice, very satisfactory. The value of the works thus assisted amounts to £9,250,000. The money was distributed strictly on a population basis, and the States, almost without exception, have acted up to the spirit and letter of the Commonwealth Governments intention. As a complete list of the works approved, most of which have already been set in motion by the various States, would be too long to insert in Hansard. I have arranged to place fifty or sixty copies of the list on the table of the library, where they may be perused by honorable members.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The records show that strong pressure is being exercised to allow panels from which steel bodies are built to be admitted under by-law, but this request has been resisted up to the present time, although the agents for some of the smaller motor cars claim that the poundage basis on which panels are admitted makes them too expensive if assembled in Australia. If the honorable member for Bourke (Mr. Blackburn) has information which shows that Australian workmen are being deprived of employment, I shall have the matter investigated, and I shall inform him of the position later by letter, but I doubt whether there has been any loss of employment because the number of employees now engaged in the industry is over 12,000 and is increasing.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/speech[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I desire to add an expression of my appreciation of the services rendered by the members of the press gallery. These gentlemen have become, through the years, the personal friends of all of us. They render a great service to the community by the faithful reports which they supply of the proceedings of this Parliament. I am sure that members of the Opposition join in this expression of appreciation.To-day I offered to allow the honorable member for West Sydney (Mr. Beasley) access to the file relating to the search for oil in Dutch New Guinea and in the Mandated Territory of New Guinea. I am afraid, however, that I cannot accede to his request that I should allow the whole or any portion of the file to leave Canberra, because, so far as I know, no precedent exists for such a course. The -honorable member may take advantage of any opportunity available to him to peruse the file in Canberra; but I think that he, having had ministerial experience, will agree that it would be improper for me to do as he suggests. The general practice is to table such documents either in. the House or in the Parliamentary Library, where they are available to honorable members and also the press. But this file was made available only to the honorable member.Mr. SPEAKER (Hon. G. J. Bell).Before putting the motion I wish to thank the Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons) and the Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Forde) for their expressions of appreciation of my services in the chair ; I hope that I deserve all that they have said of me. The Chairman of Committees and the Temporary Chairmen of Committees will, I know, allow me to acknowledge, on their behalf, the praise that has been bestowed on their work. I am grateful for the courtesy that has been extended to me by Ministers and by honorable members generally, and the assistance they have rendered me in carrying out my duties. Without their co-operation I could not have discharged those duties satisfactorily. I have done my best, but I would not be human had I always been right, and honorable members would not be human had they thought that I was always right. If I have given satisfaction to Ministers and to honorable members, I, too, am satisfied. The officers of the House and the members of the various staffs have carried out their duties with exceptional ability, and I thank them for their uniform courtesy and helpfulness. While in the chair I have known no politics; but within the next few weeks my interest in party politics will be revived. All of us may not be here when the House reassembles, but whether we are or not, I wish well to all honorable members. I shall always feel proud of having had the privilege of presiding over the deliberations of this chamber.Question resolved in the affirmative.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/speech[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
