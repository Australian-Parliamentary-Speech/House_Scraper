226,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,"The PRESIDENT",10000,"N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","—I am required to rule on two matters of privilege raised with me by senators since the Senate last met. Pursuant to standing order 81 and privilege resolution 4, I am required to determine whether a motion to refer the matters to the Privileges Committee should have precedence over other business, having regard to:(a)the principle that the Senates power to adjudge and deal with contempts should be used only where it is necessary to provide reasonable protection for the Senate and its committees and for senators against improper acts tending substantially to obstruct them in the performance of their functions, and should not be used in respect of matters which appear to be of a trivial nature or unworthy of the attention of the Senate; and(b)the existence of any remedy other than that power for any act which may be held to be a contempt.By letter dated 29 January 1993 Senator Walters has raised with me a matter of privilege. The essence of the matter raised by Senator Walters is that a person has allegedly threatened to publish certain supposed information concerning Opposition members of parliament if the Opposition members adopt a certain policy in relation to X-rated videos. Senator Walters refers to certain press reports containing the alleged threats.The possible contempt of parliament contained in the matter raised by Senator Walters is that of seeking by threats to influence senators in their conduct as senators. This is one of the well-known contempts of parliament, and is referred to in privilege resolution 6 under the heading `Improper Influence of Senators.The alleged threat is directed to Opposition members generally and not to any particular person, but it is well established that a threat to unnamed members, or to a group or category of members, or to members in general, can be a contempt just as can a threat to particular members.The alleged threat as reported is also directed to Opposition members of parliament generally, and does not distinguish between members and senators. If the threat as reported were made, it could be regarded as being directed to senators as well as members of the House of Representatives. This is so particularly having regard to the fact that senators could, and probably would, participate in the formulation of any policies relating to X-rated videos.The formulation of such a policy by a group of senators clearly falls within their duties as senators and their conduct as senators within the terms of privilege resolution 6. A threat such as the one reported obviously has the potential substantially to obstruct senators in the performance of their functions.The matter raised by Senator Walters therefore is clearly capable of being regarded by the Senate as meeting criterion (a) which I am required to take into account.In relation to criterion (b), the availability of another remedy for the act which is the subject of the complaint, if there is another remedy, is not clearly or readily available. It may be that, if the alleged threat were made, a prosecution for certain criminal offences could ensue, but it would be a difficult and uncertain process for senators to bring about such a prosecution. A civil suit undertaken after the alleged threat had been carried out and the supposed information published would not be a satisfactory remedy. I therefore think that there is not a readily available other remedy.By letter dated 20 April 1993, Senator Reynolds, as chair of the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Telecommunications Technologies, has also raised with me a matter of privilege pursuant to standing order 81.The matter relates to a letter addressed to the committee by a spokesperson of a company called Eros Foundation. One paragraph of the letter contains what appears to be a threat that unless the committee makes some `reassessment of its findings, actions for damages will be undertaken, presumably against the committee or individual members of the committee.If this interpretation of the paragraph is correct, the paragraph would clearly be capable of being held to be a threat made against a Senate committee and its members in the performance of their duty and therefore a contempt. It is well established that a threat to take legal action made with the purpose of influencing a committee or its members, or actually taking legal action for that purpose, can constitute a contempt.The matter therefore clearly meets criterion (a) which I am required to consider. As the submission of a document to a committee is absolutely privileged, there is no other remedy. I table the letters from Senator Walters and Senator Reynolds and the attachments.I therefore determine that motions to refer these two matters to the Privileges Committee may have precedence in accordance with standing order 81. Senator Walters and Senator Reynolds may now give notice of motions.","N/A","PRIVILEGE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[1]/proctext/interject/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Sir Paul Meernaa Caedwalla Hasluck KG, GCMG, GCVO, Governor-General of Australia from 1969 to 1974, member for Curtin from 1949 to 1969, Minister for External Affairs from 1964 to 1969, Minister for Defence from 1963 to 1964 and Minister for Territories from 1951 to 1963; and that the Senate places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.Paul Hasluck was born on 1 April 1905 at Perth, Western Australia and educated at the Perth Modern School and the University of Western Australia. He began his working life in 1922 as a journalist for the West Australian , where he distinguished himself by twice winning that States Lovekin prize for journalism. From there he took up a post as a temporary lecturer in history at the University of Western Australia.He joined the Department of External Affairs in 1941. In his six years in the department, he travelled on diplomatic assignments to Canada, New Zealand, the United States and Britain, culminating in the post of counsellor in charge of the Australian mission to the United Nations in New York. Sir Paul resigned in 1947 and returned to the University of Western Australia as a reader in history, contracting to write two volumes of the official war history.The year 1949 saw him enter Federal politics. He stood for and won the seat of Curtin and became the Minister for Territories some 15 months later, remaining in that portfolio until 1963. He subsequently became, as the motion states, Minister for Defence and Minister for External Affairs. He held the seat of Curtin for 20 years and was on the front bench of successive Liberal/Coalition governments for 18 of those years. It was a distinguished parliamentary career by any reckoning.I did not have the privilege of knowing Sir Paul personally, but as it happens my senior adviser, Geoff Bentley, worked as his Private Secretary in the mid-1960s. Mr Bentley recently wrote for my department a memoir on Sir Paul as external affairs Minister, from which I think it is worth quoting a few passages:Sir Paul was a tireless worker and prepared much of his own briefing, often calling for files to work on himself. He was among those of our ministers who have demanded the highest standards and who have achieved them. He believed in careful research and precision and clarity in drafting; unexplained acronyms were a particular hate.Seemingly formal and aloof, Hasluck was personally modest and unassuming with little time for humbug and pomposity. In a quiet and unobtrusive way he encouraged many younger officers. Away from work he enjoyed a yarn—particularly about rugby—and he and those around him were genuinely at ease visiting aid projects in the backblocks of Thailand and Vietnam. It was not surprising then that he enjoyed the easiest of rapport with Asian leaders. He was concerned—at times too concerned—not to impose Australias will on Asian decision making, and by todays standards might be thought less than persistent in pursuit of our agenda. On one occasion he complained that a division head wanted him to put an Asian president on the ropes when, first up, he only wanted to get to know the fellow. That evening, at the presidents banquet in Haslucks honour, they both played in the band.Our world then was dominated by an unpredictable Sukarno and Indonesias Confrontation of Malaysia, Singapores separation from Malaysia, British military withdrawal east of Suez, Chairman Mao and the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution, involvement in Vietnam and the theology that our northern neighbours were dominoes in danger of falling before the communist menace.Then, as now, work in and on the Asian region was demanding and professionally satisfying. Despite the testing issues, the early post-colonial period was marked by warm relationships. Apart from Australian MPs being able to call routinely on the likes of the Tunku and Lee Kuan Yew, we had access and expertise that both the Americans and British envied. Our embassies joined the top rung in most Asian countries and perhaps for the first time it was recognised that Australia could carve out its destiny in the region. Looking back, life must have been simpler and the foreign policy agenda not so vast. After all the then Department of External Affairs, including the forerunners of AIDAB and the Overseas Property Group, occupied a mere three floors in one of the 4 blocks of the present Foreign Affairs and Trade building and boasted just one photocopier. It was with few resources at his disposal that Sir Paul Hasluck laid some of the groundwork for where we are in Asia today.That memoir ought to be acknowledged. Sir Paul went on to serve as Governor-General of Australia from 1969 to 1974. It was also during this period that he was able to complete the second of the volumes of the official war history that he had contracted to do back in 1947. From 1974 onwards he returned to his writing and produced several works—historical pieces; essays; his popular autobiography entitled, rather implausibly, Mucking About ; and a number of books of poetry.Journalist, lecturer, writer, public servant, diplomat, politician and vice regal representative—in all roles Sir Paul Hasluck maintained the highest standards of integrity, honesty and loyalty. He worked unstintingly in the service of Australia and the Australian people. He will be remembered as a great, indeed an outstanding, Australian. On behalf of the Government, I extend to his wife, Alexandra, and to the family our sincere sympathy in their bereavement.","N/A","CONDOLENCES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
360,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator HILL","BH4","(South Australia-","LP","Leader of the Opposition)",40,"—On behalf of Opposition senators I join with the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Evans) in expressing our regret at the death in January at the age of 87 of former Governor-General and Minister, Sir Paul Hasluck. Sir Paul Haslucks life was one of most distinguished service and contribution to the Australian community in all of his various careers—as a journalist, diplomat, historian, author, Minister and Governor-General.Sir Paul began his career as a journalist with the West Australian . As I understand it, in 1941, at the urging of an old friend and journalist colleague, John Curtin, he joined the Department of External Affairs and was a senior member of the Australian delegation to the San Francisco conference, which led to the formation of the United Nations. In 1946 he was appointed Counsellor in Charge of the Australian mission to the United Nations. He became a Liberal member of Parliament in 1949 and represented the people of the division of Curtin for 20 years.Within 15 months of being elected, Sir Paul was appointed Minister for Territories in the Menzies Government, a position which he held for 12 years from 1951 to 1963. During this time he played an important role in the eventual independence of Papua New Guinea. After a short period as Minister for Defence, from 1963 to 1964, Sir Paul was given the external affairs portfolio, and he held this ministry from 1964 to 1969.It is possible, according to some, that, but for his reluctance to engage in what some refer to as number crunching in politics, he might well have become Prime Minister in January 1968. Sir Paul was appointed Governor-General in 1969 and retired in 1974. In all of his roles—journalist, author, historian, diplomat, Minister and Governor-General—Sir Paul was distinguished by his great integrity and formidable intellect.I think he could be fairly described as a reformer. In many respects, particularly in his concern for Aboriginal welfare and in his interest in the Asia-Pacific region, he was well ahead of his time. When he spoke of his own career, it was his work as Minister for Territories, particularly in Aboriginal welfare, which gave him most satisfaction.In international relations he held the view that the problems of peace were global and that it was Australias role to ensure that the Asia-Pacific region was not forgotten by the great powers. Another factor which influenced policy making at the time was the perceived need to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of newly independent states.Sir Pauls internationalist approach and his focus on Asia really form the basis on which Australian foreign policy has since developed. It was a revolutionary redirection in our outlook and a fundamental reassessment of our place in the world. There are few Australians whose talents have been so diverse and who have contributed so richly to the development of our nation. On behalf of coalition senators, I extend our most sincere condolences to his widow and family in their bereavement.","N/A","CONDOLENCES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
361,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator KERNOT","XW4","(Queensland-","AD","Leader of the Australian Democrats)",40,"—I rise to offer the condolences of the Australian Democrats to the family of Sir Paul Hasluck, who died in Perth on 10 January this year. It will not surprise honourable senators to know that I never met Sir Paul during his long and distinguished life. In fact, to me he was an important figure in an era when I believe I was just becoming a little more politically conscious. He was someone whose contribution to this nation was already passing into history by that time.Looking over the many things that have been written about and by Sir Paul Hasluck, it is clear that he was motivated by clear principles, many of which I feel a strong identification with. For his time, the young Paul Hasluck was unusually sensitive to, and aware of, the plight of Aboriginal people. It has been said that he supported what was then called assimilation on the grounds that the alternative would have been some form of apartheid. As questionable as his preference may look from the vantage point of 1993, I think there is no question that his motives were humane and honourable.As a Minister and Governor-General, Sir Paul showed an unusually deep and philosophical grasp of the importance of a strong parliamentary democracy and Public Service. One of the ironies of history is the suggestion that had he been Governor-General at the time of the 1975 constitutional crisis, it would have been resolved in a more appropriate way. The irony lies, of course, in the fact that he was appointed by a Liberal-National government, while his controversial successor was a Labor appointee.Sir Pauls parliamentary philosophy valued the competition of ideas but recognised the need for an overarching unity of purpose and commitment to national development. In his first speech, he warmly acknowledged the positive influence of his friend and former colleague, John Curtin. His incapacity or unwillingness to submerge himself in the rough and tumble of parliamentary politics was seen by some as a weakness and by others as a virtue.He appears to have been a student and advocate of parliamentary convention and of dignified parliamentary behaviour. In a 1993 reflection on the Australian Constitution, he deplored the degeneration of Question Time and the growing assumption of power by the Executive, views with which I heartily concur. He was also moved to make this comment:I cannot understand how it was that private greed and personal profit seemed for a period to take front place in shaping national economic policy.That is a matter which has been dear to the hearts of the Democrats for some years.As Minister for Territories, Sir Paul Hasluck oversaw developments in Papua New Guinea, then an Australian colony, which resulted in that countrys later independence. His legacy there may be seen by history as mixed. On the one hand, he appears to have been alive to the ultimate need for self-determination; on the other, the model of economic development which was established for Papua New Guinea—presumably with his involvement—has been a mixed blessing, most notably in the case of Bougainville.Another achievement which amply illustrates the forward looking nature of Sir Pauls ordered but inquiring mind is his role in the establishment of the United Nations. His death has come at a time when the ideals which motivated the establishment of the United Nations are finally bearing some fruit. The Australian Democrats warmly support the motion of condolence for the passing of a distinguished and accomplished Australian.","N/A","CONDOLENCES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
362,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BOSWELL","YE4","(Queensland-","NP","Leader of the National Party of Australia)",41,"—I would also like to extend my sympathies to Sir Paul Haslucks family and associate myself and National Party senators with the condolence motion moved by the Government. Sir Paul Hasluck was a skilled historian, a fine statesman, and a loving husband and father. He started his career as a journalist and entered public life in 1941 when he joined the Department of External Affairs after a chance meeting with his old friend, John Curtin. The department in those days had eight professional staff and occupied about 10 rooms in the West Block building.In 1946, Sir Paul led the Australian mission to the United Nations but resigned from the department the following year after a dispute with the then leader of the government, H.V. Evatt. Sir Paul drifted into Parliament in 1949 after the West Australian Liberal and Country League asked him to stand for the seat of Curtin. He accepted the invitation after some indecision and began to build his career as one of the most unusual and thoughtful politicians of his time.Sir Pauls attitude to his new profession was tempered by his deep scepticism about the value of the conventional rewards of political life. He realised very early in his career that the pomps of this world are fleeting and that political fame and glory melt away. He said in his autobiography:I suffered from a lack of identity with those who seemed to find politics wholly satisfying, and who felt that a political triumph, achieved by any means, was the chief end of man.He developed a reputation as a diffident man who disliked speaking to the media and at one stage the Courier-Mail complained that he `behaved like a Trappist monk.Sir Pauls first ministerial portfolio was the Territories ministry which he held from 1951 to 1963. His greatest achievement in the portfolio was undoubtedly the expansion of representative government in Papua New Guinea, both at the local and at the territorial level. His policies were controversial but laid the groundwork for the successful democracy that Papua New Guinea has today.Sir Paul was appointed Minister for External Affairs in 1964 after a brief sojourn in Defence. He established an impressive international reputation, particularly in Asia, although he never achieved—nor did he seek—a particularly high profile here in Australia.Sir Paul was appointed Governor-General in 1969 and, from the start, was determined to take an activist role. He believed, as I do, that the Governor-General should act as a brake on the Executives enthusiasms. He did not believe that the Governor-General could impose his own ideas on the government, but rather that the Governor-General should ask questions, encourage, and ensure that the governments decisions were in accordance with the Constitution and the law. He closely followed the process of government administration through extensive discussions with his three Prime Ministers, Gorton, McMahon and Whitlam. He later said that they were prepared to seek his advice because they knew that he had extensive political experience and because they knew that he did not have his own political agenda.Sir Paul paid particularly close attention to the Executive Council minutes that passed across his desk and did not hesitate to question proposals that seemed to him to be poorly considered. He later said that he rejected, on average, two or three out of every 100 Executive Council proposals because they were not properly put together.I believe that Sir Pauls attention to detail considerably enhanced the quality of public administration during his term in office. His Governor-Generalcy highlights the important role played by the Governor-General as an independent figure who can consult, encourage, and warn, but can never, by convention, attempt to advance a Government House line.It is an honour to join with the Government, the Liberal Party and the Democrats in this condolence motion for a man who served his country with such devotion and distinction. I extend the National Partys sympathy to his wife and his son.","N/A","CONDOLENCES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
363,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator DURACK","8G4","(Western Australia)","LP","N/A",42,"—I rise with a deep sense of personal sorrow to support this motion of condolence on the recent death of Sir Paul Hasluck. Probably unlike anybody else here, I knew Paul Hasluck personally for a number of years. I first knew him when he stood for the seat of Curtin in 1949, but I really did not get to know him until later when I became an office bearer of a Liberal Party branch in his electorate. Following some years in that role, I became president of the Curtin division.During that period of eight years or so, I worked very closely with Sir Paul Hasluck. I came to have a very high respect and regard for him, as one would naturally experience for a man of such outstanding attainments and qualities. I do not wish to repeat all those qualities; they were very well summarised by earlier speakers on this motion.There has been a misunderstanding about Paul Haslucks nature as a remote figure, probably unsuited to politics. The fact was that, apart from having a very acute social conscience and sense of public duty, Paul Hasluck also got on extraordinarily well with ordinary people. The Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) made that point by referring to a memo from a person who knew him very well. Sir Paul was a very good grassroots politician in the sense of being able to handle seriously the problems of his constituents. He made that a priority. He had a fairly good patch of grass to care for in the Curtin electorate as a Liberal. He always stressed to me that a member of parliament cannot write people too many letters. He was a great believer in letter writing. Obviously, the Government has adopted that view as well, with its generous postage allowance—something which I am sure Sir Paul would have made the best use of.Sir Paul Hasluck listened very closely to people. I worked with him in several election campaigns in the electorate of Curtin. He was a great believer in going out and meeting people on street corners; he favoured that very much. I was able to see another side of him—a different side from the historical model. I rose today to emphasise that particular aspect of him.Sir Paul Hasluck had a tremendous sense of dedication to any job he took on. He was particularly dedicated to the people of Papua New Guinea, for whom he was responsible for 12 of the 18 years that he was a Minister of state of the Commonwealth. In those years he laboured tremendously for the advancement of the people of Papua New Guinea and succeeded very effectively. He made great contact with people, rather than being just an administrator.In regard to Sir Pauls qualifications for political office, despite all the other qualifications he had which have been mentioned—as an author, poet, historian and so on; all qualities which are not usually associated with successful politicians—he was a very successful Minister and politician. It often troubled me that he was not more recognised—certainly not recognised for the leadership of the Liberal Party. When the opportunity came his way after the death of Harold Holt, it seemed to be clear that he was the person to whom the Liberal Party should have turned. I have often speculated what benefits we as a party may have had had that right decision been made early in 1968. We certainly would have been spared some very embarrassing moments, with the untidy demise of John Gorton and the prime ministership of Billy McMahon. Whether he would have won the 1972 election is another matter. At least he would have kept the Liberal Party in much better shape through a very difficult period of our history. However, I do not want to speak today about those particular matters.After he retired from public life, Sir Paul Hasluck remained extraordinarily active. He took up all sorts of small causes. He travelled a good deal; I often used to run into him travelling from west to east, but he did not spend long away from home. He spent a lot of his time at his home and at his small property in the hills behind Perth. Another important side of him was that he was a deep lover of nature; he was also a very keen and active horseman until his later years. It is with great sorrow that I have to speak on his death. I extend my deepest sympathy to his family.","N/A","CONDOLENCES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
364,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator TAMBLING","6E4","(Northern Territory)","NP","N/A",43,"—Sir Paul Hasluck will be remembered by many as the unpolitical politician who nearly became Prime Minister of Australia in 1968. Yet Sir Paul, who disliked the wheeling and dealing of politics, left an even greater legacy to this country as a journalist, historian, university lecturer, diplomat, politician and Governor-General.Born into a Salvation Army family in Perth in 1905, he joined the West Australian newspaper at the age of 17 and later lectured at the University of Western Australia. As has already been mentioned by my Senate colleagues, he entered politics in 1949 as the member for Curtin and, within 15 months of being elected, was appointed Minister for Territories, a portfolio he held for 12 years. This therefore brought him a very close relationship and partnership with the constituency that I represent—that is, the Northern Territory. In 1963, Sir Paul was made Minister for Defence and, a year later, the politician who hated politics was promoted by Sir Robert Menzies to the crucial post of Minister for External Affairs.Yet Sir Paul remained an enigma. A brilliant Minister, he was a private man who believed that merit should bring its own reward and that it was undignified to have to persuade people of the fact. On one occasion, in 1974, the usually reserved Sir Paul announced that Australians were:. . . less distinctively Australian than they had been for 100 years.In comments that could apply to Prime Minister Keatings current republican debate, Sir Paul said that Australians were:. . . crying aloud in the middle of the night with our own disturbing version of Australian roosterdom.Importantly, Sir Paul believed that the Northern Territory could, and eventually would, manage its own affairs. This was demonstrated in the changes he initiated and supported in the structure of the Northern Territory Legislative Council as well as the progressive transfer of responsibilities to the Administrator and his council from the Department of Territories in Canberra.Indeed, Sir Paul made it patently clear to his officers in Canberra that administration as well as policy proposals from the Territory Administrator would be adopted unless there were compelling reasons to the contrary. This led to friction between the Administrator and his officers and the departments secretary and his officers. However, Sir Pauls judgment and wisdom were such that he could effectively balance strong and competing interests.At this time in the 1950s, I was a teenager in the Northern Territory. I can certainly recall Sir Paul being one of my political icons. Naturally, he was well publicised in the Northern Territory. I can certainly recall meeting him on a number of occasions personally and feeling very challenged by both his presence and the activities that he undertook. He had a close relationship with my father in developing Aboriginal education, also in the early 1950s.Mr Harry Giese, a retired senior Commonwealth public servant still living in Darwin, recalls that one of Sir Pauls first tasks in the Northern Territory was to assist the transfer of the Institute of Aboriginal Studies to Darwin from Melbourne. According to Mr Giese, Sir Paul subsidised linguists from the institute to study and record some of the 103 Aboriginal languages spoken in the Territory. It was the first concentrated effort to record Aboriginal languages in Australia.Despite the wide geographic and administrative diversity of the territories portfolio, Sir Paul maintained close contact with department heads in the Northern Territory, regularly joining them on field trips. In 1958, Sir Paul made the first major change in the composition of the Northern Territorys Legislative Council by appointing some non-official members, letting members elect their own president and generally extending the authority of the Administrator. Certainly in his later capacity as Governor-General he took a very keen and continuing interest in the Northern Territory.Sir Paul will also be remembered for his lifetime interest in Aboriginal affairs, an interest that led him to complete a masters degree on Aboriginal policy in 1936 and establish a group designed to promote Aboriginal interests. A report in the Canberra Times earlier this year described Sir Paul as:. . . not an architect of assimilation, though he always defended it, particularly against what he regarded as its opposition—apartheid; he believed in rights for Aborigines, fought against prejudice, and argued that Aboriginal development depended on education, training and access to services.Sir Pauls merits have brought us all, and will continue to bring us, reward. On behalf of Northern Territorians, I convey condolences to the Hasluck family.","N/A","CONDOLENCES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
365,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator KEMP","WW4","(Victoria)","LP","N/A",44,"—I wish to pay tribute to the distinguished career of Sir Paul Hasluck and extend my condolences to the Hasluck family. I cannot recall ever meeting Sir Paul, although as a member of the Liberal students at the University of Melbourne and subsequently an active member of the Liberal Party I, of course, closely followed his career and his contributions to public affairs. The extensive writings of Sir Paul Hasluck make it easy to refresh ones memory about the man, his attitudes and his impact on great events. Indeed, in the last week I have had the opportunity to read some of the articles written by Sir Paul and look at some of the books that he published. In my view, his thoughts are often particularly pertinent in light of the issues which have come before this Parliament.One of the themes which comes through the remarks that others have made today, and which is certainly backed up by my own readings, is that few, if any, men in our political life have had as much of the intellectual in their make-up as Sir Paul. His interests ranged across the theatre, literature and music, and he was also an avid collector of Australiana. In the last year, at the age of 87, he published a series of articles in Quadrant dealing with changes in social mores in Australia over his lifetime. The articles covered the topics of gambling, thrift, conversation and religion and he compared the attitudes and conventions of his childhood and early adulthood with those that he observed in contemporary Australia. The overwhelming impression one gets from reading those articles is that he felt something of the essence of Australian life had been lost and that we were the worse for the losing of it.He clearly had a sense of unease about the changes he perceived. As Sir Walter Crocker said in his own tribute to Sir Paul Hasluck in Quadrant :He was uneasy and apprehensive about certain tendencies in Australian life and culture, such as increases in dishonesty, in violence and in intolerance . . . and the decline in the mass media, not least in the press. The debasement of the English language in Australia in recent years was an alarm bell for him.His uneasiness with what he perceived to be the debasement of Australian life is reflected in his general concern about attitudes to and proposals for changing the Australian Constitution and, more specifically, to the standards observed by parliamentarians. Sir Paul was very strongly of the view that the Constitution as it stands is both strong and adaptable. His view was that, so long as it was treated with respect and good sense, its endurance would ensure continued good government. His thoughts are worthy of careful consideration as, while not a constitutional lawyer, he was well versed in constitutional history and the workings of government. In the 1992 Sir Samuel Griffith lecture, Sir Paul reflected:Our biggest worries in the government of Australia are not whether the text of the Constitution is perfect but whether we have the wisdom—or even enough plain commonsense—to govern our nation wisely.In the same lecture he stated:The Constitution has given a sound basic structure, system of government and the political institutions for handling the changes that have taken place in Australia during the century. It has proved sufficiently adaptable to meet the changing needs of an emerging and evolving nation. Our Constitution is not an outworn obstacle to political wisdom or administrative skill. I can see no strength in arguments that we need a new Constitution or a new system of government even if there are very strong arguments for the need for some adjustments to meet changes.Sir Pauls views on the debate surrounding Australias Constitution and system of government extend into the contentious area of standards to be observed and respected by parliamentarians.In the speech delivered to the Samuel Griffith Society, Sir Paul decried what he referred to as the `weakening, and in some cases total disregard, of the unwritten conventions in our Constitution. He pointed out:. . . respect for the conventions as well as the text of the Constitution is a basic requirement of parliamentary democracy.In earlier days, he recalled:A Minister resigned if he was found to have misled Parliament; in the process of the introduction and passage of all stages of a Bill and transmission from one chamber to another sufficient time was allowed for debate; question time was an opportunity to obtain information and not to have another donnybrook brawl.Senator Kernot drew that issue to our attention today, and I agree with her remarks. Importantly, he highlighted the need for `recognition and respect of the place in a bicameral system of each chamber. In this context he expressed his particular consternation about Mr Keatings derogatory references to the Senate.Sir Paul rejected the so-called `dash for cash mentality, maintaining throughout his public life a strict sense of duty about the spending of public money. As a Minister, he eschewed the perks of political life. A profile of him which appeared in the Canberra Times in 1968 emphasised this facet of the man, stating:He seldom uses VIP aircraft and drives his own ageing Peugeot station wagon to Parliament House instead of using a Commonwealth car.As an ex-Governor-General, entitled to a number of services paid for by the taxpayer, he remained scrupulously frugal.His views on what he felt to be the deterioration in parliamentary standards are perhaps best summed up in the last few lines of a poem he wrote and published recently. The poem was called But Words Unheard are Sweeter . These are the lines that Sir Paul penned:In short, Ive listened to the House, throughout a year,Heard cries of `Rubbish, `Order and `Hear, hearWith rising pressure and hardening party cries.Ive heard a little truth and many lies.But never heard, though listening late and long,`I beg your pardon and `Perhaps I may be wrong.Sir Paul Hasluck was a great Australian and a great Liberal.

366,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BISHOP","SE4","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A",46,"—I join with my colleagues in honouring the memory of—to use Senator Kemps words—`a great Australian and a great Liberal, Sir Paul Hasluck. Sir Paul was an historian who was in a particularly privileged position to appreciate Australias system of government, having served as a senior public servant with the Department of External Affairs, as a member of parliament and as a cabinet Minister. He served with distinction as Australias Governor-General.As Governor-General, he promoted national interest well ahead of any party affiliations. He dedicated himself to serving the system of government in which he so strongly believed. He was constantly at pains to reinforce our system of government and to comment upon the way in which Australians as a people had benefited from that system of governance put in place by our founding fathers.Others have mentioned and quoted from the address that was given by his son on 25 November 1992 to the Samuel Griffith Society. Indeed, my colleague Senator Kemp quoted one part of that address that I think was particularly poignant—the comment about the Constitution giving a sound basic structure. I have another quote from that speech, which was an embodiment of Sir Pauls views. He had this to say:My only purpose has been to support the propositions that Australia has undergone great changes during the century; that Australia today is a nation-state vastly different from the collection of colonies that federated in 1901; that the issues we faced and the policies that we had to shape throughout the century were perpetually changing; and above all else the future will be much more brutally challenging to us than the past. Through all this, it is not the Constitution that has hampered us in the handling of public affairs or prevented governments from working together. The lesson is not that we can only prosper if we write a new text or make major amendments to the old one but rather we need higher political skill and forbearance in using our Constitution.Sir Paul was a man who can be truly called eminent in that he was a person who was exalted in rank and distinguished in character and attainment. He was an Australian who made a contribution which was great and his passing signifies a great loss. I, too, wish to pass condolences to the family and say that this country has been the richer for the contribution that he has made and the wisdom that he has left behind in the things that he has written.","N/A","CONDOLENCES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In particular, Australians will remember Turgut Ozal with special affection for his role in organising the 75th Anzac commemoration at Gallipoli in 1990 and his part in the Turkish Governments decision to rename the landing place of the Anzacs at Gallipoli, Anzac Cove.I personally certainly remember President Ozal very well as a very lively and engaging interlocutor in my conversations with him, both in 1991 on his visit to Australia and more recently during my visit to Turkey in October 1992. His instincts, even on the most delicate and difficult of issues like Cyprus, struck me as essentially constructive and moderate. Turgut Ozal was keenly aware of the importance of consolidating Turkeys regional status as a democratic secular state. I do believe that he will be greatly missed by his compatriots and, indeed, by the international community. I hope that all Australians and members of this chamber will join with me in expressing our profound sorrow and regret at his death.","N/A","CONDOLENCES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
370,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator HILL","BH4","(South Australia-","LP","Leader of the Opposition)",47,"—On behalf of the Opposition, I support the motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) and express our deepest sympathy to the family of the late President Ozal of Turkey. President Ozals death means that Turkey has lost a respected politician whose driving force helped to shape modern Turkey. President Ozal made a substantial contribution to Turkish politics, elected first as Prime Minister in 1983 and then as President in 1989.President Ozals free market economic policies were important in stimulating Turkeys economy. Last year Turkey recorded an impressive 5.5 per cent economic growth rate and expects a similar growth rate this year. In foreign policy, Turkeys key support against Saddam Hussein during the Gulf war, when President Ozal allowed allied forces to operate against Iraq from a Turkish air base, has helped Turkey forge stronger links with the West. Turkey is, of course, still making a valuable contribution to the maintenance of the no-fly zone in northern Iraq.In regional affairs, President Ozal was also committed to developing relations with the new states of central Asia. He provided them with significant assistance in education, transportation, communications, and science and technology, which has assisted them in their early development.In recognition of President Ozals contribution to developing Australian-Turkish relations, he was, as the Minister has just said, awarded in 1990 an honorary Companion of the Order of Australia. It is a developing and important relationship, and we remember his contribution to it. On behalf of the Opposition, I extend to President Ozals family our sincere sympathy in their bereavement.","N/A","CONDOLENCES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

He was a wily political tactician who bridged Turkeys western ways with his countrys Islamic people. President Ozal was strongly committed to improving his countrys relations with our country. He was awarded the honorary Companion of the Order of Australia in 1990 for his services to Australian-Turkish relations.Mr Ozal spoke eloquently and movingly at the Anzac Day commemoration that was held at Gallipoli in 1990. He said:The adversaries proved gallant and determined, earning the respect of each other . . . This is why the lesson of the Gallipoli Campaign will remain unique forever. The friendship that was built among our nations has stood the passage of time.My grandfather fought at Gallipoli, and I was touched by Mr Ozals words and by the courtesy that his Government showed our veterans. President Ozal was a good friend of Australia and he will be missed.Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable senators standing in their places.","N/A","CONDOLENCES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It was a tragedy for Sri Lanka and for its people. Ranasinghe Premadasa was a popular president, a man of humble origins with a genuine concern for the poor and underprivileged. The economic reforms which he promoted with such vigour have done much to open up the Sri Lankan economy and to encourage investment in the development of the country.In his very last speech President Premadasa referred to the unprecedented pace of progress in his country over the last four years and the great transformation taking place there. Under his presidency, the record on human rights in Sri Lanka improved dramatically. When I met him in Colombo in August 1990, he impressed me with his commitment to improving human rights in Sri Lanka. He had worked hard to increase awareness of and respect for human rights, recognising that his government and the armed forces needed to very much improve the application of basic human rights in that country. Even through the serious problems which beset peace in Sri Lanka, he remained tied to reconciliation and peaceful processes.His violent death, coming so soon after the assassination of the Leader of the Opposition, Athulathmudali, last week places very great renewed pressure on peace in Sri Lanka. As President Premadasa said, again in his last speech:We do not believe in violence and hatred. We believe in passion and kindness.It is sad indeed that a man who expressed such peaceful sentiments should die so violently.Apart from his significant domestic achievements, President Premadasa will be remembered for the new friendships he formed within the south Asia region in his capacity as Chairman of the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation in 1992 and his success in significantly improving India-Sri Lanka relations through his close relationship with Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao. These are some of his enduring legacies to the Sri Lankan people.The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has sent a message of condolence to interim President Wijetunge and has asked the distinguished former President of the Senate the Hon. Doug McClelland to represent the Australian Government at the state funeral this week on 6 May.Australians deplore the use of violence as a means of settling political or communal differences. I very much hope that all Australians and every member of this chamber will join me in expressing our profound sorrow and regret at President Premadasas untimely death.","N/A","CONDOLENCES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/debate.sub1[3]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
374,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator HILL","BH4","(South Australia-","LP","Leader of the Opposition)",48,"—On behalf of the Opposition I support the motion moved by Senator Evans and express our deepest sympathy to the family of the late President Premadasa of Sri Lanka. President Premadasas tragic assassination at the age of 68 deprives Sri Lanka of a strong leader committed to the well-being of his nation. The violence of his death is abhorrent and anathema to peace loving peoples worldwide.He did, as Senator Evans said, make a substantial contribution to his country, showing genuine concern for the poor. But, of course, this work was to the background of the ongoing and very severe ethnic conflict.His death reminds us of that conflict which, regrettably, has no solution in sight. In the past 10 years it has been reported that up to 28,000 people have been killed in the conflict which, as I said, shows few signs of diminishing. It is unlikely that military victory by either side will be achieved.The record of human rights violations as taken by the United Nations makes really quite appalling reading. The United Nations working group on forced or involuntary disappearances recorded some 12,000 disappearances in Sri Lanka between 1983 and 1992—the highest number ever recorded for any single country. This report confirmed the findings of Amnesty International which, in turn, reported evidence of gross violations of human rights and large-scale executions and disappearances, particularly in the north east of the country where the fighting is concentrated.It is hoped that President Premadasas death does not signal the start of another spiral of violence. But, coming so quickly, as Senator Evans said, after the death of the Leader of the Opposition, one cannot be too hopeful. There will also be the consequence of further pressure on a country which, in some ways, has been improving economically but is still one of the worlds poorest 20 countries.On this occasion, when we remember President Premadasa and we look at the tragic situation in Sri Lanka, I put to the Senate that we should again look to a role in which the international community might be able to help Sri Lanka and the Sri Lankan people to bring an end to this ongoing agony. This is something that I, personally, have sought, particularly with efforts by the Commonwealth, and I acknowledge that Senator Evans raised these issues with President Premadasa a few years ago.Unfortunately, he, as most proud leaders do, took the view that his country should be able to resolve this problem itself. The Commonwealth, which I thought was the most appropriate body to help Sri Lanka in this instance, took the view that it should not offer its assistance unless its help was requested by the Government of Sri Lanka. Therefore, a stalemate developed, and the international community has not been able to make the contribution that I think it can make and, furthermore, which I think is necessary if Sri Lanka is to be helped through this tragic situation.I hope that on this occasion the Australian Government might resolve to make a further effort to encourage the Commonwealth, the United Nations or other international bodies to at least have the confidence to make representations to the Government of Sri Lanka, offering to be of assistance in an effort to mediate a settlement and perhaps provide constitutional advice or other help that could overcome the communal differences in Sri Lanka, and bring this terrible civil war and the destructive consequences that the Sri Lankan people have been suffering for so long to an end.On this occasion, when we remember with deep regret the assassination of the late President of Sri Lanka as part of this ongoing cycle of violence in his country, I trust that we will take the opportunity to encourage the international community to see whether there are ways in which we can help Sri Lanka and the Sri Lankan people to bring this cycle of violence to an end.On behalf of the Opposition I extend to President Premadasas widow and children our sincere sympathy in their bereavement.","N/A","CONDOLENCES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/debate.sub1[3]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

376,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator LEES","8U4","(South Australia-","AD","Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats)",49,"—I support the condolence motion on behalf of the Australian Democrats and, in doing so, deplore the violent and brutal way in which Sri Lankas President Premadasa was assassinated a week ago. Last week the world witnessed yet another tragic episode in Sri Lankas recent turbulent history. A total of 18 people, including the President and his bodyguards, were senselessly killed when a man set off explosives strapped to his body after barging into the Presidents entourage. All of them were victims of this mindless violence.The assassination represents a personal loss to the Premadasa family, but it also represents a loss, in a very real sense, to the people of Sri Lanka. In many ways, his death is also a great political loss, as the ensuing aftermath challenges the maturity of the democratic processes of Sri Lanka and looks very closely at its political institutions.President Premadasa represented the unique benefits which a strong democracy can bring to any nation, having himself risen from an impoverished family background through the labour movement to the highest political office in his country. Premadasa was President of Sri Lanka for a little over five years and, despite ongoing interracial violence of varying degrees, it must be said that he presided during a period of some considerable economic stability. It is most regrettable, however, that during his presidency a solution to the ongoing racial conflict was not found.The Democrats wish to join with the Government and the Opposition in expressing their deep sympathy to President Premadasas immediate family and express the hope that peace and security may soon return to Sri Lanka.Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable senators standing in their places.","N/A","CONDOLENCES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/debate.sub1[3]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is only fitting that we honour him today through this condolence motion. He joins those few other special Australians who have been similarly honoured in this Parliament.Fred Hollows was born in Dunedin, New Zealand, on 9 April 1929. In his early years he thought he might become a minister of religion or perhaps a psychologist, but never really imagined that he would enter the field of medicine. It was not until he was offered a place at the University of Otago to study medicine, at age 22, that he first thought seriously of such a career.He became interested in eye surgery and by 1961 went off to the UK to complete his Diploma of Ophthalmology. He spent some time working in Wales before coming out to Australia in 1965 to head the Ophthalmology Department at the University of New South Wales. With Freds urging it was not long before there was a separate eye clinic at the Prince of Wales Hospital. By this stage Fred Hollows had adopted Australia as his home and his work with Aboriginal people, for which he was so well known, had begun. First, there was the establishment of the Aboriginal Medical Centre at Redfern and then the national trachoma and eye health program.Fred Hollows developed a tremendous affection for and rapport with the Aboriginal people. He and his team travelled the length and breadth of the country treating Aboriginal people in remote areas, continuing the fight for improvements to their living conditions and access to medical treatment.From early 1987 onwards he extended his program to the Third World. He managed to establish clinics and training programs in Eritrea, Nepal and Vietnam. He acted as a consultant in the extension of his surgical techniques to places such as Bangladesh, Burma, Tibet and various parts of Latin America. Freds plan was not merely to train local doctors in the surgical techniques, but to build the factories to make intra-ocular lenses. He saw this as the only way of making eye surgery and lenses readily available to the poor of these countries.His aspirations are now well on the way to being realised, with lenses factories soon to be in operation in Vietnam, Nepal and Eritrea. He would have been delighted, incidentally, to know that the Eritrean independence referendum was successfully carried through last week and that Australia today has been one of the very first countries to recognise the new nation.The honours and awards bestowed upon him over the years include Australian of the Year, Australian Humanist of the Year, the Australian Human Rights Medal, Companion of the Order of Australia and several honorary degrees.Fred Hollows was a passionate man with deeply held convictions. His politics were to the left of the Labor Party—even the Victorian branch—and he gave politicians of all stripes and colours, including me, a consistently hard time. He had a wholesome hatred of red tape and he avoided bureaucrats wherever possible, preferring instead to deal with those directly involved. When it came to Ministers, however, whatever we did do—whether it was with the aid program or anything else—was never quite enough. Fred always wanted more, but, of course, it was always because he wanted to help more.While to his patients Fred Hollows was unfailingly generous and compassionate, his relations with most others were a little more robust. He was forthright—some would go so far as to say rough as guts—and his methods often quite unorthodox. His professional colleagues were certainly not spared the acid of his tongue; not least at the memorable conference organised by the College of Ophthalmologists in his honour when he told them—and I hope you will forgive the expression in this context, Mr President—`You are only pissing in my pocket because I am dying. Fred in his autobiography summed up the way he got things done:If it helps real, living people then I am not going to worry about professional decorum, good taste or anything else.Again, in Fred Hollows own words:Having a care and concern for others is the highest of the human qualities. It distinguishes us from the other animals and deserves to be paid more attention and to be more exercised.It was his care and concern for his fellow man that drove Fred all of his life, as a result of which many thousands of people are now able to see and many more thousands will be given the chance to see.Fred Hollows was held in very high esteem by his colleagues both here and overseas, he was worshipped by his patients, and he was loved very much by his family and friends. His death is a deeply sad loss for us all, but I am sure that the excellent work that he began will be continued in the same spirit and with the same dedication through the Hollows Foundation. On behalf of the Government I extend to his wife Gabi and all the children our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement.","N/A","CONDOLENCES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/debate.sub1[4]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
379,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator HILL","BH4","(South Australia-","LP","Leader of the Opposition)",51,"—On behalf of Opposition senators, I join with the Leader of the Government (Senator Gareth Evans) in expressing our regret at the death, on 10 February, of Professor Fred Hollows at the age of 63. He was an extraordinary Australian. In 1990 he was named Australian of the Year and he was awarded the Australian Human Rights Medal; and in the following year he was named Australian Humanist of the Year and he was awarded the Companion of the Order of Australia. In January 1993 he won the Rotary International Award for Human Understanding for his work in establishing eye surgery programs among Australian Aborigines and in Third World countries.Professor Hollows arrived in Sydney in 1965 as an Associate Professor of Ophthalmology at the University of New South Wales and almost immediately attracted prominence. After visiting the Gurindji people of Wattie Creek, he was appalled by the extent of eye disease that he encountered and he observed that of a camp population of 150, all the children had trachoma. Soon after, he helped a group of young Aborigines to establish their own medical service in Redfern, the first of its type in Australia and the prototype of many more around the country.In 1975 the Royal Australian College of Ophthalmologists launched the national trachoma and eye health program and Professor Hollows took to the outback as head of a mobile medical team. In two years, 105,000 people in 465 locations were examined, 15,000 Aborigines took part in treatment programs and about 1,500 operations were performed. Under his guidance, the program achieved extraordinary success, halving the incidence of curable blindness among Aborigines.It was after meeting an Eritrean with an eye condition in his Sydney office that Fred Hollows organised an AIDAB grant for training an Eritrean eye doctor in Sydney. He himself later travelled to the country and conceived the possibility of establishing an artificial lens factory there. In Eritrea and other Third World countries, Fred Hollows introduced preventative medicine and surgical techniques which returned sight to so many people. Building intra-ocular lens factories to combat Third World blindness became the sustaining passion of Professor Hollows in his later years.Mr President, it was regrettable that Professor Hollows was unable to witness the recent successful Eritrean referendum for independence that you and I had the privilege of witnessing, which brought to an end 30 years of civil war and destruction. This will allow the intra-ocular factory—which is now being transported by sea from Australia to Eritrea—soon to start manufacturing in Aymara.What we found extraordinary in Eritrea was the recognition there of Professor Hollows and the incredible benefit that this brought to Australia in terms of attaching credit to our country derived from his work and his reputation in that country. This, to me, was a real reminder of the effect that one individual can have upon the reputation of a country. It was quite an extraordinary experience to go out into villages of Eritrea, which one may have thought very few, if any, Australians had ever visited. When we identified ourselves as Australian, the first comment we heard was about the wonderful work of Fred Hollows. Credit for the good work Fred Hollows had done in so many villages was being accorded to Australia. I found it quite humbling to be part of that experience. It is a great credit to Fred Hollows and to his memory.I know that not only in Eritrea but also in Nepal and in Vietnam Fred Hollows work in the establishment of intra-ocular factories will be an ongoing legacy. On behalf of coalition senators, I am pleased to extend our most sincere condolences to Professor Hollows wife, Gabi, and his family.","N/A","CONDOLENCES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/debate.sub1[4]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
380,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator SCHACHT","4J4","(South Australia-","ALP","Minister for Science and Small Business and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Science)",52,"—I rise to speak to this condolence motion for Fred Hollows. Since 1988 I have had the opportunity to meet Fred on a number of occasions. My first involvement with Fred Hollows was an indirect one when I visited Eritrea as a guest of the ELF in October 1988.I remember travelling down through Sudan and finally reaching a place called Rota where there was an underground hospital which was equipped with quite sophisticated medical equipment. We talked to a number of staff there who in the previous months had been trained by Fred Hollows himself on his first visit to Eritrea. The most moving occasion of all was when we met a former patient of Fred Hollows who said that because of Freds work she had had her sight restored after many years of blindness. I suddenly realised then that this man Hollows was someone exceptional.I agree with Senator Hills remarks that everywhere one went in Eritrea, Freds fame and service to that country had spread—so much so that the credit Fred Hollows had established in that country rubbed off on us as Australian visitors. I met Fred when I returned to Australia and, in common with Senator Evans, was overwhelmed by his style, language and presentation. This meant that one was either 110 per cent with Fred or one had better watch out.I remember one occasion when he came down to visit Parliament House to get the funds for the intra-ocular lens factory in Eritrea. He wandered into my office and shouted out, `Come on, Schacht, lets go round and get hold of Blewett. I need $200,000 for this factory. I said, `Well, have you got an appointment?. He replied, `I dont need a bloody appointment—we will just go to see him and well get it off him.Before I knew what I was doing, I was leading him around to Dr Blewetts office. We walked in and Neal had quickly got a bureaucrat to come over from AIDAB who was sitting there rather nervously, because he had already heard about Freds reputation. Fred started the conversation by saying, `Look, Doc, I understand Schacht has got a few numbers for your preselection back in South Australia. Unless you get this money for us, you might be in trouble getting re-elected. It was the most amazing start to any representation I have ever seen and away Fred went from there.The conversation lasted about four minutes. Freds bulldozer effect was very effective because Dr Blewett said, `I am sure we can make arrangements and the bureaucrat got the message. Then Fred said, `By the way, it is not $200,000 Australian; it is $200,000 American. So the value had suddenly doubled. Since then the equipment has been prepared and it is on the way. I understand that the Eritreans will name the intra-ocular lens factory after Fred Hollows; it will be called the Fred Hollows Factory. In Eritrea there will always be a very effective reminder of the contribution made by Fred Hollows.On a number of occasions since then, I have had opportunities to meet Fred at functions. I was given the great honour at an AIDAB conference to introduce Fred as the guest speaker. The first 10 minutes of Freds speech related to his version of Marxism and the evils of the capitalist system, which startled most of the audience. He then proffered a few views on how AIDS could be controlled in Australia, and that upset the rest of the audience.Most of the people at the conference had come along to meet this fantastic character, Fred. By the end of his speech they were rather confused about the range of issues that Fred got himself involved in and how he expressed his views. But when they met him afterwards privately in conversation, despite, as Senator Evans said, his `rough as guts attitude, they saw some great charm about Fred such that, in the end, one could not help but be on his side. I have never yet come across a person who had some meeting or some period of time with Fred who was not, in the end, an absolute devotee of his cause.There is great sadness with Freds passing. The cause of his death, cancer, caused a slow deterioration in Fred. But throughout it all, even when he was greatly affected, he was still working flat out for the causes, still performing his work as a doctor, still making phone calls, still getting people to make the commitment to raise the money for the causes in which he so strongly believed. The state funeral that was conducted at the cathedral in Sydney was one of the most moving occasions at which I have been present in my period in public life in Australia. So many people from all walks of life attended and the orations from various people about Freds career were very moving, from that given by the Catholic Bishop of Sydney to that given by the well-known communist Frank Hardy. They all made it clear that, obviously, Fred was a remarkable person.I will certainly miss conversations with Fred—or arguments, I should say, because conservations with Fred usually were arguments. All I want to say in conclusion is that not only was Fred Hollows a great Australian—in my period in public life, I cannot think of a greater Australian I have met—but also he was a great human being worldwide. By any measure, Australia has been very fortunate to have had Fred Hollows as an Australian citizen. He brought great credit to our country right around the world. It is only appropriate that he is one of the few private citizens who has had the honour of a condolence motion in the Australian Parliament.","N/A","CONDOLENCES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/debate.sub1[4]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
381,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BROWNHILL","RD4","(New South Wales-","NP","Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia)",53,"—I rise to pay tribute to Professor Fred Hollows who died on 10 February 1993. He was the 1990 Australian of the Year and was made a Companion of the Order of Australia. He also won the Rotary International award for human understanding and many other awards. But awards really do not do full justice to such a great humanitarian.Fred Hollows had very little respect for bureaucracy, as Senator Evans has already said. He was an intellectual who saw the need to abandon the academic world for the real world of the disadvantaged. He was probably best known for his work with Aboriginal eye disease, working on a national trachoma program under which 100,000 Aborigines were treated in the first two years.He established eye clinics in Australia, Bangladesh, Burma, Latin America, Vietnam, Africa, Nepal and in other countries which Senator Evans has already mentioned. He was heavily involved in building intra-ocular lens factories to combat Third World blindness. He projected his image around the world. That has already been alluded to by others who have spoken on this condolence motion.As described by Bishop John Heaps during the funeral service, `Fred Hollows did not treat eyes. He cared for human beings. He was different from other medical missionaries. He was able to inspire those around him, to instil in them the same sense of dynamic enthusiasm he had for the work he was doing. He was an exceptional man; simple, gruff, possibly some would consider rough—and I think that has been exemplified by what Senator Schacht said of his knowledge of Professor Hollows. These attributes endeared him to so many, and enabled him to relate to those with whom he worked. I met him only once, but the impact of that meeting was immense. He had compassion reaching far beyond that of most of us. He had, with his whole being, no more important a goal in life than to help, no matter what the personal sacrifice. I understand his energy was limitless and we would do well ourselves to think about how Fred Hollows channelled his energies. His selflessness was remarkable. He was a man who gave back to life far more than he took from it.After being diagnosed as having cancer in 1989, Fred Hollows continued tirelessly with his work, although he was forced to slow down due to radiotherapy. This alone reflects the selflessness and altruism of the man. He showed much courage in making the conscious decision to not let his illness interfere with his work. It is unfortunate that it was acknowledgment of the traumas in his life that instigated recognition of the outstanding work he was doing. I also mention—as Senator Schacht has mentioned—the point that Professor Hollows made about the AIDS debate. I commend him for entering that debate and saying, as an eminent professor, what should be done.I extend to his wife, Gabi Hollows, and family—through whom, together with the Hollows Foundation his outstanding work will be continued—our sympathy. Gabi Hollows has the same sense of dedication and drive for not only helping but also teaching the underprivileged people. She should be commended and acknowledged for her past and continuing role with the Hollows Foundation. The National Party joins with the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Hill) and the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Evans) in supporting the condolence motion on the passing of Professor Fred Hollows, a great Australian.","N/A","CONDOLENCES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/debate.sub1[4]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Fred Hollows was a truly great Australian. He was a great Australian eye surgeon, a great Australian humanitarian and a great Australian character, as has been said by everyone today. Millions of Australians, especially our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community, millions of Africans and millions of South-East Asians will all remember Fred with gratefulness and much affection, and so do I. He used his illness to support his work, and that was a very brave thing to do.I first met Fred when I was seated next to him at a quiz night. He came dressed in very casual clothes and his wife, Gabi, was dressed in beautiful and stunning clothes. They looked completely different from each other and I think that was pretty indicative of the way they both were. I would like to give our love to Gabi and to the family. This is a terribly sad loss for them—the loss of a father and of a husband—but they are carrying on, as far as I can see, very bravely and very well.The last time I saw Fred he said, `Dont abandon the Eritreans and dont let those Ministers sweet-talk you into abandoning the East Timorese. I can promise him—and I am sure he is still listening from somewhere—that I will not.","N/A","CONDOLENCES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/debate.sub1[4]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Late last year I hosted a dinner for him in my suite in Parliament House. It was attended by people from both sides of the Parliament. We talked about the work of the Hollows Foundation and how we might keep it going. It was quite obvious that Freds health was in decline at that stage, but I have to say he was in good form that night. As Senator Hill said, recently he and I were in Eritrea, and Fred Hollows is a legend in that country. I am glad to say that the intra-ocular lens factory will continue his work. It will be operating in Eritrea later this year and it will be named after him.I extend my sympathy to Gabi and the children. I will relate to them an incident that occurred in Eritrea. When an electoral official found out that I came from Australia, he said that Fred Hollows would have loved to have been here today but his spirit will always live in Eritrea.I ask honourable senators to stand in silence to signify their assent to the motion.Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable senators standing in their places.","N/A","CONDOLENCES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/debate.sub1[4]/speech[5]/interject/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

643,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Senator Cook","RF4","QLD","ALP","N/A",69,"—The answer to the honourable senators question, based on information supplied by the Federal Airports Corporation, is as follows:(1) In accordance with Commonwealth Government Policy, the Corporation makes payments in lieu of rates to local authorities in respect of staff houses, property leased to tenants other than the Commonwealth and terminal buildings.The Corporation has a policy of fully recovering from its tenants the amounts paid to local authorities in lieu of rates. This recovery is either through direct billings of tenants, included in gross rents for concessionaires, or on a net rent and outgoings basis for all other areas of multi-tenanted buildings. As a result the amounts listed below represent only the amount recovered by direct billing to tenants.At Canberra, Townsville, Coolangatta, Archerfield, Hobart, Launceston and Cambridge Airports, the local authority charges include water/sewerage/ garbage charges as well as land rates. Consequently, the difference in the amount billed to FAC and the amount invoiced to tenants reflects an FAC usage component for these services.At airports where car parks are run on a management contract, such as Sydney, the rates are recovered from the operating revenue of the car park in question.At Alice Springs and Tennant Creek, no local authority rates are charged even on land leased to other parties on which a commercial return is received. The Corporation does, however, make payments in lieu of rates for remote area residences provided to FAC employees at these airports.Payments in relation to Camden Airport are currently under review by the local authority.The following local authorities receive payments for rates or money in lieu of rates from the Corporation:Botany Municipal CouncilMunicipality of RockdaleMunicipality of MarrickvilleBankstown City CouncilLiverpool City CouncilCity of MoorabbinCity of EssendonCity of KeilorBrisbane City CouncilGold Coast City CouncilCity of West TorrensSalisbury City CouncilCity of BelmontShire of SwanCockburn City CouncilCity of ClarenceMunicipality of EvandaleDarwin City CouncilTownsville City CouncilMt Isa City CouncilAlice Springs Town CouncilTennant Creek Town Council(2) & (3)(a)(i)-(ii) and (b)(i)-(ii)Amount billed Amount billed toAirport to the FAC tennants($) ($)Sydney (KSA)1991 1,363,134 1,036,5061992 1,993,555 1,007,860Bankstown1991 189,287 189,2871992 197,103 197,103Hoxton Park1991 2,167 2,1671992 1,917 1,917Melbourne1991 1,740,108 1,250,3061992 1,579,797 1,310,054Moorabbin1991 106,205 106,2051992 111,794 111,794Essendon1991 106,274 106,2741992(1) 6,289 6,289Brisbane1991(2) 1,722,122 1,722,1221992 865,626 865,626Coolangatta1991 91,442 87,5491992 114,031 107,976Archerfield1991 93,062 87,5871992 99,838 93,766Adelaide1991 126,113 126,1131992 183,810 183,810Parafield1991 20,301 20,3011992 30,937 30,937Perth1991 402,751 402,7511992 493,440 493,440Jandakot1991 40,341 40,3411992 46,455 46,455Hobart(includes Cambridge)1991 60,500 1,5001992 66,000 1,800Launceston1991 15,000 1,0001992 15,500 1,200Canberra1991 44,608 25,7421992 48,368 29,540Townsville1991 164,522 53,3331992 193,033 104,834Mt Isa1991 32,768 16,9751992 36,443 14,127Darwin1991 34,985 34,9851992 16,677 16,023Alice Springs (3)1991 1,220 Nil1992 1,282 NilTennant Creek (3)1991 698 Nil1992 699 NilNotes:(1) Full accounts not yet received.(2) Includes back charges from 1 January 1988.(3) These charges relate to employee occupied residences.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[16]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Deed was not included with this documentation as it did not relate to the sequence of events leading the Authority to make the original decision to issue a permit (rather, it was a consequence of that decision).The Deed was included in the material prepared for the second hearing of the AAT appeal in March 1990 on the basis that it, and other documents, helped show the progress of events during the period between April 1989 and March 1990 hearings; the material in the second list was not tabled as Island Voice withdrew the appeal (on 5 March 1990) prior to the hearing commencing (set for 19 March 1990).(2) The Authority does not claim that the breakwalls cannot be removed. It was and is still the Authoritys view that once the walls were completed, removal would cause greater environmental impact than leaving them in place. This was stated in the notice printed in the Gazette (No. S390) dated 15 December 1988 giving the reasons for the Authoritys decision to grant a permit for the development.Dr Kinseys affidavit of 21 August 1989 contains reference to the possibility of the removal of only the thin sheet piling used in the construction of the walls—not the completed breakwalls themselves.On 25 August 1989 (not 29 August 1989) Judge Bulley lifted a temporary Stay of Works that he had imposed on the project on 16 August 1989. The Authority undertook to inform the AAT when work at the site would cause irreversible changes to the Marine Park and did so in February 1990.(3) It is not true to say that removal of the breakwalls was never a requirement. The intent of the provisions in the Deed was to ensure that the capacity existed to remove partially completed walls if necessary—for instance if they were unstable and unsafe.(4) Not applicable (see (3) above).(5) and (6) In the notice published in the Gazette (No.S390) dated 15 December 1988 giving the reasons for the Authoritys decision to grant a permit for the development, it was stated that it was the Authoritys view that the removal of the breakwalls would not be considered feasible (ie. would be impracticable) once the walls were completed because it would involve risk of unacceptable environmental damage to the Marine Park.The October 1988 assessment report on the Magnetic Quays development stated that the walls should be considered permanent facilities. Subsequent discussions between the Authority and the Australian Construction Services on whether physically removing all traces of the completed breakwalls was possible, concluded that such large-scale works would inevitably lead to significant silt production in the rest of Nelly Bay and the release of sulphides and rust into the Marine Park from the remnants of the sheet piling at the centre of the walls.The Authority has had extensive experience with the environmental assessment of other large scale developments in the Marine Park eg. Hamilton Island runway.(7) No.(8) No. Attempting to rehabilitate or restore the Magnetic Quays site would damage the Marine Park.(9) The Authority received expert advice on the application of the insurance policy from Sedgwick James Ltd, Australias largest insurance brokers on the same day that the policy was queried by Mr Woodley. This advice was accepted by the Authority as indicating that the insurance would answer the matters raised in Mr Woodleys query.The GBRMPA was not threatened by any party during this time or at any other time.(10) I am not satisfied that there was at any stage a decision to approve the project without adequate insurance.(11) The GBRMPA received legal advice from the Australian Government Solicitor (AGS) on application of a Stay Order on 7 and 8 August 1989. The AGS advised that it would be a legitimate stance for the Authority not to apply for a Stay Order.On the basis of this advice, the Authority Chairman, with the support of other Authority members, decided not to apply for a Stay Order at that time, because no works which might cause irreversible damage to the Marine Park were imminent.(12) The GBRMPA Chairman did not convince the developer to press ahead after the Authority had decided against the proposed development. The developer had been working to meet the Authoritys requirements for several years, and the remaining problems identified by the Authority at its meeting of 24 October 1988, were of a technical nature for which the Authority believed the developer would be able to find satisfactory solutions. The Authoritys view was conveyed to the developer by the Chairman as part of his proper duties.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[18]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

649,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Senator Button","4F4","QLD","ALP","N/A",73,"—The Minister for Science and Technology has provided the following answer to the honourable senators question:(1) One only CSIRO staff member, a technician, appeared on the program. His statements did not indicate he was against the mining proposal. The statements made related to the likely consequences of such mining.(2)(a) The comments were based on official CSIRO reviews of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) prepared for the sand mining proposal within the Shoalwater Bay Training Area. These reviews became public domain when sent by the Army to the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories as part of their formal response to the EIS.(b) He was appearing during normal hours of duty. The two reasons for his appearance on the program were that he has extensive knowledge of the environment of the Shoalwater Bay Training Area as a result of 17 years involvement in studies concerned with the management of the Training Area; and because the Training Area is a restricted place, it was necessary to have the film party accompanied by someone who was aware of the procedures to be followed and the obligations to safety.(3) The technician was authorised by his superior, Dr Brian Tunstall, to assist the production by way of providing technical detail and facilitating access.(4) The views expressed by the CSIRO officer in the program reflect CSIROs general responsibility to provide authoritative and independent advice to Government, industry and community groups. In this instance, CSIRO prepared detailed comments on the EIS on sandmining in Shoalwater Bay Training Area at the request of the Army and publicly declared its findings.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[19]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

However, in mid 1990 the Bureau of Mineral Resources, Geology and Geophysics (BMR) was requested to prepare a financial evaluation report on the leases now held by Pivot Mining Pty Ltd, which cover only a small portion of the Shoalwater Bay area. This evaluation concluded that there is a `98 per cent probability that the project would show a zero or less rate of return. The analysis was based only on data set out in the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) submitted by Pivot and estimates made by the BMR. Its conclusions take no account of the potential for discovery of further heavy mineral deposits, either within the area of the leases or elsewhere in the Shoalwater Bay area.(2) A copy of the BMR evaluation is available from the Senate Table Office.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[20]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

653,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Senator Robert Ray","UI4","QLD","ALP","N/A",74,"—The answer to the honourable senators question is as follows:(1) (a) The stated purpose of the application by the film crew was to highlight the impact of planned or proposed sand mining in the Shoalwater Bay Training Area (SWBTA) and Byfield areas.(b) The application was approved by Major Hassall, former Officer Commanding District Support Unit Rockhampton, through Headquarters First Military District Operations.(c) Conditions of entry were:(i) The crew were given access only under escort; and(ii) SWBTA Standing Orders were strictly adhered to.(2) No transport was made available to the film crew but the military escort was provided with a service/departmental vehicle. It is part of normal operational procedure to provide a military escort, for civilians on SWBTA, and no reimbursement of costs was sought.(3) Training that has taken place over the last two years include: 34 regiment/battalion size exercises, 64 company strength or less exercises and approximately 100 visits by small parties for reconnaissance purposes.With regard to environmental management the following occurs each time any military users have access to the SWBTA. Standing Orders on issue to all user units are read and the information contained therein is disseminated to all rank levels. Unit representatives are briefed in detail, prior to entry, by the Range Control Officer (RCO). The three `on site permanent caretakers continually patrol all areas to ensure strict compliance with all orders as above mentioned and the environmental policy as detailed in the brief. A detailed inspection of all areas used by the units is conducted by the RCO before units are cleared. Repairs are carried out if necessary.(4) Yes. Environmental management is a major function of the Officer Commanding (OC) the SWBTA. All incoming OCs are briefed on their environmental management responsibilities and are provided with briefing and land management information to assist in this function during their tenure with the unit.It is a basic principle of Defence land management that the property is used and managed in such a way as to maintain it at, or as close as possible to, its natural condition.(5) SWBTA is in an area where the Subtropical Zone merges with the Tropical Zone and the Desert Zone. This creates a rich mixture of flora and fauna communities.For example the fauna survey, undertaken by CSIRO, revealed the presence of a distinctive specimen of the Yellow-bellied Sheathtail Bat in the SWBTA. It may prove to represent a new species. If this is so, it is rare and possibly locally endemic.(6) Impact Zones for exercises are selected so that no fragile habitat is used. Mt Hummock is the present impact zone for artillery bombardment. This area does not contain any fragile environments.Exercises are limited to periods of the year when the habitat is least vulnerable, such as, between January to August when the fire risk and fauna breeding activity is low.Ground exercises are kept hygienically clean and crews repair all clearings and excavations as required.(7) (a) Feral animals: The Shoalwater Bay Training Area Fauna Survey prepared by CSIRO and published in December 1992, indicates that there are nine species of feral animals in SWBTA; Cane Toad, House Mouse, European Rabbit, Red Fox, Cat, Horse, Pig, Cattle and Feral Goats. The number of Cane Toads has not been established. House Mice are limited to disturbed ground around man-made structures. The European Rabbit, Cat and the Red Fox are uncommon within the SWBTA. Pigs are widespread despite a regular culling program. Townshend Island contains an estimated population of 3,000 feral goats. The study did not investigate full populations of feral animals.(b) Cattle: Cattle are abundant and widespread in herds of up to 50 animals. The cattle are remnants of previous use of the SWBTA. No precise population numbers are available for cattle within SWBTA.(c) Brumbies or wild horses: Horses are abundant and widespread with herds numbering up to 30 animals. No precise population details are available for horses within SWBTA.(8) The view shown in the documentary a view of the headland, was not part of the Gunnery Range but the Freshwater Sector Headland.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[21]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
