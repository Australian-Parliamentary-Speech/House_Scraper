Coincidentally with that, as the House will be aware, there was a demonstration of pensioners outside Parliament House. The photographer was not. specifically assigned to photograph the pensioners at all. He was assigned to photograph an organised march by the unionists who were campaigning against rising costs. The practice followed in the Australian Capital Territory in this regard is the practice followed by all State police forces. It comes out of court cases where defence counsel on previous occasions have used photographs and films to assist their cause. The police have found themselves in the position of having unofficial photographs being used to support the case of the defendants, and they therefore adopted the practice in their own defence of taking photographs themselves. I do not believe that reasonable people would object to the practice because the police have the responsibility to maintain law and order. They have the responsibility to care for people and their property.I might say that police in the Australian Capital Territory carry out this duty with a great deal of credit to themselves and to the force generally. I do not believe that people would object to the use of photographers. There is the old saying that the camera does not lie. There is no reason at all why people would object to seeing photographs of a demonstration if a court case ensues following a march.","PENSIONER DEMONSTRATION","QUESTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In fact, over recent months the Commonwealth has been paying out many millions of dollars towards financing measures being taken by the Queensland Government to alleviate drought in that State. There is a provision of $11. 5m in the Budget which is the present estimate of the likely cost of further drought relief measures in Queensland for this financial year. We are all hoping, of course, that we will get a break in the drought which alone can really alleviate the situation. The policy of the Government in this matter is well known, that is, that preference will be given both in the allocation of funds and the interest rates to be charged to primary producers in rural areas and other exporters. This is well known, and also recently the Reserve Bank has once again been asking banks to give particular consideration and priority to those stricken by drought and to others who are afflicted by adverse seasonal conditions.

We arc going to put on some kind of demonstration. Come and photograph that so that we will get more publicity.

The aircraft are now again flying with the United States Air Force but to flight limitations, which is not abnormal for an aircraft at this stage of its development. 3ut the aircraft still does not meet the technical and operational assurances that will be required by the Royal Australian Air Force and which the United States Department of Defence has indicated would be necessary. The new wing carry through box has not been designed. The proof testing for the wing pivot fittings has been undertaken, t understand, quite satisfactorily, but the non-destructive inspection which is also necessary before one can be quite certain has not yet been developed to enable it to be properly applied to the same faults. The static and fatigue testing has not yet been completed and 1 am advised that it will not be completed until some time next year. In these circumstances there can be no question of (he Australian Government making any decision no matter what any spokesman for General Dynamics might say. I can only suggest that General Dynamics would be better employed in rectifying the aircraft and bringing them fully up to standard and not trying to develop some public pressure in the way that I believe it has. It will be the aircrafts performance and the manner of its performance that will ultimately determine the Australian Governments decision. I do not see a decision being made in relation to that before the end of next year in view of the timing of the various test programmes tha: will be necessary.

28,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"GORTON, John","KH5","N/A","LP","N/A",373,"- I think that perhaps the first part of the question was based on a misconception because it stated that troops were again being reinforced in the Gazelle Peninsula. To the best of my knowledge no troops have ever been sent to the Gazelle Peninsula. It might have happened a long time ago, but certainly in recent days no troops have been sent there. Possibly the honourable member might have meant police - I do not know. The second part of the question related to the multiracial Council. I think the House would know that both before I went to New Guinea and while I was in New Guinea I made a plea for peaceful discussion between the Mataungans and the Tolai, or at least as many as believed in the multiracial Council. I suggested that a referendum should be held on this matter, if that was the best way of discovering what the will of the people was, and said that the Government would certainly be bound by the results of that referendum. The Mataungan Association refused to have any talks whatsoever and also refused to take any part in a referendum.Previous to that I had already done what the honourable member suggests I might do, in the sense of asking whether I would receive the Mataungan leaders as I received Mr Paul Lapun and helped in Bougainville, in that I had spoken to a Mr Kaputin who had come down here and had suggested to him that the best way to deal with this situation would be to ascertain the will of the people there. He indicated to me that he refused to have any thought of that at all. If he did have any thought abou! H il would have to he an 0Den referendum so that everybody would know how everybody else voted, which is not really the way of ascertaining it. He was completely intransigent about it as he has been ever since. But I have some hopes that other leaders of the Mataungan Association are now willing perhaps to enter into some talks up there and I would hope that if that were to take place a proper resolution of this whole matter could be reached without the dramatics which some of the Mataungan leaders have previously sought to introduce into the matter.","PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA","QUESTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I believe, as I have always believed and as I believe history is proving to be true, that in fact what has been called the domino theory is in operation and would be in operation should Cambodia be overrun. It has been one of the bases of our policy in that area, a basis which has been derided by the Opposition but which I think is now shown to be true. I believe that there is no question - perhaps there is in some peoples minds, but there can scarcely be a question in any sensible persons mind who has studied the facts - that the invasion of Cambodia took place long before the United States troops and South Vietnamese troops entered that country and that they entered that country in order to repel the troops from North Vietnam who were already on the soil of that country illegally.On the other question which the honourable member has raised I would say that in a sense there is a united front now in that area in that Cambodians, South Vietnamese and, as I understand - although I am not sure - some Thai troops are there; certainly Thailand would be one of the countries threatened by these developments.

I am merely stating the factual situation - that members of the Australian Labor Party in the last sitting of this Parliament opposed the Dartmouth proposal which had been agreed to by the previous government of South Australia, the Commonwealth Government and the Governments of New South Wales and Victoria. They supported what had been put up by the present Premier of South Australia, namely that construction of Dartmouth and Chowilla should be undertaken together. That was the proposal at the time. There was a further query regarding the works which would be undertaken on Lake Victoria. Those particular points were answered in this House at that time. It is essential that a decision be made very soon to undertake this work on the Dartmouth proposal. The River Murray Commission is at present making a study of the salinity report which has just been obtained. This is part of the overall programme of development. If in the near future agreement is not reached and ratified by the Parliament of South Australia to undertake the Dartmouth proposal, as agreed to by the other parliaments, the State to suffer most will be South Australia. I can only suggest that as soon as possible the Government and Parliament of South Australia should ratify the agreement which was reached with the previous government.

55,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"WHITLAM, Gough","6U4","Werriwa","N/A","Leader of the Opposition",377,"- The arrangements under which the Commonwealth at present makes grants to building societies and State housing authorities will end next June. The Commonwealth first made advances to the States for housing under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreements Act 1945, which ran for 10 years. The arrangements were extended for a 5-year period by the 1956 Housing Agreement Act, which was passed on 21st June, the day the House went into recess, for a second 5-year period by the 1961 act, which was passed on 16th May, the day before the House went into recess, and for a third 5-year period by the 1966 Act, which was passed on 13th May, which was again the day the House went into recess. One can expect, therefore, that the Gorton Government will follow the practice of the Menzies and Holt governments in letting the House debate the framework of State housing grants for the next 5 financial years on the very last day or the last day but one of our sittings in this financial year.The original 1945 Agreement was intended both to enable ordinary Australians to secure housing at a cost they could afford to pay and ensure that housing was provided in a properly planned and serviced urban environment. The three extensions of the Agreement dropped all provisions for planning and servicing the environment. It is appropriate, therefore, that we should inform ourselves on the extent to which these goals have been realised, on current housing needs to be met within the context of a new housing agreement and upon the resources which are available for that purpose.In July 1968 and again in March 1969 the State Housing Ministers - at that time all members of the Liberal and Country parties - unanimously but unsuccessfully requested the Commonwealth to make grants under the Aged Persons Homes Act and the Homes Savings Grant Act in respect of houses constructed by State housing authorities, to relieve those authorities of their obligation to set aside a quota of houses for serving members of the forces, to grant the States Sim for the provision of plans for urban renewal and to make other grants for approved development and research housing projects by State and Commonwealth authorities.A committee from both sides of both Houses of this Parliament should not only examine how the next quinquennial legislation should incorporate these modest State requests. It should also formulate a 5-year plan to counter the dearth of housing caused by this years credit squeeze, the record interest rates reached in the last months, the mounting cost of land caused by Commonwealth and State failure to participate in land development and the poverty of urban facilities and amenities caused by the Commonwealth and State starvation of local government.Australia required in 1969 additional dwellings for at least 108,000 families newly formed by marriage and at least 25,000 families newly arrived from overseas. We required additional dwellings for 9,000 families who had previously shared accommodation and for 17,000 families who felt sufficiently affluent to want a second home. We required replacements for 18,000 dwellings lost by mishap or demolition. In all, therefore, our total national housing requirement was 177,000 dwellings and of these 34,000 were found from existing housing stock. Since we constructed in the course of the year only about 135,000 dwellings there was a shortfall in housing supply of at least 8,000 dwellings. In 1970 we will require at least 147,000 new dwellings but instead of stepping up our rate of construction we have actually allowed it to fall quite drastically. The number of new dwellings approved fell between 1969 and 1970 in May from 14,732 to 11,307, a drop of 23%, and in June from 13,123 to 11,954, a drop of 9%. The Minister for Housing (Senator Dame Annabelle Rankin) foresaw in her address to the Housing Industry Association that it would be in the September quarter that chill winds would really begin to blow. In all, the number of approvals for dwellings granted in the first half of 1970 has fallen short by 1,730 of the number granted in the first half of the previous year. Even if the Minister is confounded and matters get no worse, the deficit for the year will be at least 16,000 dwellings. The housing industry estimates that it must expand its capacity each year by 5% in order to keep abreast of demand, but present government policies are actually driving builders out of the industry. By 1972 our annual requirement for new housing will have risen to 156,000 dwellings and by 1977 to 183,000 dwellings. We should bc gearing ourselves to build within the next 30 years as many new dwellings as we have built in our whole past history but the present Government is systematically and cynically undermining our capacity to do so.This destructive and irresponsible process is being undertaken in the name of squeezing the building industry to reduce overheating in the economy as a whole. Tt is being undertaken on the initiative and under the direction of a Treasurer who once asserted, as Minister for Housing, that to damp down housing because of undue expansion in other sectors of the economy may distort our ultimate priorities for survival. What should we make of a policy which so gravely handicaps the vital housing component of the building industry while permitting the other component - factories, shops, office blocks, etc. - to leap in value in June by 26%? What should we make of a Treasurer who so blatantly contradicts his stated social priorities by resorting to measures which on 4 previous occasions - in 1951, 1956, 1961 and 1966 - cost Australia at least 110,000 houses?Looking broadly at the income pattern of the community in relation to the main arising sources of demand for new housing, it would appear currently that many newly marrieds and migrants may never be in a position to buy a home.","Discussion of Matter of Public Importance","HOUSING, LAND DEVELOPMENT AND URBAN ENVIRONMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
56,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FORBES, Alexander","KFH","Barker","LP","Minister for Health",381,"- The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) has adopted his usual practice of using this House as a public relations platform, with scant regard for the House itself. He has come in here today with a prepared statement which 1 have not seen. I have no doubt that the Press has a copy of it. So that he could get through it in the time allotted to him the Leader of the Opposition gabbled it out in such a way that it would be quite impossible for honourable members to take in any detail what he was trying to say. I just want to place that on record, lt seems to me to be an abuse of the ethos of this chamber.I want to make 2 comments on what the Leader of the Opposition had to say. Because he read his prepared statement at such a rate 1 am not completely sure whether I am drawing the right conclusion. Perhaps I am slow. His criticisms of the Government in relation to action taken recently and on a number of occasions in the past which involved some slowing down in the rate of new dwelling construction appeared to imply that a Labor government would put no limit on the proportion of. our total resources going into the housing industry. He implied that it was not the function or the responsible role of a government to make an assessment as to whether at any particular time too great a proportion of resources is going into this industry, or that there is an obligation on the Government to take action to correct an imbalance. We have it on the record that the policy of a Labor government would be full steam ahead in relation to housing, whatever the situation, whatever the strain on resources, however much of those resources would go into housing and whatever effect it would have on the price levels in the economy.The honourable gentlemans speech from beginning to end was one criticism of the Governments activities in housing. It was an attempt to suggest that the housing policies of the present Government have been a dismal failure over the last 20 years. Anybody who listened to the honourable gentleman could be forgiven for thinking that the Government had sadly failed in this field. In the period that this Government has been in office we have produced the situation in which a higher proportion of home ownership has been achieved in this country than in almost any other country in the world and perhaps more than in any other country. This is what the Governments policies have achieved, ft has been made possible for a greater proportion of our population to own their own homes than in any other country. What a failure! lt is a failure by the standards of the Opposition. It still harks back to the little capitalists of the Dedman.The Government regards the degree of home ownership in Australia as the hallmark of its achievement. The specific remedies that the Opposition would propose, if it came into government, to correct the alleged defects in the housing situation are related to the Oppositions belief that there is something bad in home ownership because this makes a person into a little capitalist. I use the words of a predecessor of the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) who will speak in this debate. Although the Leader of the Opposition did not say much about it, his motion foreshadows an urgent need to appoint a joint select committee - of this Parliament, presumably - to inquire into and report on the grants and conditions which the Housing Agreement 1971 should provide for housing, land development and urban environment. That is the matter of public importance that we are debating. I see no need to appoint such a committee, and the Government will oppose such a proposal. My colleague, the Minister for Housing (Senator Dame Annabelle Rankin), has already received the views of all the State Housing Ministers on the nature of the offer of housing assistance they would wish the Commonwealth to make. These views are now being considered very carefully by the Minister and her advisers. In addition she is studying closely the nature and extent of the Commonwealths offer of assistance to the States for housing. She will shortly be putting her proposals to her ministerial colleagues.Honourable members may be interested to know that, having regard to the terms of the matter that the Opposition has raised, the Minister for Housing has asked her Department to make a study of those people who are most in need of housing assistance. Those best able to inform the Commonwealth Government on this matter are the State officers who are in day to day contact with families, widows, deserted wives and others seeking housing assistance. Officers of the Department of Housing recently discussed this matter in some depth with the housing officers from all the States. We now have a comprehensive and up to date story of those in need of housing assistance and of the manner in which the States wish to obtain Commonwealth assistance to enable them to carry out their housing tasks. I venture to say that the State Ministers for Housing and their officers are better informed of housing needs and what should be done to meet them than are most members of this House who would of course constitute this committee.","Interest Rates","HOUSING, LAND DEVELOPMENT AND URBAN ENVIRONMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1[5]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It wants a committee to tell the States what they should do in a field in which the States clearly have the expertise and the competence to discharge the day to day responsibilities.The question of land development for residential purposes is also one which the Commonwealth Minister for Housing has been looking into very closely. She has also discussed this with a number of State Ministers and, following on these discussions, has reached the conclusion that this is a matter for the States, several of which are actively engaged in land development and have introduced schemes to keep the price of newly developed land as low as possible to young families. I might also add that under the existing CommonwealthState Housing Agreement the States may develop, and are developing, small areas of land for sale to home seekers. To take another element of the motion, urban environment is not being ignored by my colleague the Minister for Housing. As a result of informal discussions with the States it has become apparent that the States wish to experiment with new types of estate development which would include, in addition to the building of cottages, the building of a number of terrace houses and groups of cluster housing as well as modest high rise buildings for single persons and families without children in particular.All the State housing authorities are interested in improving the environment surrounding homes. Some of them have already embarked on interesting experiments. The States are seeking, and obtaining, more information on types of dwellings desired by home seekers, and some universities are assisting them with this work. The point I am making in relation to all the elements in the motion is that it is perfectly clear that there is not an urgent need, to quote the motion, to appoint a joint select committee of this Parliament for the purposes set out by the honourable gentleman. As I said before, the responsible authorities are the State governments. They have the expertise. Is the Opposition suggesting that the State housing authorities are not competent to decide these matters, that they have not the expertise and that these are not unquestionably matters which lie within the constitutional powers of the States? We will be hearing from the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren), the Labor Partys shadow Minister for Housing, who has been overshadowed today by his Leader. He can tell us just what the Labor Party does think about the competence of the State authorities in this field.I think it is overweening arrogance on the part of the Labor Party Opposition to suggest that this Parliament knows better than the State governments what the States want and the priorities that they attach in this field, because this is the implication in its move to set up a select committee for the purpose named in the motion. As I say, my colleague has been actively discussing this matter with the States and they, from their knowledge, experience and expertise and also from a consciousness of where their responsibilities lie, have made clear where their priorities stand. As I have also said, the Government will very shortly proceed, as a result of the discussions that my colleague has had with the States, to decide its attitude on the new agreement after the existing one expires. The Government opposes the motion.","Interest Rates","HOUSING, LAND DEVELOPMENT AND URBAN ENVIRONMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1[5]/speech[1]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
59,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"UREN, Tom","EE4","Reid","N/A","N/A",383,"- My only comment on the speech of the Minister for Health (Dr Forbes) is that the Government is so barren of ideas on housing and urban living that there was only a slight mention of housing in the Budget speech, even though the home building sector of the building industry is in a chaotic condition. There was no mention in the Budget Speech of urban life or of pollution associated with the urban environment.I support the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam). I have pleasure in supporting him and following him. There are many reasons I could give for supporting this motion, but time will permit me to deal with only a few aspects. A few of the aspects are, firstly, the interest burden on the young married couple seeking a home - also the family group, which is continuously having its interest burden increased; secondly, the cost of a home and land and the inadequate loans that are available; thirdly, spiralling land costs; fourthly, the inadequacy of the low cost housing provided by State Government authorities; and, fifthly, the fact that it is almost impossible because of finance difficulty for a young couple seeking to construct or purchase a dwelling to do so.Let me give briefly some details of the low cost housing constructed by the State Housing Commission and the moneys made available under the StateCommonwealth Housing Agreement. In 1945 the Chifley Labor Government provided the States with 53-year loans for housing for people on low incomes. These loans bore an interest rate of 3%. The Commonwealth Government at that time agreed to meet three-fifths of the cost of rent rebates, which was designed to ensure that no low income family would be required to pay more than one-fifth of its income for a government home. There has been a gradual erosion of this monument of social justice to the not so fortunate in our community. The present staggering interest burden placed on dwellings constructed by the State housing authorities is at a rate of 6%. Just imagine: The rate of 3% under the Chifley administration has increased to 6% under this Gorton administration - or should 1 say maladministration. The number of dwellings constructed has diminished each year. From a peak of 17,900 dwellings constructed in 1954-55 the number diminished to 12,300 in 1968-69. So that from 1954-55, when the State housing authorities constructed 22% of all dwellings constructed in that year there has been a decrease in low cost housing to only 9.7% of dwelling construction in 1968-69. In other words, the public sector of the building industry is getting into greater and greater squalor. But one must question whether one can even describe it as low cost housing.Let us examine the example of a home, including land and dwelling, which costs $12,000. The average cost of a block of land and a house is $14,000 throughout Australia. If one were to rent a home and land costing $12,000 from the State Housing Commission with an interest burden of 6% , the weekly cost in interest alone would be $13. On top of that there would be maintenance costs, depreciation, rates and taxes and the amount necessary to be put aside to pay off the capital cost of the dwelling. How can such housing be described as low cost housing? We need an inquiry to examine the stupidity of the Federal Government and its exploitation of the States with this heavy interest burden. It is a weapon that is destroying our people who need assistance, guidance and encouragement. We need to give them social security from this urban drought - the drought in the cities that drags them down. This Government is not assisting and encouraging them to face their insecure world. We need an inquiry, because they need a new deal and we should begin again. We should return to the Chifley era. We need a cheap money policy for low cost housing. If the rural sector has a case for special consideration, then people living in a social drought in the urban areas need special consideration.I turn now to the ever-increasing interest burden on housing. The Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Mr J. G. Phillips, said recently that in the course of its contacts with savings banks, trading banks and life insurance offices, the Reserve Bank had asked these institutions to maintain and, in the case of savings banks. to extend and increase the volume of their housing loans in the coming months. 1 ask the House rationally: Can young people benefit from such action? Last April, due to the action of the Reserve Bank, interest rates were forced up. The interest on a loan from a savings bank to purchase a home was increased to 61% for the first $8,000, and in certain circumstances a second mortgage of $4,000 at 84% interest was available from the trading banks to bring the loan up to $12,000. But a purchaser of a home has to find another $2,000 to $3,000 to close the deposit gap, because the average home costs approximately $14,000 to $15,000.The repayments on a loan which is to be repaid over 15 years would be $127.85 a month for the first 8 years and $70.79 a month for the remainder of the period. The repayments on a loan to be repaid over 25 years would be $112 a month for the first 8 years and $55.27 a month for the remaining 17 years. The repayments on a loan of $12,000 from a permanent building society, to be repaid over 15 years, would be $116.42 a month, and if it is to be repaid over 25 years the repayments would be $94.62 a month. It seems to me that it is putting young people into an impossible position. If the lending authorities require the mortgage repayments not to exceed 25% of the earnings of the male earner, a person who wanted to obtain a bank loan and repay it over 25 years would have to earn at least $110 a week. If he were to obtain a loan of $12,000 from a permanent building society, to be repaid over 25 years, he would have to earn $94 a week. If the loan was to be repaid over 15 years, the burden would be much greater. With the concurrence of honourable members I incorporate in Hansard a table setting out the relevent figures.N/AWhat is the solution? We need an inquiry into all sectors of housing. The interest burden continues to grow. Interest on Commonwealth Bank loans has risen from 3i% to 6i% in 2 decades. Interest on second mortagage loans has increased to 8J%. Interest on premanent building society loans has increased to 8i%.The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) has suggested that a 2% housing subsidy be granted to every young married couple in the first 10 years of marriage. On a loan of $12,000 repayable over 25 years this would mean a benefit of $352 in the first year of the loan. On a loan repaid over 25 years it would mean a savings in interest repayments of $4,635 over the life of the loan. This proposal could assist young married couples. On the other hand, the subsidy could be extended to help the family groups who 5 or 10 years ago entered into housing agreements and who now find their interest burden, with the encouragement of the Government, continuing to rise.An examination of the present estimated value crf home loans outstanding to all lending authorities shows a total amount outstanding of $6, 129m. If one excludes home loans outstanding on war service homes amounting to $900m with interest at 3i% and to State housing authorities amounting to $700m with interest at about 5%, the value of outstanding home loans is $4,529m. If one applies an average interest rate of 7%, the interest burden per year would be $317m. If Mr Whitlams subsidy of 2% were extended, it would reduce the interest burden to $226m per year. Therefore, it would cost $91m to finance the proposal. It may be necessary to consider a means test both on the cost of land and dwellings and also personal income. Such an inquiry could examine this proposal.Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Lucock)Order!The honourable members time has expired.","Interest Rates","HOUSING, LAND DEVELOPMENT AND URBAN ENVIRONMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1[5]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
60,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"IRWIN, Leslie","KJG","Mitchell","N/A","N/A",385,"- I rise to oppose the proposal put forward by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) because it is totally unnecessary. The Minister for Housing (Senator Dame Annabelle Rankin) has already taken the matter up with the States. The housing Commissions in the various States have done a very good job. They have built a home of good standard which is rented at a minimal price. These homes are sold to low wage earners on very reasonable terms. I think that the discussions which are taking place between the Commonwealth Minister for Housing and the State Ministers for Housing will reveal that the people who need urgent assistance, who need to be given preference in obtaining homes, are those in the low wage bracket and with large families. The numbers of people waiting to rent housing commission homes in New South Wales has been reduced considerably, but I would like to see it reduced further as quickly as possible.If we consider the improvement in home construction and the amenities that have been provided in homes over the last 7 years we will find that the cost dollar for dollar of building a home has not increased to the same extent as has the price of land. Why has the price of land increased to the extent that it has? It has increased because of the so-called planning that has taken place. The present prices obtained for land are fictitious. They have been brought about by an unrealistic approach to the problem. I speak only in regard to New South Wales. I think that the increase in the price of land in New South Wales has been brought about by zoning. Latterly a person subdividing property has had many impositions placed upon him. He has had to supply reticulated water and also make improvements such as footpaths.This is all right to a point, but naturally the developer passes the cost of providing these services on to the purchaser who in turn is not relieved by the payment of lower rates to the water and sewerage board or to the council. Despite the fact that all these amenities are provided by the developer and paid for in turn by the purchaser, the purchaser still has to pay the same rates as do people in the more exclusive areas who have had all their amenities provided by the public utility. This is not fair to our young, low wage people. A young couple in New South Wales who have the opportunity of renting in the first instance a Housing Commission home may buy it on exceptional terms. They may purchase it for a deposit of $100. Of course, in addition they have to pay State stamp duty and legal costs. I have been told that they would require $300 to $350 to start off on the purchase of their home. This is a very wonderful opportunity for young married people and people on a low wage. The interest paid for a loan or a Housing Commission house is something in excess of 6%. The Commonwealth charges the States 6% for the money that is provided under this scheme.The Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement is to come up for review in 1971. I am the chairman of the Government Members Housing Committee and it has already had discussions about the Agreement. I think the emphasis from now on will have to be to ensure that the low wage earner - especially the low wage earner with a family - and the young married couple will be given the precedence to enable him to purchase his own home. It would appear that more money should be directed into this field. It would appear that the middle bracket and higher bracket of wage earners have the resources available to borrow money and to erect their own homes. It would appear that because of the percentage of young married couples and the low age of a great number of our citizens the emphasis as regards need has passed now to the low wage earner and the young married couple. We will view this position in association with the States, which are very close to the scene and are better able to judge than we are. We are able to get more direct evidence from State officials because they are in daily touch with the people requiring homes. I think it would be preferable to act in this way than to do what the Opposition has suggested.Honourable members may be interested to know that 80% of all married pensioners own their homes. So the position has not been as bad as that depicted by the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren). I believe that in New South Wales we have to get rid of the zoning method, by which rural land can be bought very cheaply. Immediately the land is zoned as residential, human nature being as it is, the price goes up. Planning is always necessary, but the implementation of planning in New South Wales is wholly responsible for the high price and the increase in the price of land in New South Wales.","Interest Rates","HOUSING, LAND DEVELOPMENT AND URBAN ENVIRONMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1[5]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
61,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"SCHOLES, Gordon","5J4","Corio","N/A","N/A",386,"- I rise to support the proposal of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) that a parliamentary inquiry should be conducted into the terms under which the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement will be renegotiated next year. I do so because I think a very narrow view of housing is being expounded by the Commonwealth Government. In fact, we have reached the stage where the only consideration in relation to housing which is evident in Government policy is how much money will be spent on it; how much interest will be charged; and how much can be extracted from young families in order to meet repayments over ever-extending periods. I believe that there is more to housing than this. I believe there is more to Commonwealth responsibility than this. And this is not a new view to be put before this Parliament.Provision was made in the initial Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement that certain allocations of money had to be spent on recreation and community facilities. No such provision now exists in the Agreement with the result that some of the housing projects which have been constructed and are being operated by State authorities with Commonwealth money are an absolute disgrace to our society and will cause our society far more problems than would the total failure to provide housing. I think that is a fair statement. As early as 1945 the urgent need for the provision of housing was brought to the attention of the Parliament. A report was prepared that year for the then Minister for the Post War Reconstruction and presented to the Parliament. Despite the fact that at the time pressure on the nations resources was far greater than it could conceivably be considered to be today, provision was made in the recommendations of that report that as a matter of urgent consideration recreation and community facilities should be constructed with housing projects. I would like to quote 2 passages from that report - I do not have time to quote any more. I will later ask leave to have the report incorporated in Hansard because the report was made to the Parliament at a time of austerity and as a result only 1 copy is available in the Bills and Papers Room. Members cannot peruse this copy at their leisure because of the obvious value of the single copy that is available. The section of the report dealingwith the summary of recommendations has this to say about the activities of the Commonwealth Housing Authority.to examine proposedhousing projects where Commonwealth financial assistance is desired to ensure that the plans comply with Commonwealth standards for town planning, community facilities and housing;I think where large sums of Commonwealth money are involved it might not be a bad idea to have some guidelines for the allocation of Commonwealth funds. Quite obviously some of the recommendations have become out of date by the passage of time and some have been covered by legislation.In another section of the report dealing with minimum community standards we find that the following provisions recommended in any new housing estate:Shops (to provide day-to-day needs); play areas, infant health and pre-school child welfare centres; meeting hall; and schools.The report also recommends under the heading Education and Culture that urgent needs include:Kindergartens and day nurseries;Club and meeting rooms;Small halls for use as little theatres, lecture halls and space for art and museum exhibitions, orchestra, band, etc.;Libraries, including childrens section.Under the heading Recreational the report states:small equipped play areas, located within close distance of dwelling;childrens playgrounds, equipped and supervised;playing fields for field games for youths and adults;gymnasia;swimming facilities;youth centre, including rooms for indoor sports, club activities, handicrafts and music;I think that these requirements are as relevant now as they have ever been. With the concurrence of honourable members I incorporate in Hansard 2 sections of the report.Part XVI.

Our terms of referencehave limited our inquiries to the community in which people live, rather than the community in which people work. Community facilities exclude working time activities; they are, however, wider than leisure-time interests, for they embrace health, educational and shopping activities. It is, however, convenient for purposes of discussion to divide community facilities into two types:","N/A","SUMMARY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

76,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","facilities for which little provision is normally made and for which financial responsibility is not clear. This group includes recreational facilities, both physical and cultural, and educational facilities for the pre-school child and adults. 819. It is difficult to define the scope of community facilities because the needs vary as between different communities. There is, however, a definite minimum which will be needed in each area. 820. In the past, facilities of the first type have been provided either as a general service to the community, as with the present health and educational services, or as the result of effort within the community itself. There are, however, certain communities in which, through lack of initiative or finance, these services are seriously lacking, these conditions being found in many closely builtup areas in large towns. In all communities there are serious omissions in the field of provision for the pre-school child and cultural activities for all age groups. 821. The deficiencies in many localities, as wellas the gap between achievementandideal in all communities, may be due to lack of knowledge, interest or leadership. Sometimes the community is too small and scattered to support the services. The need is often for more information and for provision of finance. 822. Therefore, we consider that it is necessary for some outside authority to assist local activity to give the lead in providing facilities and direction, and to stimulate residents to an active sense of responsibility and a desire to participate in the management of their own activities. 823. Even where fairly adequate facilities do already exist there has been, generally, a lack of co-ordination which has resulted in restricted community development. During the war there have been many illustrations of the benefits achieved through an active community spirit. The Air Raid Precaution Services, Red Cross, war committees and camouflage net-making groups have all provided wider social contacts than previously, with obvious benefits to the spirit of co-operation of the community as a whole. There is clearly a need for co-ordination of welfare and social organisations. 824. In new housing estates there will be special need to stimulate community development; these estates may possibly form a major part of postwar housing. In established communities some social, educational and recreational organisations exist, but in new housing estates these bodies will have to be developed. Residents moving into a new area will have broken old associations and will feel the need to make new ones, and health, educational and shopping facilities should be provided when the area is first occupied; the development of recreational and cultural facilities in a new estate may, however, be slow and outside assistance and advice will be required to stimulate organisation by local citizens. 825. We consider, therefore, that there will be a need for encouragement to be given to establish community facilities as a part of all housing, whether this development is in the form of entirely new housing estates or in the replanning of existing built-up areas. Therefore, WE RECOMMEND that in planning all new areas and in replanning all built-up areas, land and buildings should be provided for at least the minimum community facilities listed in paragraphs 831 and 834, and that Commonwealth financial assistance should not be granted for any particular project unless and until conditions prescribed by the Commonwealth Community Facilities Committee (see paragraph 842) are complied with. 826. We consider it most important to emphasise that, although recreational and social activity should be stimulated and assisted by a central organisation, the motive force and the responsibility for organisation must rest with the people of the locality concerned.","N/A","SUMMARY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/list[2]/item[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

The State Housing Authority or its delegated authority will be responsible for the erection of certain community buildings, and it will be desirable for the technical staff of the State Housing Authority to maintain close liaison with other departments, such as as the Departments of Health and Education, in order to ensure thai the buildings erected by these departments shall harmonise with the rest of the housing project. 828. Minimum buildings only should be provided at first in a new housing estate. In the postwar period restrictions may be necessary owing to the shortage of labour and material. While building resources are in short supply a temporary or an incomplete building may be used. This will allow scope for variation in the way in which the social life of the community may develop. Certain disused military buildings may be avail able for these purposes. 829. In built-up areas land for additional community facilities should be acquired with due regard to town-planning principles, for social activities already present and to provide for their extension. In all cases local committees should advise on the work to be undertaken. 830. We consider, as a general principle, that in every scheme certain community facilities should be established at the time of the erection of dwellings, and that space should be left for other facilities, which may be built as local initiative becomes more conscious of the need for them and as more resources become available.","N/A","SUMMARY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/list[2]/item[2]/list/item/list/item[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

We do not feel competent to recommend the number of persons which should be served by each of these faciliteis Educational and health authorities have already some working basis for provision of the facilities for which they ?. irresponsible. The variation in the size and density of existing communities served by other facilities is so great that there can be no attempt to establish standards. We consider that the numbers of each facility to be established in particular are;.should be left to decided by the Community Facilities Committee in each State (see paragraph 841). After experience, these committees should be able to establish some principles which would be of assistance in planning facilities in other areas. 833. The provision of recreation areas is primarily a town-planning problem. For example, if a new housing estate is established near a builtup area, existing playing fields and parks may partly serve the new estate. Similarly the neighbouring area may be badly served by facilities and some allowance may have to be made for the use of new facilities by people outside the particular area. 834. In addition to the provision of the facilities listed above we recommend that in every large housing project land should be allotted for the following facilities, leaving the development of the areas, the provision of buildings and services to be provided as the need become apparent:","N/A","SUMMARY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/list[2]/item[7]/para","N/A","N/A"

205,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"HALLETT, John","KGA","Canning","N/A","N/A",399,"- Nobody would deny the importance of home building in Australia. Australia has always been looked upon as a community of people who like to have their small plot of land - a quarter of an acre or whatever it may be - and on it have their own homes and so their independence. We see the development of Australia moving ahead. Nobody would deny either that the standard of homes being built across the continent today is very good. The standard has been improving for some time. Firstly, there is the matter of responsibility. This comes up quite often not only in this Parliament but also wherever politics and development are being discussed. Let me remind the House that within this Commonwealth of ours we have 3 levels of government - local, State and Commonwealth - and we have our own constitutions relating to those areas of government. As I see it, far too often some people are apt to forget about such things as constitutional responsibility. This motion seeks to set up another committee and if we do not look out we will have far too many chiefs and far too few Indians in this country. That is the way it will go. If we leave the areas of responsibility where they belong today and stop trying to cut across each others area of responsibility we will get on quite a lot better.We have our responsibility as a Commonwealth which includes certain financial responsibilities. Under their constitutions the States have their responsibilities in relation to housing and within this area local government authorities certainly have their own area of responsibility. They are much nearer to the scene of activity ofGovernment and I believe that the Minister in negotiating with the State Ministers concerned and in arriving at solutions in relation to the problems of home building is in fact doing the right thing. Something has been said in relation to finance for home building in Australia. We know that in home building than is this Commonwealth recent times we have had an increase in interest rates. This is a traditional move not only in this country but in the economies of other countries. Economists in other countries do precisely the same thing when they have inflationary pressures bearing down on their economies. This is important to home building. The pressure on home building in the Commonwealth during recent years has created an inflationary pressure in this area. The pressure has been tremendous and there simply have not been enough bricks or whatever it takes to build a home or enough chaps to put them together. This inflationary pressure was building up and so we had to do one of 2 things: We had to allow that to continue and the inflationary pressure to move on with the cost of homes moving up as it was in fact moving up or we had to do something about it.The Governments decision - or the Reserve Banks decision as I understand the monetary system of this country - to increase interest rates was made in order to dampen the economy and therefore dampen the cost of home building. If we did it the other way within a few years home builders would be paying far more for their homes than will result from the extra interest rate which has been applied. Nobody likes to see increases in interest rates. Nobody likes to see additional costs but in a country developing as rapidly as this one this inflationary pressure is dangerous not only to the housing industry but also to all the other sections of the community. If it were not dampened down the results would be far greater costs not only to the housing industry and those people who, following our tradition, are buying homes but to all other sections of the community as well. Therefore, if this matter of finance and interest rates is raised it is necessary to take a choice of one of the two matters which I have mentioned. In this motion it seems that the Oppositions only concern is with urban homes, urban environment and urban development, but we want to see equal opportunity for the people not only in urban areas but also outside urban areas. We have heard much talk about pollution and that seems to be a popular topic today. If we do not do as has been done in Canberra we will be building pollution into the city areas. We must get out of some of the big cities, cut off development at the point we have reached, and begin building additional cities. This can be done. It must be borne in mind that we can create pollution by establishing a certain environment, but it must be remembered also that we can move out into the great areas of this country and build cities elsewhere if we want to avoid this situation. We have heard a reference by the Opposition to equal opportunities, but there are not equal opportunities. I think it was the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) who mentioned something about droughts and other problems which affected certain areas of the rural sector. I remind the honourable gentleman that in the main the rural sector does not have the same opportunity in relation to housing as does the urban area or the provincial city areas. If the honourable member were on a farm he would find that he could not obtain a long term loan of any dimension whatsoever at this stage.","General Powers","SUMMARY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

207,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"HALLETT, John","KGA","N/A","N/A","N/A",400,"- Loans for war service homes have been made available to farmers only in the last few years. I am well aware that they were not available until a few years ago. So the financial terms and conditions available to people in the cities for building homes are not available to persons living on farms. We hope that this situation will be corrected in the not too distant future. When we consider the city areas and the advantages there compared with country areas we must look at both sides of the ledger to understand the situation fully.I should like to mention one other point in relation to homes to illustrate what I have been saying about there not being equal opportunity for people. I am sure that the honourable member for Reid would be the first to admit that there should be equal opportunity. To illustrate my point perhaps I can refer to the homes savings grant. Under this scheme there could be 2 barnes valued at precisely the same amount, one being in the country and one in the city.But because the person in the country has to install his own water supply he immediately adds to the capital cost of that block of land when his home is built. If he installs a tank or sinks a well to obtain a water supply the cost is included in the capital cost of the home. I trust that this situation will be rectified in future. 1 have just recently discovered that this situation exists and when I discover something I endeavour to do something about it. Let us consider what happens in the city. 1 am not saying it should not happen, but in Sydney, Melbourne or somewhere else when a water supply is available from a reservoir all that is needed to supply water to the home is about 30 or 40 feet of half inch pipe coupled to the main. But there is no main in country areas. Perhaps in some towns there may be a water supply, but no main is available to the farm and so the farmer has to provide his own water scheme, the cost of which is included in the estimated capital cost or value - however it is termed- of the total home and so it affects his entitlement to a grant. To apply the same cost component to the city dweller it is necessary to take a percentage of the cost of the Sydney or Melbourne water supply system and apply that to his home. Inconsistencies of this kind can be sorted out by honourable members. I do not think we need a special committee to sort out problems of this kind. We have enough chiefs - good ones in the States, the Commonwealth and local authorities - to sort out the situation in relation to housing and let the Commonwealth do its job in relation to these matters.","General Powers","SUMMARY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[1]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The quorum of a subcommittee shall be a majority of the members appointed to the sub-committee.Each committee, or any sub-committee, shall have power to send for person (excepting Ministers of State), papers and records, to move from place to place, and to sit during any recess of the Parliament.Each committee shall have leave to report from time to time its proceedings with or without the evidence, or the evidence only.Except where otherwise provided in this standing order, the standing orders relating to select committees shall apply to a committee appointed under this standing order.I want to place before the House a proposition that we establish a system of standing committees in line with the procedures that have been outlined and circulated to the Parliament. 1 believe that this would be a most important addition to the procedures of the House. It would be, perhaps, almost a revolution in the procedures of this Parliament. Arguments on this matter have been advanced for many years but I want to put before the House the reasons why 1 think it essential that at this stage in the parliamentary history of this country we should make a change towards greater parliamentary participation in the management of the nation. I do not believe that elections or the Parliament itself are concerned merely with the selection of an executive. They are not to be regarded as an exercise to find somebody who can press buttons and have action taken. In Australia there is no shortage of action. We have a very efficient Public Service. We have an administrative system right throughout the continent which can produce results whenever it is so desired. It is not a question of executive action that I believe needs to come under scrutiny at this time but the question of parliamentary participation and public participation. In general, we need a scrutiny of power rather than the exercise of power.Honourable members may look at this amendment and say that they prefer select committees to standing committees but I do not believe that the definition of the subject is important. I believe that what we have to do is to get the maximum parliamentary participation in the work of the nation. It is not exactly a consideration of executive authority which will be the basis of the work of the committees, as I see it. The opportunity has occurred, as a result of the work of the Standing Orders Committee, to place this matter before the Parliament and the further opportunity has occurred because of the agreement of the Prime Minister (Mr Gorton) - almost his initiative, I would say - for questions associated with the Parliament to be decided by members by a free vote. I hope that members of Parliament will consider these issues as parliamentarians and not as Party members.I agree that this is perhaps a change of some magnitude in the procedures of the Parliament and that perhaps it should not be entered upon lightly, but I believe also that the proposition contains no real dangers to the parliamentary institution. We will still meet here, the 125 of us, and there will still be the votes and decisions that have to be taken in this place. The motion is to establish 7 standing committees. A schedule of the duties of the committees has been circulated to honourable members and I do not propose to read them out. lt might be said that this is the first thought about the way in which we would divide the functions of this country. We have first to consider the magnitude of the administration of a country such as ours. The 12 million people involve all sorts of social, financial, political and other complex activities. Parliament itself is responsible for the management of a Public Service of well over 100.000 full time public servants. lt is responsible for the administration of 30 to 35 major Commonwealth departments. There is a large number of statutory organisations of great magnitude. Some of them appear as minor matters in the Estimates. One with which I am associated, the National Library of Australia, is responsible for the employment of hundreds and the expenditure of millions. There are some areas of the Estimates where just one line involves millions of dollars and thousands of people. So the following divisions are suggested: A standing committee on foreign affairs and defence, a standing committee on finance and trade, a standing committee on health and welfare, a standing committee on primary industry and national development, a standing committee on transport and communications, a standing committee on education, science and the arts, and a standing committee on legal, home and internal territory affairs. 1 have no doubt that other honourable members could think of other ways in which this could he organised but 1 believe that in the first instance it would be worthwhile to launch the project in these terms. The motion is designed to give the greatest possible flexibility to the membership of the committees. In the first instance each committee will have a chairman and a nucleus of 1 1 members, but there will be room to appoint 6 other members if this motion is carried. Paragraph (c) of the proposed new standing order 29A reads:By agreement between the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, up to 6 additional members may. having regard to their special knowledge and qualifications, be appointed to a committee during the consideration of a particular matter.The object of this proposal is to give the greatest possible flexibility to the work and membership of the committees. I believe it is fatal to the workings of an institution such as ours to have to make decisions about such a matter at a fixed lime and that because somebody is not appointed to a committee on a certain date his expertise and his capacity are lost lo that committee. I put thai point before honourable members so they can sec that we are attempting to design a flexible system under which members of the Parliament may participate in the deliberations of the nation to the greatest possible extent.Of course, the object of these committees in the. first instance will be to examine the work of the nation and the legislation before the Parliament. We will be beginning a system which has already worked successfully in various ways in other countries. We are stepping into a new era. For various reasons, some of them historical and some of them deriving from the exceptionally partisan nature of our politics. I think it is fair to say that our political structure is certainly much more partisan over large areas than in the United States of America and. I believe, in Canada, and even in the United Kingdom and New Zealand. Because of this characteristic our tendency has been to polarise everything in a party area.In my experience of the committees with which I have been associated I have found allies right across the board. Some years ago with members of all parties I sat on the Select Committee into Grievances of Yirrkala Aborigines. Arnhem Land Reserve. This was a most rewarding experience because, when it comes to the general human values which one is required to examine. 1 am able to arrive at the same basic conclusions as my friends opposite. This is the case with much of the legislation that comes before us here, lt is true that a large amount of the legislation that passes through this Parliament is not of a controversial nature and does not cause any great difference of opinion. Many Bills, motions and resolutions are passed without dissent. Therefore we accept the view that we are in agreement on so many things. That is why I took this opportunity to bring this motion forward. We ought to capitalise the consensus in the Parliament rather than polarise the dissent. 1 believe this is what a committee system can do. When honourable members sit round a table and consider a matter in detail, getting down to the bones of it so that they can see where the good lies and where the wrongs are, they find that over large areas of social enterprise there are not many great differences between those of us who are regarded as being on the left and those who are regarded as being on the right. This is the opportunity that a committee system would give.Our Parliament has certain characteristics which are not familiar to other people round the world. As I pointed out. it is partisan and is likely to polarise dissent rather than capitalise consensus. This is partly because the nation is as it is and partly because, relatively, we have looked upon ourselves as a small assemblage. An assemblage of 125 people is not a small assemblage at all. Even in the days when 70, 72 or 73 members were meeting here it. was still a fairly large public meeting. So the democratic need for open discussion and exchange of views is almost impossible to achieve. 1 believe that democracy faces a very important challenge at this time. Tn the world at large there are very few totally democratic communities. I have made many speeches to show that there are large areas of undemocratic practice in this community. I do not propose to expound on that today. I believe that at this time the world needs examples of democratic political co-operation.Sitting suspended front 12.45 to 2.15 p.m.","Report","STANDING ORDERS COMMITTEE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
210,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BRYANT, Gordon","JSU","N/A","N/A","N/A",403,"- Before the suspension of the sitting I had moved a motion for the establishment of a standing committee system. The motion has been circulated and most honourable members are familiar with its contents. J was outlining the reasons as I saw them for the necessity for a standing committee system, one of the principal reasons being that it would create more opportunity for particiation by the Parliament itself in the government of this country and it would broaden the basis upon which the whole administration of the nation works. I believe it is necessary at this stage for a country such as Australia to establish standards for democracy which other people can admire and emulate. In the area in which we live parliamentary democracy - indeed the whole idea of democracy - is under continual challenge. These days people talk about democracy but they implement it as little as possible. This applies to many people in our neighbourhood. It is important that we try to introduce or regather to ourselves some confidence in the institution of Parliament.I believe the committee system will do a number of things. First of all it will look as if Parliament were participating. I hope it will dispose of the idea that we are just rubber stamps for an Executive which meets in some secret enclave somewhere and presses on from there, lt would give easier and more effective access to the deliberations of Parliament by a greater number of people who now just write to us in voluminous documentation of some case, lt is a very important feature of our democratic society that people should have access to the decision making and policy making processes. Of course it would bring to honourable members some sense of doing something useful, in my mind there is no doubt that there are large areas of government in which all of us could participate. In this Parliament there is a great deal of intellectual capacity, human experience and - to use a colloquialism - a great deal of nous. For instance it would bc a great and fortunate accident if by some means members of the Ministry had this capacity to a greater degree than anybody else had. I am not conceited enough to think that I am much more gifted than people in the Ministry and 1 am not modest enough to say they are any more gifted than I am. I believe this is a convocation of equals. We are not in the contest of presenting the country with Prime Ministers, Ministers or people of rank. We are all of equal status. We come here in the same way representing people.The very function of government requires that some people shall have the responsibility of initiating Executive action and seeing that things work smoothly. But each one of us has a function to perform because of the capacity which we have, the people we represent and the very nature of the society of which we are a part. Therefore I start with the assumption that this is a convocation of equals and not just a selection of a Ministry. We are all in a position to consider and answer for the things we do. I believe we have to arrive at a state where decisions of this Parliament are both deliberative and considered. As I said earlier a large number of the decisions of this Parliament are not controversial. Whether there will be 8,000 scholarships or 10,000 scholarships, whether they shall be this sort or that sort and whether they shall be contested in this way or be granted in that way are not political matters. These are decisions which have been made somewhere along the line perhaps by somebody in the Public Service after the Minister has initiated the scheme.In my conversations with people of ministerial rank, with people who have held that rank at some time in the past and with senior public servants I gather some sense of how it all happens. The Minister has visions or ideas - perhaps not enough at the current time. He makes his views known, his staff starts to think about them and produces suggestions or facts in accordance with his ideas. One might say that hints have been dropped in various ways. The great difficulty that this Parliament creates for itself is that little opportunity exists for the hints from our side of the House or from outside the Ministry to flow into the apparatus. In the Public Service there Ls a great pyramid in which ideas can flow, 1 have no doubt, from even the most humble to the top until they reach ministerial level. They may well be implemented by political decisions. Outside that there is a curtain of some sort behind which the rest of the honourable members are consigned. On the other hand I believe it is necessary for some mitigation of power, not necessarily the mitigation of my friends in the Ministry but a mitigation of the authority which flows through the Executive decisions of the nation. We should be careful to keep everything under scrutiny, to let everybody possible participate and see that any decision which is made is exposed to public view.This Parliament is a forum. At this time that is about all one can say for it. In the last few days we have been able to consult and decide for ourselves on matters of some importance such as the quorum. I happen to disagree with the decision the Howe made on the quorum but in fact we made individual decisions. It seems to me the party system prevents debate in the Parliament from becoming an actual exchange of views. We can expose our views here but we cannot exchange them and then change them as a result of the deliberations of this House, in smaller groups such as committees one can do this. I believe we ought to be prepared to initiate a system which will allow us to do it. What shall be the functions of the committees? One might say that we are beginning. For some time we have had a number of standing committees such as the House Committee, and statutory committees like the Public Accounts Committee and the Public Works Committee.I have circulated a paper which is headed Development of the Committee System. I do not know whether it has been printed in Hansard but, if feasible, I would like it incorporated in Hansard. It is a description of the committee system. If it were incorporated I think it would help honourable members as time goes by. It is an official document.","Report","STANDING ORDERS COMMITTEE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

217,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BRYANT, Gordon","JSU","N/A","N/A","N/A",407,"- Let us consider the question of petitions. Many of them involve a great deal of research and effort on the part of somebody and a lot of hopes. 1 think petitions should be referred to committees and examined. Some of them are simple matters which ought not to take up much time. In 1963 I was here when a petition from the people of Yirrkalla in the north brought forth a committee of this House which examined the position. Many Bills are non-controversial. They do not necessarily involve any great differences of political philosophy. Legislation on the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Fund is one example, the Repatriation Act is another and great areas in education are others, in my time here some of the most fruitful examination of legislation has been as a result of the tabling of legislation some months before it is finally considered. The matrimonial causes legislation was of that sort. The Attorney-General at the time was criticised over the Bill. He paid the House and the community the compliment of having the Bill circulated before he finally pressed it through the House. J believe that would probably apply equally to legislation relating to copyright, patents and so on. On the other hand estimates of expenditure ought to be considered. The point that one must make is that no committee will have an executive function on its own. Two features of it will protect any rights of the Ministry and the rights of the Parliament itself. Under the motion a Committee shall act only when a matter has been referred to it by the House. Secondly, it shall report back to the House. 1 believe those are the protective devices for those who are concerned that perhaps this is a breach of the established parliamentary custom of executive, responsibility. Of course, a strong case can be made out for some committee of the House to examine what might be termed the need for legislation in various areas. Conservation is one of them, but there are a lot of other areas in which people can see need for legislation. It would be conceit on our part to think we know all about everything and that we should keep only the present standing committees.As far as the work of a parliamentarian is concerned, the most satisfying task I have had is my membership of the National Library Council. This is an executive authority. It conducts the affairs of a large institution. It has on it some very distinguished Australians and I regard it as an honour to sit and deliberate with them. I find myself in the unique position there of actually helping make decisions, evaluating the judgment of other people and assisting in the development of that institution. I believe a lot more of us could be used in this fashion. Most honourable members are isolated from this kind of deliberation no matter how good they are. There is one other matter that is perhaps a little parochial. The Senate has instituted committee systems and so on. I believe there is a slow move of responsibility and respect for the institution as a legislative and deliberative body to the other side of Kings Hall. It might be just a narrow parochial view on my part but I want a great deal of it to stay here. I believe we have to become equal parts of the deliberations of this Parliament and that, therefore, the standing committee system would be an important contributor to that. On the other hand I remind honourable members that the parliaments of Britain, Canada and New Zealand all have similar systems to that outlined here.I hope that we will adopt the motion I have placed before the House. I know it has a great deal of support around the House. 1 am not quite sure how one crystallises this into full scale deliberations by a House such as this. Perhaps we are just learning the methods by which we deliberate, not as free people but as parliamentarians considering our affairs unrestricted by partisanism of any nature. Having sat opposite Ministers for so long and knowing them personally I can understand the difficulties they face. A Minister must have an overwhelming task to maintain his ministerial duties, his duties in this House and all the other things that go with being a Minister and a member. I believe the Ministry would be aided in most of its tasks - forgetting partisan-political ones - in most of the areas in which Ministers are engaged if Ministers had the independent minds that come from being members of this Parliament. Parliament is different from any other institution. We stand as equals before the greatest in the land. We are always treated as perhaps less than equal by many people, with the equal sign in the democratic equation. It is only to us that people can come with a sense of equality and it is from there we can step into here with a sense of equality. I hope the House will adopt the motion I have placed before it, that honourable members will give it proper and due consideration and that we will take a new step in the evolution of Parliament. I remind honourable members that Cabinet itself is an historical development of the committee system that was introduced in Britain in the 17th Century. I will not outline the history of it. We can all find that in the Encyclopaedia Britannica in the Library which, of course, is developing great resources as a result of an effective committee system revolving around the Library itself.","HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMMITTEE SYSTEM","QUESTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I move:That the House take note of the paper.I am pleased indeed to present this report to the Parliament and at the outset 1 desire to indicate that it is not my intention during these few remarks to speak on the matters which were discussed at the Conference because they are fully reported in the report itself. However, I commend the report to all honourable members and trust they will make time available to read and study it. I welcome the opportunity to express publicly my thanks to the other members of the Australian delegation, namely, Senator Laucke, Mr Devine, Senator Hendrickson, Senator Byrne and Mr Hallett, for their help and comradeship during the whole period of the Conference. T am sure I speak on behalf of all members of the delegation when I record our sincere appreciation to Mr Roy Bullock, Deputy Clerk of the Senate, who acted as secretary and organiser of our party, and Mr David Sadlier of the Department of External Affairs for their outstanding cooperation, helpful advice and assistance, not only in making our task of performing our duties at the conference much easier but also for the thoughtful and efficient manner in which they handled other personal matters that arose during the course of the trip.I feel obliged to report that the leader of the delegation, Senator Laucke, performed his important duties with great energy, courtesy and tact. His co-operation and friendliness were a great boost to us all. Senator Laucke was very much assisted by his enthusiastic and active deputy, Mr Devine. The delegations special thanks go to Sir Arthur and Lady Range for acting as joint hosts at the reception given at the High Commissioners residence and to other members of the High Commission and their families for the kindly assistance extended to us all. Words cannot express our thanks for the manner in which our host country, India, from its gracious Prime Minister right down to its most humble citizen, assisted and encouraged us.

224,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"ENGLAND, John","KDN","Calare","N/A","N/A",410,"- I want to identify myself with this Bill because I know, like a number of other people in this House who have been interested in this project for quite a number of years, that the project will give a boost to Australias reputation in astronomy. My particular interest dates back to 1963 when the Australian National. University Bill was introduced by the then Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies. I raised this matter in 1966 and during the debate on the Budget Estimates in 1967. I remember well that the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley) led for the Opposition at that time. We also heard speeches from the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth), who is now the Minister for Social Services, and others, particularly one of our colleagues at the time, Mr Failes, who was then the honourable member for Lawson. He had a great interest in this matter because Siding Spring Mountain was in his electorate. The Australian National University Bill was designed to remove any restrictions of a geographical nature from the workings of the Australian National University in the field of astronomy. At that time some of us took the opportunity to advocate the building of the telescope with which this Bill deals.This suggestion received very strong support. The Australians received strong support from leaders in astronomy throughout the world. I think it is as well to remember these things because they have helped to put Australian astronomers in world class. I remember that Professor Ambortsumian, a Russian, at that time was President of the International Astronomy Union. He chaired a symposium in Canberra in 1963. The construction of a telescope of this size had the support of the Astronomer Royal, Sir Richard Woolley. Honourable members will remember that at one time he was Commonwealth Astronomer and I think he was Professor of Astronomy at the Australian National University. Professor Gold of the Cornell University in the United States of America expressed the opinion at that time that Australia was then in the top flight in the field of radio astronomy. He gave great support to the proposal for a 150-inch telescope, upon which we have now decided.I think I should digress here to refer to the great spirit of co-operation which exists among astronomers throughout the world. In this troubled world of ours we grab at anything at all which will unite the peoples of the world who are working for something better. They work together firstly through the exchange of information, which is given readily throughout the world. The time of use of the great telescope at Parkes, which is working 24 hours a day, is shared between certain nations. I remember being there not long ago with 2 Ministers of the House. We were spoken to by an Indian who described to us in a lay way the pulsing quasars that they have found as timed against the atomic clock. The fact that we have these people working in our observatories is all to the good. There is co-operation in relation to finance also. The telescope at Parkes was paid for partly by the Carnegie Corporation, partly by the Rockefeller Foundation, and partly by private subscription and, I am glad to say, the Commonwealth Government, which provided more than half the funds. Again in this Bill we see international cooperation. The cost of the telescope will be shared by the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth.At this time I think it would be fitting to refer to the work of Professor Bart Bok.He was known to a large number of people in this country. Here again there is an international aspect to the matter. He was born in Holland, he was a naturalised American, and he spent a great deal of his time working at Mount Stromlo and in astronomy in general in this country. He was a great agitator for the 150-inch telescope that will be built. He wanted it as a basic insrument to be used in what he termed the British-Commonwealth Southern Observatory. I remember, in a paper he delivered - I think it was to one of the international symposiums - under the heading The Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds, he said:An instrument with an aperture of 150 inches should provide in Australia a major telescope that need not take second place to any now in the planning stage.This Bill provides for the construction of such a telescope. He pointed out that experience overseas had demonstrated that a 120-inch reflector was exceedingly useful but on the small side by modern standards. He pointed out that it was definitely too small to enable the astronomer to observe directly at what he referred to as the prime focus. I assume that that is the best focal setting or the best focal length. As a scientific instrument, he pointed out, a 150-inch reflector is clearly the very best buy.The honourable member for Fremantle has raised a question concerning the cost of the telescope. It is interesting to compare the estimate made by Professor Bok in 1963 with the present estimate. It is a tribute to him that, for such a complicated instrument as this, with the effluxion of time his estimate has been found to be very close to the present estimated cost. He estimated that it would cost us £A6m. Now we see that the cast is estimated to be $1lm. I think that h a particularly good estimate for something as sophisticated and complicated as this instrument.After the Australian National University Bill was introduced, the next thing that happened in relation to this telescope was the agreement in 1967. That was the agreement between the United Kingdom and the Australian Governments to build the 150 inch telescope. It was also decided at that time to build it at the Australian National Universitys observatory at Siding SpringMountain. A joint policy committee was set up with a panel of particularly well-known people. They included Sir Richard Woolley, to whom I referred a while ago, and Professor Fred Hoyle, Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy at Cambridge University. They comprised the British side of the team. Other members were Professor Eggen, Director of the Mount Stromlo Observatory, and Dr Bowen, chief of the Radiophysics Division of the CSIRO. That distinguished panel was set up in 1967. It was pointed out by these people that the optimum site for this telescope was in the southern hemisphere. Its siting there would be of benefit in the study of the Milky Way and essential for the study of the Magellanic Clouds. Another reason for this siting was that if its location was too far north some of the advantage would be lost and if it was located too far to the south there would be too much interference from auroral intensity.It has been pointed out by scientists that obviously the best position for an optical telescope is on a space platform, away from atmospheric refraction and other forms of interference from the earth. The site we are talking about was chosen after very intensive investigation throughout the southern areas of Australia. One of the main factors taken into consideration was the absence of cloud cover. Under this measure we envisage the setting up of one of the largest optical telescopes in the world; it is certainly the largest in the southern hemisphere. It is exceeded in size only, as far as I know, by the Palomar 200 inch instrument in California. The proposed optical telescope will do tremendous work and will extend the already great range of knowledge which has come from our research in Australia. It will complement the work of radio telescopes and optical telescopes throughout the world, and particularly the 210 inch radio telescope at Parkes. That instrument was set up and went into operation in 1961. A lot was expected from it because of its great size. It was then about the biggest radio telescope in the world, although I think a bigger one has been built since. The Parkes telescope was designed to operate to very fine tolerances and it had the propensity for pinpoint focusing. That is what is was designed for and that is what was expected from it. With such things the plans often go astray, but in this particular case this world standard telescope achieved more than it was designed to do and far more than was expected of it.At this stage I should like to commend Dr Bowen for his work not only in this connection but also in radiophysics in Australia. His success has kept Australia in world class in radiophysics. I should also like to commend Mr Bolton, the man in charge of that great instrument, and his band of workers. One should not forget that in the building of the telescope at Siding Spring Mountain not only was the Federal Government involved but local government played a big role. The Warrumbungle Range is very old geologically. It is quite rugged and in parts inaccessible. The first step was to build roads. The Coonabarabran Shire Council did a magnificent job in putting roads through to enable the building work to commence. Provision of water had to be looked at, and one of the big problems was to provide electricity. The Ulan County Council did a good job. Apart from the rugged nature of the country, one of the problems was the importance of providing constant voltage at the site for the successful operation of this $1 Ira instrument. This has been achieved.I want to draw attention to 2 of the side effects which have come from the efforts in astronomy in this country. Firstly there has been quite a solid influence on decentralisation. We have the equipment at Mount Stromlo and Siding Spring Mountain, which is a long way out; the Australian invention, Mills Cross, at Hoskinstown, and the interferometer at Narribri. 1 believe there is also a heliograph at Narrabri but I may be wrong. The CSIRO has quite a large establishment at St Marys. There is at Dapto a radio spectroscope. One of the reasons for setting up these projects in country areas was the absence of smog, which is common in our pattern of pollution today. The second important side effect that we should be very pleased about is in the scientific field. We have built this telescope and we are building a nuclear reactor at Jervis Bay. Before these events Australia experienced a great brain drain of young scientists. Our young doctors of philosophy qualified in astronomy, who in the past were limited in what they could do in this country, were being attracted to places overseas. The building of this world class telescope and the prospect of the new atomic reactor at Jervis Bay should have a profound and favourable effect on the brain drain amongst these young scientists and this will help Australia to maintain its position in astronomical research in the world.I not only support the Bill but warmly commend the Government for concluding an agreement with the United Kingdom for this $llm project. It will enable Australia to maintain its world position in astronomical research and it will also assist our radio astronomers to maintain their world lead in this branch of science.","Second Reading","ANGLO-AUSTRALIAN TELESCOPE AGREEMENT BILL 1970","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The honourable member asked whether this would be likely to inhibit the development of the project. As he would be aware, I am only assisting the Minister for Education and Science (Mr N. H. Bowen) and therefore I have no personal knowledge of this matter. I have consulted officers of the Department on this subject who have assured me that there will be absolutely no difficulty at all in this respect. The finance for part of this project will be provided by a body in the United Kingdom and the required amount has definitely been committed. I think the honourable member was wrong when he said that our appropriations will be on a triennial basis. I think that the appropriations will be made annually. However, the main thing is that the honourable member can rest assured that there will be no difficulty in the provision of finance for the part of the project which Australia is handling and the part of the project which the United Kingdom is handling.Question resolved in the affirmative.Bill read a second time.That the Bill be now read a second time.","Second Reading","ANGLO-AUSTRALIAN TELESCOPE AGREEMENT BILL 1970","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
226,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CREAN, Frank","JAG","Melbourne Ports","N/A","N/A",413,"- The Opposition supports this measure, which is an extension of the book bounty legislation which was before the House in September 1969. With some prescience on our part the Minister for Repatriation (Mr Holten), who was a back bencher at that stage, and I indicated during the course of the debate on that occasion that the amendment which is now being considered by the House might be necessary. The present proposal is to add to the list of books which are eligible for the payment of a bounty certain Commonwealth and State government publications which were excluded previously. Honourable members will recall that the purpose of the bounty is to encourage the publishing in Australia of books which are being published in countries such as Hong Kong, Singapore and, I think, Japan because it is cheaper to do so. The Australian publishing industry was in jeopardy because it was much cheaper to produce books in those countries.A rather curious anomaly exists whereby a duty is not imposed upon books as such because that would be regarded - and rightly so - as being a penalty upon knowledge, but we do impose a duty on paper and the other raw materials which are used in the printing of books. A book published in Australia is therefore at a disadvantage compared with a book produced somewhere else by reason of the fact that the cost of many components of the Australian product is inflated because of the duties which are imposed. These duties are escaped by publishers of books in other countries. It was felt that the disadvantage could be overcome by applying a bounty. In other words, a payment is made to the publisher in certain circumstances to enable him to publish books in Australia without being placed at the disadvantage of having to compete with a foreign product. I asked the Minister for Customs and Excise (Mr Chipp) some questions about the book industry. Unfortunately he is not with us today. He replied on 12th May stating:Before moving adjournment of the debate on the second reading of the Book Bounty Bill 1970-This bill was introduced in this House in May - - you asked me for some details of the nature of and value per annum of the books that arc printed for the States or the Commonwealth.The nature of the books involved are publications of a literature or educational character which qualify for book bounty and some details of books on which bounty has been refused because of Section 8 (2)-That refers to the Act as it stands - of the Book Bounty Act include textbooks and technical reports for the Papua and New Guinea Administration; text books for the Department of Education, Victoria; literary books for the Australian War Memorial Trustees; technical books for the State Electricity Board, Queensland; technical books for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation.In addition it is known that there are a number of other books for which no formal application for bounty has been made and in several of the abovementioned instances the publisher has indicated that because bounty was not payable, printing would possibly be done by lower cost overseas printers.No precise estimate is available for the value involved per annum but the industry indicates that this type of work represented about 10% of their output and on this basis the amount of bounty involved could be about $150,000 for 1969-70.I noted on the Estimates presented to the House on Tuesday that a sum of $1,600,000 is included this year as the likely outlay for the Book Bounty Act. This is a comparatively small sum in toto for the encouragement of what is a significant industry.During the last debate on this measure I think honourable members on both sides of the House quoted with approval from the booklet entitled Books are Different - A case prepared by the Printing and Allied Trades Employers Federation of Australia on behalf of the Federal Book Manufacturers Group. The foreword to this book states:This industry arose during the Second World War to meet the gap created by reduction of overseas supplies and Australias internal defence and civilian requirements and in later years developed to the point where it has manufactured about 25% of the books sold in Australia- <I wish we could get a similar kind of content arrangement for Australian television. I hope some day that that very serious matter also will be considered by this Government. The foreword continues: serving Australian based publishers with the production of books primarily written and published here for the local market.This is apt in regard to Australian television -Imported books, representing about 75% of the Australian market, are usually written and published overseas for world consumption. . . .Then the author goes on to list the great inroads that have occurred in Australian publishing because it was easier to send the matrices, or whatever they are, to Hong Kong or Singapore to have the books printed and then sell them much cheaper than would have been the case had they been produced in Australia. Figures are cited to show how book imports from Asia increased dramatically in the last 3 years. The value of books printed in Japan rose from $442,000 to $1,023,000. In regard to Hong Kong the value rose from $83,000 - almost a negligible amount - to $983,000 - almost $lm. This was to the detriment of the Australian publishing industry.I noticed that a few days ago the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Snedden) addressed a function called Pakprint 70. The title of his address was Horizons for the 70s. He described the very great importance to Australia of the printing industry and indicated the quite significant changes that had taken place in technology. To indicate the technical changes that are taking place in this field I shall quote from the Newsletter, volume 5 No. 2 for 1970 of International Business Machines. I think that many honourable members regularly get copies of the Newsletter which indicate some of the processes in the computer and other allied fields. The article from which I shall quote is headed Australias First Computer-produced Book Now on Sale and states:Australias first computer-produced and typeset book, the 2,184-page Kompass Register of Industry, is now being distributed.It lists the source of supply for 296,000 specific products available in Australia and gives details of 8,300 Australian companies.Data for the register was punched into cards from information supplied by the listed companies, stored on magnetic tape, and sorted into various categories by an IBM System/360 according to an international formula for Kompass registers.The Melbourne Data Centre undertook the job of writing the required programmes and of processing data entry and compilation.The first edition of Australian Kompass, which will be published annually, was only 15 months in preparation. lt is one of 14 international editions of the Swiss-based Kompass. The Australian publishers, Peter Isaacson Pty Limited, Melbourne hold the franchise for Australia and New Zealand from UK Kompass, and IPC subsidiary. They plan to produce the first New Zealand edition in 1972.Data preparation for the Australian edition created one of the largest data files yet handled by the Melbourne data centre.A Melbourne photosetting firm, ran the processed magnetic tape riles on four more computers to produce the final mag-tape for typesetting.The publishers laid down the several thousand feet of photographic output from the photosetter in page format and printed 7,000 copies of the 2,184-page book on their own web offset press.I hope that honourable members realise the immensity of the operation: 7,000 copies of a volume with 2,184 pages is an aggregate compilation of the magnitude of IS million pages. The article continues:All editions of Kompass include three main data groups.There are alphabetic indices in five languages to 31,000 different classes of products. For the Australian edition the publishers added 33C products unique to Australia or newly-marketed, ranging from abalone to pantyhose.That is certainly a wide variety. 1 have quoted this merely to indicate the great changes that are taking place in some industries. A sum as small as 51 .6m, wisely spent, may preserve this industry against the day when it is able to sustain itself by more and more operations of this kind. I am told that by reason of the quality of Australian labour in making magnetic tape for computers in Australia we have quite a distinct competitive advantage even against the United States of America. We are capable of working up an important export industry on the basis of Australian skills employed in making tapes to be fitted into computers in other parts of the world because Australian labour in relation to this skill is still cheaper than, say, in the United States or somewhere else, lt seems to me that this bounty, although it is applied directly to particular sorts of publications, is helping to preserve an industry that is likely to be on the verge of great technical change. Therefore, as we did on the previous occasion, we support this measure which has a relatively minor financial impact on the total Australian economy but which is significant in preserving an industry that is vital to Australias culture in this era of technological change.Mr WHITTORN(Balaclava) {3.10]- As the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) has said, this legislationthe Book Bounty Bill 1970- has had a very tortuous path. I know that he was prepared to speak on it in May of this year, as I was. Now, because we are working on Fridays, we have an opportunity to say a few words about this well deserved legislation. Its main purpose is to assist private enterprise printers in binding books competitively. As the honourable member for Melbourne Ports said, in September last year a 25% bounty was placed on books used by private enterprise but excluding books that would be sold to the Commonwealth and State governments and to instrumentalities of the Commonwealth and State governments. The Commonwealth Government was waiting for a Tariff Board inquiry regarding books that were produced for the Commonwealth and State governments. Most of us realise that State governments in particular and the Commonwealth Government to a lesser extent have imported too many books from overseas because they are cheaper to produce there.On 7 th May 1969 the Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr McEwen) indicated in a statement to the Parliament that this section of the printing industry - that is, the bookbinding section - was reaching a parlous situation and therefore the Government had a duty to do something about it. There was a significant loss of employment in the bookbinding section of the printing industry, and there were very good reasons for that I hope that before I sit down I will be able to give some of the reasons which are not within the power of the Australian GovernmentSo, in September -of last year the Government took the unprecedented step of bypassing the Special Advisory Authority - it did not refer the matter to the Special Advisory Authority, which is the normal procedure for this Government to take - and, after extensive investigation into the industry situation and careful consideration of other methods of assistance, it took this decision to introduce an interim bounty. Reference to that decision may be found at page 1547 of Hansard of 18th September last year. However, as I said earlier, certain books were excluded, namely, those that were supplied to the Commonwealth and State governments.Nine months later - that takes us to June this year - the indications are that the legislation introduced in September has been partially effective. In fact, it has resulted in some books being retained in Australia for production. It has caused some books, which were sent to Hong Kong for production before the bounty was introduced, to be recalled to Australia for local manufacture. It has not stopped much book work, particularly that in the multi-colour field, being placed overseas. It is this section of the industry that is still being hit, even with the assistance of a 25% bounty. It has not stopped books being imported at an increasing rate, particularly from Hong Kong - one of the main problem areas for local manufacturers.Despite the Book Bounty Act 1969 the latest figures indicate that books worth $2.8m will have been imported from Hong Kong in 1969-70, an increase of 54% in 12 months. The information I have before me was collated on 30th April 1970. The estimated total value of books imported into Australia in the same period is $43.6m, an increase of 13.5%. I can assure the House that printers in Australia would like to get even a small proportion of that production. A number of very good printing and book binding factories could be set up and a number of skilled artisans could be employed in this printing work if the books that are now imported were produced in Australia.In an effort to protect local book manufacturers who faced unfair competition from overseas - particularly from low cost Asian countries - the Government took the unprecedented step of legislating for a book bounty. One of the prime reasons for my speaking today on the bounty on books produced for private enterprise or for Commonwealth and State governments is that Australian artisans are still well behind overseas countries in the production of books printed in multi-colour. Australian printers get the black and white printing work but the work that is interesting to highly trained men - that is, the production of multi-colour books - will still go overseas simply because wages in Australia are so high for these artisans compared with wages paid for similar work overseas.Many honourable members will appreciate that over the years I have criticised the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission because of the tremendous wage rises it has given to the work force in Australia. In recent weeks I have been overseas. On my trip I found that my views are supported by the fact that artisans in the countries concerned receive between one-eighth and one-half of the wage paid to Australian workers in the same occupation. Overseas they are unionists, just as Australian printers belong to the trade union movement. It is obvious that the people who invest their money in the production of books will continue to go to the low cost countries with their work while the wage differential applies - and it seems that it will apply for a long time. In other words, so far as multi-colour work is concerned it seems that the book manufacturing industry in Australia must ultimately wither away.I believe that the Government cannot continue to increase bounties to compensate for the difference in wages and other costs as between South East Asian countries and Australia, which I will refer to later. There is a continuing demand for the production of black and white books in Australia and this demand should be maintained, but the colour work will continue to go overseas because of tremendous differentials in production costs and the fact that printing artisans overseas work a good many more hours in a week than their counterparts in Australia. One reason why the Government introduced the bounty is what is called the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation Florence Agreement. This Agreement necessitates that books shall enter countries without being subjected to tariff. As Australia adheres closely to the United Nations it has maintained the need to import books without tariff. I believe that the Australian printing industry could have produced a good proportion of the books to the value of $43 .6m imported into Australia in 1969-70. In that year there was a 13.5% increase in the value of books imported into Australia. This should provide good work for the Australian printing industry.It is fallacious for us to believe that we are doing the right thing by imposing duties on raw materials, such as paper, to protect our local industries and then allowing books into Australia duty free. Admittedly we now have a bounty for all types of books but this bounty has not prevented the flow of work to Hong Kong and Korea. While I was in South East Asia I learned that printing industries were being set up not only in Djakarta but also in Singapore to a greater extent and in Kuala Lumpur. This set of conditions will apply not only to the printing industry but to other industries as well. General Motors-Holdens Pty Ltd and the Ford company have already set up assembly and partial manufacturing plants in the 3 overseas centres I mentioned. Companies dealing in plastics, not only from Australia but from Japan and the United States of America, also are setting up plants in those areas. This problem which is connected with the bookbinding and the printing industry will become general as the years go by. The artisans in the overseas countries I mentioned are equally competent to carry out the work which is done in Australia. The facilities in overseas countries are as good as those in Australia. The weekly hours worked by overseas artisans is 57 compared to 40 in Australia.","Second Reading","BOOK BOUNTY BILL 1970","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

228,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"WHITTORN, Raymond","L0N","BALACLAVA, VICTORIA","N/A","N/A",416,"- We have a unique problem in Australia as far as this industry is concerned. The end products are admitted to this country duty free because we adhere to the decisions made by the United Nations. The materials used for manufacture in Australia are substantial and we have, as a protection for those materials, general and anti-dumping duties.Australian manufacturers in the bookbinding and printing industry have high labour costs. Sometimes these costs are as much as 8 times those which apply in Singapore and Hong Kong. Australian manufacturers have to bear a higher cost for their materials. Until September 1969 there was no protection at all. So this bounty of 25% does help the industry in a minor way. I have been told that Asian manufacturers can purchase their raw materials for as much as 60% below the cost of materials in Australia. 1 have already said that the Asian wage varies between one-eighth and one-half of the wage in Australia. Many workers in Asian countries work up to 57 hours a week. In reply to the interjection about the need for good unions in those countries, let me say, having been there 3 or 4 weeks ago, that they believe they do have very good unions. They believe that workers should work a reasonable time for a reasonable wage. They believe that this sort of thing should apply in this country. However, it does not seem to have very much relation to what takes place in Australia.Because of the additional costs which I referred to earlier either the bookbinding industry will wither on the vine or the Government will have to do more and still more to assist it. The industry itself realises that it has a special problem and that other forms of assistance such as those which are being granted in America could be a great help to it. America, of course, is a high cost country. The costs of labour and materials in that country are higher than those in Australia. America has found a way to comply with the UNESCO Florence Agreement. It does not have tariff barriers against books; but it does have other methods of protecting its bookbinding industry.I have in my hand a booklet entitled Books Are Different. I think the best way to demonstrate my point is to read the questions and answers as they are set out in the booklet. They read:Question: What other forms of assistance could be beneficial to the industry?Answer: A manufacturing clause arrangement similar to that which has applied for many years in the USA.The manufacturing clause of the USA Copyright Law states that to obtain copyright in the USA a book must be printed and bound from type set in the USA (i.e. from a process wholly performed in the USA). Certain concessions were made during the Universal Copyright convention in 19S4 and manufacturing restrictions were narrowed down to a single phrase that books in the English language, by American Authors or by French Authors resident or domiciled in the USA must be manufactured and printed from type set within the USA for copyright . . .This mechanism has enabled the US book manufacturing industry to develop and prosper in a protected field whilst abiding by the UNESCO Florence Agreement requirements that no tariff barriers be erected against book imports.I think that this Government will have to consider following the action taken by the United States Government if we want the bookbinding industry in Australia to be maintained. I believe that we should ensure that text books purchased by State governments for use in their educational systems and text books prescribed or recommended by State Education Departments should be printed in Australia. I do not think any honourable member on either side of the House would contest that view. The booklet continues:A large proportion of primary and secondary school recommended text books have always been imported (e.g. in South Australia 29 out of 62 books prescribed for primary school are imported) although these books would provide a sound basis for a strong viable Australian book manufacturing industry.The position has worsened in NSW, Victoria and South Australia because some Australian text books, previously printed here, are now being printed in Asia. The list for the 1969 school year will include many more for which orders have been placed. Often these are reprints of text books originally manufactured in Australia but newly recommended text books are also being ordered from Asia.Although the book manufacturers are in agreement that the Governments policy in following the UNESCO ideal of not imposing tariffs on book imports they consider that the intention of such an international policy was to ensure that copies of a book which is written, published and manufactred in say, UK, for world consumption should enter Australia duty free, but that it was neither intended, nor is it in the spirit of the agreement, that this should be used to permit the sub-contracting of book manufacture out of Australia for re-entry duty free. Under these circumstances the book manufacturers consider that a tariff or restriction on such farming out of manufacture would not conflict with Australias policy of following the UNESCO Florence AgreementSome fringe assistance could be provided by an increased preference in the postage rates for books printed in Australia. There is precedent of very long standing for a preferential rate of postage for Australian manufactured books. Many years ago this was of considerable value to the book manufacturing industry but, although the postal preference still exists, its degree of effectiveness has lessened to a point of little direct value.In effect I make a plea on behalf of the book binding section of the printing industry, particularly in relation to multicolour books, that the Government have a further look at the problems facing this section of the industry. It certainly is true that the 25% bounty has helped the industry considerably, particularly in relation to black and white work. So far as multi-colour work is concerned - this is the work that is of interest to the trained printing practitioners or the artisans - this is still being sent overseas for production for the reasons that 1 have mentioned. There are other reasons. The tremendous tariff protection that we give to Australian paper manufacturers makes it desirable for overseas people to buy their paper overseas, and they do so. They have a 60% advantage when they purchase their paper from overseas sources rather than in Australia. It is well known in the industry that Australian paper can be purchased in Hong Kong a good deal cheaper than it can be purchased in Australia. I believe that it is the responsibility of the Department of Trade and Industry and, to a lesser extent, the Department of Customs and Excise to have further investigations made into this problem because we will continue to put good Australians out of work if we maintain our present policies. I support the Bill, but I ask that the Ministers and departments concerned do a good deal more for this section of the industry than they have done in the past.Debate (on motion by Mr Giles) adjourned.","Second Reading","BOOK BOUNTY BILL 1970","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
