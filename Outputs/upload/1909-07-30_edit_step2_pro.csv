3,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"LYNE, William","KIN","Hume","N/A","N/A",1863,". - An article, written by some person connected with this House, has just been published by the South Australian Advertiser. In it my name occurs frequently, and most of the references to me are absolutely incorrect. I shall not refer to these passages in detail, but I refuse to allow misstatements to go uncontradicted. Whatever is written about me, the truth will, ultimately be known. The article is headed,,.  A Great Speaker, and begins in this way -It was at the time when every one was wondering what was going to happen after Lord Hopetoun had sent for the Premier of the senior State, Sir William Lyne, to form the first Federal Ministry that two men were waiting on the North Melbourne platform for the express to arrive from Adelaide. These two were Mr. Deakin and Sir George Turner, then Premier of Victoria.I believe that, so far, it is correct. Subsequently it is stated that certain things were said to the late Sir Frederick Holder, and that the gentlemen . who met him tried to dissuade him from promising to join me in the formation of the first Commonwealth Ministry. The statement as to the communication from Sir Frederick Holder to myself is not correct. It is absolutely untrue that he declined to join me. Although, when it was found that he could not be stopped at the North Melbourne railway station, Sir George Turner was sent after him to get him to promise not to join me, he agreed to join me, and we had a discussion in which we tried to arrange matters regarding the Tariff. He then came back from Sydney, to see two gentlemen in Victoria on my behalf, to get them to join with us. As he arrived on a holiday, they were out of town. I have little doubt that otherwise the Ministry, would have been formed. I do not wish to enter into small details, and did not intend for some time to come to publish the early history of (Federation, though I got the consent of the Marquis of Linlithgow, before he left Australia, to do so when a suitable occasion presented itself. I am forced to do so. by this article, which, it is said, was written by a very close friend of the Prime Minister. I shall not mention the name until I am positive that my information is correct.","N/A","PERSONAL EXPLANATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I regret very much that Mr. David Syme is not now living, because he took my part; but there is a gentleman in Melbourne now through whom everything was done, and others, including a Judge on the Bench in South Australia, who will be able to testify that my statement regarding the transactions of the time is correct.","N/A","PERSONAL EXPLANATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/speech[1]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I desire to review the great powers with which the people of the Commonwealth have endowed the banking corporations. In 1908 the banks of issue of Australia made a net profit of over £2,400,000 on a paid up capital of £18,000,000, or 13^ per cent. A financial man looking into those figures will see that the gross profits could not have been less than between £5,000,000 and £6,000,000. Those profits were made, not in the process of developing Australian industries or creating wealth, but in the process of enabling the producers and traders of the Commonwealth to exchange their property and products. The producers have had to pay to foreign banking corporations between £5,000,000 and £6,000,000 sterling for the right to exchange their own property and products, after furnishing the capital to those institutions. - In other words, gauging the gross profits, based on the net profits, the banks made £1 5s. per head of the whole population, and £2 13s. per breadwinner. Every man, woman, child, and infant in its cradle gave them a profit of 25s. per head for the right of exchanging his or her own property and products. The people of the Commonwealth furnish the banks with £46,526,971 of deposits not bearing interest, which the banks have the use of daily. Every man who has had a training in a bank knows that in the great cities that amount is paid over the counter_ fifty or a hundred times, but it is all back in the banks, at 3 oclock in the afternoon for balancing, to be loaned out again next day. The deposits bearing interest amount to £71,218,463, so that those corporations have the joy of having £n7>745>434 of the peoples money which they can utilize to make profits on their shares, yet they are not satisfied, but want to drag the last penny out of the producers and traders of the Commonwealth.","Postal Notes and Orders - Banking Charge","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I am simply showing what benefits the people are conferring upon these corporations, which, nevertheless, want to destroy the little currency that the poor working man has as a medium of exchange. The highwaymen of olden days could not have done a worse thing. I am sorry to think that I was trained in institutions which would be guilty of trying to destroy the peoples currency. Every time a man knows that he has to pay this charge he will write : - Dont send me a postal note, send a cheque, it is easier to negotiate. I have had many letters lately to that effect. Every cheque that one gives on any bank in Australia will be exchanged between the banks. In Melbourne the banks will exchange each others cheques. You can draw a cheque on one bank, and some one else may draw one on another bank, but there is no money taken out of either bank ; they simply liquidate obligations, like the great clearing house of, London, by offsetting indebtedness. I hope honorable members will understand that there is never any money used in proper banking. It is only the poor man that uses money. No rich man ever carries money. The whole of the exchanging is done by offsetting indebtedness, and that is what is called international or local exchange. To talk about money is good enough for outside people who do not understand the question. Many years ago the Rt. Hon. William Lidderdale, a governor of the Bank of England, told a gentleman, in my presence, that you could operate a bank without any gold if you used some other bank as a bank of exchange. The Commonwealth could operate a banking corporation without gold if it asked the Bank of New South Wales or the Commercial Bank to act as a bank of exchange for it, .letting that bank keep the gold. There is no need for honorable members to try to tell me about the business. I was reared as a child in it. I ask honorable members to study the question before they tackle it. I confess that I do not like moving the adjournment of the House, because I do not wish to take up time; but let me put another question. The banks pay taxes on about ,£4,000,000 of their note issue, but they issue £8,000,000. £4,000,000 of notes are in circulation, on which they pay -2 per cent., amounting to about ,-£80,000 a year. My object is to show the tremendous privileges that we bestow upon the banking corporations. Another £4,000,000 of their notes lie in their branch banks as reserves, which they can utilize whenever they want to. Those reserve notes are the capital of the branch banks, and enable the institutions to take the whole of the gold away from their branches and operate in the big cities with it. I wanted to see if Australian banking was run in the same way as American banking, and I find that there is no difference in the basis. While the banks do not make a large profit on the circulation of their notes on which they pay the States 2 per cent., yet they make an immense profit on the notes which are not circulated.","Postal Notes and Orders - Banking Charge","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I do not want any more money, so honorable members need not bother themselves about that. I am simply pointing out that the people of Australia are to-day living in a fools paradise so far as finance is concerned. They are running into debt year after year, and making no provision to repay. Australia in that sense is a  neerdowell, and it worries me. Every man to whom I speak says, Oh, the public works, if they were sold, would pay the whole debt. What nonsense that is ! I shall have something to say about it on the Budget. The number of postal notes paid during 1908 was as follows : - New South Wales, 2,700,000; Victoria, 2,091,119; Queensland, 500,000 ; South Australia, 421,783; Western Australia, 349,877; andTasmania, 454,410, or a total of 6,517,189 postal notes cashed for the whole Commonwealth.","Postal Notes and Orders - Banking Charge","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

67,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"OMALLEY, King","K5D","N/A","N/A","N/A",1868,"- I d id not bother to ascertain the value, because the banks propose to charge id. per note. If they took the value as the basis I should not mind so much. With regard to money orders, New South Wales cashed last year 630,000 ; Victoria, 318,365 ; Queensland, 165,000 ; South Australia, 81,115; West Australia, 136,595; and Tasmania, 66,537, or a total of 1,397,612 money orders cashed for the whole Commonwealth. Adding the two together gives a total of 7,914,801 postal notes and money orders. A charge of id. on each of these means that the banks are grabbing £32,978 from the people of Australia - from the poor. That is to come out of the pockets of people away in the backblocks. The small note will pay as much as the big one. The poor man if he owes money and has a postal note, pays it with that. note. He never goes to cash it himself. The poor man would not be poor if he were trained in finance. Not being trained, he goes to another man who is trained,, and gives him a profit for looking after his affairs. No man ever made money by working ; men make money only by learning how to gather the profits of the work of others. As the honorable member for Maranoa pointed out on Wednesday, the banks are now issuing to customers postal notes that have been used for the purpose for which they were originally issued by the Department. Many of these are being sent to Tattersalls. They are being used over and over again, but the Postal and Telegraph Department receives nothing in respect of them, save the fee charged on them when they were first issued. Is it right that such a practice should be allowed to continue at a time when the Treasurer does not know where to look for money for defence purposes, the payment of old-age pensions, and various other matters necessary to a progressive community? Although we have £24,000,000 of gold in the Commonwealth, the gold actually in circulation is only about £5,000.000. The banks are allowed to have the use of enormous gold reserves on which they do not pay a penny. It is true that as soon as they put their notes in circulation, they have to pay a duty upon them, but bank notes, after all. only represent gold reserves. In this age of progress very little money is required for trading purposes. The great medium of exchange is not money, but fructifying indebtedness, or reinforced credits. Banks issue their credits in exchange for the credits of producers and traders, and these become transferable media of exchange, until they are finally redeemed by cancellation. We have a banking aristocracy which is a world unto itself. The people who are able to regulate the movements of the money volume - who are able to regulate the operation of the credit volume - have the power to raise or lower prices whenever it suits twenty or thirty of them to do so. They can by their operations affect the value of every property in the Commonwealth, and it is amazing to me that an intelligent House like this is not prepared to seriously discuss these financial questions. It will be little short of an act of Divine Providence that will cause the House to discuss the financial question free from political partisanship and sectional bigotry. It is impossible to. accurately estimate the total loss of revenue resulting from the system to which I object. But if we were to introduce tomorrow a system that would make the Standard Oil Company pay a tax amounting to £32,000 per annum - and the revenue of that Trust is nearly three times as great as is that of the Commonwealth - Mr. Rockefeller would hurry to New York, and devise a scheme bv which that loss would be transferred from the Trust to the Commonwealth. The banking corporations are the prototype of Mr. Rockefeller, and if they are going to tax the people to the extent of £32,978 per annum, by this charge on postal notes, the Commonwealth will have to bear the loss in the shape of a depreciated revenue.","Postal Notes and Orders - Banking Charge","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

76,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"WYNNE, Agar","L1R","Balaclava","N/A","N/A",1869,". - I have one or two suggestions to offer the Government, with a view to a settlement of this difficulty. This tax affects not so much the large traders as those who are in a small way of business. There are many tradespeople carrying on business in a small way, who receive three, four, or five postal notes every day, and a tax of1d. per note, when the face value of that note is only 2s. fid. is a fairly heavy one. When speaking yesterday to a couple of bankers, I inquired why this charge was insisted upon. They replied that some of the large trading firms and companies pay into their banks as many as two hundred or three hundred notes per day. The receiving teller has to check each of these notes before he can pass the pay-in slip, and whilst he is doing so a large number of customers are kept waiting at the counter, and are seriously inconvenienced. I was informed by these gentlemen that in many cases there was a post-office between the trading companys warehouse and the bank with which they did business, but that their officers passed the post-office and paid the notes into the banks. The desire of the banking institutions is to induce traders to collect the amount of the notes received by them at the local post-offices, and one suggestion I would make is that there is no reason why a trader should not be able to hand in his two hundred or three hundred postal notes per day to the nearest post-office, and receive in return a cheque for the full amount, which he could then pay into his banking account. If that cannot be done, the Postmaster-General might arrange for these notes to be cleared by an officer of the Department at the clearing house. Then he could pay in the balance at the end. of the day, or at the end of the week. Another arrangement, which I am sure would be acceptable to the bank, would be one under which five or six postal notes would be received free of charge - because it is not much trouble to a bank clerk to have to add up four or five amounts - the man who paid in 200 or 300, keeping other customers waiting, having to pay for the inconvenience he caused. If a man pays in £200 in notes, nothing is charged for collection, because the notes are legal tender, and the tellers do not have to enter them separately. Postal notes, however, are for various sums, and have to be entered separately. If the Postmaster-General would enter into negotiations with the banks, a settlement could be arrived at, and the banks would be prevented from . making the large profits spoken of bv the honorable member for Darwin. Those with whom I discussed the matter yesterday told me that they do not wish to make a profit, but that they wish to prevent a loss If an arrangement is not made with the banks, persons will begin to draw cheques for1s., 2s., and other small amounts. Hitherto the practice has been not to draw cheques for sums of less than £1. If cheques are substituted for postal notes, the State will gain in stamp duty, and the Commonwealth will lose.","Postal Notes and Orders - Banking Charge","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Government should not allow either a corporation or an individual to interfere with its privileges.

Only those who, like the honorable member for Darwin, have studied matters of finance, know how far-reaching in its influence the action of the banks will be, though, of course, no estimate can be verv accurate. I was delighted to hear of the large increase in the issue of postal notes, but if the practice which has been objected to is allowed to continue next year, there will be a falling off,- and we cannot afford to lose a penny of revenue. I object to any interference with the currency of the Commonwealth. There is no probability of the House, as at present constituted, establishing a bank on the lines proposed by the honorable member for Darwin, but whatever may be the views of honorable members regarding a national banking system, it is their duty to safeguard the currency.","Postal Notes and Orders - Banking Charge","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

One would expect in a debate of this kind to hear those who have been connected with financial concerns for many years, and who must know something of banking usages. We have the chairman of the Employers Federation here, and he is associated with large moneyed interests in the country. Why is he not taking the floor on a question of the kind, and helping to assert the rights of the common people as against the great banking institutions? Then there is the honorable member for Parkes, than whom no one is better qualified! to inform us, associated as he has been for many years with all sorts of boards of control in financial concerns.

They ought, however, to remember that they do not come to this House as the representatives of their own interests or the institutions with which they are connected, but as representatives of the people who are affected by such actions as that contemplated by the banks. In the Melbourne Age of the 8th of this month, the following appeared -The report noted the success achieved by the deputation from the Employers Federation to the Postmaster-General, protesting against the extreme telephone charges imposed by the Labour Government, and which resulted in the appointment of two expert accountants to go into the financial side of the question, while, for the present, subscribers remain under the old terms and conditions.That shows that the Employers Federation, with, the moneyed interests behind it, is exerting pressure on the present Government. In the same report we are told that the Postmaster-General, after listening to the representations made to him regarding the very matter under consideration by the secretary of the Associated Banks, and representatives of other institutions - said the explanation given showed the subject in a new light altogether. He did not, in view of the representations now made, intend to take any further action, unless the Chamber of Commerce or some other traders association made further complaint.Is it not a ridiculous attitude for a Minister to take up, that he should, when asked to conserve the rights of the people, take his instruction from the secretary of the. Associated Banks and from the Employers Federation? I had no desire to take part in this debate ; but I think we are indebted to the honorable member for Darwin for bringing the subject up. That honorable member is one of the few who make an earnest attempt to deal with financial questions which affect the people. I do not pretend! to have any great qualification to speak on the subject, but, as a young man who is endeavouring to learn something about these great problems which I know vitally affect the people, I feel, as I say, that I am deeply indebted to the honorable member for Darwin for placing such proposals before us from time to time with the view to conserving the interests of the rank and file, as against those of the great financial institutions - the money bags of Australia. Notwithstanding the fact that, on a capitalized value of about £18,000,000, the banks had a profit of £2,400,000 last year, they are not satisfied, but desire now to impose a tax on the postal notes and post-office orders of the poorer classes, to the amount of nea.rly £33,000 per annum.

If we had a Commonwealth bank, there would be no talk of a charge of the kind. The banks, having obtained this £250,000 per annum from the small traders for keeping their accounts, now go a step further and make a charge on postal notes and post-office orders, with the effect of placing another £33,000 in their already overfilled coffers. If we sit down and permit this, what will be the next step? The banks have it within their power to extend credits and limit credits, and by that means to tighten or loosen the money market which in turn largely influences the prices of property, lands, and commodities, and thereby increase or decrease the purchasing power of wages. We hear a lot said about arbitration and other industrial Courts raising the value of commodities, and we are told that, on account of the Tariff, £1 will buy only as much now as 16s. would ten years ago; but, from my study of the question, the expansion and contraction of credit has much more to do with decreasing the purchasing value of money than has the action of the Courts. There is a district in New South Wales which was brought under my particular notice, where a couple of years ago there was a boom in business, and land values were high. The banks, however, called in their overdrafts, and compelled those who had land to pay up, with the result that there was a drop in values, and the district is now one of the worst in New South Wales. This, I say, was owing to the action of the banks in limiting credit. The time at my disposal has expired. I can only hope the Government will take action to safeguard postal notes and orders against taxation by the great banks of Australia.","Postal Notes and Orders - Banking Charge","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/continue[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I desire to compliment the honorable member for Darwin, who, under cover of the motion, has presented to the House, in a sort of axiomatic manner, a knowledge of banking science, for which, probably, many members did not give him credit. I take the liberty of saying to members of the Labour party that, judging from certain scholastic training I had in my earlier life, the honorable member is absolutely sound in the ideas he has expressed this morning; and honorable members on this side, who have practical experience, cannot dispute his contentions, more particularly those in relation to banking corporations. We have also to thank the honorable member for Balaclava, who admitted the weakness of the banks position, and suggested how it should be altered. His suggestions were those of a shrewd business man. He realizes that the banking people have bitten off more than they can chew ; and, speaking from his experience, he has advised them to back down under cover as quickly as possible. But the matter has gone a little too far for us to allow them to take cover under the honorable members wise advice and suggestions. Personally, I thank him for his keenness and shrewdness. His speech was an acknowledgment that the banks have, gone beyond their functions, and apparently he has pointed out to them the dangerous path that they are now treading. This debate has drawn attention to a neglected power of the Commonwealth under the Constitution - the power to pass banking legislation for the whole of Australia. The banking corporations, by their greed and avarice, in trying to get a poundage on. postal notes, have really awakened this Parliament to the necessity for introducing banking legislation, and so exercising a power which has lain dormant too long. Some honorable members say that the honorable member for Darwin puts the subject in a humorous manner; but it is one of that honorable members characteristics to illuminate his addresses by a certain amount of personality. Certain other honorable members are so intensely respectable and dignified that I believe they would play the Dead March, and palm it off as a wedding march. They try to pass through the . world as knowledgeable men by clothing themselves with a serious air, and a mien of ultra-respectability, to conceal their lack of knowledge.","Postal Notes and Orders - Banking Charge","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If the honorable member for Darwin wrapped himself up in the air of a bank official, walked slowly to the table, joined the digits of each hand, and took a quarter of an hour over each argument, he would probably pass for a serious and well-advised man like the honorable member for Parkes. The question before us is the invasion by the banks of the functions of the Commonwealth Parliament. To show the importance of it. I would draw attention to the general use of postal notes in the daily life of the Commonwealth. In 1 901 there were issued in the . whole Commonwealth 3,516,908 postal notes of a value of £1,293,039. In 1907, the most recent year for which complete returns are available, 6,077,237 postal notes were issued, of a value of £2,271,155. There was, therefore, in six years an increase both in volume and value of nearly too per cent. In New South Wales, to show what a ready medium of exchange they have been made by the people, the total number of postal notes issued in 1906 was 2,161,069odd, of a value of about £808,759. By T907 the number had grown to 2,436,085 of a value of £887,105. These figures show to what extent the interests of a large section of the public are involved. The notes are a public convenience. The honorable member for Wentworth pleaded that the banking authorities had a lot of trouble with regard to the matter, and that it involved a great deal of clerical work. He forgot to point out that the banking institutions are presented with the use of ; a number of facilities at the cost of the Commonwealth, without any charge for them. Take the circulation of cheques as an instance. If the Commonwealth wished to begin reprisals upon the banks, a ready means to hand would be to treat all cheques going through the post as registered letters. If the banking officials are going to fight the Commonwealth for the sake of £[33,000, and lessen the value of a public convenience, they will be met with reprisals like that which the honorable member for Darwin said that skilled financiers in the Old World resorted to. If the Postmaster-General desires to regain any ground in this matter, I make the suggestion to him to treat cheques passing through the post as registered letters. The Post Office is becoming a larger and larger concern, and it is performing banking business in the interests of the general public. The growth in the number of postal notes is an evidence that that work is valued, and taken advantage of by the community. The honorable member for Wentworth, when he argues that :we are only fighting on behalf of people in a large way of business, does not go far enough, because the class of people who use postal notes is mainly the industrial class, and by far the larger proportion of the notes are for amounts of £1 and under. In many parts of Australia they are not even conveyed to a bank, but are passed from hand to hand like bank notes as an ordinary medium of exchange. The difficulty in the way of making them an actual medium of exchange is that certain clerical work with regard to signing them would have to be got over ; but that could be done. The bank officials, who are generally well advised! and shrewd, have overstepped the mark on this occasion. I am not surprised that the bank managers, who simply work on routine lines, knowing their banking science and insolvency laws, but not knowing the world beyond, should have recommended this step ; but I am surprised that the bank directors, who are men of the world, did not see that they were arousing the dormant power of the Commonwealth to establish a national bank. This discussion has done a lot of good. When banking legislation is brought before the House, the banks will undoubtedly ask for many conveniences and facilities, and. out. of the mouths of those who have been silent today, there will proceed many respectable and heavy speeches in the interests of the banking corporations. No attempt will be made in those addresses to depart from stereotyped phrases. They will be uttered slowly, and will sound well. Commonplace generalities will take the place of originality, and because they are spoken slowly, an opportunity will be given to the reporters to record them, and to the House to accept the instructions which they will be intended to convey. But one happy feature of this debate is the evidence that the Labour party, or any other advanced party, will now give more attention to the immediate necessity of introducing banking legislation. I believe the shrewd suggestion of the honorable member for Balaclava will be acted upon to-morrow morning by the - banking authorities. He has simply said :  Get cover as quickly as you can, boys; the lions are roused. You have gone too far ; it is not worth the risk; stronger measures will follow. I am surprised that the Postmaster-General has. not already made a suggestion similar to that of the honorable member for Balaclava. When legislation is introduced honorable members will be found to be much more versed in the higher branches of banking science than other people think. Because a man betrays his individuality and makes his points in a characteristic manner, it does not follow that he is ill-informed on these questions. I admit that the banks have a perfect right under the present system of private enterprise to do the best they can for themselves. I do not blame them, but I do blame the authority which allows them to impose a fresh tax upon one of the conveniences of the people, when they have already a large number of facilities given to them free. Let them demand their pound of flesh if they like. They have a perfect right, as a business concern, to make a charge to meet expenses for clerical labour. I do not ask them to be charity-mongers or philanthropic institutions ; but I do say, as a representative of the public, that the Commonwealth must wake up, and, in turn, make its proper charges upon the banks for the free facilities which it now gives them. It will be a fair go, and the question will not stop here. I do not suppose it can be done during the life pf this Parliament, but I hope that whatever Government is in power in the next Parliament will be forced to bring in banking legislation, and that the outcome will be the utilization of our postal service to form the nucleus of a national bank.","Postal Notes and Orders - Banking Charge","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

So far no Minister has taken any interest in the debate. I look upon this as one of the most serious problems that the Postmaster-General has to face. I suppose, as there are no chambers of commerce, or chambers of manufactures, or banking institutions on this side to wait upon theTreasurer or Postmaster-General, no notice is taken of what we say - simply because the masses, and not the classes, are affected.","Postal Notes and Orders - Banking Charge","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Nine-tenths of my constituents use the postal note service. Hardly a mail comes from Queensland in which I am not asked to induce the Postmaster-General to afford facilities for getting postal notes. To people living in the bush a postal note is practically currency. No one can bear me out more strongly than can the honorable member for Darling Downs, because the same thing happens in his district. The Postal Department in Queensland) gives, every possible facility to people to get postal notes, and the Deputy Postmaster-General in that State has, since he went there, opened more offices for the sale of postal notes than have existed before. He is increasing the facilities for that purpose every year, and postal notes are practically becoming the currency in Western Queensland. People in far back portions of that State find it easier to obtain goods from Brisbane and to send postal notes in payment for them than to obtain their supplies from the nearest town ; it is easier to forward postal notes through the post-office to Brisbane business houses. They, now find that on every postal note which they use for the payment of services rendered, or goods supplied, they are to be penalized by the banks to the extent of1d. This question is of great interest to the people generally; and particularly to those who reside in the back places of Australia. If there is one section of the community to whom my heart goes out more than to any other, it is that section which resides in the back-blocks of the different States, for I have lived in such places, and know the disadvantages under which they labour. If it is possible for the Postmaster-General to make their lot a little easier than it is, I hope that he will do so, and I am sure that any such attempt on his part will receive the cordial assistance of his colleagues. It is imperatively necessary that action should be taken at once. Notice has already been issued by the banks that the charge is to be levied as from1st proximo, and I ask the Treasurer, in the absence of the Postmaster-General, to take this matter in hand without further delay. If the banks are not prepared to accede to our request, I am satisfied that the Government will be able, within twenty-four hours of its introduction, to pass a Bill that will give effect to our desire.","Postal Notes and Orders - Banking Charge","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Their contention is that there is more trouble involved in entering up a post-office order than there is in entering an ordinary cheque. I dare say that the average amount of the cheques that are drawn by customers of banking institutions in Victoria is considerably over £5, whereas the average in respect of postal notes is probably 5s., or even less. A great deal of work is involved in dealing with these small notes.","Postal Notes and Orders - Banking Charge","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The question that has been raised by the honorable member for Darwin is of great importance to those who live in country districts. For some time in Tasmania this charge on postal notes has been in force, and the unionism of the banks has gone beyond that which is reasonable. Year after year they have gone on piling up new charges, and it would appear that with them it is a case of unionism run mad.","Postal Notes and Orders - Banking Charge","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[11]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The  speeches made by the honorable member for Balaclava - who is an able financier - the honorable member for Dalley, and others, show that they have devoted much study to this problem, and I hope that action will be taken by the Government without delay, Already I have had letters from people with . whom I had business dealings, Saying,  In future send us one of your own cheques instead of a postal note, because we have now to pay one penny on every postal note that we pay into our banking account. This means that, even in the case of a cheque for 5s., I have to add sixpence exchange. Representatives of country districts should consider for a moment how this charge by the banks will affect them. The storekeeper pays the postal notes that he has received from his customers into his banking account, and in this way the banks are collecting a very large revenue. The revenue of the Commonwealth will also suffer, because, owing to the introduction of this system, people will naturally demand to be paid by cheque instead of postal notes. The banks did away with the Inter-State exchange on banknotes as the result of the policy speech delivered at Gympie by the late Treasurer, who said that he proposed to provide for a Commonwealth note issue. I regret that the honorable gentleman did not at once bring down a financial scheme in accordance with that which I proposed, and which was adopted by the Brisbane Labour Conference. My scheme provided for a national system of banking, including a Commonwealth note issue, gold reserves, and the redemption of the note issue in both gold and in consols, at the will of the Comptroller-General of the currency. I made up my mind that we should have such a scheme that half-a-dozen banks would not be able to corner the Government as the Government of the United States was cornered after the resumption of specie payment in 1879. The Government of the United States had then to hire a corporation of banks to float gold bonds. I remember the incident well, for some of my own people were in the deal. It seems that every one desires to get at the Government. I know that the Treasurer- will do that which he promises to do. I have every confidence in him. He has been an explorer, and we know what an explorer can do when he enters the financial world. I deeply regret that the Postmaster-General has declared that, having listened to the views of the Secretary to the Associated Banks, he did not intend to take further action.

154,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"GROOM, Littleton","KFK","Darling Downs","Protectionist","Minister of External Affairs",1878,". - I move -That this Bill be now read a second time.Honorable members are invited to give their attention to a very important question, which seriously affects the welfare of the Commonwealth, and is part of a still greater problem lying before Australia. One has only to turn to the map, and see how unpeopled our northern lands are, to realize the obligation upon us. We have to hold and maintain this country as a part of the British Empire, and to so develop its resources that it shall become an important part of the Empire, peopled by a white race, preserving the highest standards of the civilization of which we are so proud. To-day we have to consider, not the development of the whole of the northern part of Australia, including vast and fertile areas in Queensland and Western Australia, but only the development of what is known as the Northern Territory of South Australia. That Territory is important by reason of its area alone. It contains 523,620 square miles, or 335,116,800 acres, so that it is nearly one-sixth of the total area, of the Continent, and equals in size France, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, and Italy put together.It possesses a coastline of 1,300 miles, off which lie large islands. It is watered by magnificent navigable rivers, such as the Victoria, the Daly, the Adelaide, the Alligator, the Liverpool, the Goyder, the Roper, and the McArthur. Although much of its land may. not equal the best in other parts of Australia, it possesses rich, fertile coastal districts, suitable for agriculture, and, inland, large pastoral areas and extensive and valuable mineral deposits. Yet its population last year was only 2,973 persons, of whom 1,081 were Europeans, and 1,892 men of other races, exclusive of the aboriginal population, whose conditions are dealt with in the memorandum circulated. This population has been decreasing year by year, and one of the questions we have to face is how to get it to increase. Hitherto the Territory has been governed by South Australia, but that State is finding the burden more than it can bear. We are obliged to consider the position of the Territory from the point of view of defence also. How does the Territory lie in its geographical relations with the rest of Australia and the countries of the East? A few figures, giving distances by sea routes, will help honorable members to realize the facts. The distance from Port Darwin to Thursday Island is 730 miles; to Fremantle, 2,092 miles; to Brisbane, 2,160 miles; to Sydney, 2,634 miles; to Melbourne, 3,210 miles by the east coast route, and 3,952 miles by the west coast route ; and to Adelaide, 3,453 miles by the west coast route and 3,709 miles by the east coast route. From Port Darwin to Amboina. in the Dutch East Indies, is 580 miles; to Sandakan, in Borneo, 1,440 miles; to Batavia, in Java, 1,705 miles; to Manila, in the Philippines, 1,872 miles; to Singapore, 1,902 miles; to Hong Kong, 2,350 miles; and to Colombo, 3,253 miles. Thus Port Darwin is nearer to Hong Kong than it is to Sydney. Representatives of Western Australia have complained that thai State, is as difficult of access from the eastern States as is New Zealand ; all communication having to be carried on by sea. Port Darwin is similarly situated. We have there large and valuable areas of country, which are much more easily reached from other parts of the world than from the populous centres of the Commonwealth. For the sake of defence alone, it is important that our communications with it should be improved. On this matter, the opinion of Major J. Bevan Edwards, C.B., at one time commanding the troops in China and Hong Kong, is of value, though it was written twenty years ago. He says -No general defence of Australia can be undertaken unless its distant parts are connected with the more populous Colonies in the south-east of the Continent. If an enemy was established in either Western Australia or at Port Darwin, you would be powerless to act against him. Their isolation is, therefore, a menace to the rest of Australia. . . . The interests of the whole Continent, therefore, demand that the railways to connect Port Darwin and Western Australia with the other Colonies should be made as soon as possible.A former Governor of South Australia, Sir George Le Hunte, has also spoken of the harbor at Palmerston in these words -The harbor is a very fine one - deep, well sheltered, and capable of being easily defended. Its position with regard to the Eastern Archipelago and the great Asiatic trading centres ought to make it a very important commercial port in the future, while from its strategic position it might prove a very valuable base in the event of developments which may, and in the course of time, are nearly certain to, take place amongst the Powers in the East. There is, in my opinion, every reason why Australia should appreciate and safeguard one of its most important, positions.

We have in the north a rich, fertile country, practically isolated; and no matter what means of communication may be determined in the future, that Territory, as it is to-day, especially in relation to other nations, is a menace to the Commonwealth. Honorable members will realize that there is only one means by which we can hold the Territory, and that is by having there a settled population - not a population settled merely on the coast, but, if we are to retain the Territory permanently as a portion of the Commonwealth and of the Empire, there must be a large population settled on the interior lands also. The remark of President Roosevelt, in reference to Australia, is, I think, as applicable to-day as when he made it. He said -Beware of Keeping your north empty ; and remember that an unmanned nation invites disaster.The position of the Northern Territory is exactly that described by President Roosevelt ; we are in possession of this Territory, and, at the present time, it is unmanned. The problem which Australia has to face, whether the Commonwealth takes over the Territory or not, is how we can alter the present state of affairs. At present we have possession of the Territory ; that is, we can say that we have actual possession, and that it is occupied from the point of view of international law. But when we observe the growth of population in other countries, and see there the overcrowding and desire to occupy fresh territories, a desire proceeding from laws of nature which we must recognise - it becomes increasingly pressing on us as a people to remember that, if we are to justify our title, the only way we can do that is by effective occupation. Effective occupation does not mean merely placing a Customs official at a port and flying the flag; to my mind, it means permanent occupation by a people who are applying their energies and industry to developing the resources of the country, not only in their own interests, but in the interests of the community as a whole. These are the problems which lie before us. South Australia, for a period of forty-six years, has had the responsibility of this Territory; and I think that that State is entitled to a meed of praise for having kept the British flag flying over that great portion of the Commonwealth. If South Australia had failed to recognise her Imperial obligations - if she had so neglected her duty as to leave this, as it were, a no-mans land - the problem might have been even more serious. But for the benefit of Australia as a whole, as it ultimately proved - though probably selfish considerations may have actuated some of her citizens - South Australia has resolutely faced the position all these years, and tried to do her best-","Second Reading","NORTHERN TERRITORY ACCEPTANCE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

At that time, the Queensland border did not extend so far west as it does today; it was in 1862, by an Order in Council, that the Queensland borders were extended on the west up to the present border of the Northern Territory. The question of dealing with the Northern Territory was discussed at the time. About 1863 there was considerable stir in South Australia by reports that were presented by the great explorer, McDougall Stuart, who had traversed the continent, and made reports as to the richness of the land which he had seen. Mr. A. C. Gregory, another explorer, had also been across the Territory; and he, and all acquainted with the facts, spoke highly of this portion of the continent. Some correspondence between the Colonial Office and the Governments of Queensland and South Australia took place in regard to the disposition of the Northern Territory; and the request of Queensland was not that it should be attached to that State - it was felt that Queensland had enough territory to develop but that it should be annexed by South Australia. The South Australian Government asked for the annexation, and in the year 1863 the annexation was made.","Second Reading","NORTHERN TERRITORY ACCEPTANCE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

That request was refused by the Imperial authorities, but, as we know, under the Constitution Act, the Northern Territory was incorporated as part of the province of South Australia. Therefore, South Australia has power to deal with the Territory - to surrender or dispose of it, just in the same way as New South Wales, Victoria, or Queensland may deal with any portion of its territory.

183,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"GROOM, Littleton","KFK","N/A","N/A","N/A",1882,"- I was putting the question - What has South Australia done on behalf of the Territory? She has made attempts at land legislation, of which some of the earlier ones certainly landed her in disaster. She also undertook large, public works, one of which in particular was not only a boon to South Australia, but a distinct national advantage. I refer to her action in undertaking solely out of her own financial resources the construction of the overland telegraph line. That work has been of infinite value to all the States. It gave them their first communication by cable with the great markets of the world. It was a distinct business advantage to Australia, although South Australia undertook the enterprise on her own account. The construction of the line had to be made through a large and practically unexplored territory. The responsibility had to be undertaken of bringing all the material through that area, and to take upon herself the risk of the line not paying. That work alone ought to stand for all time to the credit of Sir Charles Todd, who completed it when others had partially, if not wholly, failed. It cost South Australia no less than £603,959. Three-fifths of the line runs through the Northern Territory. In addition, South Australia constructed the Palmerston to Pine Creek railway, and made harbor works and jetties in connexion with it, which cost her a capital expenditure of £1,184,612. A series of attempts were made to settle the country by making costly surveys, in order to get a proper conception of its pastoral resources. Exploring parties were equipped and sent out prospecting parties. Money was expended in sinking wells, and in various other ways attempts were made to induce settlement in the North. These works landed the State in continual expenditure, which left a series of accumulated deficits year after year, until to-day she bears upon her shoulders the burden of a total expenditure in connexion with the Territory of £3,327,983. It will therefore be seen that by her efforts, supplemented by the establishment of experimental stations to indicate the line upon which agricultural development should take place, and by doing her best to encourage pastoral settlement, South Australia has made some serious attempts to solve this great problem.","Second Reading","NORTHERN TERRITORY ACCEPTANCE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[15]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

185,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"GROOM, Littleton","KFK","N/A","N/A","N/A",1882,"- No. The argument why we should take it is that as South Australia has hitherto been bearing what is really a national obligation, the time has come for transferring to the whole community of Australia a burden too great for the small population of the State. From a national stand-point the question of the settlement of the North must be faced. The Commonwealth as a whole must realize its position. I have already referred to the necessity for taking the Territory from the defence stand-point. The defence authorities of the Commonwealth concur in the opinion expressed by Major-General Edwards, and affirm that no defence of Australia would be complete unless Port Darwin is defended. South Australia has undoubtedly made mistakes, and it is quite possible that something more than has been done might have been done. But the question whether South Australia has done her duty or not is apart altogether from the national question which now has to be faced. The question is not what South Australia has not done, but what the Commonwealth of Australia is going to do. When Federation was accomplished, the late Sir Frederick Holder, who was then Premier of South Australia, wrote on 18th April, 190.1, to Sir Edmund Barton, then Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, offering to transfer the Territory to the Commonwealth. He did this, not under the authority of Parliament, but in his capacity as head of the Executive, realizing that whatever was done would be subject to parliamentary ratification or rejection. In making the offer, he said : -I may mention that, had South Australia been willing to have given carle blanche to capitalists to introduce coloured labour into the Territory a sum of money estimated at about ^10,000,000 would have been forthcoming to establish a chartered company to take over the Territory, with its assets and liabilities to South Australia, and to carry out the construction of the remaining portion of the overland railway. This offer was declined by the South Australian Government in its own interest and in the interests of Australia.The Commonwealth Parliament discussed the matter, and in September, 1902, thisHouse, on the motion of the late Mr. Solomon, passed the following resolution : -That in the opinion of this House it is advisable that the complete control and jurisdiction over the Northern Territory of South Australia be acquired by the Commonwealth upon just terms.Therefore, this House has already by resolution affirmed the desirability of acquiring the Territory. South Australia passed, in 1902, a Trans-continental Railway Act, authorizing the construction of the line upon land grant terms, and the previous offer was withdrawn. When that Act was passed, certain offers were made, with which I need not deal. Subsequently the late Mr. Price became Premier of the State. He submitted to the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth certain resolutions passed bv his Parliament on December 7th, 1905, authorizing the transfer of the Territory to the Commonwealth on the following conditions : -Payment of the total amount expended by South Australia- in connexion with the settlement and administration of the Territory up to the date of its transfer.That the Commonwealth Government agrees to construct the transcontinental line from the southern boundary to the present terminus at Pine Creek.That the line of route of the proposed railway shall be from the terminus of the railway at the South Australian boundary to the terminus of the northern section of the line at Fine Creek, and within one hundred miles east or west of the present overland telegraph line.That the work of construction of the rail way shall be commenced by the South Australian Government from Oodnadatta, and by the Commonwealth Government from Pine Creek end, within twelve months of the passing of the necessary Acts by the State and Commonwealth Parliaments, and the approval of the transfer by the Imperial Parliament.Negotiations took place, the details of which I need not mention, and ultimately it was agreed between the Premier of South Australia and the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth that the Territory should be surrendered to the Commonwealth upon the terms of the agreement which are the schedule to the Bill that is now before the House. I shall go through those terms briefly and explain them. In the first place, the Territory and all the State property and assets in the Territory, are to be transferred to the Commonwealth. - In return, the Commonwealth undertakes to be responsible for the indebtedness of the State in respect of the Territory, as from the date of acceptance, by annually reimbursing the State interest on the loans, and by paying annually into a sinking fund the amount which the State is at present liable to pay into a sinking fund, and also redeeming or paying the loans as they fall due. The Commonwealth undertakes to pay the deficit account which now exists on the Territory. It also covenants to cause a railway to be constructed from Port Darwin southward to the northern boundary of South Australia proper. It agrees to acquire the railway running from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta, and to construct a railway line northwards from some point on that line to connect with the other portion of what is described as the transcontinental railway. It agrees to pay the State the indebtedness on the Oodnadatta to Port Augusta line by becoming responsible for the interest and for the loans. The State, on its part, covenants tq give the Commonwealth all the necessary powers to construct those lines, and to give consent to the construction of the railway from Port Augusta through the South Australian territory towards the Kalgoorlie Perth extension. These, generally speaking, were the terms of the agreement. If honorable members will bear with me, I shall now go through the agreement in a little detail. In the first place the State has undertaken to transfer and surrender to the Commonwealth the Northern Territory. What does that Territory mean to us as a Commonwealth? From the point of view of its natural wealth, let us take the last returns - those for the year 1907. Its imports in that year were valued at £78,996, and its exports at £345,721. The leading exports were gold, wolfram, copper, tin ore, silver, pearl shell, cattle, horses, hides and tallow. Up to date the total mineral wealth won from the Territory amounts to £2,565,578. It has increasing stock returns. To-day its wealth in that direction amounts to about 400,000 cattle, 20,000 horses, and 44,232 sheep. I mention those figures simply to give honorable members some idea of the latent resources of this great portion of the continent. I do not wish to go in detail into the opinions which have been expressed about the Territory. In the memorandum which has been circulated, honorable members will find the views of men who have been long resident in the Territory, and have had considerable experience of it. Those will give them some idea of its agricultural, pastoral, and mineral resources, but I feel in duty bound to submit to the House a few opinions of practical men. The Honorable J. Langdon Parsons, who for a long time administered the Territory, and also resided in it, says -These Northern Territory lands have been by some much over-praised, by others much under depreciated. In such a vast expanse of Australian country there are stony wastes, rolling sandhills, spinifex .thickets, waterless regions, rocky and sterile ranges. But there are also wide undulating downs, broad well-grassed plains, rich alluvial flats, and on the north coast large navigable rivers.Captain Barclay, F.R.G.S., who has resided in the north for many years, divides the Territory into three districts, namely, coastal, northern, and southern, and writes -Fully one-third of the Northern Territory is first-class pastoral country, admirably suited for sheep. Northward from the Jervois range a great tableland stretches for hundreds of miles. The southern limit is 2,500 feet above the sea; thence it gradually falls until it meets the coastal ranges bordering the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Indian Ocean. Owing to the elevation above the sea, the climate is perfect, and there seems no reason why agriculture should not flourish, the rainfall gradually increasing over vast plains of rich soil, from about 10 inches in the MacDonnell Range to 45 inches at Pine Creek and 62 inches at Port Darwin.Then again Mr. Winnecke, another explorer, reported -My experience of the Northern Territory extends over 35 years. I have been astounded at the frequent mention of desert country. My experience is that some of the finest pastoral country in the world is to be found in Central Australia. Water, principally artesian, is more abundant than supposed. . . .Another, who has had great experience in the north, Mr. Giles, says -From the northern base of the MacDonnell Range to the west range (Hann) is a distance of 70 miles, the whole of which is magnificently grassed, although timbered thickly in places by mulga (acacia). At 25 miles from the MacDonnell Range are rolling downs thickly grassed and equal in richness of soil to any in South Australia, being inundated plains of rich black and red soils, fit for the growth of wheat. This excellent country extends east and west for considerable distances, also to the north-east and north-west.Mr. John Costello, of Lake Nash, in giving evidence before the Royal Commission, said -There is a large area of country from Newcastle Waters and the head of the Roper to the Queensland border at Cammoweal. This magnificent belt of country known as the tableland may be said to be the cream of the pastoral land of the Territory. I have the fullest and greatest faith in the future of squatting in it. I have travelled over most sheep raising country in Queensland, and I can safely say that in no part of that Colony have I seen country better adapted for wool growing than this splendid tableland.

193,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"GROOM, Littleton","KFK","N/A","N/A","N/A",1885,"- I am quoting from the general evidence given by him in respect to the Northern Territory. Mr. David Lindsay, than whom no one has a better knowledge of the Territory, and who those who have met him will admit, may be relied upon to give a judgment based on experience in summing up the whole position in regard to the Territory, says -Thus we have a country capable of supporting hundreds of thousands of cattle and horses and millions of sheep; extensive agricultural areas which will produce sugar, rice, coffee, cotton, and nearly all other tropical and sub-tropical products necessary for our use ; and the wonderful mineral wealth of gold, silver, tin, and copper, all combined, will make the somewhat despised Northern Territory of vast importance, and place it in the front rank of the Australian States.By glancing at the map which I have caused to be exhibited in the Chamber, honorable members will obtain an idea of the extent of the area, concerning which these opinions have been expressed by practical men. The areas at present occupied under lease are coloured pink on the map, and perhaps at this stage it may be well to give honorable members some figures as to the actual occupation. The total area of the Northern Territory is 335.1.16,800 acres, and of that only 473,809 acres - coloured green on the map - have been alienated in fee-simple. There are 99,740,068 acres held under pastoral and other leases, whilst under annual leases and permits, 16,563,840 acres are occupied. We have thus a total occupation, under leasehold or permits, of 116,777,717 acres, leaving a balance of 218,339,083 acres still untouched. Honorable members will find in the memorandum I have circulated a complete list of the lands held under lease. The leases extend over periods ranging up to forty-two years; but a portion of the time of some of them has already expired. In dealing with the problem of the occupation and settlement of the Northern Territory, the question that will confront us in regard to the large areas, totalling 99,740.068 acres, held under the long leases, is a serious one.","Second Reading","NORTHERN TERRITORY ACCEPTANCE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[20]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

As regards part of the Victoria River country, the most recent official reports give 15 to 20 head of cattle per square mile as the stock-carrying capacity. As regards the possibilities of agriculture, the Government Resident points out that this year settlers are beginning to go in for mixed farming, a change which he looks upon as most promising. The officer in charge of the botanical station considers the Territory suited for such productions as maize, tobacco, rice, palms, fibre plants, arrowroot, spices, sugar, rubber, and tropical fruits. His experiments with upland rice have been so satisfactory that he is confident that the crop will be as valuable to the Northern Territory as the wheat crop is now to South Australia. Sisal hemp has also been grown successfully, and is beginning to be planted for commercial purposes. He looks for a great future from it. With regard to the mineral resources of the Territory, let me read the opinions of experts, who speak very highly of its possibilities. The Rev. J. Tenison Woods says -I confidently assert that the Northern Territory is exceptionally rich in minerals, only a small part of which has been made known to the public. I do not believe that the same quantity of minerals, veins of gold, silver, tin, copper and lead, will be found in any equal area in Australia. In fact, I doubt if in many provinces will be found any country so singularly and exceptionally favoured as Arnheims Land is, in respect to mineral riches.In the opinion of Mr. Brown, the Government Geologist, one of the most competent and careful men we have in Australia - the present gold mining field is capable of much further development. They are only working on the surface now. There is a good deal of country for prospecting in the neighbourhood of the existing gold-fields. . . A good proportion of the best mining country is still open.Professor Tate says -The development of the mineral resources of the Northern Territory is but in its infancy, and I believe that rich stanniferous lodes will yet be found. Rich auriferous lodes abound over a large tract of country. It is my honest conviction the gold reefs can be worked profitably and to a considerable depth.Mr. Parkes, the Inspector of Mines, declaresI have no hesitation in saying that the Northern Territory is phenomenally rich in minerals, but more especially in gold and tin.Judge Herbert says -I am convinced from what I have seen, that no part of Australia can show tin lodes to the same number and extent as the Northern Territory, though in particular instances, such as Mr Bischoff, they may be richer. . . The Northern Territory may be emphatically pronounced to be a tin country.On Monday last the South Australian Government received a telegram from Mr. Brown, the Government Geologist, reporting a very important discovery of gold in the Northern Territory, at a place about 400 miles south of the Victoria River, and at no great distance from the border of Western Australia. In regard to this, Mr. Brown telegraphed -I am of opinion that this gold discovery is an important one, and that the rich stone found on the surface and in the lodes will continue in depth, and can be followed down by proper prospecting. The rock formation of the district examined bv Mr. Murray and myself, and noted above, is typical auriferous country. Altogether the prospects are sufficiently good to warrant every arrangement By the Government in well sinking, as the want of water is the greatest drawback to development and prospecting generally.There is a report from the Minister of the Northern Territory, in which the same mine is also referred to. I do not say that the land of the Northern Territory is uniformly of first class quality, and that droughts do not periodically occur there, as elsewhere in Australia. But those who. consider the matter impartially, will be forced to the conclusion that we have there, unoccupied and uncultivated, some of the finest land in Australia. In the southern part, artesian water is to be obtained, and elsewhere sub-artesian water, while there are larger rivers, so that water conservation, on a large scale will be possible. But it will mean the expenditure of capital, . and require the presence of population to make it profitable. The Northern Territory is certainly not a, desert, but has not our experience been that, that country which is despised to-day is sought after to-morrow? Had Victoria refused to make railways into the Mallee districts, she would to-day be much less prosperous than she is. We are every year acquiring a better knowledge of our natural conditions and a better understanding of the laws of production. This knowledge will be increased by the efforts of the Federal Bureau of Agriculture, and we believe that much of the land which is now de,spised will ultimately become very productive. But, judging the Northern Territory in the light of our knowledge of to-day, we can say that it is capable of carrying a population greater than that of the Commonwealth at the present time. As to its climatic conditions, a special report from the Commonwealth Meteorologist is embodied in the Government memorandum. He says -It will be noticed by reference to the figures, that while temperatures are hotter in Australia during the summer months, yet the annual range is considerably in excess of that of more equatorial latitude, and, consequently, from this. point of view, is more endurable for the permanent white settlement, year in and year out, than is either Ceylon or the Malay Peninsula. The humidity and wet bulb results give also a like verdict. Tropical heat, when associated with high relative humidity, is muggy and oppressive, has an enervating effect, physical and mental action is considerably reduced or becomes even impossible ; these conditions undoubtedly exist in the northern parts of the Territory for nearly six months of the year. The winter months in this area, however, enjoy a climate which should render mental and physical effort distinctly possible, if not enjoyable, by reason of the dryness and comparatively cool nights. Notwithstanding the high temperature, the general dryness of the interior should cause the expenditure of energy to be possible all the year round, and the climate should not have a deteriorating effect upon a white population. This fact lias been demonstrated in Western Queensland, South Australia, the northern parts of Victoria, and the western districts of N-ew South Wales, where temperature records in excess of those experienced in Central Australia have been registered by many degrees.Captain Barclay, F.R.G.S., who has lived there for years, says -It is true the climate is tropical, but, at the same time, it is, without doubt, the healthiest tropical climate in the world. Experience has amply proved that settlers from Northern Europe can live, work, and thrive, even in the town of Palmerston on the shores of Port Darwin. Many instances can be pointed to where three generations lived, strong and healthy, two having been born within its limits; whilst the average children about the streets are at least as rosy and chubby as any in the Commonwealth.I frankly admit that there are contrary opinions, and these are set out fairly in the memorandum. But experience has shown that the northern districts of Queensland can carry a white population, and that the legislation which was passed with a view to promoting white settlement there has been successful. It must be remembered that the climatic conditions of the Northern Territory vary considerably. On the coast, the climate is humid, but inland it is drier and cooler. Emphatically, the Northern Territory is a white mans country. In return for the surrender of this Territory, and all the State property, what does the Commonwealth undertake? I will take the covenants in the order in which they appear in the agreement. The Commonwealth, in clause (1) (a), covenants with the State of South Australia to become responsible for the State indebtedness in respect to this Territory. The loans outstanding, on the 30th June, 1908, amounted to £2, 768.062, less £16,169 unexpended; and a sum to the credit of the sinking fund amounting to £26,132. Deducting this total of £42,301, the indebtedness comes to £2,725,761. In addition, we undertake to be responsible for accrued deficits amounting to £602,222 ; the total obligation being, therefore, £3>327»983-","Second Reading","NORTHERN TERRITORY ACCEPTANCE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[28]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

As difficulties in building such a line wholly within the Territory were foreseen, they appear to have been willing that it should run partly through Queensland territory.

I never hinted at such a thought; on the contrary, I think the honorable member will admit that I have fought continuously and strenuously for the rights of Western Australia, as I know the Treasurer also has. The honorable member must realize that when we are dealing with national problems, it is better not to suggest that this or that State may reap particular benefits. So far as Australia is concerned, we want both lines. If this railway is constructed, South Australia will get from it exactly the same communication with the north as other States can have under the agreement. The agreement has no clause preventing other States from being connected with the line. South Australia will get no more benefit than any other State. If the trade naturally flows to South Australia, she will get it. If it naturally flows from the Northern Territory to Queensland, Queensland will get it. South Australia, before handing over the Territory, practically says :  We are giving up absolutely our right to determine where the route shall be. We could have built the line, and then, perhaps, handed theTerritory over with an increased debt. Instead of that, we leave it to the Federal Parliament to build the line as it thinks fit. All we ask is that the route shall be decided in such a way that we shall get the communication with the north that historical associations and geographical relations entitle us to have. I have dealt with the Commonwealth obligation, so far as the liability upon that line is concerned. The total capital liability on the Port Augusta railway will be £2,242,342. In addition to that, there is a sum of £29,292 in connexion with the construction account, and the annual interest amounts to £84,088. The line shows a surplus of £12,000 in earnings. We shall be liable, then, on this for a deficit of £77,694, made up by deducting earnings and adding sinking fund contribution. This is the liability we are under in respect of this part of the agreement. If we take over these railways . we shall have to continue running them, and we must give the State running rights over them, and also the right to connect with them, but, beyond that, we have no obligations. On the other hand, the State undertakes to give the necessary permission to -enable us to survey and construct the lines, and also to acquire the necessary lands. In addition, it covenants to give consent to the construction df the Western Australian railway through its territory. One other matter respecting the liability connected with the overland telegraph line, must be mentioned. In the keeping of its accounts, it has been debited to South Australia alone, and not to the Northern Territory. We have made an arrangement with South Australia, to be carried out under this Bill,, by which we agree to compensate the State for so much of the line as runs through the Northern Territory, as transferred property. In that way we put it exactly upon the same footing as all other transferred properties taken over by the Commonwealth.","Second Reading","NORTHERN TERRITORY ACCEPTANCE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[49]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In addition to that, we become liable tor the loan amounts which I have already stated. There are two points in which we criticise the Act which the South Australian Government has passed. Section 7 seems to us to impose a restriction upon our power to deal with the lands in the Territory. The South Australian Government have promised to amend that section if our Act is passed in its present form. We contend that if the Commonwealth takes over the whole Territory, we should be free and untrammelled in dealing with the lands as we think fit. That condition is set out by us in clause 10 of our Bill. We shall recognise all estates and interests which are held at the time of transfer, but we reserve to ourselves full power to deal with them as we think fit.

With regard to future development, Australia has to face the position that, whether the Territory is to be developed by South Australia or the Commonwealth, it will necessitate the expenditure of large sums of money. That is inevitable. We have to decide whether we shall face the question of the settlement of the Territory seriously or not. My hope is that the Commonwealth will do it. It will be, of course, for this Parliament to decide its own policy in that regard if it takes the Territory over. One thing is clear, that if the Territory is to be developed, the backbone of any policy to secure its settlement must be railway construction. Side by side with railway construction there will have to be) an immigration policy, and an exceedingly liberal land policy, by which people can acquire land on the easiest possible terms. There will also have to be liberal mining legislation to assist in the development of the mines, and the people will have to be prepared for measures providing for advances to assist agriculturists and other settlers to occupy the land. There will have to be. generous assistance in the shape of experimental farms to test the possibilities of the soil, and to give instruction and help to those who are prepared to undertake this great work. Every encouragement will have to be given by Parliament to assist pastoralists and others to market their produce, and to discover new markets for them. Water supply and conservation will have to be undertaken on a large scale. Those may, or may not, be matters of proper State action ; but my own opinion is that this Parliament will have to adopt them, if it proposes to approach the question seriously. We can no longer stand idly by and see the small population of the Territory getting smaller every year. We must regard it as a national obligation to do all that we can to develop, not only this, but all the other portions of northern Australia.","Second Reading","NORTHERN TERRITORY ACCEPTANCE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I may explain in a few words its object. In the early days of Federation, Sir George Turner, when Treasurer of the Commonwealth, instituted! the practice of remitting to London almost simultaneously with an order for works or supplies being placed there, the moneys which had been appropriated for the year in respect of them. That practice has been continued up to the present time, so that work may be paid for as soon as it is completed. One of the reasons for the introduction of this system was that the Treasurer did not wish to be called upon to remit payments to London at short notice, and because it was desired that money appropriated for expenditure abroad should be so expended during the year in which it was appropriated. In some instances, however, the whole of the moneys so transmitted to England have not been paid to the contractors by the end of the year in respect of which they were voted. Balances have remained in the hands of the London Agency, but have been treated in the public accounts as if they had been expended within the year for which they were voted, although they were not actually paid over until some time after the close of the year. The Auditor-General has demurred to this procedure, and has said that balances so remaining at the end of the financial years should have been taken into account in the distribution of our surplus revenue among the States.","N/A","AUDIT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

353,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"LYNE, William","KIN","N/A","N/A","N/A",1895,"- I was telling the plain unvarnished truth. So far as I remember, when I was Treasurer, there was never an objection raised to cross-headings. I remember one occasion on which an honorable member sent down a speech which was very nicely improved, and somewhat altered in phraseology. I remember it well, because the speech was brought to me. ThePrime Minister himself is the chief member in this Chamber to improve his speeches, and also to cross-head them. That has never been objected to. He is noted for improving his speeches after delivery. I have seen his speeches published with cross headings on many occasions. I saw one to-day in which the cross-headings were certainly no less objectionable than those which the right honorable member for Swan has quoted. I can see no objection to cross-headings, so long as their substance is in the speech itself. If they contained entirely new matter, very strong and reasonable objection might be taken to them; but there should be no objection, either to emphasizing matter in larger type, or to inserting cross-headings pertinent to matter contained in the speech. Honorable members have a great deal of expenses in various ways. They are not all wealthy men, and cannot afford to pay large sums to outside printing firms for reproducing their speeches. Hansard is set up for members, and for distribution by members. It is stereotyped by the Government Printer, and it does not matter how many copies he rolls off. Especially in view of the action of the press in refusing to publish the utterances of certain honorable members, .Hansard is the only means by which the majority of honorable members can reach their electors. If they are prepared to pay the extra cost for cross headings, which do not go beyond the speech itself, the Government Printer loses nothing, the Government lose nothing, the country loses nothing, and honorable members have an opportunity of placing before their constituents speeches which otherwise they could not afford to print and circulate. Every convenience should be given to honorable members to let their electors and the public generally know what happens in this Parliament. I shall shortly move for the establishment of a daily Hansard. I have all the particulars of Committees that have sat in other States, and my object in moving in that direction is that the electors may know what takes place in this Parliament. They cannot learn it at present from the press. The Treasurer, if he looks at his own speeches, will find that he stands at the head of all honorable members in altering and embellishing speeches, and putting cross-headings to them. If honorable members were debarred to-morrow from making use of Hansard, the right honorable member could go to the most expensive printing establishments and pay them to do the work. The cost would be a bagatelle to him; but other honorable members are not in the same fortunate position. The Treasurer and the Ministry should be the last to restrict the rights of honorable members, or to prevent the electors from knowing what goes on in this House. They should rather be the first to give honorable members all the facilities possible for distributing their speeches cheaply and effectively.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[3]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
