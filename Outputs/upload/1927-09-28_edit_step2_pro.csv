The Duchess and I are deeply grateful for your generous words, and I will not fail to convey to the King, my Father, the expressions of duty and loyalty to the Crown and Person of the Sovereign which it contains. The King and Queen retain the most vivid recollections of their visit to Australia when, as your Address recalls, he opened the first Federal Parliament 26 years ago.It is a source of the greatest pride to me that I should have been commissioned by the King to open the first meeting of the Commonwealth Parliament at Canberra, and thereby to inaugurate the new Capital City. The Duchess and I rejoice to have been associated with the people of the Commonwealth on this great and historic occasion. We shall always remember our visit to Australia, and to-days culminating event as one of the proudest and happiest memories of our lives.We pray that our present tour, and especially the ceremony of to-day, performed, as it has been, in the presence of representatives of various parts of the Empire, may be the means of drawing still closer the ties of loyalty, kinship, and affection, which bind together all members of the British Commonwealth.Albert. 9th May,1927.","N/A","ADDRESS TO THE DUKE OF YORK","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

He was appointed Second Clerk Assistant on the 1st May, 1901, and in July of that year was promoted Clerk Assistant.

He had become a familiar figure to us all, and,I feel sure, was generally regarded as a guide, philosopher and friend, who never failed, when asked, to assist in the unravelling of intricate questions of parliamentary procedure. To new members, particularly, the assistance which Mr. Gale was always ready to give was extremely valuable. There are few men who have occupied a seat in this House who have not owed to him a deep debt of gratitude in this regard. It is with profound sorrow that, at our meeting to-day, we miss his once familiar figure from its customary place. It was a great gratification to him that he was able to take his place at the table at the inaugural meeting of the Parliament at Canberra in May last, his ambition to be in the service of the Parliament at the time of its removal to the permanent capital of the Commonwealth being very strong. The motion will commend itself to every honorable member. We shall keep very dear the memory of Mr. Gale. We held him in great admiration as a parliamentary official, and also as a public servant of the best type. I feel sure that honorable members, would wish to tender their deepest sympathy to Mrs. Gale and to the family of the deceased officer.","N/A","DEATH OF THE CLERK","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In seconding the motion, I associate myself with the remarks which have been made by you, Mr. Speaker, and the right honorable the Prime Minister. Mr. Gale was a trusted officer of this House, and always rendered excellent service. He was held in the highest esteem by every honorable member. He had the goodwill not only of honorable members, but also of every official of the Parliament. As the Prime Minister has said, the loss of such a valuable public servant is a severe one. I, in common with the majority of honorable members, was indebted to him on many occasions for the advice that he was able to give me out of his extensive store of constitutional knowledge and parliamentary procedure. I join in the expression of regret at his sudden death, and trust that it will be of some consolation to his widow and family to learn of the high esteem in which he was held by those who were brought into contact with him.","N/A","DEATH OF THE CLERK","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I have met his widow and family since his death, and I can assure honorable members that it is of great comfort to them to have received from honorable members thoughtful messages of sympathy and to know that he was so universally esteemed.

From the inception of Federation, Mr. Gale was not only an officer of this House, but also a friend of every honorable member who entered it. He regarded every member as his charge. His knowledge of parliamentary procedure was profound. It will be difficult indeed to fill his .place. He was an outstanding figure in the chamber, and a guide and a friend to his fellow officers. In every way it can truly be said that he was one of Natures gentlemen.Mr. HUGHES (North Sydney) (3.19]. - I would add my tribute to the memory of Mr. Gale, and associate myself with what has been said by the Right Honorable the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, and the honorable members for Wannon and Newcastle. I knew Mr. Gale very well. As the honorable member for Newcastle has said, Mr. Gale was associated with this Parliament from its inception, and was the guide, philosopher, and friend of all who entered it. For many years I was his fellow clubman, and proud to call him my friend. He devoted his life and great talents to the service of his country, and was happy in the manner of his death, for he passed away among the surroundings in which he had spent his active life. The Commonwealth lias lost a loyal and zealous servant, and we a good friend and wise counsellor; one from whom every member could seek advice with the absolute assurance that this would be given without party bias. His knowledge was wide and thorough. None questioned his authority on parliamentary procedure or his sincerity. And now he, who was for over a quarter of a century a figure so familiar to us all that he seemed an integral part of the National Parliament, has. gone, and we are left to carry on as best we may without his aid. His memory, however, will live. I join in extending to his widow and family heartfelt sympathy, and I feel sure that the words that have fallen from the lips of honorable members to-day will be treasured by those whom he has left behind.","N/A","DEATH OF THE CLERK","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It has been truly said of him that not only was he an efficient officer, but also the guide, counsellor, and friend of every occupant of the Speakers chair, and of every individual member of the House. Whenever an honorable member approached Mr. Gale for advice in connexion with the procedure of the House his assistance was most cheerfully given. I know of no man who had a more kindly disposition, a more tender heart, or greater solicitude for the welfare of honorable members and the staff of the House. I deeply regret his loss to this Parliament, and also to the country, of which he was so valued a citizen.","N/A","DEATH OF THE CLERK","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Mr. Gale met the obligations of his office with marked ability and courtesy, and a high sense of duty. He had a thorough knowledge of the law and customs of Parliament, and he most readily placed that knowledge at the command of honorable members and his fellow officers. The smoothness of the proceedings of the House was often due to his advice. He had the highest respect for the dignity of Parliament, and was jealous of its high traditions. Personally he was of the kindest disposition. He was thoughtful of others and most considerate in his relation with his fellow officers. He was particularly loyal in his friendships. It has been said  There is nothing that can be taken in exchange for a faithful friend - and his excellency is beyond price. Mr. Gale has left behind him a record of service which will be an inspiration to his successors. May it be a true consolation to his widow and family to know how highly his services to the Commonwealth are appreciated.Question resolved in the affirmative, honorable members standing in their places.","N/A","DEATH OF THE CLERK","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[6]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This is so especially in regard to entrance doors and passage ways, which are more numerous than we have been accustomed to. In order to avoid confusion, I propose, with the concurrence of honorable members, to adopt the following practice in the taking of divisions : - When the bells are rung, the corner doors will be closed, tout the other doors will be left open. This means that honorable members will be able to enter the chamber not only by the main door from Kings Hall, but also by the doors immediately behind me, and those leading from their party rooms. The rule when the House is in division will be that the tellers will record the names of only those honorable members who are within the line of the back row of seats. For division purposes the passage ways round the chamber will be regarded as being outside its limits. I feel sure that these arrangements will commend themselves to honorable members, and I ask their assistance in giving effect to them.","N/A","PROCEDURE FOR TAKING DIVISIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Delay in its delivery has been inevitable owing to the transfer of the Seat of Government to Canberra, which has prevented Parliament from sitting in the earlier months of the new financial year.The budget is based on a great achievement in co-operation. That achievement is expressed in the financial agreement between the Commonwealth and the States which provides for united action in the redemption of Australian public debt and the common management of future borrowing. This real combination of the financial interests and policies of all the Governments ofAustralia can be regarded as the coping-stone of our continuous efforts for securing co-operation in national activities.The consequent re-adjustment of Commonwealth finances is reflected in the figures now submitted. The method of presentation of accounts adopted last year, which had bean made necessary by the continually extending co-operation of the Commonwealth and State Governments, enables the effect of this readjustment to be readily seen.To enable the details of the budget to be understood, I shall first briefly describe the terms of theagreement.That the first item in the Estimates under Division I. - The Parliament - namely, The President, £1,300, be agreed to.","N/A","BUDGET, 1927-28","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

259,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"PRATTEN, Herbert","K1J","Martin","NAT","Minister for Trade and Customs",58,". - I move -That the schedule to the Customs Tariff 1921-1926 bo further amended as hereunder set out, and that on and after the twenty-ninth day of September, One thousand nine hundred and twenty-seven, at 9 oclock in the forenoon, reckoned according to standard time in the Territory for the Seat of Government, duties of Customs be collected in pursuance of the Customs Tariff as so amended.That, excepting by mutual agreement, or until after six months notice has been given to the Government of the Dominion of New Zealand, nothing in this resolution shall affect any goods the produce or manufacture of the Dominion of New Zealand entering the Commonwealth of Australia from the Dominion of New Zealand.N/AHonorable members will recollect that in connexion with the scheme for road development throughout the Commonwealth, duties on petrol, chassis and rubber tyres were submitted to the House in July, 1926, by which it was anticipated that additional revenue to the amount of £1,500,000 would be collected during the then financial year and would form portion of the Commonwealths financial contribution to the scheme. At that time the Premiers of certain States contended that their Governments would not agree to the scheme; so it was not deemed necessary to raise the full £1,500,000, and consequently the proposed extra duties on tyres and chassis were withdrawn. At that time it was anticipated that the extra 2d. a gallon on petrol would yield a revenue of £983,000, that the increase of 2£ per cent, on chassis and parts would yield £270,000, and that the extra 6d. a lb. and 15 per cent, on rubber tyres and tubes would yield £308,000. Since the action taken by this Parliament last year, when the proposed duties on chassis and tyres were withdrawn, in view of the total of £1,500,000 not then being required, the position has materially changed, in that all the States have agreed to participate in the scheme. To conform with the policy of the Government, the agreement necessitates the raising of an additional sum of nearly £500,000 this financial year. It is proposed, therefore, to increase the rates of duty on motor chassis under the intermediate and foreign tariff schedules only by an additional 5 per cent, on unassembled, and 7-J per cent, on assembled chassis. This will make the unassembled chassis free under British preferential tariff, but dutiable at 12^ per cent. under the intermediate tariff, and at 17i} per cent, under the general tariff. The rates on assembled chassis will be 5 per cent, under British preferential tariff, 20 per cent, under intermediate tariff, and 25 per cent, under the general tariff. The motor chassis imported into Australia for the year ended 30th June, 1927, were valued at approximately £12,250,000, of which £7,500,000 represented chassis from the United States of America. Chassis imported from the United Kingdom were valued at approximately £3,000,000; those from Canada at £1,000,000; and those from other countries at approximately £500,000. It will, therefore, be seen that, had the increased duties now proposed been in operation last year, they would have affected imports to the value of about £9,000,000, and yielded a revenue of about £550,000. For various reasons it is not expected that the figures estimated for last year will be reached during the coming year. It is probable that the twelve months ended 30th June last, represented the peak year so far as the importation into Australia of motor cars and chassis is concerned. Moreover, seeing that it is not proposed to increase the duties «n British chassis, the Government hopes that the increased duties under the foreign tariff will result in a certain amount of the trade now done with theUnited States of America being transferred to Britain. Whatever happens, the duty on petrol, together with the extra duty now proposed on foreign chassis, will, it is hoped, total the full amount of £1,500,000, to which reference has already been made. The estimates and the statement before the House have been carefully framed. Although made primarily for revenue purposes, and in accordance with the promise of the Government as outlined in the Prime Ministers policy speech, the action now proposed will, it is hoped, be a further step towards the realization of that interEmpire economic development that is so desirable in the interests of all the members of the British Commonwealth of nations, and will tend to reduce the unfavorable trade balance with the United States of America. Honorable members will notice also that an increased margin is given to those persons who assemble imported chassis in Australia, and thus provide employment in Australia. The scheme of road improvement, which is now being carried out in co-operation with the States, must commend itself to all sections of the community, for the reason that it will assist to develop the assets of the Commonwealth. Land transportation in Australia in the future will undoubtedly be carried out chiefly by motor vehicles. This is the motor age. For the motor traffic of the future we must have suitable roads The new duties now proposed will enable us to raise the revenue necessary to meet the Commonwealths obligations under the agreement already entered into with the States. The proposal before the House is in accordance with the publicly announced policy of the Government which. I submit, has been endorsed by the electors. It should be remembered that the making of roads provides a considerable amount of employment and that the whole of the money expended will circulate and be retained in the Commonwealth. Honorable members will recollect that there are already two tariff resolutions on the table of the House which, though not yet passed, are in operation. This resolution forms a part of the budget proposals and will operate from tomorrow morning.The House has to-day paid a warm tribute to the memory of one who was, perhaps, its most valued officer. May t be permitted, at this my first opportunity, to express my personal regret, the regret of the Government, and I am sure of every honorable member, at the untimely death of the late Comptroller-General of Customs, Mr. R.

In the prime of life, when his services were of the greatest value to the Commonwealth, he was unexpectedly cut off. His probity honour, and integrity were unquestioned, his ability unrivalled. Mr. Oakley had the confidence of the Government and, I believe, of every member of this House as well as of the business community with which he had to deal. His place cannot easily be filled. As Minister I appreciated his worth as well as his loyalty. His passing is a great personal loss.

The amount to be appropriated by the bill, as honorable members will notice by a perusal of the papers before them, is £4,069,925, made up as follows: - £1,486,500 for departments and services other than business undertakings and Territories of the Commonwealth; £1,S22,720 for business undertakings; £60,705 for Territories of the Commonwealth; £200,000 for refunds of revenue; £500,000 for Advance to Treasurer. The bill is based on the estimates of expenditure for the financial year 1927-2S, but no new services are included. Provision is made to cover the pay-day which falls on the 2nd December. The sum of £3,369,925 is provided for in this bill to meet the ordinary services of departments. This amount is less than one-sixth of the total amount of £20, 202, 60S which has been provided for these services in the Estimates of 1927-28, and, added to the provision of £4,S51,495 in Supply Bill No. 1, makes a total of £S,221,420. This amount of £8,221,420 compares with five-twelfths of the total provided for the present financial .year, which is £8,41.7,790, and is less also than five-twelfths of the appropriation for 1926-27, which amounted to £S,247,095. In addition to the amount of £3,369,925, provision is made for refunds of revenue to the extent of £200,000, and Advance to the Treasurer £500,000. As honorable members are aware, the advance to the Treasurer is to meet unforeseen requirements and also to carry on works in progress at the 30th June last. These will subsequently be covered by an appropriation for additions, new works, and buildings for 1927- 2S, which, I hope, honorable members will soon have an opportunity of discussing. It is desirable that the bill should be passed as soon as possible, as it is necessary to cover the first pay-day in October.","Second Reading","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2) 1927-28","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It may be urged in connexion with the particular bill under consideration that that course was impossible, in that the parliamentary machinery had to be removed from Melbourne to Canberra, and Parliament could not have met sooner than it has done. However, I have heard nothing up to the present time as to what arrangements are to be made for the future. Obviously, if the Parliament is not to meet in the winter months, there should be some explanation to guide honorable members in regard to future financial arrangements. If we are not to meet until three months after the close of the financial year, as in the present instance, we shall have to grant Supply for a number of months to carry us over the winter, and then, as we are now doing, grant a further supply for a couple of months until the budget has been passed by the House. That would be an altogether unsatisfactory arrangement, but I did not hear anything in the budget speech in regard to what was proposed. So far as I know there has been no public announcement on the matter up to the present time.","Second Reading","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2) 1927-28","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Obviously something must be clone. We cannot go on allowing the House to be closed during the whole of the winter months without proper provision being made for an early consideration of the finances. I do not know whether the Treasurer intends to alter the financial year, or whether the present arrangement will continue. If there is to be no change I fail to see how Parliament can remain in recess for the winter period. It seems to me that it will have to meet just as it did in Melbourne. The Treasurer might have taken us into his confidence, because it has been freely circulated in the newspapers that Parliament will not sit in the winter months. Honorable members are now at a loss to know what to expect. We cannot go on granting supply to the Government if it does not recognize the financial year as it exists. It should bring down its budget within a reasonable time after the close of the year, in order to obviate the necessity of granting supply so frequently. Under present circumstances money is expended, as the honorable member for East Sydney (Mr. West) suggested, before Parliament can discuss the expenditure on the Estimates. Too often there is undue delay in the discussion of the Estimates, with the result that when honorable members attempt to bring about a reduction in expenditure they are politely told that the expenditure has already been incurred, and no reduction can be made. A clear basis of procedure should be laid down, now that Parliament is installed in its new home, and the sooner that is done the better for all concerned. We could at least satisfy the public desire to know the intention of the Parliament. The Government may intend to alter the financial year, or may have in view some other method of overcoming the difficulty. It may propose to continue the sittings in the winter months as heretofore; but the matter should be settled without delay. There should not be a recurrence of the present situation, with Parliament meeting three months after the opening of the new financial year, and being asked to grant a couple of months Supply to carry on the services of the country until well towards Christmas. I expected to hear something on the subject during the course of the Treasurers budget speech.I propose to refer briefly to the position into which we are drifting in connexion with public borrowing. I shall have occasion to refer to the subject in dealing with the budget, but I take this opportunity of mentioning the appalling position in which we now find ourselves in regard to trade balances. As the Treasurer pointed out in his speech, we have amended the tariff on two occasions in the last few years. It was anticipated that as a result we should be able to manufacture in Australia many articles that were previously imported, and that the trade balances would show a marked improvement in our favour; but instead of that the position has become much worse.","Second Reading","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2) 1927-28","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

For the year 1926- 27 the Commonwealth had an adverse trade balance of nearly £20,000,000. Its indebtedness overseas at the 30th June last was £130,635,131 in London, and £10,356,930 in New York, a total of £140,992,061. The Treasurer tells us that our New York indebtedness is now over £15,000,000,  indicating that if we cannot obtain all that we want from Great Britain we are going to America to get it. That will result in more goods being brought into the Commonwealth from the United States of America, which takes a small quantity of goods from Australia as compared with what we get from that country.","Second Reading","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2) 1927-28","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

281,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CHARLTON, Matthew","JXA","N/A","N/A","N/A",62,"- Of course. At the 30th June, 1920, the Commonwealth indebtedness in London was £91,778,559, and in New York nil, showing an increase up till June last of £49,213,502. The matter is very serious; it is idle for us to talk about reducing our indebtedness when it is allowed to increase overseas. The States indebtedness at the 30th June, 1926, was £349,695,298 in London, and £9,529,436 in New York, a total of £359,224,734. At the 30th June, 1920, the London indebtedness was £266,307,448, and the New York indebtedness nil, so that the increase since 1920 totals £92,917,286. This financial drift must be checked, although I realize the necessity for developing the country, and providing money for that purpose. Should we constantly borrow abroad, or should we not confine ourselves to borrowing in Australia such sums as we cannot obtain out of revenue for our requirements? That matter demands our earnest consideration. From 30th June, 1920, to the 30th June, 1927, the Commonwealthand States indebtedness overseas was increased by £142,130,788. The total annual interest bill on Commonwealth and States debts is £23,138,939 payable in London, and £816,069 payable in America: These figures, which are the latest available to me, represent the annual interest on the Commonwealth debts as at the 30th June, 1926, and the annual interest on State debts as at 30th June, 1925. Our imports from United States during 1925-26 were valued at £37,234,257, and our exports to America at only £12,953,877, leaving a balance of £24,280,380 in favour of America. If the Commonwealth and the States borrow extensively from America this adverse trade balance will become very much greater, because all our loan money from abroad must be received in the form of goods. In other words, if we raise a loan of £20,000,000 iu the United States of America, we commit ourselves to the purchase pf American goods to that value. I remind the honorable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory) that the tariff can never become effective if by foreign borrowing this country commits itself to the purchase of large quantities of foreign goods. During the first nine months of 1927 Australia imported from America goods to the value of £30,896,000. This is a matter so serious as to demand earnest consideration. I have touched on it only briefly to-day, because it will require to be further considered when the budget is under discussion. My reason for mentioning it now is that there seems to be an overwhelming desire on the part of Australian Governments to place loans upon the American market. The sooner we restrict our borrowing abroad the better for all concerned.Last week I had an opportunity to see the appalling conditions in the drought areas, and one is forced to speculate as to what will happen to this country if the wheat harvest this year should be a partial failure.","Second Reading","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2) 1927-28","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

283,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CHARLTON, Matthew","JXA","N/A","N/A","N/A",63,"- I believe it will. I have heard a good deal about the prevalence of a drought, and my own observations lead me to doubt that the crop this year will be nearly as good as it was in former years. The dry spell may not be general throughout the Commonwealth, but large areas are affected, and in them sheep are dying through lack of food. The prosperity of Australia depends largely upon the proceeds of the wool clip and wheat crops. What will happen to us if that revenue is lost, having regard to the large amount required each year to pay interest on a huge national debt? Undoubtedly we shall have difficulty in meeting our obligations. I have realized for a long time that since the war ended, Australia has been very fortunate; it has enjoyed a long series of good seasons, and has received high prices for its wool and wheat. Last year we had bountiful crops, and received good prices for our products, especially wool. In this way, large amounts of money were brought to this country, and if this wealth is lost to us in any year the country will suffer severely.serious position is arising in connexion with immigration. I refer particularly to migrants from Europe, other than Great Britain, and non-European countries. The large influx of people from Southern Europe and nonBritish countries, is doing serious harm to the workers of this country. About two years ago when the subject was discussed in this House, and at various intervals since, we were assured that the influx of southern Europeans would bo reduced to definite proportions. Special conditions were to apply to Italians, each migrant being required to have a prescribed amount of money on landing, and to be of good health and character. In almost every State of the Commonwealth, thousands of good Australians are unemployed and unable to get work, whilst newcomers who are not British citizens are able to get employment. Can we expect our people, especially men who have families dependent upon them, to remain satisfied with this state of affairs? In the Newcastle district about 2,000 men are unemployed. Men flocked to that centre from various parts in the expectation of getting employment in the big works there, only to find that no openings for them existed. From South Australia and other States I hear the same complaint about the employment of Maltese while good Australians are walking the streets in idleness. Nothing will cause a greater feeling of resentment amongst the native-born population than their inability to get employment when new arrivals fare so much better.","Second Reading","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2) 1927-28","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is futile to talk about developing the country and introducing immigrants, when thousands of our own able-bodied men are unable to get work. During the six months ended 30th June last, the arrivals from Italy totalled 3,648, and the departures 652, leaving an excess of 2,996 arrivals. The total number of European arrivals was 8,982, and of departures 3,250, leaving an excess of 5,732 arrivals. Of non-Europeans there were 2,839 arrivals, and 3,310 departures, so that there were 471 more departures than arrivals. The grand totals in respect of both European and non-Europeans were: - Arrivals, 11,821; departures, 6,560, showing a net gain of 5,261. We are often told that the percentage of foreigners arriving in Australia is low in comparison with the number coming in from Great Britain ; indeed, we have been assured on many occasions that the foreign immigrants represent not more than from 8 to 10 per cent. of the total.Sitting suspended from6.30 to 8 p.m.","Second Reading","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2) 1927-28","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
288,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CHARLTON, Matthew","JXA","N/A","N/A","N/A",64,"- For the six months ended the 30th June last the arrivals from Great Britain numbered 46,165, and the departures 35,840, the excess of arrivals over departures being 15,325. We discussed this matter two years ago, and the Prime Minister then promised to keep an eye on the influx of Europeans other than British. As a matter of fact, the number of immigrants from European countries was limited; but the only limitation placed upon Italians was that they must be persons of a reputable character, possessing so much capital, and the result has been that the great majority of those who are coming to Australia, other than from Great Britain, are Italians. I have not a word to say against Italians or other Southern Europeans; they make good citizens of Australia; but we cannot afford to allow thousands of our own workmen to remain unemployed while strangers come here and secure work. We must, therefore, do something to restrict the influx of these immigrants. It may be said that I am dealing with a delicate question that must be handled carefully; but all matters of domestic concern are within our control, and under international law immigration is a matter of domestic concern. There is, therefore, no reason why the Commonwealth Government, if it has grounds for doing, so, should not restrict, as far as it deems necessary, the influx of immigrants. America has found it necessary to regulate, control, and restrict immigration, and it must be apparent to all that the time has arrived when Australia should act similarly. If we could absorb all those who seek to come to our shores, everything would be right, but we cannot do that. Two years ago the Prime Minister said that we were maintaining a certain balance, and that all but about 10 per cent. were British immigrants. The figures for the six months ended the 30th June last show clearly that there has been one nonBritish immigrant to every three British immigrants. We have heard complaints about the influx of assisted immigrants, but these non-British people who are coming to our shores arc not assisted immigrants.","Second Reading","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2) 1927-28","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
