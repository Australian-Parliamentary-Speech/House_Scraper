"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","RILEY, Edward","KYV","South Sydney","ALP","N/A","17",". - I am sure we are all surprised to see the turn events have taken this morning. In the last Parliament we had a gentleman in the chair who, I think, was faithful to his party, and carried out his duties so far as he possibly could to assist the Government. Now, however, the Government, which have thrown all their principles overboard, and have come together as - what shall I say ? - a hybrid party, start the present Parliament by displacing a man who has served them well. This is only following on what the Government have been doing during the last mouth - casting out men who have served the country well. This is certainly a very fine start. Who can say that the honorable member for Lang (Sir Elliot Johnson) was not a good Speaker for his party and for his country ? It was only a few days ago that I was speaking to that honorable gentleman, and I know he expected, to be re-elected Speaker. He had every justification for that expectation; but this  managing  Government have  managed  to get him out of his office. I have nothing to say against my honorable friend, the honorable member for Balaclava (Mr. Watt). He will make a very nice picture on the walls of the Queens Hall. Such a picture is one of the rewards for being a. Speaker - the successful member is  taken  in oils, and, as I say, the honorable member will look very well in oils. No doubt the honorable gentleman will look well in a picture in the Queens Hall here, but I do not know how he will like the circumstances when his portrait is hung at Canberra. The honorable gentleman in his career has been Premier of a State, and has held very high office in this Chamber, holding the office of Treasurer and that of Acting Prime Minister. Under all the circumstances, I cannot conceive what is the motive that has led him to accept the nomination as Speaker; I can only think that there must have been some very fine  managing  going on. However, as this is to be a  business  Government, it is just as well that they should manage. As I say, I cannot imagine what was the  bait  that was held out to the honorable gentleman to induce him to accept the position of Speaker. Perhaps it was the horsehair wig, and gown, and the fact that, as Speaker, he will have a nice young gentleman to carry the mace in front of him. All these  baubles  may have been some inducement to the honorable gentleman, who may also have recollected that when the- honorable member for Lang (Sir Elliot Johnson) became Speaker he was plain.  Mr. The honorable member for Balaclava would, perhaps-, like to be Sir Billy Watt- a very nice title. Indeed, he may aspire- higher; he may regard the  Sir  as quite a common thing, and feel that there might well now be a departure brought about by a Government that can  manage, and that he may become -the Duke of Balaclava. That latter would be a nice title, indeed, for- my honorable friend. However, I deeply regret that the party opposite show so little generosity to quite a number of men. who have served them well. The members of the Government used at one time to- sing the praises of these men as  fine fellows  ;. but when it comes to the question of the emoluments of office they have to go. There may be an opportunity later on to say a word or two about the Governor-General and his- action in ignoring the strongest party. in the House. He insulted our Leader (Mr. Charlton) by. not consulting him; and we shall, in the future, treat him with the same courtesy and generosity he has. displayed to us in 1 lie. past. The. absence: of the honorable member for Balaclava from the floor of the. House will form good security for the Government The honorable member in the last Parliament was free-lance. He was not consulted about, the formation of the. Ministry, and, perhaps, because of that, the Government fear he might prove a candid critic. There is no doubt that the honorable gentleman can criticise, and with a view nicely to  managing  things the Government hold out to him the  bait of the. horsehair wig, the. gown, the mace, and Sir  Billy  Watt. Ha is done now. In the. chair lie cannot say anything against the Government.. All he has to do is to act as a constable, to keep us. in order ; a glorified constable! From Premier of a State, and Acting Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, this gentleman has degenerated to the status, of a constable., whose duty at will he to maintain order in this House.-","N/A","ELECTION OF SPEAKER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The late Government were, ignominiously defeated at the hands of the people. Trickery and subterfuge> and the murder of many of their colleagues whom they should have had- the decency, at least, to stick to, culminates to-day in yet another assassination - that of one who has always treated the -Government fairly. Wow there is about to follow the elevation of a gentleman whom they fear to a position where he cannot speak-. The party to- which I belong may be misunderstood in the matter of its, attitude regarding; the whole of these questionable proceedings: But I say that from the time when the honorable member for Flinders (Mr. Bruce) was wrongfully sent for by His Excellency the Governor-General, and came away with twelve bribes in his hands - all fairly large bribes, too - he was given a commission to go abroad among the members of Parliament, to fix something up. And he has fixed it well and truly. First of all, the representative of His Majesty acted unconstitutionally, unfairly. The Leader of the Opposition, the honorable member for Hunter (Mr. Charlton), represents the- largest party in this House; rather, he did so prior to the amalgamation which, has brought about, the present Government That Government is now. the National Government. Being the Leader of the largest party in this- Chamber, the honorable member for Hunter should have been sent for. Wot that we anticipated governing the Commonwealth ! Not yet ! When we do govern this country we shall have sufficient numbers with which to govern. We have no desire to govern it with a minority in this chamber. The whole, of the proceedings, from the time when the -late Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) was taken to the bathroom - to quote the elegant language of an honorable friend - and had his political throat cut and when several other individuals thereafter had their political throats cut also, may be summed up as a blot upon the parliamentary institution in the Commonwealth. Wow, what, have we after all this intriguing? A compositeGovernment! I invite honorable members to consult Webster. That authority describes the word with a very effective phrase. I have no more to add, except that, as the Government have started disgracefully, so will they end disgracefully.","N/A","ELECTION OF SPEAKER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

As for the right honorable member who has taker - shall I call it a bribe? - a place, a gown, and a horse-hair wig - do I not remember the eloquent address which he delivered concerning the late Alfred Deakin! It was given with splendid elocutionary power; the oration ranks with the highest efforts of its kind in our parliamentary history. I know full well his elocutionary gifts. But what of the right honorable gentlemans political career? I had hoped that, for the sake of Victoria, he would have closed his political life as Prime Minister of Australia. I would have held my hand - which I do not purpose doing to-day - had he achieved such a .climax. As matters stand at this moment, I am reminded of one entering a .cemetery where, over the tombstones, are to be seen the words, Hia jacet - Heu lies--  for here is the end pf his political career. I never thought he would have been guilty of accepting this post.I purpose, in comment, only .to quote a few remarks from the daily press. That great organ thundering there in Collins street, what does it announce?  Candid Critic Silenced. Why silenced? Because he might expose this collection, this conglomeration: the Government. The newspaper in question says,  The Country party also decided to support Mr. Watt as Speaker. The Country party would support any one who, in return, would give them .security of tenure. The paper says, further -On the whole, however, the opinion is that Mr. Bruce has by this means rid himself -of a somewhat dangerous rival.Had the honorable members for Balaclava (Mr. : Watt), North Sydney (Mr. W. M. Hughes), and Martin (Mr. Pratten) been able to put their heads together the present Government would not have known five clays, existence. Here is .another quotation, this time from the thunderer of Flinders-street The Bun: - Watt, Speaker! Surprise in Federal politics. In the train to-day 1 met sun old friend, who said,  Good God. Maloney, what has happened to Watt ?  I said, I dont know. He said, I saw that man once fall down in the street - in Flinders:streel - when big stalwart John Murray lifted him up and put him into a cab. I never thought he would have done such a thing. Thai is one opinion heard in the train.Now, turning to the late Speaker, the honorable member for Lang (Sir Elliot Johnson), there is no doubt that if the English precedent were followed - if the example of the Mother of Parliaments were adopted - my honorable friend would be re-elected to the Chair to-day. Of course, we have heard certain remarks to the effect that the honorable member for Balaclava would not on any account have permitted himself to be nominated if the honorable member for Lang had indicated his intention to stand. But the latter dashed well  knew that the Government, wl.cn they met the House to-day, would have the numbers. They would not dare to face an election ; for if they did, the honorable member for Balaclava would not be placed in the chair. I have been warned that if I say what it is any intention to say I shall make an enemy in the Chair.. I do not care. I never count consequences when once. I have .made up my mind.The ex-Speaker was man enough to resent one of the most infamous happenings in this Parliament when a young man employed in this building was fined two guineas, an amount which was paid to Mr. Broinowski, he Who had .the damned impertinence to come into this chamber and announce that the Governor-General had arrived here. I want to know what be did with that two -guineas, which, in plain words, he filched from that young man to whom I refer.","N/A","ELECTION OF SPEAKER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The -ex-Speaker, however, could do nothing- when this young man was dismissed. The forms of Parliament allowed the panjandrum of another Chamber, who once discarded the wig and then had it brought back to him again, to take the matter into his own hands. If honorable members care to read a criticism of the indecency of wearing a wig, I urge them to peruse the speech delivered by the Hon. Thomas Givens upon that subject. This gentleman was cowardly enough to inform Parliament that the young mans mother, had written a letter saying that her son had been misbehaving badly. As a matter of fact, the mother has signed a sworn declaration to the effect that this statement was false. It was Senator de Largie, who has fallen by the road, who, to his honour, exposed this, as can be seen in Hansard. Then, again, the Auditor-General was misquoted by this panjandrum of the Senate in giving evidence before a Select Committee when he declared that he was not the means of dismissing an innocent employee. Despite the exSpeaker, and in spite of the efforts of the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr. Mathews), who resigned from, the House Committee as a protest against the dismissal of this youth, justice could not be done. It may, however, be done by the present Government.So that honorable members may be acquainted with their future Speaker, I propose to give a brief epitome of his career. We all know that the late Sir Graham Berry was placed in the Speakers chair, and never rose to greatness again : and I can only recall one instance of a man who, having been appointed Speaker, afterwards became a strong political power. That was the late Sir Thomas Bent. After occupying the chair he became Premier of his State. If the honorable member for Balaclava becomes Speaker of this Chamber he can write hic jacet on his political life. I wish it were otherwise. I remember when he was joyous in his victory at North Melbourne over Mr. Prendergast, the present Leader of His Majestys Opposition in the State Parliament. And when he in turn went down before Mr. PrendergastI am told that he cried like a child at the loss of his dignity. Then came the other episode when he, as Postmaster-General in the State of Victoria, refused to give permission to an officer who wanted to get away to fight for the Flag of England. That officers sister applied to him a scourge that is often applied to dumb animals. The next episode in his career was when, with the help of the late Sir Thomas Bent, he became Minister of the Crown. Years ago he proceeded to hound that great big-hearted man to his doom. The last message sent to me from Sir Thomas Bent on his dying bed was,  I am on my dying bed, and you can tell the world that I have been murdered by Watt and Murray. Then, later on, what did Mr. Watt say to that stalwart man, Mr. Murray, who had, so to speak, picked him up in his arms? He said, Get back - play second; I want to be first. And so Mr. Murray was put in the background. Later came the Labour Government in the State of Victoria. I think it held office for thirteen days, but Mr. Prendergast, as Chief Secretary, put a minute on the file that could not be destroyed by a succeeding Minister. It was an instruction that every man and woman entitled to be on the electoral rolls should be placed on them. As a result of this minute, 1,200 additional names were placed on the roll for the Essendon electorate, which was represented in the State Parliament by Mr. Watt, who had never given these men and women the right to vote. The addition of these names was sufficient to induce him to quit. What did he do? He got hold of the Australian Womens National League, or the Awful Womens Naughty League, as I have heard it called, and it so pulled the strings that Dr. Carty Salmon, a former Speaker of the House of Representatives, was sent to the right-about. I am informed that although he, as head of the Masonic body, had presented Mr. Watt with the greatest prize it was in that bodys power to give, as a result of the manipulations which took place he was sent to a country electorate under conditions that his family know to-day brought about his death, for the chill he caught in the country would have been avoided had he been in Balaclava., I have this information from one very high in the Craft, but all those who are Masons can easily ascertain that what I say is true.I have finished. Now that Mr. Chanter has gone, I am the oldest member in the House, and I simply wish to say that if the Government go into, recess with all the horrors of bribery, corruption, and fraud rampant in our midst, the country will be their judges. If any member of the Government thinks that his Ministry has the power of the people behind it, I will give him a chance of proving it before the electors of Melbourne. I issue that challenge, although the full power of the daily press has been directed against me .throughout my political life. Like a boa constrictor the Government have swallowed the Country party - one of the most independent members of which is not here to-day. But I leave the Government to their fate. Honorable members have mentioned that the Governor-General, perhaps through an over sight, did not. consult, the Leader of the Labour party with regard to the formation of a Government. I pass that by, but I must record the fact that in anticipation of the visit of His Excellency this afternoon to receive the newly-elected Speaker, twelve officials came to this House to inspect the room in which the ceremony will take place. Included amongst them was the Admiral of the Fleet. I should like the Leader of the Government to supply me with a list of the names, positions, and salaries of the officials who made the inspection, so that we may know to what expense the country was put by a rehearsal of the reception. Why, in heavens name, did the Admiral of the Fleet come ?","N/A","ELECTION OF SPEAKER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[5]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I am confident that when he is elected to that position he will endeavour to carry out his duties in a fair and honest manner, and will endeavour to uphold the high traditions of his office. Apart from that, the Leader of the Government should be congratulated upon his shrewd business capacity. A clever commercial mau is the Leader of a so-called business Government, and his first step has been to dispose of his most dangerous rival. There was no more formidable rival to the Prime Minister than the gentleman who is to be bribed with the position of Speaker. I congratulate the Prime Minister upon his business acumen, but it is a sorry day for the country when public affairs have reached such a low ebb that a dangerous rival to the Government may be silenced by the offer of a valuable bauble. It is unnecessary to say much in regard to this matter, but the public are resenting the fact that the high traditions of public life are being dragged into the gutter. One thing that the people of all British communities, particularly the people of this country, hold dear, is the conduct of public affairs in an honest and honorable fashion, but to-day Federal politics are surrounded with suspicion ; the actions which have attended the advent of the new Government stink in the nostrils of the people. T leave the Government to the tender mercies of those same people, but I must express my deep sympathy with the honorable member for Lang (Sir Elliot Johnson) because of the shameless manner in which he has been treated.","N/A","ELECTION OF SPEAKER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The world is full of surprises, but nothing was more surprising to myself than to hear that you, Mr. Speaker, had been offered and had accepted your present position. It is not for me to examine any of the reasons that lie beneath the surface. I have known you for many years, and I know that whatever task you have undertaken you have discharged to the best of your ability I. have no- doubt that you will occupy your present position in such- a way that fairness and justice will be mated out to all honorable  members, irrespective of party. I rose not merely to congratulate you upon .your elevation to! tile Speakership, but to congratulate you: also upon the fact: that the duties now devolving upon you will be less onerous than they were in the last Parliament, in which three separate parties participated in. the- debates. Carrying my mind back to the election of the Speaker in the last Parliament, I recall the fact that the occupant of the chair was congratulated by the head of the Government and by the Leader of1 the Opposition. Then there appeared another gentleman, who let it be known that there was a new party in Parliament, a party pure and undefiled before God, that was going to set an example to other parties in this country. The Leader of the third party also rose to congratulate the Speaker; and the reason why his party wished to add its congratulations was not so much because of its overflowing friendship towards the new Speaker, as because it desired to convey to Parliament, and to the country, the fact that a third clearly-defined party had come into existence on the floor of this House. At the present moment, however, there is nobody to speak mi- behalf of this party. If it ever was a separate entity, on the present occasion there is, unfortunately, no one to speak on its behalf, except the Leader of the Nationalist Government of this country. I congratulate you, Mr. Speaker, that henceforth you will have, not three parties to deal with, but only two. Reference has been made to the fact that the precedents of this Chamber are somewhat different from those of the Mother of Parliaments. We are informed, by the press that in the House of Commons it is- the usual practice to -have the Speaker elected unanimously and to permit the previous occupant of the position, to retire. I congratulate you that in this respect the precedents- of the Old Country have been followed with exactitude in the present case. There have- been a- unanimous election and a voluntary retirement. There has, however, been one slight difference in that the voluntary retirement has taken the form of self-extermination in preference to being exterminated publicly by the forty-seven different entities in the present composite Government. I congratulate you upon your election, and I hope that if I ever go astray in debate you will temper justice with mercy. I do not ask you to- be impartial on all occasions, but to show some mercy to your old friends and associates. Whatever reasons prompted the Government in supporting your candidature for the Speakership,. I have not the slightest doubt that you will carry out your duties, with special ability, and that your sense of fairness will not be less than the ability you have shown throughout your life.","N/A","ELECTION OF SPEAKER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I have not yet had an opportunity to sufficiently acquaint myself with the forms and procedure of the House. Honorable members on this side, at any rate, congratulate the Prime Minister upon having achieved what was widely considered to be. an impossible job. He has brought the Fanners and the Nationalist parties together, and has formed a Government which appears to give promise of permanency. We ardently hope so, and have good reason to be thankful. The policies of the two parties were so nearly alike that, when the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) got together, they found that there was, indeed, so little outstanding between their views that they were able without much difficulty to form a new Government. In congratulating the Prime Minister upon his achievement, I take the opportunity to congratulate also my old school and his - namely, Melbourne Grammar - upon having been able to produce a second Prime Minister to serve the Commonwealth.. The schools of this country, and our public schools in .particular, have set fine examples to our sons; they have ever maintained the highest ideals. We welcome the Country party to this new alliance with us. We believe that its outcome will .mean stable government - settled government, at all events, for some time to come. We know that there have been many jealousies between the Country and Nationalist parties, but we believe that with mutual forbearance and generous consideration any such difficulties as may possibly crop up can be overcome.I take it that I shall not be expected to make a -very long speech, because, after all the speech of His Excellency was not a very long one. Certainly it was not as Jong as I had expected, and I feel sure that T. shall correctly estimate the feelings of honorable members if I make my own remarks correspondingly brief. We hope to see quite a number of things brought about before the Government go out of office. We are looking forward to a very considerable further development of Australia. We trust that such expansion will occur during the regime of the new Government, and I am confident that if we all pull together some very good national legislation will have been put into effect.One of the main points which must come up for consideration at the proposed conference between the representatives of the Commonwealth and States is that of immigration. Considerable ©are will have -to be exercised., .however. The Federation lias very little land of its own upon -which settlers < can i-be closely placed. Wie are bound, therefore, to make the necessary arrangements with the States, which hold the land. The only way in which we, for our part, can render effective help will be in financing the States. When we regard the vastness of this country and consider its powers of productivity, and when we remember its proximity to certain teeming peoples of the East, we feel that our only chance of keeping Australia white - or, perhaps, of keeping it- at all - lies in the direction of a great access of population. Our Motherland has an overflowing population, and .she is only too ready to send her. surplus people to us. Moreover, she has millions of money for investment in new lands ; and there is -no better place than this to which the Imperial Government could send new settlers and direct money for national investment. I trust that the people who come out to the Commonwealth will not be of that type which gravitates inevitably to the cities, but will be very ready and willing co settle on the -land and become prosperous producers. There should bo a wonderful future for Australia, if and when wo secure a ten times greater population. We would then be producing enormously, and we would be required to considerably extend both our local and our overseas markets. All these factors must receive the closest consideration. I trust that the outcome of the proposed conference will be to provide successful working arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States.The question of duplication of Stateand Commonwealth activities is another which has been exercising the public mind. I need not refer to all the duplications, but will mention as an example those in the realms of income and land tax, gathering. The taxpayer likes nothing less than the task of making up a multiplicity of returns; it is no wonder that the average man is ever ready to consign all the various tax-gathering officials to the utmost depths. The sooner this unreasonable and unecessary duplication is ended, the better for everybody.Our public debt is considerable, but when we regard our vast resources we should not be fearful. If we maintain our sinking fund, and if we can look forward to reasonably good seasons, we ought, with decent financing, to be able to rub out our liabilities in a comparatively little while. The matter of our finances must be very closely examined by the Government, and consideration should .be given, not only to our financial relations with the States, but with the Motherland also. I have been pleased to read of the splendid arrangement which the Victorian Premier has just been able to make in London with respect to a loan for this State. His success may be taken .as a happy augury for the Commonwealth authority should it be required to borrow again , before long. -Mr. Lawson s success indicates that there is unbounded confidence in Great Britain regarding ;the future -of Australia,.I have been much struck during the past few days by the- character of .several addresses which the Prime Minister has given in various parts of the Commonwealth. The right honorable gentleman has pleaded for unity and for a national outlook. We should do all that we canto foster those ideals to the utmost. Honorable members will remember that when our soldiers reached the other side of the world they made a great reputation for Australia. In speaking of soldiers, I refer not merely to captains, majors, dr even generals, of whom, there are a few in this Parliament, but to the ordinary privates, who enlisted to the number of about 300,000, of whom 60,000, unfortunately, left their bones on the other side of the world. What was the spirit that animated those men ? Was it not the spirit of Australia - the spirit which our Prime Minister wishes the people of Australia to display at the present time ? These men did not go abroad merely because they wanted to fight, but because they wanted Australia to come out on top. They possessed the national spirit of Australia, and it was that alone which enabled them to overcome the great- difficulties which they had to face. When we think of the awful weather they had to endure, and the heavy packs, rifles, and picks which they had to cany, we must admit that nothing short cf an inspiration like that could have been the foundation of their endurance. If we could only translate that spirit into our present-day activities in Australia, we could not go far wrong. If we could only get together a little more, get rid of the imaginary barriers that now separate us, sink our differences, and work for the benefit, not of a particular section of the people, but of the whole of Australia, we would not need to have any fear but that we would be able to lift this splendid country of ours into the very front rank of the nations.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH : ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/speech[1]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The only fact which encouraged me in accepting the honour that was offered to me was that I knew I could rely upon the forbearance and toleration- of the older members towards one who has just come among them. Although possibly after a few moments they may be somewhat bored; for they then will be kept busy forming their estimate of the calibre of new-comers. I can give them the cheering news that I shall be very brief. That, I have been given to understand, is essential.The first thing that strikes me particularly, as an Australian of the fourth generation, is the very important fact that every member of the Cabinet is Australianborn. Although I am aware that much has been done for Australia in the past by our forbears, it is gratifying to know that we have now got beyond the swaddling-clothes stage. We have men in this country who were born, reared, and educated in it, and have absorbed into, their very bones the spirit of Australia. These are the mcn who will carry on. In saying that, I make no reflection on any persons who have come to this country and were not born here, but it is of great interest to know, and it is better for Australia, that her own sons should govern this country. Particularly noteworthy, also, is the fact that the two leaders of the Ministry are both returned soldiers. That fact should give returned soldiers generally an expectation of things to come. These two leaders have shown their willingness to serve their country overseas, and to give, if the necessity should arise, their very lives for it. Now they have returned to Australia, and are in the legislative halls, where they will give of their best to their country in another way, by bringing their great mental capabilities, which no one can deny they possess, to bear upon the great problems confronting us at the present time, when the war has not ceased to worry us. Although there may be divergencies of opinion between honorable members sitting on the Government side of the House - differences on questions of detail, and sometimes on larger and more important matters - still they are only differences of viewpoint. Take, for instance, Parliament House. If one looked at it from Spring street one would get an entirely different view-point from that which would be obtained if one looked at it from the back. The central fact would remain, however, that it would still be Parliament House, and the difference would merely be a difference of view-point and of attitude, of. mind. I think that every honorable member of the House, wherever he sits, is agreed upon the big central fact that Parliament must govern and legislate for the benefit of this country as a whole and for the prosperity of its citizens, whether they be old or young, rich or poor, city dwellers or men and women out-back - those sturdy pioneers who are battling still to make this country what it should be - the finest on Gods earth. We can do that for this Australia of ours, and it should be done.I may mention one way in which we can help the people out-back. The Postmaster-Generals Department can give, and I am sure will give, increased facilities for telephonic and telegraphic communication. That Department can also assist .the settler out-back in many other ways.A question that must be taken up is decentralization. It has been a phrase, a  plank  in the platforms of political parties for many years past. 1 am sure the time will come when decentralization will no longer be a party joss or merely an abstract phrase, but will become something definite and tangible. Instead of decentralization being a mere formal expression of policy, we want it to be an actuality. During the life of this Parliament, honorable members will have an opportunity of discussing the subdivision of Australia, and deciding upon decentralization in whatever way they think fit. Incidentally, there will be the question of the creation of now States. Decentralization must be made an accomplished fact, and no longer allowed to remain just a phrase in the platforms of the various political parties.Another way in which those out-back can be helped is in the stabilization of our various primary industries, whether they exist for the production of butter, sugar, wheat, or anything else.- In the near future, no doubt, sugar will be discussed in this House. This great industry cannot be allowed to languish. It means much to Australia, and it must be helped, along with the fruit and other industries that depend upon it, and, at the same time, the interests of the consumers must not be lost sight of. An endeavour should be made to give a fair deal to all, and I am sure that this House, in its collective wisdom, will find a means of doing so.I also wish to refer to a small incident that occurred this morning. It may have been only a lapsus linguae on the part of you, Mr. Speaker, when you referred to  two parties  in this House. There are three parties in this House, and two of them have seen fit, in their wisdom, to enter into a partnership. Each party, however, is separate and distinct. Something had to be done to enable the government of the country to be carried on, and the two parties entered into a partnership for that purpose, just as two men might enter into a partnership for carrying on any business. Each party, just as each man in a partnership business, is separate and distinct from the other. The Country party and the Nationalist party are working together for the ultimate benefit of Australia, irrespective of what may be said to the contrary. I could not allow ar opportunity to pass without stressing the fact that the Country party, although its members have gone into the composite Ministry with the best of intentions, in the hope of being able to do something in collaboration with our friends to carry on the government of the country, is still a free and distinct entity. As our Leader has said, we can retire, if necessary, with our lines of communication intact.I have the honour to represent a constituency that has often been called  the garden of Australia. I am sure it will come as a very great surprise to honorable members to know that the bulk of that constituency - I refer to the more populous areas of it - is absolutely unconnected in any way by rail with the rest of Australia.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH : ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I believe it will be acknowledged that during that time he carried out his duties without bias and in a manner satisfactory in every way to the members of the various Parliaments.His appointment as.

During my service in this House I have been convinced of his ability and impartiality, and I believe that he will be as good a Chairman as any this House has had in the past.. I have watched his career during the long period for which he has represented an electorate in the State from which I come; I know that he enjoys the confidence of nearly the whole of the people of that State, who will learn with pleasure of his appointment to the high and honorable position for which he has beenproposed.Mr.BRENNAN (Batman) [5.34].- I move-That the honorable member for Denison, the Hon.

The carrying of my motion would have the further effect of convincing a sceptical public that there is no suggestion of partisanship or party in the appointment of the men who are to preside over the deliberations of this House and its Committees. I have no personal objection to the honorable member for Herbert, but I have strong political objections to him, as he knows, and that objection is shared by many of my fellow members. But on the broad ground that the honorable member for Denison is the better fitted by experience and capacity to fill the position of Chairman of Committees, I submit my motion to the House.","N/A","CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The speakers at the meeting were Messrs. J. A. Wright and J. M. Scott, and the motion, which was carried without opposition, on a show of hands, reads as follows : -This meeting of citizens emphatically objects to the proposal of the Federal Government to create a Board of Control for our Commonwealth Bank, and looks at the suggestion as disloyal to Australia and as a treacherous attempt engineered by overseas diplomacy to hamper the Governor of our Bank in his great work of financing Australia into a powerful nation. We are well aware that the cause of Australias small population is solely due to the deliberate restrictive finance practised by the private banking companies here, under Londons instructions, and the shipment abroad by these banks of our citizens money placed with them, in order to finance London; and we suggest to Dr. Earle Page and his colleagues that a Royal Commission be appointed to inquire into the overseas control of the banking companies here; and we also suggest that the whole of the private banking be brought under the domination of our great Commonwealth Bank, and that these institutions be compelled to finance our secondary industries. We suggest that a Board of Control be created in each country centre to dominate the private banks to force the financing of our country towns and secondary industries in the country to the extent of the bank deposits in each centre (banks nowadays finance our country less than 25 per cent. of the deposits). The increased country finance will cause a flow of desirable people from abroad to participate in our Australian prosperity and our empty spaces will automatically increase in population. We claim that the key to Australian development and local patriotism is in the banking business. An analysis of the financial juggle called  Borrowing in London will prove that Australia received neither credit, goods, nor money in return for our bonds placed in London, and that the so-called public debt due to London is really a banking debt clue from London to Australia, and that our country has been financing the British Isles and about one-third of the world since 1851.","Commonwealth Bank : Board of Control - Queensland Sugar Industry: Sugar Agreement","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

During the recent Federal election campaign all kinds of promises were made by Nationalist candidates in the northern State, and some were to the effect that if they were returned there would be a renewal of the existing sugar agreement. We find, however, that the present composite Ministry, which embraces the whole of the anti-Labour forces in this Parliament, is hurrying into recess without doing anything to bring about a renewal of the agreement. The honorable member for Herbert (Mr. Bamford), and the honorable member for Wide Bay, when seeking re-election, definitely promised the sugar-growers of Queensland that it would be renewed.. The only indication we have had as to the intentions of the Government regarding the sugar industry is to be found in this mornings issue of the Melbourne newspapers, in which we have the statement that-Mr. Bruce informed members that it had been decided to refer the question of the import duty on sugar to a special tribunal that would recommend the fixing of a price that) would be fair to all parties concerned.We have heard before of promises of that kind. This statement on the part of the Prime Minister means nothing. It is shelving the question. The present sugar agreement will expire on ?>0th June next, and the sugar-growers of Queensland have a right to expect from the Government a definite pronouncement on die subject. They are entitled to expect that the pledges that were given to them during the recent campaign will be honoured.I do not intend in this motion for the adjournment of the House to dwell at length on this matter. I shall deal with it more fully at a later, date, but- I wish at this, the first opportunity, to enter my protest against the inaction of the Government. In order to show that I am not indulging in mere general statements, I shall quote what the honorable member for Wide Bay (Mr. Corser) said when he was wooing the electors of Wide Bay, amongst whom there are many sugar-growers, and appealing to them for their votes. The honorable member, speaking at Nambour,- said, as reported in the Brisbane Daily Mail of 29th November last -If the Nationalist Government is returned to power  further sugar proposals will lie submitted, and I feel confident that the existing sugar agreement will be renewed. In view of this statement, the sugar-growers in the honorable members electorate naturally expect- that the Government will renew the present sugar agreement. The honorable member for Wide Bay was not alone in giving that definite promise. The honorable member for Herbert, I am told, telegraphed to scores of centres in his electorate telling the people that if he were elected there would be a renewal of the present sugar agreement, and that he would at once move to that effect.","Commonwealth Bank : Board of Control - Queensland Sugar Industry: Sugar Agreement","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Biggs, of Proserpine on 19th January last, the statements that were made by the honorable member. The letter .is as follows : -NATIONALISTS AND SUGARTo the Editor - Sir, - In view of the assertion that it was doubtful if Queensland favoured a continuance of the sugar agreement, and taking into consideration the result of the Queensland elections, I wish to make it quite clear that the Nationalists candidates of Queensland all pledged themselves to a continuance of the agreement, which was in direct opposition to the policy of the Nationalist party, as given by Mr- Hughes. Thi; following were put to Afv. Bamford at his election meeting at Proserpine by me: -Are you in favour pf the continuance of the sugar agreement F- Mr. Bamford. - Yos, for a further term of five years.In the event of your party, as a « party, refusing to Vote for same, will you cross the floor and vote against them? - Mr. Bamford. - .Yes, I will] and, further, when I am returned I will pledge myself to make it my business, at the first opportunity, to bring the extension of the agreement before the House, as it will give me the opportunity to put the acid on the Country and Labour parties, and prove their sincerity to the sugar growers.I appeal to the House to say whether the honorable member has honoured that definite promise which he made to the cane-growers of the Proserpine district when he was appealing for their votes. The letter continues -Mr. Bamford expressed himself us being dubious about the latter. - about the sincerity of the Country party and the Labour party in regard to the renewal of the sugar agreement -As one in the industry, I trust you will publish the above, so as to make the position clear. - Yours, &c,B. Biggs.Proserpine, 19th JanuaryThat letter puts the position clearly from one in the industry, and shows that, the people of Queensland during the recent Federal campaign were misled by Nationalist candidates, some of whom won the election by telling the people that if they were returned there would be a renewal of the present sugar agreement.We should look at this very important question of sugar from, an Australian, and not from a parochial, stand-point. It is a great national question, and .with it is interwoven that of the White Australia policy, which is of vast concern to the whole continent. We have in Australia approximately1, 149,000 square miles of territory within the tropics, and we must foster the great sugar-growing industry, which is the only one that will enable us to settle the people there. The present Government has not clone the fair thing by the sugar -growers of Queensland, but I appeal even at this late hour to the Prime Minister to give the fullest consideration to requests for a renewal of the present agreement which will be made to him in the course of the next few days. The sugar industry of Queensland is worth £9.500.000 to the people.It gives employment to 22.000 persons, and a sum of £6,000,000 per annum is paid in wages in connexion with it. Some 4,000 men from Victoria and other States go to Queensland every year and gain there a living in the industry, and keep their wives and families in New South Wales and Victoria. Furthermore, while hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of machinery from the southern States are sold throughout the sugar districts of Queensland, the southern foundries benefit. In view of these facts it cannot be said that the industry helps only the State of Queensland. It helps the whole of Australia. In the northern part of the continent, where the mining and cattle industries are languishing, we should foster the great sugar industry. It is the duty of the present Government, even at this late hour, to endeavour to live up to the promises made by honorable members opposite when they were seeking, by, I fear, false pretences, to secure the votes of the people of Queensland.Later on I shall discuss the sugar industry in detail. At this juncture I do not intend to detain the House. I hope, in the course of my speeches in this Chamber, to be able to place before honorable members opposite sufficient facts to convince them-, as well as the people of the southern parts of Australia that the sugar-growers of Queensland have a just claim. If the people of Australia had been called upon during the period 1915-1921 to pay worlds parity for their sugar it would have cost them £12,000,000 more than they actually had to pay.","Commonwealth Bank : Board of Control - Queensland Sugar Industry: Sugar Agreement","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I appeal to them now to retrace their steps and do the right thing. Due credit would be given them if they came forward and treated this vast national industry as it should be treated. .","Commonwealth Bank : Board of Control - Queensland Sugar Industry: Sugar Agreement","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I do not for a moment wish to say that the new member for Capricornia (Mr. Forde)has made an untrue statement willingly; I have been too long in Parliament to myself make such a stupid statement as that--","Commonwealth Bank : Board of Control - Queensland Sugar Industry: Sugar Agreement","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I could never have made such a statement as that attributed to me-. What I did say on the public platform, and what I repeat here, is that if the Nationalist party were returned to power I was convinced that justice would be done to the sugar industry in the shape of a renewal of the sugar agreement in some varied form - I specially stressed that point, because I knew there was no prospect of a renewal on the old terms - or that a Board or pool would be provided, and adequate protection given in the shape of a duty on imported sugar. That was what I said, and what I now stand by. The honorable member forCapricornia belongs to the party in Opposition, but I do not remember my friend the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Charlton), when at Maryborough, in my electorate, saying that he was in favour of a renewal of the agreement as it stands to-day; in fact, he never did say so. I hope that what has occurred this afternoon here will act as a warning to the honorable member forCapricornia to think well before he makes accusations so serious.Question resolved in the affirmative.House adjourned at6.3 p.m.","Commonwealth Bank : Board of Control - Queensland Sugar Industry: Sugar Agreement","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
