I do so not only on behalf of the Opposition as I have led it hitherto, but also on behalf of those honorable members who hitherto in this Parliament have had as their leader the honorable member forWest Sydney (Mr. Beasley). We entirely agree with the sentiments contained in the Message which you, Mr. Speaker, and the President of the Senate forwarded to His Majesty King Edward VIII. We say that King George V. was ft truly great King, and that he personified thq aspirations of the people of the British Commonwealth of Nations. We believe that his rule gave symbolic fitness to the Throne, in that it indicated a leadership of peoples who believe in self-government, and at the same time can reconcile what in other parts of the world might be conflicting ideas, but which in our system of government unite the Throne and the people in a common fealty to the ordered instruments of democratic government.","N/A","DEATH OF KING GEORGE V","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

9,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CURTIN, John","009FQ","Fremantle","N/A","N/A",6,".- I beg to second the motion. The people of Australia have had knowledge of the personality of King Edward VIII. I am certain that the affection that they held for his Royal father will be entertained for him in full measure. We hope that his rule will be beneficent, and lengthy. We also are inspired hy the belief that his reign will be marked by great changes for the betterment of humanity. King Edward VIII. has already manifested attributes of deep sympathy with the best instincts of humanity. He has, we believe, an intimate knowledge not only of the exacting dutieswhich have come to him, but also of the lives of his people, including those who are numbered among the most lowly of his subjects. We are confident that, however great has been the sympathy which in the pasthas existed between the Throne and the people, it will be even greater in the future.Question resolved in the affirmative, honorable members standing in their places.","N/A","DEATH OF KING GEORGE V","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
