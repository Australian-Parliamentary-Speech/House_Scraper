Seeing that the House has agreed to go into temporary recess in order to allow Ministers to attend the Premiers Conference, the least we might have expected in the Budget was some forecast of the manner in which the Government intend to safeguard the interests of the Commonwealth at that Conference. We got no such statement. We were told nothing but the bald fact that Ministers are going to enter into a Conference with the State Premiers and Treasurers. What position does that Conference hold? Several of the State Governments are already tottering to their fall. In Queensland it is expected that the Government will be defeated at an early date. They have at present a majority of only one.

He is chairman, or secretary, of the Anti-Sweating League of Victoria, and yet is associated with the biggest sweaters in Australia. He has professed, by interjections, and other methods, this morning, to be seeking the assistance of the Government in order to relieve unemployment, but he is associated with those powers which are responsible, by their conduct of the government of the country, for creating the unemployment that at present exists in Australia. He has to stick to the Government because he can do nothing else. He has forfeited the confidence of the Democrats who used to vote for him in his constituency, and is now compelled to look to the employers and sweaters of Australia - although I do not say that all employers are sweaters - and to the anti-Socialist leagues to put him into Parliament at the next election. He knows that, without their help, he has no hope of being returned. But a more serious question than that of the position of individuals, and one demanding our attention, is the problem of obtaining such a satisfactory adjustment of the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States as will encourage that advance towards a complete national existence which the great bulk of the people ofAustralia desire. I look with the greatest possible anxiety at the mission of the Treasurer and Prime Minister to the Premiers Conference. We know that when the Treasurer went to Brisbane, he offered the States what was practically a continuance of the Braddon section for a number of years. By that means he would have tied up the Commonwealth in a way that this Parliament could not tolerate.

We are up against that particular fence now in regard to finance, and it is a fair thing that we should know what we are going to do. The honorable member for Wentworth is apparently in a very hilarious mood. That also seems to be the state of mind of the Government, because they know they have a dumb majority, who are not going to ask questions. They are in a strong position in their administration, because of the weakness of their individual followers. There is a number of men in the Ministerial party who are compelled, by their own individual helplessness, to stick to the Government, no matter what they propose, because they know that if they endeavoured to express individual opinions they would be annihilated between two fires. The Government recognise that, and express an absolute contempt for their followers, by the manner in which they present business to the House. In my opinion, it was not fair to bring the Budget down just before the House was to go into a temporary recess. It ought to be liberally debated before Ministers are allowed to go to a Premiers Conference, so that they may be in a position to express opinions which will have the weight of the people of Australia behind them. More elasticity must be given to the financial relationship of the Commonwealth and States, if we are going to build up a strong nation in these southern seas. We are faced now with the fact that the Government are going to a Conference without indicating to the House the nature or extent of the proposals which they will there submit to the representatives of the States. The Government will attend the Conference, and bind themselves to give effect to proposals of which we know nothing, relying on the threat of a dissolution if they be removed from office to compel their supporters to vote for them.","N/A","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[1]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The transfer of the public debts of the States, which amount to Â£250,000,000, and are increasing, involving, as they do, an interest account of something like Â£9,000,000 per annum, is of immense importance. We must all be agreed that they could be more effectively controlled by one central authority, and that savings could be effected and the future credit of the Commonwealth preserved by their transfer to the Federal authorities. As it is, a band of Ministers who have proved themselves to be financial muddlers are to have a free hand to determine what our financial relations with the States shall be. The Prime Minister has been in office for seven of the eight years of Federation, and yet is unable to finance the ordinary expenditure of the Commonwealth. His policy has been to let next year provide for itself. He and his Ministers have said in days gone by,  We have a surplus this year; let us hand it over to the States. Until the Surplus Revenue Bill was passed they paid no regard to the future necessities of the Commonwealth, and the result is that we have to-day a deficit staring us in the face. What would be said of any financial institution which, anticipating an expenditure in excess of its revenue made no provision, in the ordinary course of business, to meet that excess ?

In view of the statements that have been made by two of their supporters, the Government will go to the Conference of Premiers with a knowledge that it will probably be difficult to carry their proposals to borrow, and they may be induced to enter into an unsatisfactory arrangement with the States to tide them over present necessities and to render it unnecessary far them to do what would be distasteful to some of their supporters. Their desire to retain office will doubtless tempt them to come to any arrangement which will give them temporary supplies, and the whole future of the Commonwealth may be involved. When the Premiers had the big end of the stick - when the Braddon section had still some years to run - they were not prepared to make any reasonable proposal which we could accept without sacrificing the dignity of this Parliament. Now the position is such that the Commonwealth has to admit that it is in a tight financial position until the Braddon section expires. I have no doubt that Federal Ministers will ask for consideration and concessions from the States, and it may be that they will con sent to the placing of unnecessary restrictions on the Commonwealth in years to come in order to obtain temporary relief. It is seriously proposed to this Legislature to borrow money on short-dated Treasury bonds, at an interest not stated; and yet we are told that this is not a borrowing policy. The Government desire the defence of the country to be placed in the hands of the school children, and they evidently think that school children compose the Legislature to which: they submit such a proposal. We all admit that the Prime Minister is an accomplished word spinner, but he will have difficulty regarding this matter. I ask the honorable member for Balaclava, who has had some financial experience, whether he does not think that the issue of Treasury bonds, redeemable at short date, on which interest is to be paid, is a loan policy? He makes no reply. For years past honorable members have warned theGovernmentthat, unless they were careful, they would muddle themselves into their present position. It might be necessary to take over non- paying Departments ultimately, and, I believe, the control of such Departments is more satisfactory under a central authority; but this transfer, together with the liability for bounties, and the unsatisfactory position ire regard to the sugar bounty, involve an expenditure which has led to the present embarrassment. But those who warned the Government, and foretold this deficit, were regarded as false prophets; and it is only fair that the Committee should be reminded of the fact that the present difficulties were foreseen. The Treasurer now submits a new proposal. We know that nearly Â£7,000,000, over and above the one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue, have been paid to the States ; and when it was proposed that the Commonwealth should retain the surplus revenue, the present Treasurer described it as  political burglary. Apparently, it was - robbery to retain the surplus when we were in a necessitous position, and within a few months of meeting: serious obligations, but now in his opinion it is a perfectly proper course to ask the States to debit themselves with the moneys they have already been paid, as a set-off against the transferred properties.","N/A","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[1]/continue[25]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Government has admitted the urgency of defence preparations, which, we were led to believe, would be outlined in the Budget. Now we are asked to wait for the return of the Honorary Minister, and the submission of the Defence Bill. Is the Government going to be satisfied with the training of school boys between the ages of ten and fourteen,  continuing towards manhood  ? What is meant by that phrase ? A child a day old is  continuing towards manhood, though not able to assist in the defence of his country. I am of opinion that schoolboys should receive certain elementary instruction in drilling, but their place is in the school, not in the field. We have been told that the policy of the Government regarding land defence will be founded on the principle of universal training, commenced in youth, and continued towards manhood. How long does the Government intend to continue this training? To get at its policy we have to analyze the statements of individual Ministers. The present Minister of Defence used not to be an enthusiastic advocate of compulsory training.

Ministers are in agreement only when their policy has been embodied in a written document, and one of them is always on the watch to see that it is read through thoroughly and accurately. There is no agreement between their individual opinions, and there must have been a warm altercation in the Cabinet when the compulsory training provisions were under discussion. The opinion originally held by the Prime Minister, that we should have a fighting force capable of giving a good account of itself should the necessity arise, has been replaced by the statement that the training of youths, begun in the schools, continued to the age of fourteen, and further continued towards manhood, will be sufficient. On the question of naval defence, all that the Government have done has been to send the Honorary Minister to a Conference in London, for which it has been abused by its newspaper organ ever since, despite its constant apologies. Another significant passage in the Budget is the reference to the Tariff. This matter should appeal to the honorable member for Maribyrnong, who used to take a very vigorous interest in the rectification of anomalies. Since the original Tariff was passed there has apparently never been much the matter with it except anomalies. On the last occasion they were interpreted to mean the remodelling of the whole Tariff. It has been alleged since that there are anomalies, and we now get this statement from the Treasurer : -  Injurious anomalies . . . will be coped with. Fiscal stability gives great advantages to our trade and commerce, which can be preserved if anomalies are prudently provided against by well-considered action. Will anybody tell me that that is the language of the Treasurer ? As there is a. doubt as to whose language it is, will anybody tell me what it means?

218,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"SAMPSON, Sydney","L0P","Wimmera","N/A","N/A",2500,".- Whilst in certain respects yesterdays Budget may appear vague, especially in regard to financial questions affecting the raising of money and the provision for Defence, it has many features distinctly in advance of those of previous Budgets. About Â£500,000 is to be provided for Defence purposes, and nearly Â£500,000 to bring the telephones and telegraphs up to date. I shall not deal exhaustively with the figures submitted last night, because the mass of detail is tod great. But I have one or two observations to make on the financial position in connexion with the Conference between the Commonwealth Ministers and the State Premiers. Last year the expenditure of the Commonwealth exceeded its share of the Customs andExcise revenue, and this year it will do so again. Therefore, if the Commonwealth is to carry out the urgent public works and services which are required for the development of Australia, without imposing direct taxation, it will have to secure very liberal terms from the State Premiers. The excess of expenditure over revenue in the Department of the Postmaster-General is .Â£419,000, of which much is due to expenditure on new works. Twenty thousand pounds is set down for the establishment of wireless telegraph stations, and Â£850,000 for old-age pensions, in excess of the amount obtained from our one-fourth share of Customs and Excise revenue. The expenditure on quarantine will be Â£30,000, making in all, allowing for the odd figures, about Â£1,320,000. In regard to Defence, we have an increase of Â£564,000, and provision must be made for meeting our offer of a Dreadnought, or its equivalent. Assuming that that will involve an expenditure of Â£2,000,000, to be incurred within three years, the annual outlay will be Â£700,000. That makes the total Â£2,584,000. In addition, there is the prospective expenditure connected with the transfer of the Northern Territory, which will amount to Â£250,000 per annum, apart from the construction of railways and other developmental work. Therefore, in the future, if we are to leave direct taxation to the States - and I regard that as their legitimate source of revenue - we must further dip into the Customs and Excise revenue to the extent of about Â£3,000,000 a year. That is the position which our Ministers will have to put before the Premiers of the States. But, inasmuch as the Constitution created a partnership between the Commonwealth and the States, the subject must be approached with a due appreciation of the tremendous responsibilities resting on both parties for the carrying out of the public services and public works necessary for the development of the country. The States have to provide for education, construction, maintenance and working of railways, the carrying out of irrigation works, the; maintenance of law and order, and the performance of other functions which are as important as those of the Commonwealth. We are charged with the supremely important duty of providing for the defence of Australia, and we have also to carry on and extend the service of the Postmaster-Generals Department, which, if properly managed, must be a chief agency in the development of our commerce, and in bringing communities into closer communication will assist settlement by making country life more attractive. We must also encourage immigration, without which our developmental work will be largely ineffective. At present we have only one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue to pay for this and other large expenditures. The States, on the other hand, have a variety of sources from which to raise revenue by direct taxation. If the Federal Parliament is to be confined to the Customs and Excise revenue for the carrying out of its great policy of public expenditure, the States will have to deal liberally with it in the distribution of that revenue. The States have the kind that they can tax, and they have also the income tax, stamp and probate duties, and other forms of taxation which they may impose if they are forced by public necessities to do so. I dealt with the land tax in a previous speech, and so it is not necessary for me to deal with it again. I believe that the land, like any other branch of revenue-earning property, has responsibilities, and if it is necessary to place a tax upon land in order to provide the money required for the development of this country and for an adequate system of defence, let it be imposed. But I contend that this Parliament has no justification for invading the avenues of direct taxation now enjoyed by the States while the Customs and Excise revenue is yielding a much greater sum than is necessary for Commonwealth purposes. The revenue from Customs and Excise is at present more than double the amount required for Commonwealth purposes. The Constitution plainly directs that after the amount necessary for Commonwealth purposes is appropriated, the balance of Customs and Excise revenue shall be returned to the States, or applied to the payment of interest on State debts. That is an indication, although the Braddon section was only to extend for about ten years, that the framers of the Constitution, and the people who afterwards indorsed it, believed that that great revenue should be distributed in some form between the States and the Commonwealth. It was not shown precisely how the money was to be divided after the ten year period, and, owing to the tremendous advances made by nations in all parts of the world in building up armaments, the requirements of the Commonwealth are likely to be much greater than was anticipated ten years ago. This means that a sum which the States might fairly have anticipated five years ago will not be available now, in the light of the large responsibilities which the Federal Parliament will have to undertake. I hope that when the Premiers and the representatives of the Federal Parliament meet, at one of the most important Conferences of public men that have been held in the Commonwealth, due appreciation, not only of the responsibilities of the States, but also of those of the Commonwealth will be shown. I trust that, if it is intended to confine the Commonwealth to raising money by indirect taxation through Customs and Excise, while the States are still allowed to impose direct taxation, if necessary, in whatever direction they deem best, the State Premiers will recognise how essential it is for them to deal most liberally with the Commonwealth in the distribution of the Customs and Excise revenue, in order that this Parliament may be able to carry out those large developmental works and public services which are urgently required, and so do justice to itself as a National Legislature, and to the interests of the people of Australia.","N/A","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

When we examine the Budget, and see how the Treasurer has successfully dodged every question of importance, and postponed for a few years every difficulty that ought to be met and faced to-day, we cannot help thinking that the original Artful Dodger has a serious rival in this Parliament.

I regret that we have at last arrived at that stage in the history of the Commonwealth when we are starting upon the road to borrowing. Many of us hold that there is not the slightest justification for the Commonwealth to begin to borrow. We believe that borrowing is a political sin. There are some sinners, such as the men who sin boldly, whom one can pardon or excuse, but one cannot help feeling contempt for the miserable way -in which the, gentlemen composing the present Government are setting out to commit the political sin of borrowing.","N/A","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[4]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

But this Government do not pretend to do that. They are proposing to borrow to meet ordinary expenditure, which by every canon of parliamentary procedure ought to be met out of revenue. We are told that they do not propose to enter into a permanent arrangement, and that their scheme of borrowing is to extend only over four years. They are remarkably like those ladies who pawn their things on Saturday night in the hope of getting them out again a day or two later. The excuse of the Government is that theirs is only a temporary scheme, to be completed in four or five years. Indeed, they seem to hope that in five years time all the difficulties that are now pressing on them will pass away. They seem to look forward to five years hence like some religious sects look forward to a certain day which is to witness the end of the present dispensation. They do not purpose to enter into a permanent arrangement with the State Treasurers. They hope merely to make an arrangement which will carry them over the next five years. They hope to make this borrowing arrangement carry them over the next five years also. I cannot help thinking that the Treasurer has hopes that, when the bills which he now issues fall due four or five years hence - when these chickens are coming home to roost - he will be many thousands of miles away, enjoying himself in a different position, and leaving the Commonwealth to get out of its difficulties as best it may.","N/A","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[4]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Honorable members on the Ministerial side seem to be under the impression . that the real difficulty which the Treasurer has to face to-day is that set forth last night by the honorable member for Moreton, who inferred that we passed the Old-age Pensions Act before we had the money to pay for it.

232,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"HALL, David","L6Z","N/A","N/A","N/A",2503,"- It has been contended that the real financial difficulty confronting the Commonwealth to-day is due to our having undertaken the payment of old-age pensions before Che expiration of the Braddon section. The figures submitted in the Budget, however, show that even had the Old-age Pensions Act not been passed, the present Ministry would still have been unable to finance the current year without a deficiency. We are told that old-age pensions will cost the Commonwealth Â£1,500,000 per annum, but the Ministry will not have to find that amount this year. By the passing of the Surplus Revenue Bill, we have been able to present the Treasurer with accumulated revenues to the extent of Â£650,000, to finance old-age pensions. Had this House taken his advice, that Bil! would not have been passed, and he would have found himself in a far worse position than he occupies as Treasurer to-day. Deducting this accumulation of Â£650,000 from the amount which will have to be paid, we see that the Treasurer has only to find Â£850,000 this year for the payment of old-age pensions. Yet he tells us he will have a deficiency of Â£1,200,000, and that despite the failure to carry out our obligations to put the Postmaster-Generals Department in order, and to improve our defences. Those and other matters have been relegated to the future. The Argus contends this morning with a good deal of force, that the policy of borrowing can be justified only in connexion with reproductive works. I hold that it is not justifiable in the present circumstances, but we are told that borrowing can be excused only when it is proposed to expend the money so raised on reproductive works, and to pay the revenue received from those works into a sinking fund to liquidate the original debt. The reason why that precaution is to be ignored, and short-dated Treasury bonds issued, is. the Government assert, that, in four or five years time, we shall pay back the money so raised. Will any one who has the slightest idea of the immediate necessities of the Commonwealth say that there is any prospect of our getting out of debt once we get into it? There is nothing in the history of State finance to lead us to suppose that there will be a desire to pay back almost immediately what we borrow.","N/A","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[4]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Four or five years hence, we shall have to finance out of revenue, not only old-age pensions, but the cost of putting our land and coastal defences in order, and the raising of the Postmaster-Generals Department to a standard of efficiency. In less than four years also, the colossal blunder made by the present Administration in offering a Dreadnought to the British Government will have to be paid for.

Those postmasters have ample reason for complaining of the inefficient service given by temporary hands, who, in the absence of any motive, are naturally tempted to give only a poor return for the wages they receive. In the matter of defence, we are told that additional estimates will be brought down.

The additional expenditure on defence generally is utterly inadequate to meet the requirements. There is no justification for deferring the compulsory training proposals until next Parliament, because there is a majority in this Parliament, and, I believe, in the country prepared to vote for them. Honorable members recollect the eloquent speeches in which the Prime Minister declared the urgency of this matter.But it has ceased to be urgent with him since he entered into political partnership with gentlemen who have always opposed compulsory training. No provision is made in the Estimates for the establishment of an Inter-State Commission. With the abandonment of that proposal comes the abandonment of most of the purposes which the Ministry set out to accomplish. Three-fourths of its policy was bound up in the appointment of the Inter-State Commission. According to the programme read by the Prime Minister -The most complex series of measures to be submitted includes those affecting the industrial -interests of the Commonwealth. The pivot of several of these will be found in a Bill for the establishment of an Inter-State Commission.But not a shilling - in the language of the honorable member for Corio, not a dud - is provided on the Estimates for the InterState Commission. This body was to have had a general oversight of production and exchange, to manage a Commonwealth Labour Bureau, to assist in supervising the working of the existing Customs Tariff in its operation upon the investment of Australian capital and labour in Australian industries, and to consider any divergencies between industrial conditions in the various States.But in the Budget, no mention was made of it, and so it passes away. That part of the policy statement which referred to it may be summed up, in the words of Koko in the Mikado, as  mere corroborative detail designed to give artistic verisimilitude to an otherwise bald and unconvincing narrative. Actually, the proposal was still-born, and under no circumstances could have fulfilled one-tenth of the things promised. There are one or two other matters to which I intended to refer; but I shall leave them over for the present. It might fairly be asked, what would the Labour party do to avoid borrowing under the present financial conditions ? It is not wise for an Opposition to say what it would do; at any rate, it is easier to criticise the proposals of the Government. But had the Fisher Administration remained in office, the country would at least not now be pledged to finding Â£2,000,000 for a Dreadnought, which, ten years hence, will be obsolete- We should have expended the countrys money in providing a force which in that time would have become a living and vital fighting machine, capable of doing much better service than an out-of-date war vessel .Mr.McWilliams. - A force which could leave Australia to help the Empire?","N/A","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[4]/continue[32]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Then, in meeting the State Premiers, we should have demanded from them bigger sacrifices than this Ministry intends to demand. It must be remembered that the States are by no means insolvent. Last year, New South Wales, after paying away over Â£500,000 for old-age pensions, had a surplus of more than Â£460,000. This year, we shall relieve it of the liability respecting old-age pensions, though it will continue to pay invalid old-age pensions. The Parliament of that State has been able to practically abolish the income tax, and to remove many of the stamp duties. Would not the Prime Minister, therefore, be justified in saying to the representatives of the States,  We are not going to borrow money to provide for the pensions in regard to which we relieve you of liability? If they refuse to meet us, we should appeal to their masters and ours, asking the people whether the Commonwealth should go into debt in order that the States might he tempted to be extravagant. Victoria, last year, had a surplus of Â£50,000, and paid away Â£233,000 in pensions. This year, she should be relieved of that liability. South Australia has a surplus of more than Â£250,000, and Queensland a surplus of nearly Â£10,000. Tasmania had a deficiency. It is not known how much it was, but it cannot exceed Â£20,000 ; and; probably, when all the accounts are made up, will be found to have been inconsiderable. Western Australia, by reason of its exceptional position - which for some time to come will require special consideration from this Parliament - also had a deficiency. The Prime Minister is going to confer with Premiers who are well provided for the immediate future, and, instead of pledging our credit by entering upon a ridiculous borrowing policy, should insist upon the remission to us by the States of the sums which we are saving to them by paying old-age pensions. If we commence to borrow, the people of Australia will have much reason to regret it later on.Progress reported.","N/A","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[4]/continue[34]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
