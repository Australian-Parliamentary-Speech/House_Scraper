93,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CHIFLEY, Ben","A48","Macquarie","ALP","Treasurer",133,". -I move -That the bill be now read a second time.The purpose of the bill is to obtain a further loan appropriation or £75,000,000 in order to finance war expenditure from loan fund, and to authorize the raising of an equivalent amount of loan moneys in order to finance that expenditure.Loan Act (No. 2) 1941, approved by Parliament in October last, appropriated an amount of £50,000,000. This, with the balance of the appropriation available at the 30th June, 1941, covers war expenditure from loan fund up to about the middle of March, 1942. A further appropriation is therefore necessary in order to carry on our war plans. In existing circumstances, it is impossible to say with any degree of certainty what our requirements will be; but it is anticipated that the present bill will cover loan expenditure to the 30th June next.Since the beginning of the war, Parliament has granted war loan appropriations totalling £234,000,000. I need only add that, due to the circumstances of the moment, it is extremely difficult to determine exactly what the amount of loan expenditure will be. As honorable members are aware, the Commonwealth is associated with certain allied countries in connexion with different works.It is also difficult to anticipate the speed at whichmoney can be valuably spent. For this reason, it is not possible to gauge accurately the amount that it will be necessary to raise. Having before it as close an approximation as it is possible to make, the House is asked to approve of the raising and expending of the £75,000,000 for which provision is made in the measure.","Second Reading","LOAN BILL 1942","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[30]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
94,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FADDEN, Arthur William","F4T","Darling Downs","N/A","Leader of the Opposition",133,". - The Opposition does not raise any objection to the Government being given authority to raise and expend the amount provided for in this measure. It recognizes that money is indispensable in the prosecution of the war, particularly having regard to the degree of gravity that has developed within the last few weeks. But it is in total disagreement with the general financial policy that is being pursued by the Government.The Treasurer (Mr. Chifley) has asked the House to recognize the uncertainty of the amount of expenditure that will be necessary. What the honorable gentleman and the Government need to watch is the uncertainty of the ability of the Commonwealth to raise loan moneys, in view of the policy which the Government is pursuing. The present occasion is opportune to draw attention to what must be regarded as indisputable evidence of the trend of Commonwealth finances. The total of the short-term debt securities issued in Australia increased from £48,133,000 to £119,183,000 between the 31st July, 1941, and the 31st January, 1942. The increase of £71,000,000 was due to the dangerous methods of finance adopted by the Government. Is there any wonder that the Government now seeks authority to raise £75,000,000 by means of loans? It recognizes that its inflationary measures have carried it beyond what may be regarded as the safety point in the economic equilibrium of Australia. It has failed to measure up to the realities of the position by no less an amount than £71,000,000 between the 31stJuly, 1941, and the 31st January, 1942. When the budget was brought down. a gap of approximately £130,000,000 had to be bridged. The Government proposed to utilize the lending capacity of the community and to draw on bank credit. Loans have since been raised aggregating approximately £60,000,000, apart from the amount which had to pass to State Governments and semi-governmental bodies. Therefore, between now and the 30th June next an amount of £70,000,000 will have to be found. The estimate of expenditure made in the budget has been enormously exceeded, and it is ever-increasing. As the Treasurer has , stated, the actual amount is uncertain. Consequently, it itisnecessarytoobtainapprovaltoborrow a further £75,000,000.The Government has not adopted correct: methods in order to keep our finances on a sound basis. I invite honorable members to compare the position of savings bank deposits with the results achieved by voluntary contributions to war savings certificates. The savings bank deposits reached the startling figure of £266,000,000 at the end of 1941, an increase for the year of £22,000,000. In that same period the purchases of war savings certificates aggregated only £8,082,000. The increase of £22,000,000 in the savings bank deposits was only £1,000,000 less than the increase for the whole of the preceding five years. Here is a quantum of finance which has been left untouched. It constitutes a very great danger, particularly having regard to the financial policy of the Government. The spending power that it represents is being ever increased by loan expenditure and expenditure upon all other war activities in the community. By its adherence to voluntary contributions, theGovernment is neglecting a field that should be available to it, particularly in connexion with war savings certificates. Confidence is the basis of its policy. It would not agree to the adoption of the principle of compulsory loans, believing that it could obtain expeditiously the amount that it needed by handing round the hat, by appealing to the patriotic instincts of the people, by relying upon the people to devote their surplus earnings to war needs. The story of war savings certificates and bank deposits proves how futile has been the reliance it hasplaced in that particular form of contribution. The people upon whom it has to depend are those whose resources have been depleted by every financial measure that has been brought down. Regulations which arc at present before the House afford ample evidence of the unwisdom of the policy that has been adopted. The field which alone is available for voluntary contributions towards the huge volume of war expenditure is being eaten into by the limitation of profits, and the consequent reduction of commercial activity, as well as by ever-increasing taxation. The Government cannot have it every way. It cannot limit profits, fix prices and wages, thus reducing the incomes, and still expect to raise huge sums of money by voluntary loan. The Governments policy is based on confidence in the capacity of the people to contribute to loans, apart from the purchase of war savings certificates. Those investors who are being invited to contribute £75,000,000 to this war loan must have confidence in the policy of the Government. This brings me to the recent utterances of the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr. Ward). How can the Government appeal with confidence to the investing public if a responsible Minister makes statements of the kind which he made recently? There was nothing novel in what he said during the weekend; it was consistent with what he has been saying since he first became a member of this Parliament eleven years ago. Away back in 1931, he revealed himself as a staunch supporter of the Lang plan of repudiation. A leopard cannot change its spots, and the Minister for Labour has not changed his. I say that to his credit. He has stood by his principles - lie is consistent and persistent. He is the one man who has stood loyally by the platform of the Labour party ever since he has been associated with it. He stands now, as from the beginning, for the nationalization of the means of production, distribution and exchange. He is bold enough to say frankly what he means, and try to give effect to the policy in which he believes. Therefor*, unless and until the Prime Minister is prepared to disown the statements of the Minister for Labour and National Service. we must believe that what that gentleman has said represents the accepted policy of the Government. The responsibility rests upon the Prime Minister to say that his Government does not stand for .that policy. On the 18tl February, .1931, the honorable member for East Sydney, speaking in the Paddington Town Hall .at the opening of the East Sydney campaign, .said that he still -rood behind the proposals of Mr. Lang. Mis remarks were reported as follows: -The stand taken by Mr. Lang at the recent Premiers Conference was the most courageous thing ever done in the political history of the Commonwealth. Only those speakers who are prepared to stand behind the financial proposals of Jack Lang are going to take the platform during the present campaign.On the following day, Mr. Ward declared -am on the side of Jack Lang, and within six mouths there will be thousands more on his side than there are to-day.When the Financial Emergency State Legislation Bill was under discussion in this House in May, 1932, the member for Mast Sydney declared that the then Commonwealth Ministry might continue its vindictive and panicky attack upon the Labour Government in New South Wales, but its every move would be forestalled by Mr. Lang. Coming to November. 1938, we find Mr. Ward discussing the subject of monetary control. He said it should be remembered that the Commonwealth Parliament would not exercise supreme power unless it were given authority to determine monetary policy. The Labour party, be said, was in favour of granting such powers to the national Parliament, but the anti-Labour Government was not. During the debate on my budget in October of last year, the honorable member declared that he was of opinion that the best plan that could be followed by the Opposition when it became the Government, would be to put the private banks completely out of operation, and to allow the Commonwealth Bank to fulfil the function for which it was originally established.Government Members. - Hoar, bear !","Second Reading","LOAN BILL 1942","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[30]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
95,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FADDEN, Arthur William","F4T","N/A","N/A","N/A",135,"- That applause from supporters of the Government amounts to a declaration in support of the policy outlined by the Minister for Labour and National Service. The intention of the Government to take over the private banks has become apparent during the last few days. We have been told that the number of branches belonging to the trading banks must be reduced ; that branches will be closed wherever possible, and the business diverted to the Commonwealth Bank. That is in accordance with the policy for the nationalization of banking. Honorable members opposite say  Hear, bear . Therefore, we must believe that the whole financial structure of the country is in jeopardy if the Minister for Labour and National Service and those who follow him are to be allowed to have their way. I do not think that the Treasurer, who has a full realization of his responsibility, associates himself with the sentiments expressed by his colleague when addressing a Sydney congress of national unity for an allied victory last week-end. This is what the Minister for Labour and National Service is reported to have said -We should nut t)u asked to pay for the war afterwards by |m.yin;: interest on any loans that are raised now.That, in itself, is serious enough, coming as it did from a member of the present Ministry at a time when the Government is conducting an all-important war-loan campaign. I can sympathize with the Treasurer and the more responsible members of the Government. They want the loan to be a success, yet a leading member of the Cabinet, a man with ability and a considerable following, has stated that, in his opinion, no interest should he paid on war loans raised now. It would be a sorry day for Australia if the policy enunciated by the Minister for Labour and National Service were to be applied by the Government. The Prime Minister will, I am confident, give an assurance that the Government will honour its contractual obligations to pay interest, and that there will be no repudiation. The suspicion already aroused must be allayed, and that can only be done by the Prime Minister, as head of the Government, making a public declaration in this House that interest will be paid in terms of the contract on all money invested in the £35,000,000 war loan. If that be done, there will be no uncertainty in the minds of the people, and the loan will, in consequence, be a success.","Second Reading","LOAN BILL 1942","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[30]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
96,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"SPOONER, Eric","KUN","Robertson","N/A","N/A",136,".- I remind the House and the Treasurer (Mr. Chifley) that, up to the end of January, the Government has been obliged to lean on the system of shortloan credits through the central bank to the amount of more than £70,000,000. I have been very interested in the Treasurers statements and his declarations regarding the trend of expenditure. It is quite evident, that Australia is approaching a point where the annual war expenditure will be not less than £300,000,000. The amount by which it is found impossible this year to bridge the gap by revenue and loan is the amount by which the country will be compelled to depend upon its inner financial resources, and we are only at the beginning of that problem now. The Treasurer is quite well aware of the difficulties with which he will be confronted during the year 1942-43. I urge the Government to take steps now - not at some time in the future - to ensure that there shall be no inflation in Australia. Unless the Government is prepared courageously to tackle the rationing of supplies, inflation must follow. There are many difficulties in the way, and some of them are political. It is hard to devise machinery for putting the system into effect, but unless action be taken the financial difficulties of the Government will increase progressively. If the Government will embark upon a scheme for rationing it will receive much support from this side of the House. I shall give all the assistance I can, and so will many other honorable members on this side. Unless something be done to ensure that a greater propor tion of the money now passing through the industrial structure shall be diverted into government channels, the Treasurers financial difficulties next year will be very much greater than they are at present.","Second Reading","LOAN BILL 1942","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[30]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If the Government, in its wisdom, decides that, for the present, it cannot go further than it has gone in the direction of taxing the lower incomes, it should take what steps are necessary to limit the expenditure of those moneys which it leaves in the hands of private persons. That can be done only by introducing a system of rationing, if necessary by the use of coupons, in respect of consumer commodities. If the Government doe.not do this now. it will be forced to do so later.I urge the Government to be consistent in the application of its financial policy. It is not consistent for one department to endeavour to get as much money a? possible from the people by way of taxation, and for another department to try to force profits back into the hands of the public for further expenditure, which is the policy of the department administered by the Commissioner for Prices.","Second Reading","LOAN BILL 1942","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[30]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is evident that a demand for consumer goods of a non-war character is being set up in competition with war needs. That ia one of the Treasurers present difficulties, and that difficulty will be trebled next year unless action bo taken to remedy the position. TheGovernment will receive substantial support from members of the Opposition if it courageously tackles these two matters, namely, the rationing of consumer go 0(1 S and the necessity for obtaining consistency between the Treasury and the department responsible for limiting profits.","Second Reading","LOAN BILL 1942","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[30]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
101,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CALWELL, Arthur","BV8","Melbourne","N/A","N/A",137,".- The platform of the Labour party sets lit very clearly that money for war expenditure must be raised by taxation, and very member of the Labour party elected io this Parliament is pledged to support it. The policy of the Labour party opposes not only the raising of moneyIv loans for the conduct of the war, but also the payment of interest on such money. I am opposed to this bill because it proposes to continue the very bad, dangerous and disastrous practice that was pursued during the last war of placing upon posterity a burden so onerous that it cannot be borne. The Labour party did not decide without good mason to oppose the expenditure of loan money for war purposes. In reaching its decision, it was guided by the experience if years. It had approved of the expenditure of loan money only on reproductive works, helping to create and maintain a national asset, and on promoting the general welfare of the nation in a material way. The bill which lightly and airily authorizes the raising of £75,000,000 was introduced in a very few words and with very little explanation by the Treasurer (Mr. Chifley). To my mind this measure cuts directly across the platform and traditional policy of the Labour party. Because I had no opportunity in caucus to explain my views on this subject, I do not propose to vote for the bill now. An elementary knowledge of arithmetic hows just how impossible it will be for the country to pay interest at the rate >f 3 per cent, upon war loans. The in creased loan indebtedness of Australia as the result of the war is no less than H234,000,000. If the average rate of interest paid upon the loan be 3 per cent, per annum, we shall at the end of the next financial year be liable for the payment of £7,000,000. In addition, we 4i all be obliged to continue to pay that amount of interest for every year that the indebtedness remains.","Second Reading","LOAN BILL 1942","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[30]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The fact remain.? that we are liable for a payment in interest of £7,000,000 a year. We still owe large sums of money in respect of the last war. Consider the position 1 Twenty years after the conclusion of the last war, the Commonwealth was paying interest on war loans at the rate of £10,000,000 per annum. Many of those who are now fighting for Australia were not born when the debt was incurred. We still pay £7,^)0,000 a year in respect of our liabilities incurred in 1914-18. The result is that at the end of the next financial year we .shall pay £14,000,000 in interest on loans raised in respect of two wars. As the population of Australia is approximately 7,000,000, a per capita payment of £2 per annum in interest must be made to persons who lent the money for the proper conduct of those wars. That means that every man, woman and child, down to the latest born baby, is liable for £2 a year as an interest payment to those who invested in war loans. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Fadden) declared that that policy is a good one; he did not disagree with it. But when hp was Treasurer last year, he proposed to pay the workers only 2 per cent, on compulsory loans which he proposed to raise. .1 object to the payment of any interest on war loans. The Government should not beg for money that is required to conduct a war. It should not send spruikers to all parts nf the country for the purpose of pleading with people to invest in the war loan.","Second Reading","LOAN BILL 1942","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[30]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

As was said by the honorable member for Melbourne, we are still paying interest on money raised to fight, not only the last war, but also the battle of Waterloo. We are paying interest on something which does not exist, to the degree that many people believe, because credit is represented by book entries, in other words figures in a book. Money is the only thing in this world which is created out of nothing. It is shameful that to-day, while our own flesh and blood are being bombed, we should be arguing about interest. Money should be the last thing spoken about in connexion with the war. The Government has the full control of the natural resources of this country, and ii is only common sense that it should employ those resources and. in doing so. eliminate debt. Debt should not be incurred in the production of commodities. I put it another way: what has happened to all the production of Australia in the last 150 years - our wool, wheat, meat, butter and eggs, every mortal thing, even our beer, whisky and the  wine that maketh glau the heart of man? Where is it all? It has gone like the snows of yesteryear. All that remains is debt. Labour i3 the only wealth that this country has. If our fighting men laid down their arms and the munitions workers their tools what would happen? We should be gone a million . There is no doubt about it: Labour, not money, is the real wealth. This Parliament and every other Australian parliament could be laden with gold, silver, copper and notes, but that would not win the war. It is labour that will win it. While we argue over a few million pound? and as to whether we should pay interest or not the war is proceeding. I do not profess to be a financial expert, but I harp sufficient common sense to know that the money necessary to conduct the war should be created through the agency of our national Commonwealth Bank. That should be Australias policy. Call it nationalization of banking or credit expansion, I do not care what name it is called, but the fact remains that, if the present policy be persevered with, when we have achieved victory, which we certainly will have, we shall be saddled with a debt amounting to millions of pounds. War debts have never been paid in the past. All that has happened has been an accumulation more debt. In peace-time there was not sufficient money to keep our people in employment, but if this war goes on for another ten or fifteen years we shall have the money with which to fight it. Yet. if it finished tomorrow, our returned soldier.would be thrown on the scrap heap. Ji would be the same old tale that there wano money. I refuse to believe that the national credit cannot be used in orde: to provide, free of interest and debt, ever\ penny required for the war.","Second Reading","LOAN BILL 1942","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[30]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
127,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"HUTCHINSON, William","KIX","Deakin","N/A","N/A",140,".- 1 have always been a little curious as in what goes on behind the locked doors of the caucus room. I never realized thai we should see the day when there would be a caucus meeting open to the public. What we have heard to-day brings before the House and the country a very serious position regarding the way in which the Government is to proceed financially. Thi exhibition to-day shows quite clearly that the rank and file of the Labour party and sonic of the Ministers are in direct variance with other Ministers as to how war finance should be raised. This is most serious, because, at the moment, tinGovernment is appealing to the people i subscribe to a £35,000,000 Liberty Loan, and is using on posters the caption,  Yon dare not fail . If the present method of raising money is to continue it most certainly must be based on a foundation of confidence. The statements recently heard from some Labour Ministers and supporters, indicating the division which exists in the ranks of the Government, augur very little good for the success of government loans. The interesting suggestion has been made that we should not borrow or pay interest. I have not heard it suggested that the money should be raised entirely by the expansion of central bank credit expansion. It has been said quite definitely that the money needed should be raised by taxes. Is that not a little different from what we have heard on other occasions? When theLeader of the Opposition (Mr. Fadden) has directed attention to the fact that a large proportion of the people of Australia escape with very little taxation honorable gentlemen opposite have taken a definite stand against the taxing of that section of the people. But, if the money needed for war purposes is to be raised ny taxation, the Government will have to dig deep into the pockets of the small wage-earners. We are spending 22 per cent. or 23 per cent, of the national income on the war. It has been estimated that when our anticipated programme is in full swing we shall be spending 35 per cent, of the national income on the war. Great Britain is spending between to and 50 per cent, of its national income for war purposes. Before this war ends, or even before we are on the path to victory, Australia will also have io spend considerably more than 35 per cent, of its national income on the war. These figures have been placed before cbe House on many occasions. Our national income has been calculated by the Commonwealth Statistician at about £870,000,000 a year, of which only £95,000,000 goes to people with incomes ranging upwards from £1,000. It has been estimated that of that £95,000,000 Federal, State and Municipal taxation absorbs between 60 per cent, and 75 per cent. I remind honorable members of the figures already given in respect of the group earning from £400 to £1,000 a year. Their aggregate income is £145,000,000. The big reservoir of money is in the possession of the people earning less than £400 a year. Those earnings amount to £560,000,000. On the argument put forward by the honorable member for Melbourne (Mr. Calwell) and certain other honorable members opposite, it is palpable that the money needed cannot be raised even it we take the whole of the incomes of those who earn more than £400 a year. It is obvious, therefore, that, if taxation is to he employed in order to raise all the money needed, we must heavily tax those in receipt of less than £400 a year. And that has been opposed vociferously in the past by honorable gentlemen opposite. Time and time again it has been said that those people must be left untouched. Yet some Government members have entirely reversed their attitude and are plainly saying to the wage-earner,  We have to tax you heavily in order to find the money with which to fight the war .I expected that the Prime Minister (Mr. Curtin) would be in his place to-day to answer the queries and statements of honorable members. He should be hen-, and after the exhibition in this House to-day some statement must be made to us as to whether the Labour party is to follow the dictates of men outside Parliament. I wonder if the secretary of the Iron-workers Union, who wished that  the crowd at Downingstreet would be scrapped along with the rest , plays a part in the framing of the Governments policy. I wonder if Morrison, of the Liquor and Allied Trade? Union, who would rather his nine children in the grave than in khaki, helps to frame the Governments policy, lt i.high. time the Prime Minister came into this chamber and listened to his own colleagues on this matter and to the complete overthrow of previous arguments. He must make a clear and unequivocal sta lament to this country as to the direction in which the Government is to travel. If the Government intends to depend upon voluntary loans to raise money for war purposes - and it has chosen to adopt that course - it must appeal to the people of Australia who, in the past, have been thrifty enough to save money and so have become  little capitalists, for taxation is taking the great bulk of the incomes of persons in receipt of more than £1,000 a year.It is essential to the success of the voluntary loans that thrifty people be asked :  Will you give us your money in order to make the loan a success? To that question must be added :  We dare not fail . As this is the declared policy of the Government, it stand? to reason that everything must be done to prevent any undermining of the confidence of small investors. Certain national security regulations which have recently been, gazetted appear to many people to be skids under the capitalist system of this country.","Second Reading","LOAN BILL 1942","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[30]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We require in this House to-day a definite and clear statement of the Governments policy in this regard.Recent outbursts by the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr. Ward ) have been mentioned in this debate. I agree with the honorable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron) that if that Minister holds the views that have been attributed to him, the only honorable course open to him is to resign from the Government. If he cannot support the Government on a vital matter of policy like that, he should resign. That is the only honorable thing for him to do.

To ensure this countrys defence and its triumph over the powers that threaten it, the munitions workers, the miners and the people engaged in all our war industries give their services. The soldier, the sailor and the airman each offers his life. Is it too much to expect the moneyed man to give his money without expecting interest returns? Such action by those in a position to lend their money in the defence of their country and of themselves would definitely not damage the credit of this nation, but would be to its everlasting credit.I say to certain honorable members who have accepted the reports of some daily newspapers as their authorities, that there have been occasions in the past when they have not been so ready to do so.

The. Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Fadden) properly brought up the subject of a statement made by a Minister of the Crown who is now serving in the Government - a statement which, if accurately reported, was calculated to have a most damaging effect upon the finances of this country in time of war. The Minister for Labour and National Service, as he was entitled to do, explained the statement he had made. I can see no reason whatever for the subsequent stream of abuse from him, directed at various members of this chamber. All that I want to sayabout the original statement, as it was reported in the newspapers, is this:What the Minister was reported to have said had the widest possible circulation in Australia. It had that circulation at a time when a war loan of firstimportance was being floated. Until this afternoon it had not been the subject of any correction whatever by the Minister. For I do not knowhow many days, that damaging statement has had currency.Mr.Rosevear. - It did not do as much damage as was done by the shipping of scrap iron from Australia to Japan.","N/A","WANTED - £2,000,000 IN A WEEK","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[31]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I am not going to be drawn off by even  red  scrap iron, but shall direct myself to this problem. I say that the Minister is open to the very greatest censure, not only bythis House but also by the Leader of the Government, for having permitted to go into circulation a statement of the most damaging kind. I should be the last to suggest that on every occasion on which a Minister, or any body else, had been misreported, he should correct the misreport. Far be it from me to suggest that; because he would probablyhave time to do little else. But this was a case of a special kind. This was a matter of major importance, and this last moment explanation by the Minister will, I am afraid, go only a small distance towards repairing the damage that has been done. But I did not rise to say more than that on that point. I rose to draw the attention of senior and responsible members of this Government to the fact that we witnessed this afternoon one of the most extraordinary events within my recollection of politics. We have had a Minister speaking from the table as a Minister and in no other capacity - for noMinister can speak from the table of this Housie as a private citizen - and propounding two policies. The first of them is that, putting on one side past contracts, and also, it would appear, the contract that is now being made in respect of this current loan, no interest shall be paid on future loan raisings for r.his war. That is a statement of policy made during a debate on the very bill which is to authorize the raising of money for war purposes. Did the Minister speak for the Government? 1 think I am justified in pausing for a reply.","N/A","WANTED - £2,000,000 IN A WEEK","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[31]/speech[2]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Never before have we been faced with such dangers as now confront us, and a stranger walking into the House to-day and listening to the speech of the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr. Ward) might be pardoned for believing that, if we continue to debate an all-in war effort in the way that he did and to propound such principles, we do not deserve to win the war. I, in common with many thousands of other men, took part in the last war. We were short of men and materials on many occasions, and we wondered what on earth Parliament: was doing. It does not seem that Parliament has improved much in the last 25 years if we are to have a repetition of what has occurred to-day on the other side of the chamber. Nothing but the best will enable us to pull through. Every body must help in the prosecution of a common plan, from the raising of the money to giving to every man in the front line the maximum of equipment and support. We need men, money and munitions. We need money with which to provide the men with equipment and munitions of war; yet, on the basic principle of the manner in which that money is to be raised, the party supporting the Government has become hopelessly divided. One Minister holds opinions directly opposite to those held by the Government, and the honorable member for Melbourne (Mr. Calwell) and the honorable member for Riverina (Mr. Langtry), by their speeches, have clearly indicated their opposition to the Government. Many other Government members, by shouting Hear, hear have indicated their support of the Minister as against the Government. Without sound backing, the Government cannot make a supreme war effort. Parliament,as it is atpresent constituted, cannot effectively conduct the war unless it changes its attitude and shows a greater spirit of co-operation. The Government should reconsider its position because it has no majority, so many of its own followers being opposed to paying any interest on Joans, and without a majority, it cannot inspire confidence in the people. My experience when visiting country districts has been that people have no confidence in the Government, and draw no inspiration from it. Accordingly, I appeal to the Government, before it is too late, to reflect upon the incidents that have occurred this afternoon and put its house in order.I leave this thought with honorable members. We shall not win the war unless we put forward our maximum effort. We cannot obtain that maximum effortunless we have a common plan, in which every one believes. That plan is required to raise the necessary funds, to produce war materials, and to engender among the populace an enthusiasm akin to fanaticism. That spirit is not to be found in the Parliament or in the country under the present Governments leadership and the spectacle that we have witnessed this afternoon will do irreparable harm.","N/A","WANTED - £2,000,000 IN A WEEK","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[31]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

214,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BLACKBURN, Maurice","JPN","N/A","N/A","N/A",149,"- I do not agree that the object was to split the Government, because those interests considered that a government deprived of the Minister for Labour and National Service would not be so offensive to them. It is idle for the right honorable member for Kooyong (Mr. Menzies) to deprecate what happened in the House this afternoon, when he knows that he and other members of the Opposition are the cause of it. They took this, their first opportunity, to make an attack upon the Minister, in the belief that he would be repudiated by his fellow Ministers and by private members of the Labour party. WhilstI do notagree with every statement that the Minister has made, I doagree with his declaration that we should not borrow money for the purpose of financing the war, and pay interest on it. That is all the Minister said, and the majority of Australians will agree with him. There was nothing in his statement that condemned the payment of interest upon obligations that have already been contracted.Mr.harrison.-Sothatthisloanwill bear nointerest! Is that the idea ? The honorable member for Bourke (Mr. Blackburn) is holding a brief for the Minister.Mr.BLACKBURN. - I am not; I am merely expressing my own opinions. But as I have been charged with holding a brief for the Minister, I may say that ifthecountryweredeprivedofhisservices, it would be muchpoorer for the loss. He isoneofour leaders in whom the masses of the people have great confidence. The Government would stand much lower in popular esteem if he were not a member of theCabinet. The fact that he is a Minister is a guaranteeto the people that their cause will be fought for and that their interests will be safeguarded.good deal has been made by honorable members opposite about alleged divisions in the Cabinet.We had the spectacle of Satan rebuking Sin when the honorable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron) made that charge. When hewasa member of the Menzies Government, his policyalways differed from that of his colleagues. Finally, he forced a general election upon the country. Other members of the Cabinet favoured an approach to the British Government for an extension of the life of the Commonwealth Parliament, but the honorable member, at Bairnsdale, denounced that proposal. So it is not for him or for others to talk about divisions in Cabinet. Attention has also been directed to what has been described as a difference of opinion  among Ministers. Since the outbreak of war differences of opinion among Ministers of all parties have not been unknown.The people are tremendously disappointed that the Government proposes to continue the policy of borrowing money. Some of the appeals which have been made to people to contribute to the war loan were exactly the same as those which were resorted to during the last war. The practice is to tell people :  It is not necessary for you to have any money in order to support the war loan.You can borrow it from a bank . As I have often pointedout, that procedure causes inflation. What is more,we have to pay interest onthe inflationary loan. If we must - and it appears that we must -have inflation, I prefer notto pay interestupontheinflation;Isupportan expansionistpolicywhichcallsforno interest.inmyopinion,wehavereached thestagewhenwecanmitigatetheinflationarycharacterofourfinancebycontrollingwages,profitsandexpenditure and by rationing goods so that no person shallget too much, or toolittle. The policy oftheGovernment has disappointed and depressedthepeople. Although theenemy isatttacking our territories, we are told thattheonlywayin whichwecanobtain money for the conduct of the war is by undertakingtopay interest. Repeatedly I haveheardappealsofthis nature. The prudent and wise man will invest in war loans because after the war he will be theonlyperson who will have any means. There will be a depression; wages will be reduced; and profits will be very limited. Consequently, the only person in the community who will have anything is the man who draws interest from his investments in warloans. I do not agree with everything that the Minister for Labourand National Service has said, but I agree, with the great majority of the people, that he is a consistent and courageous champion of the masses. He can be relied upon to be their consistent and courageous champion, and it is because he fills that role that influences outside the House are trying to get rid of him.","N/A","WANTED - £2,000,000 IN A WEEK","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[31]/speech[5]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
215,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"ANTHONY, Hubert","JLZ","Richmond","N/A","N/A",150,".- If the enemy wanted to take advantage of us, one of the methods that he would adopt would be the creation of discord and suspicion in our ranks. One of the modern theories of war is that you can weaken your enemy by propaganda and the creation of class suspicion and hatred, and achieve as much by internal disruption as by the power of armed divisions. In this instance, somebody has done a grave disservice to Australia by creating in the minds of the people a. feeling of disquiet and distrust of the financial stability of this country during the war. I am not concerned with the theories of the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr. Ward), I do u-o-fe- know what he actually said. Perhaps, he was misreported. If that were so,, he should have, issued a correction at tha earliest possible moment before the damage was done. However, he allowed the public to believe that he had used those words. I am not one who regards cbe raising of money by loans as- the best method of financing the war;. Upon this subject, I have very much in common with the Minister, for Labour and National Service, and other members of the Government. In my opinion, a large percentage of war finance - I doubt whether the whole could- be found by this method - should come from current savings from current production. The best method- by which to obtain that, is- by taxation. However,, that is not the policy of the Government. When the Government of which I was a- member attempted to put that policy into practice, the Labour party criticized it, and succeeded in defeating it. If the Minister for Labour and National Service challenges our sincerity, we are- at perfect liberty to challenge his sincerity. The only n.*to which an individual can put profits is to purchase privileges with them. Money is of no use to an individual unless he can- buy something with it, either in the form of goods or privileges. I should like to know whether the Minister for Labour and National- Service- has, to date, set an example to the country bv surrendering some of his ministerial privileges. Although the Government is appealing to people to make greater- sacrifices than ever before, Ministers take to themselves greater and greater privileges. The Minister for Labour and National Service is probably the greatest exponent of that policy. He has a bigger staff of supernumeraries and of assistants than any other Minister. What is the value of their services? What remuneration do his colleagues, pals and friends get? Are they receiving £2 2s. or £2 10s. a day, tax-free, or are they giving their services voluntarily, being satisfied with their parliamentary allowance of £1,000 per annum ?","N/A","WANTED - £2,000,000 IN A WEEK","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[31]/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I have seen around the House in the entourage of Ministers men, who-, from; appearances at any rate, might well be doing some more active job than penpushing or paper-carrying, jobs, which could be done by girls or people not of military capacity.I have a lot in common with honorable gentlemen opposite who. have expressed views about the raising, of money. 1 agree that money could be raised by a stroke of the pen at the bank.. The best way to make that possible is by reducing ordinary civil consumption. The things that would, normally be bought, would not, be bought, and the money that would, normally be expended on their purchase would be available in the form of savings for diversion to the war effort. We could, as the honorable member for Maranoa (Mr. Baker) has so often proclaimed, finance the war through the Commonwealth bank, but that would do nothing to reduce civil consumption or divert money to the production of war needs. War production can be increased by no other means than community saving enforced by the, restriction of production and sale of civil goods. That is the reason for the loan programme and heavy taxation as against the creation of credit. It would be easy to finance the war through the Commonwealth Bank, but that would not make available one extra bullet or blanket or whatever be needed for war purposes.I regret that the debate has taken its present course. I did not rise in order to have the Minister for Labour and National Service disciplined, as was suggested by the honorable member forBourke (Mr. Blackburn); but that Minister holds a. high and responsible post. tie has great importance and power, and, if he exercises that power with the vindictiveness which the community is beginning to believe he is using, there will be no confidence among large sections of the community. Confidence may be felt by the sections which support him, but the Government needs to have behind it the whole of the community, not just a part of it. If we lose the war, and this country, as we easily might, it will be because of disunity amongst ourselves and our failure to organize and realize on our total resources. This country can be defended, hut only by strong concerted and united action by us all. No Minister has the right to strike a discordant note in the policy of his government and thereby create distrust. He who does so, does to r.hp country a disservice of no small magnitude. I hope that the Minister for Labour and National Service in the discharge of his high functions will try ro bring an impartial judgment to the problems on which he is required to adjudicate. Otherwise vast sections of the people will have no faith or confidence in, or hope for the future of this Government.","N/A","WANTED - £2,000,000 IN A WEEK","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[31]/speech[6]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
220,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MORGAN, Charles","JVA","Reid","N/A","N/A",152,".- I do not desire to impede the Government in its desire to have this legislation passed, hut, I have to make clear where I stand. 1 deplore the fact that the Government feels that it is bound to adopt the method of raising money set out in this proposed legislation. I am in full accord with the sentiments of the honorable member for Riverina (Mr. Langtry), and I cannot put the matter in better words than he used. It is time we realized that we are losing this war. Why, we have i>t every round! The only points we have trained have been those won by our Russian ally. It is because we have adopted the wrong organization and the wrong method of finance that, in spite of the fact that our resources of men are four times as great, as those of the Axis powers - we have 1.200.000.000 people as against their 300,000,000 in manpower - and the bulk nf the raw materials, we cannot take a single point. If we had a proper monetary system, we could bring our preponderance of man-power and raw materials together. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Fadden) let the cat out of the bag when he described money as being an indispensable commodity. He snowed that money has become a commodity lent out at a profit instead of being a means of bringing men and materials together. The only way to make money serve its true purpose is by using it to bring men and materials together. Until we do so we shall continue losing in this war. We must make money the servant instead of the master of man.I deprecate the attacks made on the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr. Ward), who is to be commended on the stand he has taken, even though he is a member of the Government. It is obvious to anybody who has been here to-day and has read the inspired press references to the Minister for Labour and National Service that the attacks upon him are guided by an unseen hand. It has gone out into the country that  Ward has to be put on the skids . Every effort will be made to drive the honorable member out of the Government. If possible this opportunity will be used to split the Ministry, especially by those who desire to raise the old issue of a national government. The days of the old hustings catch-cries of  sound finance ,  inflation ,  confidence  and 60 on used in order to create fear, have gone. They were used in order to retain power by the people who represent moneyed interests. It is now time, as the Minister for Labour and National Service has intimated, that, profit wa> taken out of war. ft is unfortunate that the honorable members opposite who have villi fi ed the Minister for Labour and ti onn I Service do not follow the example set bv the honorable member for Robertson (Mr. Spooner), who was constructive, not destructive, when be suggested that the resources of the country should be pooled, that commodities should be rationed and mobilized. and that recourse should be bad to the coupon system. That would do away with the present financial system and make money perform its true function as a measure or yardstick. Then we would be in a position in which our resources could be directed to the objective which we all have. We would have food, clothing and shelter, which is all we need. Of what use would it be to make profits and accumulate money if this country were to be taken by the enemy, who is almost on our shores? If that policy of pooling our resources were applied, our effort would be  all-in  and we could apply ourselves to the prosecution of the war to a successful end.We have not only the enemy outside to consider; we have the enemy within - money power. That is the real enemy confronting us. That is as true to-day as it was when Lincoln said -There are two enemies I have to fight - the one in front ofme - the Confederate Army, which I can seek out and deal with effectively, and the one behind - the unseen money power - which is more subtle in its methods and is the more insidious of the two.We have that enemy within to-day; it is as insidious as it was in Lincolns day, and it has to be dealt with as effectively as the enemy without. The out-of-date money system is clogging the war effort. The influences behind that system are responsible for the attack upon the Minister for Labour and National Service. Those same influences are at the back of an effort to institute an even more orthodox method of finance than that which operates to-day.

223,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"HARRISON, Eric","KNX","N/A","N/A","N/A",153,"- The section dealing with coupons. The honorable member for Bourke said that there was a concerted attack on the Minister for Labour and National Service, designed to drive him out of the Cabinet. That is not so. The honorable member for Bourke said that the masses bad no greater champion than the Minister for Labour and National Service. If the masses had to look to him for the lead which they need in this war they would be disappointed. They would fail to get inspiration, leadership or direction and, indeed, would be a leaderless mob. There is no need for honorable members on this side to seek for the honorable member to be driven from the Cabinet. All that necessary is that the people shall read extracts from Hansard reports of speeches made by the Minister when he was in opposition. When what he said then i.made known to the people outside they will demand his withdrawal from the Government as probably the most dangerous member any Australian government has ever had in war-time. On the 5th November, 1936. speaking on the Estimates in this chamber the honorable member said - i should not be prepared to take up arms against the workers of any country, whether they be German or of any other nationality As a matter of fact, because I am not prepared to do that, I am not prepared to tell others to do so. i believe, and judging by statements made by honorable members on both sides of the committee it seems to be generally agreed, that Australia would find it very difficult, if not impossible, to defend itself against an aggressor.This is the man who the member for Bourke says is the champion of the masses. In 1936, he said that he would not take up arms against Germany or any aggressor. In other words he isready to let Japan flog its way through this country and take over all the resources of Australia. This is the man who when the pressure is applied will break. He is a manof the type of those Ministers in the FrenchCabinet whocaused the capitulation of France. This is the man who as a private member said that he would not take up arms to defend this country. He is a man of fixed opinions; as the Leader of the Opposition has said, this man is at least consistent and whether in office or out of office attacksthose of opposite politics to his own. There was no need for the specious pleading of the honorable member for Bourke when he was directing attention to what he considered to be a direct and organized attack on the Minister for Labour and NationalService from this side of the House. The people generally need only to have statements of the kind attributed to the Minister published in order to withdraw their support from public loans. The Minister is definitely the weak link in the Cabinet and he should be removed. I believe that he would be the first person to advise the workers of this country not to take up arms against their fellow workers, even though they might be Germans or Japanese. He would say in effect :  Whatever they are, they are fellow workers .","London.

He commended this bill to the House, yet he finds one of his ministerial colleagues propounding a financial policy entirely different from that propounded by the Government as a whole. He knows full well that he will be required to answer to the House for the statements made by the Minister for Labour and National Service. He, and some other honorable gentlemen in the Government who do not favour the policy advocated by the Minister for Labour and National Service, do not desire to have either their characters or their credentials assailed. The fact is that the outlook of the Minister for Labour and National Service on financial issues has not changed. From time to time he ha.made statements to the effect that he would not contribute a penny towards the defence of his country. Such statements must inevitably affect contributions to public loans.The honorable gentleman has made no secret of hisbelief that interest should not be paid on money lent to defend the country. He has said that people should not receive any interest on money lent for war purposes. He stated in the House to-day that he was referring to past obligations, but when he was asked by responsible members of the Opposition whether his remarks had application to this billhe was silent. His ministerial colleagues also were silent. I suggest that the honorable gentlemans attitude is designed to bring about a profound change in the financial policy of Australia. It will be remembered that quite recently certain regulations dealing with the economic organization in this country were tabled. The Government ha? appointed a special committee to report upon them. That would not have been done had the Minister for Labour and National Service had his way. I am sure that we should get no modification of the regulations if the decision depended upon the Minister.

The Minister has made it clear that he is not in favour of paying interest on future war loans and he has been supported by other honorable gentlemen opposite. The honorable member for Kooyong (Mr. Menzies) specifically directed the attention of the Treasurer to his colleagues statement and asked for a definite pronouncement on- the subject by a responsible Minister. If the Minister for Labour and National Service cannot support the Governments financial policy, his course is clear. He should be courageous enough to resign from the Cabinet forthwith. Failing such action, he should beignominiously removed. Undoubtedly,his attitude is undermining the confidence of the people in the Government. People are not likely to subscribe to new loans if they fearthat interestwill not be paid according to the undertakings given.","London.

230,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,"FALSTEIN, Sydney","KEU","N/A","N/A","N/A",155,"- Does the honorable member suggestthat their patriotism may be measured by a percentage of interest?Mr.HARRISON. - The patriotism of the honorable member forWatson (Mr: Falstein) has never been, and is not likely to be measured. He will always be up in the air and not on the ground staff: We have listened this afternoon to speeches by the honorable member for Bourke (Mr. Blackburn), the honorable member for Reid (Mr. Morgan), the honorable member for Melbourne (Mr. Calwell), the Minister for Labour and National Service, and the Minister for War Organization of Industry (Mr. Dedman), all of whom referred at length to the payment of interest on loans. I have been unable to find one point on which they agreed with thefinancial policy of the Government as indicated by this bill. Each of them enunciated principles contrary to that policy. It is high time, therefore, that the Governmentsought an adjournment of the House in order to hold a party meeting to formulate a financial policy that will be favoured by its supporters as a whole. If we are to make an effective war effort, we must be a united people, and have complete confidence in our Government. I regret that, so far, we have not had an unambiguous pronouncement on financial policy from a responsible member of the Ministry. Until that has been made, the views of honorable members on this bill must remain seriously unsettled. It would appear that some honorable members opposite place the financial views of the Minister for Labour and National Service in the forefront of their political policy.Sibling suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m.Mr.ROSEVEAR (Dalley)[8.0]. -A good deal of heat has been engendered in this debate. I have listened closely to it, in order to see whether the Opposition is in agreement with,or is opposed to, the proposal contained in the bill. So faras I have been able to discover, a positive determination has been made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Fadden) and his followers, not to support the bill but to make as muchparty political capital as possible out of statements published in the press. Their passions have been torn to shreds and tatters over the question of whether the Ministerfor Labour and National Service (Mr. Ward) was correctly reported in a statement he is alleged to have made in the press. I believe that the honorable gentleman has to-day given a flat, contradiction of the construction which honorable members opposite desire to put. upon that statement. His failure to take the trouble to chase up with a denial every incorrect statement made in the press is regarded by the Opposition as evidence of his guilt and the accuracy of thepress statement. Any denial that he might make would merely draw from the press a counter-denial, and no one would be any wiser. Honorable members opposite have publicly expressed a desire to co-operate with the Government in carrying on the war effort; yet, they seize upon any matter, however trivial it may be, that is calculated to embarrass the Government. That has been clearly demonstrated to-day by their efforts to set one Minister against another in a controversy as to which was expressing the policy of Labour. Instead of co-operating with the Ministry, their endeavours are directed towards its disruption by the playing of one Minister against another. Their impassioned speeches have been actuated by political hatred of the Minister for Labour and National Service. When that honorable gentleman has the courage to tell them exactly what he did say, they are not. prepared to accept his explanation, but prefer to take for granted everything that is published in the press. Honorable members who sit on this side of .the House are not slaves bound to the party wheel, as are honorable members who sit opposite. We are entitled at all times to express our views in regard to party policy and the manner in which it is applied. Any honorable member, whether he be a Minister or a rank and file member, has the right to express his >pinion if he believes that there has been departure from the party platform by cbe Ministry. Furthermore, in view of The changed conditions brought about by the war, he is entitled to place on the platform of the party whatever interpretation he considers the Labour movement intended should be placed on it in a given set of circumstances. lt is as well to consider what the platform of the Labour party is in regard to defence, and the measures that should be adopted in order to finance it. The defence policy sets out that it shall be financed by the operation of Labours financial policy; and that policy very definitely states that naval and military expenditure shall be allocated from direct taxation. When the policy of direct taxation for the purpose of naval or military expenditure is departed from any member of the party is entitled to check up in order to determine whether or not the Ministry is departing from the platform of the party. Furthermore, Labour? financial policy lays down that there shall be restriction of public borrowing. I. am beginning to wonder whether this bill, and every other loan measure that the Labour Government has asked this House to pass, are in conformity with the platform of the party in relation to publicIkirrowing. It. might be said in justification of the adoption of this practice, that taxation has reached the limit. Honorable members opposite say that it has not; they would like the Government to invade the lower ranges of income in order to collect a greater amount of revenue. Possibly the Treasurer believes that the limit of taxation has been reached, and that the leeway must be made up by means of public borrowing. If this bill is not the result of consultation with the rank and file members of the party, any one of them is perfectly justified in criticizing it. to the degree that it departs from the policy of the party. It has been said that the Minister for Labour and National Service should resign because, apparently, he disagrees with this procedure. Whether he resigns or not, is to be taken as evidence of whether or not he possesses personal courage. I put it to honorable members that if a man ran away from, his convictions that would not be a display of courage, but that, on the contrary, he would display courage if he were prepared to stand his ground in the Cabinet as well as in this House, in defence of views which he conceived to be in line with the policy of the party.The Minister has suggested that interest should not be offered in connexion with the raising of future loans. That is regarded as a revolutionary proposal. I agree that it is. He has not advocated that contracts already made with the public shall be repudiated. I put it to the House that the Labour party has already made a revolutionary change in its defence policy. It was committed to voluntaryism in defence, but has accepted the principle of conscription for military service. There have been no howls from the Opposition on that account. When the Government departs from voluntaryism and tends towards the reactionary policy that our opponents espouse, they welcome the change of front; but when we suggest that interest shall not be payable in connexion with future loans, they repudiate the idea. In recent regulations, the Government has gone dangerously close to industrial conscription, which to the Labour movement is anathema to a. greater degree than is military conscription. Honorable members opposite have not chided us on that account. They have attempted to prove that the suggestion of the Minister for Labour and National Service, if adopted, would damage public morale. Public morale can be damaged in a number of ways. I. suggest that infinitely more damage could be done by the suggestion, of honorable members opposite that the restriction of profits will lend to the restriction of investment in loans. Nothing could be more damaging to the morale of the great bulk of the people than the belief that there is in this House a substantial party, which has been the Government and may again be the Government before the termination of the war, and which holds the view that a certain section is so paltry as to show patriotism only in the measure of the profits it can extract from the nation. The morale of the people can be damaged also by the bombardment of our cities by enemy ships and bombers. I remind honorable members opposite that quite recently Australia was bombed by Japanese raiders. A story told by an evacuee from New Guinea is to the effect that a piece of scrap iron from a bomb dropped on that territory was marked,  Thank you, Mr. Menzies . Such an incident is most damaging to public morale. Which is likely to be the most damaging - the policy suggested by the Minister for Labour and National Service, the current policy of the members of the Opposition, or the policy of those gentlemen less than two years ago? Let us examine, first, the damage to the prospects of the loan which might be caused if interest were not payable. When will this interest be paid? Payment will be made in postwar years, when the mass of the people of Australia will be paying for this war in starvation and tears; when broken soldiers, who have fought to protect this country in the interests of those who have money to invest, will be walking about like mendicants looking for a dole from the Repatriation Department; when people are reconstructing their broken homes, which have taken them a lifetime of energetic endeavour to procure. At that stage, these patriots who lend their money to the Government will be collecting interest on it with monotonous regularity. When the war is over, and work in munitions factories ceases, the unemployed will number perhaps 500,000. Those men will almost certainly have to search for work, and live on dole tickets, whilst these patriots, whom honorable members opposite are so feverishly endeavouring to protect, will be collecting their interest regularly. Present that picture to the people of Australia - the post-war picture, when levy is being paid to the interest-mongers - and then see whether honorable members opposite would be game enough, with all their humbug, to fight an election on it. That is the first test - damage to the loan prospects because there is to be no interest. Let us examine the second proposition of honorable members opposite, namely, that if you restrict profits, you will discourage investment in war loans. What sort of policy is that to put before the people? How are you to improve the morale of the public if you must tell them that, unless you allow a certain class ruthlessly to exploit them, the members of that class will not invest their money in war loans? There is only one logical conclusion to be drawn from that : the greater the profit you allow some people to extort from the public, the greater will be the success of the war loan.","London.

232,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"ROSEVEAR, John","L08","N/A","N/A","N/A",157,"- That is the inevitable conclusion to which the arguments of honorable members opposite lead. I was interested to hear the honorable member for Kooyong (Mt. Menzies), who usually acts as backstop for the Opposition when things are going badly for them, put forward a specious case on what turned out to be an incorrect newspaper report. After all,, of what use is it to be a lawyer if you cannot put up some sort of an argument even on a bad case? He asked what would people of Australia think of the Minister for Labour and National Service who dared to say that future war loans should be interest free. A few weeks ago, the honorable member for Kooyong told the House that for two years, while he was Prime Minister, he knew that we would have to fight Japan ; yet, during those two years, he forced the waterside workers with threats of gaol and deregistration to load pig iron for Japan. Now he tells us what the people would do to the Minister for Labour and National Service if they had the chance. I would rather hear the people say, Hang the Minister for Labour and National Service, than hear the Japanese say,  Thank you, Mr. Menzies , as they have done for his part in providing them with supplies of scrap iron. The honorable member for Wentworth (Mr. Harrison) quoted the statement of the honorable member for EastSydney (Mr. Ward) in 1936 that he did not want to fight the workers of any country, and, incidentally, that he did not want to fight the German workers. Did any one know with any degree of certainty who would be fighting whom in this war until the nations had actually taken sides? InHansard I could turn up columns of rubbish talked by some honorable members about countries which are now in the enemys camp. The statement of the Minister for Labour and National Service, referred to by the honorable member for Wentworth, was made in 1936, and the people of his electorate have returned him twice since then, and his party has by plebiscite elected him a member of the Government. The same honorable members opposite, who were responsible for selling scrap iron to Japan, were, if I remember rightly, responsible for the attempt to lease the Yampi iron ore deposits to Japan. About the time the honorable member for East Sydney was saying that he did not want to fight the German workers, those other honorable members wanted to provide the Japanese with unlimited supplies of iron ore.","London.

239,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"ROSEVEAR, John","L08","N/A","N/A","N/A",158,"- It is a suggestion from a very good Labour man. Honorable members opposite are scandalized at the suggestion that they, and other members of their class, should accept food coupons, but I never heard any of them condemn the issuing of dole coupons to the unemployed.For ten years they thought it good enough to issue food coupons to the men who are the present heroes of the workshops making munitions with which to fight the enemy. That is their contribution, whilst the contribution of honorable members opposite is a continuous heckling of the trade unions. Those honorable gentlemen have expressed great enthusiasm for the £75,000,000 loan for the purpose of destruction. The same honorable members, during the depression years, held up their hands in holy horror when it was suggested that a few million pounds might be raised to give work to the unemployed. They are always enthusiastic about war loans, but they have no enthusiasm for work loans for the purpose of making life bearable for those suffering the worst effects of depression. There is an obvious difference between the financial outlook of the Government and that of the Opposition. We support a policy of taxation for defence purposes, together with a restricted loan policy. 1 hope that the Government will not tempt the loyalty of the party too far by going in too much for loans. The defence policy which I have just enunciated is the one to which we have always subscribed, the one upon which we won our seats in thisParliament, andit is up to us to ensure that that policy shall not be departed from too widely.Honorable members opposite are still harping on the fact that the Government has failed to make greater inroads into small incomes. They are perturbed at the fact that an amount of £500,000,000 is received each year by the lower-paid workers, but none of them told the House just how many people share that money, and how much is left to each of them after he pays his taxes. The honorable member for Deakin (Mr. Hutchinson) still bemoans the fact that the Labour party is not prepared to dig deeper into i lie earnings of the lower-paid workers. 1 commend the Government for not having done so. If it dug much deeper into the pockets of the workers, who are [he real wealth producers of the country, it might then logically present them with loin cloths and rice howls. They would have no money to put in their pockets any way, so that a loin cloth would do them well enough.Mr. HOLT(Fawkner) [8.26TJ. - I think it might be well for me to deal first with one of the larger red-herrings drawn across the path by the honorable member for Dalley (Mr. Rosevear). I refer to the popular story about the scrap iron which the Menzies Government allowed 10 be exported to Japan. The time has come when the full facts regarding this matter should be made public, and they are very different from the story told by members of the present Government for political purposes. This problem cropped up again last year while I was Minister for Labour. We received a report that there was likely to be industrial trouble m the waterfront because the workers were being asked to load zinc concentrates and lead for shipment to Japan. I asked the Minister for Trade and Customs for a full statement on the position, because it seemed at first sight strange i hat Ave should be supplying these materials to a potential enemy. When the matter was investigated it was found that Japan could secure supplies of zinc concentrates and lead from a number of other countries besides Australia.","London.

244,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"HOLT, Harold","009MC","N/A","N/A","N/A",159,"- I am referring to the episode which took place last year. To return to the subject before the House : It is quite clear that the Government found itself, after the extraordinary performance of one of its Ministers this afternoon, in a very unpleasant predicament. Although the Government is seeking authority under this bill to raise £75,,000,000, very grave doubts existed in all parts of the House after the Minister for Labour and National Service had spoken as to whether the Government was in favour of the bill. Accordingly, it arranged for its most astute debater to present, with such sophistry aB he could muster, a case which would attempt to resolve the dilemma in which the Government found itself. He declared that no positive declaration had been made on this side of the House in support of the bill. That is completely false. The Leader of the Opposition made it perfectly clear, in the opening sentences of his speech, that we were entirely in favour of the Loan Bill to raise £75,000,000. We recognized that it was for the purpose of conducting the war. Having made that declaration, the Leader of the Opposition proceeded to direct attention to what he regarded as some of the basic weaknesses in the financial policy of the Government. Not one member on this side of the chamber expressed any opposition to the bill; but, on the other hand, a responsible Minister endeavoured to explain to us a misrepresentation of certain remarks which he had made publicly, and he offered thecorrect version in its stead. Although we do not desire to question in detail the explanation which, was given by the Minister for Labour and National Service, I consider that it is appropriate to point out to the House that this alleged misrepresentation was not limited to the one newspaper from which he quoted. Such a respectable journal as the Brisbane Courier-Mail reported the Minister thus -Wo should not be asked to pay for the war afterwards by paying interest on any loans that are raised now.The Newcastle Morning Herald, which pays particular attention to industrial matters, reported on Monday, the 2nd March, that the Minister had said -Industry was being concentrated and organized which meant that it got more and more into monopolistic hands. That was why he suggested that the Government take over basic war industries and organize them in the interests of the nation. Unfortunately, in Cabinet he was in the minority. The next best course in seeing that workers were being protected against exploitation was to give the workers themselves some say in the management of industry and some say in the production process.In view of the fact that the Loan Bill has some bearing on the stability of our financial institutions, it is appropriate for me to quote from the Adelaide Advertiser a statement by the Minister upon the subject of the banks -Mr. Wardsaid he had long held the opinion that we had too many banks and that the Commonwealth Bank was quite able to do the banking business. He had declared the Commonwealth Bank a protected industry. Private banks were on the same footing asH, 1 V other undertaking.So that if the Minister was misreported -and .1 remind the House that this is not the first time that embarrassing statements by the Minister have had to be announced to this House as misrepresentations of what he had actually said - apparently a number of newspapers fell into the same error after taking notes of the same speech. But we are prepared to meet him on entirely different ground and take the explanation which he offered to the House as being what he actually said. That explanation, in effect, is this: The Minister does not resist the proposition that we should pay interest on previous loans, or upon the £35,000,000 Liberty Loan, which is now being floated; but he is opposed to the payment of interest on any loans which may be raised in future.There can be no misunderstanding on that point, because the honorable member for Dalley went to considerable pains to explain that this is a basic feature of the platform of the Labour party. The honorable member for Riverina (Mr. Langtry) will recall that a meeting in his electorate, the proceedings of which were reported in the press this morning, resolved that he should be asked to place before the Government, in an effective and determined manner, the opinion of that branch that interest should not be paid in future on moneys raised for war purposes. So there can be no doubt as to where the Minister stands, or where many members of the Government stand on this important proposal.I asked earlier whether the Government was in favour of this bill which the Treasurer presented to the House, and I say that there is some point in my question, because the Minister for Labour and National Service said,  I am in favour of . paying interest on the £35,000,000 Liberty Loan, but on no future loans . Yet the Government is now seeking authority to raise loans totalling £75,000,000. Can we assume that even if the Ministers colleagues are in favour of raising an additional £40,000,000 and paying interest on that sum, he is not in favour of it, and that once again he finds himself in the minority, as he was when he referred to the nationalization of industry.In an attempt to justify the Ministers position, the honorable member for Dalley propounded what was for all of us a most original conception of ministerial responsibility. Apparently, the traditional theory of ministerial responsibility, which has been observed for many centuries, has been swept aside by this new doctrine that has been specially created to overcome the predicament of the Minister for Labour and National Service. The new theory is that if a Minister finds himself committed to a decision of Cabinet and he disapproves of that decision because it is not in conformity with the platform of the Labour party as laid down regularly at its conferences, it is his bounden duty to denounce that decision publicly and to advocate adherence to the platform. That was seriously put forward to theHouse as a justification of the attitude of the Minister. If that be so, it will make a cabinet government a very difficult proposition in this country for a long time. It will make effective government in mar-time by Cabinet an outright impossibility. That is the really serious feature of the situation revealed by this performance to-day. We are fighting for our very existence. The enemy is attacking our shores. But we are not able to look with confidence to the Government for guidance. It is not able to reach agreement on basic matters of policy; and on that rests the whole future security of this Commonwealth. Honorable members opposite have a novel and revolutionary conception of the financing of the war. Even in Russia, to which so many honorable gentlemen opposite pledge their sentimental and personal attachment, a very handsome rate of interest is permitted on loans raised for the conduct of war. But in Australia we must be more extreme.The statement which was made this afternoon will have damaging repercussions, for both in its implications and its consequences it is tragic for the security of this country. This Government has denounced the proposal for financing the war by compulsory loans, taking from each individual according to his capacity to contribute to the war effort. It put the previous Government out of office because it adopted that policy, and so it has decided that the system of voluntary loans is the one to which it will adhere. Whence will the contributions from this loan come? It has been suggested that they will come partly from the big companies, despite the heavy inroads of taxation upon their earnings. lt will not be seriously suggested that they will come from what we in normal times describe as the moderately welltodo and wealthy classes, because those sections are passing through a most painful period of adjustment. The fact that those people still have what on paper appears to be a very healthy income does not render the adjustment any the less painful for them, because over a period of years they have been accustomed to a certain living standard and are now compelled to adjust themselves in a matter of weeks to a drastically reduced living standard. While the voluntary principle remains, it will be extremely difficult to raise from this class substantial contributions for loans. Therefore, we must look to those elements in the community who to-day probably have more money, as the savings bank figures and the statistics relating to the purchase of consumer goods show, than they ever had before. On what basis will they make contributions to future loans? They are asked to do it voluntarily. It is perhaps the first time in their lives that they have had a little nest egg to which they look for their future economic security, and naturally they want to do the patriotic thing on behalf of the country. Accordingly, they decide to put their money into the loan. The interest might be only 3 per cent., but to them that is neither here nor there. It is a small return on their capital. But when these people are told that the Government is opposed to the payment of interest on loans, they feaT that the next step will be the confiscation of their money, and that the repayment of the principal will be repudiated. That will immediately destroy confidence and adversely affect the Governments prospects of securing substantial additional loan moneys. That is the accusation which we level against those members of the Government who talk in this loose and irresponsible manner at the present time. We say undeniably that they are destroying the confidence of the people in our financial institutions. All this talk about the private banks, interest from loans, confiscation of capital, and capital levies is having a most damaging and disastrous effect upon confidence. I ask the Treasurer to inform me whether it is a fact that there has been a significant  run  on some banks recently. People are showing a disposition to hoard their cash because of this fear of repudiation. The Minister for Labour and National Service and those who support him have done a great disservice to the country in raising this controversial issue at this juncture.I pass from that subject to what I believe is a more serious attempt to sow discord in the community, namely, the proposal of the Minister for Labour and National Service that every member of the community should be reduced to what might be termed the lowest common denominator standard Very good arguments; based on principles of social justice, might be adduced as to why every person should participate equally in the goods and services available in the community. That is a delightful academic proposal which one could usefully discuss in time of peace for hours. But when a responsible Minister, at a time when the country is battling for its existence, puts that forward seriously as a practical proposal to be put into operation, the result will be to create disunity, class hatred and class distrust. In the present crisis, the country should be pulling together in perfect unity. Does the honorable gentleman put forward that proposal seriously, believing it to be a practicable proposition or does he propound it because he knows that it will have a very popular appeal among some of the less informed sections of the community? I shall tackle him on both propositions. If he made the suggestion, not believing that it is practicable, he is deliberately provoking uncertainty, disunity and discord at a time when such, developments should be avoided. But if he seriously believes that the proposal will be given practical effect, does he speak as a member of the Government and enunciate government policy, or is he once again expressing a minority opinion from which his colleagues will openly dissociate themselves? In any event, he creates uncertainty and dissension, and so does a disservice to the community in this crisis. Whichever way one looks at it this Minister is able to do what he likes. He can publicly and privately disagree with the majority of his colleagues in a way which will appeal to certain elements of the community. I do not regard him as irresponsible or ignorant. I think he is playing a clever, shrewd game, from his own point of view, because he is obviously playing for the support of the militant industrial unions. We have got out of the habit of speaking of  Com  unions ; the honorable member for Dalley (Mr. Rosevear) and the Minister for Supply and Development (Mr. Beasley) at one stage organized to destroy those elements, but to-day we all are brothers and cannot use the expression  Com  since it may suggest disrespect for our ally overseas. The Minister for Labour and National Service is anxious to secure the support of the trade unions, and, to that end, is ready to go to the lengths of raising most controversial issues. The people of this country and the Opposition have given to the Government, from the time it took office almost up to the present moment, the most generous measure of support. In my experience no government had a better beginning than this Government had. The newspapers were behind it; they wanted to see it do well. The Opposition wanted to give it « fair trial. Hardly a member on this side has spoken publicly in the last few months.","London.

We have endeavoured to debate these proposals calmly and logically and free of personalities. The Opposition now feels that it must challenge these proposals because it sees, as the country sees, that whilst in time of war this Government has the authority to take the measures necessary for the protection of the Commonwealth, it has neither mandate nor authority to use as a cloak the circumstances of war in order to implement radical proposals which have been traditional planks of the Labour platform. We challenge the Government on that. Some members of the Government, a minority, are using the opportunity, which feeling in the community and the circumstances of war give to them, to introduce a socialistic programme, even when some of the features of that programme disadvantage the war effort. We ask the Government to consider this matter seriously. Can Ministers from their experience of the functioning of democracy since the outbreak of war believe that it can function effectively in war-time unless there is basic unity on major proposals? They must consider that this is no time to make mistakes on matters of fundamental policy. There are in this chamber 60 or more members who have the same basic ideas as to how the war should be conducted, but the tragedy is that those members are not able, by some means or other, to pool their goodwill and unity of interests and policy in order to ensure this country against aggression and invasion. .1. -,ay with all sincerity that until we pool the best administrative brains of ibis Parliament in order to establish the most effective government possible, we shall not be doing our duty to the public who sent us here and to the men who are risking their lives for us. For that reason I ask the Government to ponder its responsibilities, not only to this generation, but also to the generations to come; otherwise the charge levelled against it will be that at the time when the country demanded our best the Government was not prepared to give that best, but preferred to play politics up to the hilt so as to preserve its own political advantages.","London.

On the pretext of speaking on a loan bill, they have made an attack on the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr. Ward). If this bill had not come before the House, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Fadden) intended to move the adjournment to discuss whether or not that Minister should continue in the Cabinet. By their conduct in this debate, Opposition members have proved not that the Minister should resign, but rather, their own unfitness to represent the people in the Parliament at this grave time. I think it was the honorable member for Fawkner (Mr. Holt) who said that there was no substance in the criticism of the shipment of pig iron to Japan. I shall not discuss that matter, but I shall direct attention to something else. While the honorable member for Wentworth (Mr. Harrison) was reciting to the House what was said by the Minister for Labour and National Service -as member for East Sydney in 1936, namely, that he would not fight against German workers in a war, I had lively recollections that in the same year the right honorable member for Kooyong (Mr. Menzies), when he returned from Germany, greatly praised Hitlers administration and said that what Australia needed was a leader, which is the English translation of  Fuhrer .","London.

I was saying that the Commonwealth Bank is not only a bank, but also an instrument with which to prosecute the war. We, as a Labour party, having regard to our policy, must so fashion and sharpen that instrument that it will be the most effective weapon that we can procure on the financial side.I have drawn the attention of the Treasurer (Mr. Chifley) on two occasions through the medium of questions to the fact that, although the Government sees fit to continue its policy of borrowing from the public purse, nevertheless some persons are still being paid a commission of 5s. per cent. in respect of applications made by their clients. Those who benefit from this commission are banks, large insurance companies and stockbrokers. Simple mathematical calculation shows that in respect of the £100,000,000 conversion loan recently floated, the commission of 5s. per cent. would mean that the Commonwealth Government might be liable to pay a sum not exceeding £250,000. A contribution of £250,000 to this loan would be most substantial But still this practice is being continued and, although the Treasurer has said that he proposes to review it in respect of future loans, none theless the Commonwealth might be obliged to pay in respect of the present loan a sum of £100,000. If a firm of stockbrokers, for example, J. B. Were and Son, which acts for people like the Mutual Life and Citizens Assurance Company Limited, and the Bank of New South Wales, which make very large contributions, are to be paid 5s. per cent. on every application, which is merely a written piece of paper lodged with the Commonwealth Bank, it means that they will be paid many thousands of pounds for very little work indeed. I do not regard such expenditure as proper in respect of either the raising of loans or the prosecution of the war. The 5s. per cent. is over and above amounts authorized for expenditure on advertising, radio, and other publicity.In supporting the principle enunciated this afternoon by the Minister for Labour and National Service that war loans should be non-interest-bearing, I emphasize that it is a poor lookout for Australia if the measure of its peoples patriotism is to be the percentage rate at which those who have money will lend it for defence purposes. The arguments of the Opposition fall quite flat when we remember that the money which the Government is seeking in order to prosecute the war is to provide for the safety of the very people who subscribe it. If war loans are to be looked upon purely as investments Australia is in a most unhappy position. The great majority of our people look forward to the time when all the money necessary for defence will be provided without argument, in order to give our men fighting in the front-line all the arms and equipment they need.","London.

It is probably true, as has been stated by Sir Stafford Cripps, the new Leader of the Government in the British House of Commons, that the war will be won primarily because of the magnificent stand of Russia against the German forces.Mr.JOLLY (Lilley) [9.7].- In addressing myself to this bill, I begin by assuring the honorable member for Dalley (Mr. Rosevear) that I intend to support the measure. I listened with interest to the honorable gentlemans speech, but, at its conclusion, I was unable to tell whether he favoured the bill or not. Parliament, of course, has already approved of the raising of this loan, for it was envisaged in the budget proposals agreed to last year. I believe that the people of Australia will wholeheartedly support the loan, for they are anxious that a maximum war effort shall be made, and are fully prepared to foot the bill. I assume that the interest rates on this loan will not be higher than those applicable to the Liberty Loan now being floated, namely, 2½ per cent. for the short period and 3¼ per cent. for the long period. We all would be interested to know the proportions of applications for the long and short periods respectively in the Liberty Loan.It is gratifying to know that interest rates to-day are just about half what they were on loans raised during the last war. No other costs in connexion with the war have shown such a large percentage reduction. In this respect, Australia is in step with Great Britain. We are apt to overlook the fact that persons who invest their money in war loans are accepting a greater reduction of income than persons who are assisting in any other war activity.","London.

272,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"JOLLY, William","KA9","N/A","N/A","N/A",166,"- Yes, if that be practicable. I am intrigued by the proposal of certain honorable gentlemen opposite that money should be provided for future war loans interest-free. Why should a person who invests £1,000 in a war loan be called upon to make his money available without interest, whilst other persons who invest similar amounts in property or in business undertakings may still receive fairly substantial returns in rents or dividends? I am aware, of course, that the security in respect of war loans is better than in respect of either property or business, but that, surely, is no reason why persons should be denied any interest on money invested in war loans. It would be absurd, in present circumstances, to ask people to provide money for war loans interest-free.The time has passed in this country for talking; it is high time that we were acting to the very utmost ofour energy. I am not so much concerned, at the moment, as to how the money is to be raised as I am as to how it is to be expended. Our difficulty is not in raising money, but in spending it speedily and wisely to provide the needs of war. In making that statement, I do not criticize members of the present Government. I appreciate the difficulties that have to be faced. I do not think that any one in Australia to-day is satisfied with the nature and extent of our war effort. Much has been done, but a great deal more will have to be done in the future. I am afraid, however, that there is a tendency in some directions for us to spread ourselves too much. At this serious stage of the war, it is futile for us to be devoting our energies to activities which cannot be completed for twelve to eighteen months. We must put first things first. This is no time, for example, to be spending money on permanent buildings. We must be satisfied with temporary accommodation. We are too apt to spend our money lavishly in constructing permanent buildings. A single bomb may blow some of these buildings out of existence in a few moments. It would be far better for us to concentrate our spending on items of our war programme that are urgently needed at the moment. As a father who has sons in the services, I know that what our men at the front require are more planes, more guns and more ammunition. I agree with the view that our fighting services, and particularly the men in the front line, should receive greater consideration than they have received hitherto. I believe that the people of Australia would stand behind anything the Government did in this connexion. It is urgent that planes, arms and equipment shall be provided with the least possible delay. Any person who impedes or obstructs the war effort should be regarded as a traitor and dealt with accordingly whether he be employer or employee. There has been too much interference with our war effort, and the Government should deal severely with those who adopt obstructive tactics.I urge the importance of giving our men who enlist in the forces a far more intensive training than they have received in the past. I know from personal experience that many of these young men have been discouraged and disheartened because they have not had practical training. In the present grave hour I hope that the military authorities will see that improvement is effected in that direction.The Government should be prepared to take action in order to curtail unnecessary expenditure. There cannot be any support for the degree to which pleasure and enjoyment are being sought and obtained in Australia to-day. It is the duty of every Australian to concentrate on the war effort. The Government should follow the lead set by the Premier of South Australia, and prohibit horse racing in the Commonwealth. The only task that confronts Australia to-day is the winning of the war. I am satisfied that if this Parliament will tell the people what it wants them to do, they will do it. The situation is serious; let us get on with the job before it is too late.","London.

273,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BAKER, Francis Patrick","JNR","Maranoa","N/A","N/A",167,".- The war position is going from bad to worse. Three places on the mainland of Australia have been bombed - Darwin on two occasions, Wyndham and Broome. We seem to be losing battles, picking up straws. The only bright spot at the present juncture is in Russia, where the enemy is being driven back. Russia, vilified and cursed for a quarter of a century, may be destined to become the saviour of democracy. It abolished capitalism, and, like Othello, might well plead,  The very head and front of my offending hath this extent, no more . Sir Stafford Cripps, Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Commons, said at a Liverpool meeting, according to a report appearing in the Melbourne Argus of the 23rd February -The courage, determinnation, and selfsacrifice shown by the Red Army, supported by all the people of Russia, have been the decisive factors in turning back the German invaders mid protecting our country from - Nazi attacks.A good deal has been said to-day as to the manner in which revenue should be obtained. It would appear that only two methods are considered suitable - taxation and borrowing. Surely there are other means! We must discard the orthodox, because the conditions are not normal. We are in a struggle for our national life. I remind the House that last year the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Fadden), who was then Treasurer, told us that the primary and secondary industries of this country had produced goods to a value of £925,000,000 in the previous twelve-months period and that, for the financial year ending the 30th June, 1942, the value of the production would be £1,000,000,000. That represents the national income of Australia ; and every £1 can be multiplied by ten in order to measure the national credit. Surely, then, we can expand the issue of credit through the Commonwealth Bank in order to win the war! I shall read to the House a short extract from the report of the royal commission that was appointed to inquire into the monetary and banking systems of Australia: -The Commonwealth Bank . . . can lend to the governments or to others in a variety ot ways, and it can even make money available to governments or to others free of any charge.When Mr. Justice Napier, the chairman of the commission, was asked to explain that statement, he said that it meant what it said, namely, that the Commonwealth Bank could lend money for the construction of public buildings, &c, and that there would be no need to charge interest or even to repay the principal amount !A few days ago, in this House, as a protest against the parrot cry equality of sacrifice , I suggested that every member should be placed on a soldiers pay of 6s. a day, in addition to keep and clothing. I have since received many complimentary letters, as well as a good deal of criticism. How can there be equality of sacrifice if we occupy easy seats while the soldier boys are enduring a rain of hell? Let us be honest, and dispense with hypocrisy. I now make the further suggestion that all the necessaries of life be rationed and issued on the coupon system. If those who are privileged to sit in this national Parliament were to set an example to the men who are giving their lives, there would be no doubt as to the issue. Instead of that, what do we find? In the newspapers, there are protests against the economy plan put forward by the Government, and in this House there are protests against the reduction of the rate of interest to 4 per cent. Why should any interest at all be paid at a time like this? Mr. J. A. L. Gunn, chartered accountant, giving evidence before the Parliamentary Committee on Profits, said,  I am afraid of a curtailment of essential production. Some companies prefer to spend money rather than let the Government get it . Yet this is war-time! Before the war started, we were told that our Allies, China and Russia, and our antagonists Germany and Japan, were bankrupt. They have expanded the national credit, and look at what they have -achieved ! We have to learn to do likewise. Why should we go cap in hand to the private banks in order to borrow money at 3| per cent., and pay brokerage amounting to 5s. on every £100 raised?The amount of brokerage onthe money now being borrowed will total £87,500. Underthe National Security Act, we have complete power over men and women, money and materials; all ofthem belong to the Government in the present fierce struggle to defend our Commonwealth. If any man is instructed to go anywhere, he does not think of objecting, but goes. If we want money, we should not have a discussion as to whether we should pay for it so much per cent., but should take it.","London.

But I hope that this will be the last occasion on which we shall vote to borrow money during the progress of this war, and even after its termination. We have complete power over men, money and material, and with them we must win the war. Only a small percentage of our ablest-bodied men can be placed in the firing line. Behind them are the skilled technicians in the shops and factories, who manufacture the lethal weapons of war; and behind those again there is another section of the population producing food. Napoleon said that an army marches on its stomach. Every army fights on its stomach. Discussing tactics, strategy, and so on, a general said to me the other day, The first thing is to feed your men, the second is to feed your men, the third is to feed your men. Equip and. train your men, and they will do what you want them to do in order to defend this country. Has any one ever thought of what would be likely to happen if we were under the domination of the Japanese? I spent half a dozen years in the country around Thursday Island, Normanton, Croydon and Burke town and I can visualize what would happen. The sampans would creep round the coast, the Japanese would land and send out their scouts; there would be a raid on the blacks camp, following which every female from twelve years upwards would be put on board the lugger. A little later - over the side ; and the sharks are always hungry in the vicinity of Thursday Island. I lost my wife and two daughters some little time ago, and I say that I would rather them dead than that I should see them fall into the hands of such an enemy. For men the triumph of the Japanese would mean opium and dope, mutilation, captivity and murder. For the women it would mean violation, defilement, and captivity, from which there could be only one escape. I want the Australian men and women assembled here to-day to face this reality, and not bother whether the rate of interest should be 4¼ per cent. or4½ per cent. Such considerations are unworthy of us. We must show a better example to our young men. Each of us should be, in the words of Browning -One who never turned his back but marched breast forward,Never doubted clouds would break,Never dreamed, though right were worsted wrong would triumph,Held we fall to rise, are baffled to fight better,Sleep to wake.I deplore the attack made this afternoon on the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr. Ward), who, of all honorable members of this House, has outstanding courage and high ability. But, because he dared to say that interest should not in future be paid on money raised to keep Australia from defilement, a massed attack was made upon him.","London.

It might be as a part of an ordinary loan flotation on the market, or it might be by short-term loan from the Commonwealth Bank. Some of the speeches made to-day were no more than political posturing and, indeed, some of them contained a large measure of piffle. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Fadden) has been very generous and decent in his treatment of the subjects brought before the House, and some constructive criticism was offered by the honorable member for Robertson (Mr. Spooner) and the honorable member for Lilley (Mr. Jolly); but several of the speeches this afternoon were apparently delivered only for the purpose of gaining publicity or some political advantage. The Leader of the Opposition himself was forced into the position of expressing, on behalf of some disgruntled members of his own party, sentiments which he does not entirely endorse. Whatever the reason, we have been treated to an exchange of recriminations. It is all very well to say that the attack upon the Minister for Labour and National Service was not premeditated. Before the House met, the corridors were buzzing with talk of what was going to be said about the Minister. What is the position in regard to his statement? Honorable members opposite accept newspaper statements only when they suit them. In this instance, a newspaper reported the honorable gentleman as having made a certain statement, and he was attacked this afternoon before he was given an opportunity to make an explanation in this House, which is the proper place in which to do so. Even after he had denied the statements attributed to him, honorable members opposite went on saying exactly the same things as they had said before he made the- denial. At a time when the country is in a critical position, an afternoon has been devoted to an exchange of recriminations. If members of the Opposition had not begun this tirade of abuse, we should not have been treated to this exhibition, but they could not resist seeking a political advantage on the strength of some remarks reported in the press, whether accurately or not. Having embarked upon the attack, they found thai the Minister for Labour and National Service was able to play the game better than they could. They found that he is quite as good at personal recrimination as they are. The whole incident rather reflects upon the political judgment of the Opposition. The right honorable member for Kooyong (Mr. Menzies) challenged the Prime Minister to state the policy of the Government in regard to loans. Well, the Prime Minister has made a statement, and if he had not. done so, I should have felt quite confident to do it on his behalf. The Government is an honorable one, composed of honest men, and when it says that interest will be paid on money borrowed, it will keep its promise, just as honest men do. Although there is difference of opinion on the subject of the payment of interest, there is not one man on this side of the House who would say that this Government should be a partyto the repudiation of one pennyworth of interest or principal in respect of commitments entered into by this or any previous Government. If honorable members opposite wanted to damage the prospects of the loan, they could not have gone a better way about it than by voicing these inferences and innuendoes. The best answer I can give to the suggestion that anything which has been done by a member of the Government has damaged the prospects of the loan, is that there were 8,500 applications in respect of the loan to-day, and three out of every four were from people who were investing less than £200. Just before dinner the honorable member for Wentworth (Mr. Harrison), when most of the members of his own party had left the chamber, delivered a violent speech calling upon the Prime Minister to answer this charge and that. He spoke as if the Prime Minister, whose job at this time is in his office, should be present to answer every challenge which he and other honorable members opposite choose tothrow out in order to obtain a little personal publicity.The Leader of the Opposition, in discussing the financial administration of the Government, referred to the short-term indebtedness. When the right honorable member for Kooyong was Prime Minister, and the present Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer, there were times when loans were not fully subscribed, but they did not shout from the housetops that bank credit was being used to make up the difference. I have heard from this side of the House talk of the Government begging the private banks to subscribe to the loan. People who speak in that fashion do not know what they are talking about. This Government has not gone begging to the private banks.I can assure honorable members that the private banks have been very small contributors to the previous cash loan, or to this one. That is no reflection on their patriotism, or on their desire to help. It is due to the fact that the regulations under which they operate do not leave them any surplus which they can invest in loans, and require them to obtain the permission of the Commonwealth Bank before subscribing.","London.

285,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CHIFLEY, Ben","A48","N/A","ALP","N/A",170,"- The surplus assets which come into their hands as a result of the expansion of credit are being put into a special deposit account, which carries a rate of interest that only just covers administrative expenses. We have been warned of the dangers of inflation. Is there any man in this House foolish enough to think that our present rate of expenditure, which could not be anticipated six months ago, when different circumstances obtained, can be met out of taxation? Certainly it cannot, no matter what rate of taxation be imposed. When it is said that the deficit should be met from loans, I reply that the Prime Minister and I consulted with those persons who are supposed to know what the public can lend, and the loans that are now being put on the market, and those that will be floated in the future, are based upon their reports.Regarding the financing of the war, the Government in a period of three months imposed additional taxes estimated to yield £50,000,000 per annum. Does any honorable member venture to assert that that is not a genuine attempt to make the nation pay as far as possible for the war? Even if the previous Government had remained in office, it could not have carried on without the assistance of bank loans. It would be nonsense to say otherwise. Whilst I agree with the statements of the Leader of theOpposition . regarding the dangers of inflation, I remind him that the Government has taken almost every step, with the exception of that mentioned by the honorable member for Robertson (Mr. Spooner), in order to safeguard against it. The honorable member advocated the introduction of individual rationing in the community. When a government is utilizing bank credit up to the point where all of the national resources are involved and all man-power is engaged, it can no longer, with safety, expand credit. It has virtually reached the end of its tether in that respect. But these times are not normal; they are extraordinary. When a government has utilized bank credit beyond that point, it must impose stiff control so that the inflation which we fear will not occur. I challenge any one r.o 9ay that the Government has not introduced safe measures of control. Differences of opinion may exist about the incidence of taxation, but people often talk very loosely about financing the war from taxation. When I introduced the budget last year, I spent a busy time replying to requests by honorable members on both sides of the chamber for the exemption of certain articles from the sales tax, or for a reduction of the wartime (company) tax, because it would destroy the incentive of many businesses to contribute to a maximum war effort. Incidentally, these references to  incentive  are a reflection on a number of people engaged in industry. Some honorable members opposite have declared that unless companies can make ample profits, they have no incentive to expand production for the purpose of assisting in the conduct of the war. That is a reflection upon the patriotism of a number of people who accord their political support to the United Australia party and the United Country party.The constant references to inflation during this debate were made purely for political purposes. If Australias war effort continues to expand, the expenditure which to-day is regarded by some as evidence of inflation will doubtless seem comparatively small. We must keep our feet on the ground, and realize that, because, the situation is abnormal, we must In unusual things. Those unusual things may have bad consequences if we fail to exercise proper economic control. The Government is endeavouring, to the best of its ability, to provide that measure of control, and I think that its efforts have met with reasonable success. In making that statement I do not overlook or discredit the measures that were taken by previous governments in this connexion. When the honorable member for Warringah (Mr. Spender) was Treasurer, he introduced a number of measures which were very creditable to him, in order to effect control in certain directions. I do not for one moment claim that this Government alone possesses a broad national outlook. I realize that we all are engaged in this fight and I hope that we all have the same objective. But our democracy does not receive a very good advertisement when the representatives of the people in Parliament engage in violent recriminations, and give emphasis to material that might create a false impression. For some hours, this House has listened to unfortunate personal invective. In attempts to bolster up a case against a Minister, extracts have been quoted from speeches that were delivered fifteen years ago. My only pleasure this afternoon arose from the fact that some one did not quote from past speeches by the right honorable member for North Sydney (Mr. Hughes), because there would have been such a mass of contradiction that every one would have been bewildered.I am in no dilemma regarding the position of the Government. An honest man has only to say, as the representative of an honest government, that we shall see that the prospectus which we issue is kept as regards the payment of interest and the repayment of principal. If later we are again in opposition, we shall try to see that the promise is kept. No supporter of the Government would say that he does not agree fully with that undertaking. Some difference of opinion might exist about the rate of interest that is payable on these loans. Some honorable members on this side of the chamber might consider that the rate should be i per cent.; others might favour 1 per cent, or li per cent. Still others may believe that no interest at all should be paid. Before to-day, people have considered that interest was an undesirable feature in the life of a community. Every one is entitled to his opinion, even if that opinion be that interest should be nominal, and should cover only the cost of administration. But if the Government and the majority of the members of the Labour party decide that, as a matter of policy, the Government should offer interest at 3 per cent., every member of the party will abide loyally by that decision. Even if one does not personally agree with it, that does not mean that he favours repudiation and confiscation. All such talk is a mere invention of the Opposition, despite this critical period in our history. Honorable members opposite expressed their horror that the confidence of investors should be destroyed, but many of the speeches that they delivered this afternoon were calculated to arouse serious misgivings among the public. Personally, I do not think that the people believe them ; otherwise, there would not have been 8,500 applicants for the loan to-day. I have participated in this debate only for the purpose of replying to loose talk about inflation and the necessity for adequate control. I deprecate many of the utterances that have been made to-day,I was delighted to hear two constructive suggestions by the honorable member for Robertson and the honorable member for Lilley (Mr. Jolly). The honorable member for Robertson advocated the introduction of rationing, the necessity for which I do not dispute. I realize the possibilities, and the action that might have to be taken to deal with the position. The honorable member for Lilley replied most effectively to the contention that interest should not be paid on loans. As an illustration, he said that one man might save £1,000, which he would invest in the purchase of a house or business that would return to him 3 per cent., 4 per cent, or 5 per cent, per annum. Another man, by working extremely bard, might save £1,000, which he proceeds to lend to his country for the purpose of conducting the war. Some persons contend that he should not be paid any interest upon his investment, but the honorable member for Lilley showed that that man is just as entitled to some reward for his thrift and for his patriotism in lending his savings to the Government for the purpose of defending the country as is the other man who invested his money in property. That is getting down to cold hard facts. All the other talk in the debate was loose, largely because it did not deal with realities. Unfortunately, there was a premeditated decision to launch an attack upon the Minister for Labour and National Service.","London.

That convinced me that some honorable members opposite were determined to attack the Minister. His denial mattered nothing to them. Whilst I realize that we are engaged in politics, I warn honorable members opposite that we can overdo politics at the present time. The, responsibility for the recriminations that have taken place to-day rests with the Opposition, because it launched this attack. Honorable members opposite could have asked the Minister at question-time whether he had made that statement, and the Minister could have given his explanation. If the Opposition did not believe him, it would have regarded him as a liar. If it did believe him, there would be nothing more to be said on the subject. Certainly there was no necessity for introducing side issues and implying that some Ministers were not in favour of meeting, not the Governments obligations, but the nations obligations. Those statements brought no credit to this Parliament. Perhaps we all are at fault; but honorable members should not forget that in the life of a democracy it is important that the public should have respect, not necessarily for a party, but for the Parliament. Everything that we do to destroy that respect deals a deathblow at democracy itself.Question resolved in the affirmative.Bill read a second time and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate.","London.

As the collection of duties under those proposals has only been validated up to and including the 31st March, 1942, it is necessary to take action in order to allow the duties to continue to operate after that date. In view of the more important issues at stake at the present time the Government does not consider the time opportune for Parliament to debate the proposals.The only new matter in the proposals -consists of amendments to Customs Tariff Items 3 (f) and 208 (p) andExcise Tariff Items 2 (n) and 11 (c). These amendments do not involve any increase of rates of duty, but are merely alterations of the wording of the items to assist in their administration.In respect of Excise Item 2 (n) and its counterpart Customs Tariff Item 3 (f), which relate to methylated spirits, the by-Jaw proviso in each case previously read for power purposes as prescribed by Departmental By-laws . On this wording relief from duty could only be given in instances of methylated spirits being used for power purposes, but it ha? been demonstrated that certain other users of methylated spirits can present reasonable claims for by-law concession. For instance, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research has introduced a new method of shrinking wool, involving the use of methylated spirits. Accordingly, the restrictive incidence of both the Customs and Excise By-law Items has been removed.With regard to Excise Tariff Item 11 (c) as it is at present worded, some doubt exists amongst technical people as to whether certain types of petrol substitutes are dutiable under the item, as was originally intended. The wording of Item 11 (c) has been so amended as to leave no doubt that such petrol substitutes are classifiable thereunder. The Metropolitan Gas Company of Melbourne has introduced a form of coal-gas as a distillate. It is felt that it should be included in the dutiable range.There are no other alterations.

Indeed, I remember that when the present Opposition was inoffice, certain members of the present Government very rightly indicated in general terms that censorship should be used only for that purpose. I asked the Prime Minister (Mr. Curtin) last week whether he would lay upon the table of the House all written instructions to newspapers or broadcasting companies, censoring or giving instructions for censorship of any particular matter, so that private members of this House, as custodians of, the rights of the people, might know that these instructions were solely directed to security and to no other purpose. I further suggested to the Prime Minister that, if he was not prepared to do that, he should suggest means by which private members could have some say as to what should or should not be censored, so that they would be watchdogs of democracy to see that censorship was used for its proper purpose. I have had some experience in respect of security and I know that censorship instructions cannot be made public, because to make them so would be to defeat one of the purposes for which censorship is instituted. But it seems to me that members of this House are entitled to know those instructions, and the mere tabling of them should not mean that they would be available for publication in the newspapers. In fact, the press has them now, and private members have no access to them at all. I see no reason why they should not have the right of access to all instructions which go to newspapers and broadcasting companies indicating what should or should not be reported or spoken about.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[34]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I am concerned solely with the fundamental rights of democracy. The Prime Minister was approached with respect to this matter in the Advisory War Council, with the result that it was made possible to every one of the council to go to the Chief Publicity Censor and have the various instructions made available to him. So I am not quarrelling with the access given to representatives of the Opposition on the council, but I am directing my attention to this matter, because I have reason to believe that censorship instructions are not always concerned with national security.The first matter I desire to mention is the resignation of Mr. Rorke, the Deputy Censor in New South Wales, tie was a censor of some ability and had experience in the last war. I think £ am correct in saying he was a censor in New South Wales up to two or three weeks ago, when he resigned. What is behind the resignation I cannot speak about, but I do desire to have an answer lo this question: Is it a fact that Mr. Rorke submitted to the newspapers an explanation of his side of the question and chat its publication was prohibited by the Censor ? If so, on what grounds ? This is a vital matter. It seems extraordinary that a man who was a censor in this country during the last war, and has been a censor for two years during this war, should have been precluded - if I am correctly informed - from expressing his view as to the grounds for the resignation which was finally forced upon him.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[34]/speech[1]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If it bo, as suggested to me, that Mr. Rorke took exception two months ago to censorship instructions given to him on the ground that they had nothing to do with security matters, but were designed to prevent political criticism, and if, from that time onwards, his position became untenable to him, so that, finally, he had no alternative but to resign, the House should demand an inquiry. I am not dealing at the moment with the merits of the case. I desire to know specifically whether a censorship instruction was issued to make any explanation by Mr. Rorke subject to censorship, and if, in fact, all of his statement but two or three lines was suppressed. The question is whether a democratic government, in a time of war, is taking steps to prevent complete freedom of criticism of what is being done. I ask the Prime Minister to give me an answer to my questions either this evening or as early as possible.Another matter touching the censorship in relation to the Australian Broadcasting Commission has caused me concern. In the Senate the Minister for Information (Senator Ashley) was asked whether instructions had been given to the commission which in effect directed the commission how it should express itself. I now ask the Prime Minister, specifically, whether it is a fact that instructions were given, either directly or indirectly, by Ministers, to the Australian Broadcasting Commission, first, that there should be no reference to Mr. Churchill in the overseas broadcasts ; secondly, that there should be no reference to the totality of the war, that is, that the Pacific war was part and parcel of a total war; and, thirdly, that there was to be nothing broadcast to detract from the proposition that the main and vital centre of the war at present was the Pacific?","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[34]/speech[1]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

314,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"SPENDER, Percy","KUG","N/A","N/A","N/A",194,"- The same men have been in office since this Government has been in power. However, I do not wish to introduce any provocative matter into the debate. It should be a simple matter to check whether instructions have been issued in writing or whether written confirmation has been received from the commission of any verbal instructions.The last matter to which I shall refer relates to certain industrial disturbances in recent months. The House is entitled to know what instructions have been issued in respect of broadcasting commentaries or announcements in relation to industrial disturbances. I refer in particular to a controversy involving the Moulders Union about Anniversary Day. There was an argument as to whether the moulders should work on that day. In fact, they did not work. I am not concerned at the moment as to whether they should or should not have worked. I am concerned with the refusal of the censors to allow certain statements to be published in the press concerning these matters. Another matter will give point to my argument. In Common Cause of the 2Sth February, a newspaper published by the Australian Coal and Shale Employees Federation there was an article which contained a number of statements such as -We have not forgone the right to strike, and where the issue is a real one and other methods fail we will still agree to strike, but on!} after full consideration of the issueand after attempts to use other methods fail.Nor do we agree that conditions and wage.should remain static. We have during tinpast week submitted several important claim; to the Central .Reference Board, and we arc confident that real gains will accrue from this.These claims are not very great, but the* will result, provided we are successful, ii. considerable gains to our members. There are too, quite a lot of other claims that have been listed since Inst August. Some of these have already been dealt with by local boardand others are listed. We have reserved the right to bring any or all of the remaining claims before the local boards when we think best, so what our programme really means in practice is that we really fight, but that we fight in a new way.That article means that the miners intend to retain the right to strike, irrespective of conciliation or arbitration. As a reply to that article, another article was submitted to the censorship authorities. [Extension of time granted.^ It reads as follows : -It will be remembered that recently the miners representatives told the Central Coa) Reference Board that they had modified their original claims and were submitting in their place eight major items. They said that their aim, in view of the critical situation facing the country., was to level up present conditions of work.At the time the colliery proprietors representatives on the board stated that in effect the miners had dropped nothing and had concentrated everything in eight claims, leaving other matters to be dealt with by district boards. Mr. J. Johnson said,  I can only say that the statement that you are dropping all but one or two points was made for propaganda purposes .All along I have given it as my impression that the miners are using the present national situation to force improved conditions and increased wages at the expense of the rest of the working community, and in Common Cause, dated the 2Sth February, the president of the Miners Federation, Mr. Harold Wells, makes the following statement to federation members : -Then followed the extract from the article in Common Cause which I have already read. The article in reply submitted to the censor continued -I would draw particular attention to Mr . Wells statement that the Miners Federation does not agree that conditions and wages should remain static. In view of the PrimeMinisters statement that  wages and conditions were to be pegged for the duration of the war, I think that the public is entitled to know whether Mr. Curtins or Mr. Wells policy is to be carried into effect.The article was signed by the secretary of the Northern Collieries Limited, Mr. Gregory Forster. I should like to know what possible objection could have been taken to the publication of that article? Yet it was rejected by the State censorship authorities. If we are reduced to this kind of thing, I say to the Prime Minister, with great respect, that there is more than a little ground for the suspicion that the censorship is being used in this country for other than legitimate censorship purposes. I do not desire to make a provocative speech, but if the facts are as I have said, I ask that the whole question be remitted to a committee representative of private members on both sides of the House. Speaking as a member of the Advisory War Council, I, of course, have had an opportunity to see the instructions that have been issued, but in a democracy it is not too much to ask that, as the newspaper authorities are allowed to see copies of instructions, it should be permissible for private members of the Parliament also to see them. En this way they can determine whether our democracy is being preserved, or whether criticism is being stifled for alterior purposes.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[34]/speech[1]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I bring to the notice of the Prime Minister certain difficulties concerning the call-up of men for the Militia, and the volunteering of men for the Australian Imperial Force. Some time ago it was proposed that a rent allowance should he granted to soldiers in the forces, but the matter seems to have dropped out of sight. Many married men are now being called up for definite service, but no provision has been made for a rent allowance for them. Some of the men have been in receipt of high salaries or wages, but have had to enter camp under financial conditions which, unless remedied, will destroy their home life and make it impossible for them to provide educational facilities for their children. Men who have been paying fairly high rents to landlords, or are meeting substantial instalments on the purchase of their own homes, or have certain commitments in regard to hire-purchase agreements, are receiving, as members of the forces, such a small remuneration that it is impossible for them to meet their various obligations. Family life is the rock on which this nation stands, and if it should be submerged, our democracy will not be preserved. The Government, in my view, is not meeting its responsibilities to the men who are being called up, and I ask the Prime Minister to give this matter his immediate attention with the object of providing the proposed rent allowance.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[34]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
316,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"ANTHONY, Hubert","JLZ","Richmond","N/A","N/A",195,". - I direct the attention of the Prime Minister (Mr. Curtin) and the appropriate Minister to the lack of preparation to meet air raids in the Australian Capital Territory. Since Darwin was bombed and the first impact of war on Australia was felt a fortnight ago, one would expect that a Government with its head-quarters in the capital city of Australia would have taken the necessary precautions in order to ensure that, in the event of an air raid, the administrative facilities would not be impaired to any appreciable extent. So far as I have been able to learn, however, the Government has continued to operate as though Japan had not struck, and on the assumption that this city is inviolate, instead of being, as it is, only 80 or 90 miles from the sea-coast, off which bombers could be launched from an aircraft carrier and be engaged in a raid here within about 50 minutes. Important though the provision of shelters may be, it is, perhaps, of minor importance compared with the security of the documents of the Commonwealth. So far as I have been able to ascertain, not one thing has so far been done in order to preserve the very important documents in the various administrative quarters. Photostats have not been taken, a3 they have been by banking institutions and business firms, and sent for security inland, far from the coast-line. The Government is in a state of hopeful bliss, evidently believing that we may escape the impact of attack by the enemy. It has the duty and the responsibility of attempting to safeguard the administrative machinery, so that, in the event of a bomb falling on a secretariat or on Parliament House, there will not be complete disorganization of thi nations services. Such a contingency is not at all unlikely. I suggest that the Government take time by the forelock, and act immediately in order to see that at least the important documents, without which it would be extremely difficult to carry on the Government, shall be placed in such a position that there will be no possibility of their destruction by aircraft, or that duplicates of them shall be made.Throughout Parliament House to-day, the doors were plastered with notices stating that, in the event of an air raid, those who are in the building shall leave Parliament House and  take to the bush . What a nice picture would be presented by the Prime Minister and the whole of the Cabinet seeking shelter under rose bushes in the parliamentary gardens ! That is the only place in which they could shelter. In this matter, I am not looking for any publicity. The whole of my remarks can be censored, if that be thought necessary. It is a fact that no provision has been made for the safety of the Administration, the staff, or any member of Parliament. So far as I have been able to see, no provision has been made for the safety of any of the residents of Canberra. I have not seen a single trench. If it exists, it must be in a back garden. Who is responsible for that? To-day, I asked the Minister for Home Security (Mr. Lazzarini) a question on the subject. I assumed that he was charged with responsibility for home security, but he very politely replied that such responsibility is vested in the Department of the Interior. Probably the Minister for the Interior (Senator Collings), if he were asked to comment, would tell us something else. The fact is that the enemy bombed Darwin a fortnight ago. Goodness knows when a bombing attack may be made, not only in this Territory, but also on points on the eastern sea-board. We have to remember that we are only 90 miles from where an aircraft carrier may be waiting to launch an attack upon us. I submit to the Prime Minister, the Minister for Home Security, and otherMinisters, that the matter is one which affects not only the persona i safety of members of this Parliament, but also the positions that they hold in the parliamentary machinery for the government of Australia in its hour of crisis. The Government has the responsibility of seeing that adequate measures are taken, not only for the preservation of records, but also for the safety of the members of this Parliament and the residents of Canberra. If a similar state of affairs existed in Sydney or Melbourne, I could direct my criticism at the State authorities. In this Capital Territory, no one is responsible except the federal authorities. The position needs to be remedied very quickly by whoever is responsible, because the enemy does not give more than a few minutes notice of his intention to attack. The longest notice that could be given of a bombing attack on this city would probably be 50 minutes, if the enemy were lying off the coast. I therefore urge the Prime Minister to take whatever steps are necessary to meet the position.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[34]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
317,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MORGAN, Charles","JVA","Reid","N/A","N/A",196,".- I appreciate the statement that has been made in regard to machine tools by the Minister for Munitions (Mr. Makin), but am disappointed with the meagre details that it contains. This matter was first raised by me and by other honorable members particularly the honorable member for Dalley (Mr. Rosevear) over three months ago. Inquiry into it has been made by three departments. Cost investigators of the Munitions Department have investigated it fully, and could have placed all of the details before the Minister. The Department of Home Security also has been conducting an inquiry since December last, when a special investigation was instituted; and on behalf of the Parliamentary Committee on War Expenditure, experts have been engaged on it for some considerable time. That committee has presented reports dealing with specific details, and showing that in certain instances the profits have been higher than 60 per cent. The comment of the experts is that some of the profits have been fantastic. These details are available, and should be placed before the House at the earliest possible moment, particularly as the gentleman who instituted the system is still in charge of machine tool production. While inquiries are being conducted he is, in effect, under a cloud. There is considerable disquiet in the whole of the munitions industry in regard to the supply of machine tools, and particularly the activities of the director and his associates in connexion with machine tool production. This is one of the greatest bottlenecks in our war effort. It is holding up production, and causing a complete sense of frustration among, not only the workers, but also many of the manufacturers. I hope that the Minister will see that no facts are suppressed, and will issue definite instructions for a full disclosure to be made to him in order that he may make a report to the House as early as possible and thus enable the position to be cleaned up. I am perfectly satisfied that when the facts become known this House will consent to the setting up of a select committee, or even a royal commission, to investigate the control of machine tools and the activities of those who are concerned in their production.Several weeks ago, a dispute occurred at the Aircraft Factory, Lidcombe, as the result of which certain men were dismissed. They were members of a production committee which had been set up in the industry in order to deal with inefficiency and production lag in that particular aircraft undertaking. When suggestions were proffered to the management with the object of rectifying certain matters that had come under their notice, the leaders were dismissed and other members of the committee were disrated. Many men on wages amounting to £10, £12 and £14 a week were being kept in a stateofidleness,contrarytotheirown wishes. They thought that it was high time for the matter to be dealt with properly, consequently they set up a production committee and placed their views before the management. A meeting to discuss the position following upon the dismissals was held during one lunch hour when the greater part of the works was idle. The meeting lasted a. little longer than was expected, and when the men endeavoured to return to work over 100 of them were locked out, and remained so for some days. The employers contended that they were on strike. Eight of the men received a telegram notifying them that they had been dismissed from their employment. Meetings were held at the TradesHall. As the local member, I appealed to the men to return to work. I had received a notification from the Minister for Aircraft Production stating that the whole of the allegations made in the dispute would be inquired into, and that the menscharges would be fully sifted. On that specific undertaking, the men returned to their employment. The Minister has made statements which fully vindicate the attitude adopted by the men, whose names have been besmirched and who have been under a cloud. On a Saturday night only a few weeks ago, I heard the Minister state over the air that ultimately the action of the men would be found to be fullyjustified. He went on to say that the greed and selfishness of certain interests with an un- Australian outlook had been holding up aircraft production in Australia. He followed that with a statement which was published in the press only a few days ago, in which he said -Delays in production had occurred. These delays had been caused by -1 ) Government variation of production schedule;Domination of the industry by private interests.In Sydney, there had been delays because key men were removed from high posts when their opinion did not correspond with the opinion of others. That our aircraft production industry could not afford to lose even one capable manmeant nothing, apparently. Lower down the ladder, workers were charged with being fifth columnists because they got restless and expressed their displeasure as trade unionists. I had to intervene.That was a public vindication of the men. The Prime Minister has called for a special report from the Leader of the Opposition, who is acquainted with the facts, having inquired as to the reason why a high American expert had left his employment and returned to America. These facts being in the possession of the Government, and the specific promise having been made that there would be an inquiry into the allegations of the men, the charges should be fully investigated, and the men should be given an opportunity to vindicate their attitude.The Clyde Engineering Company Limited at Granville employs 1,700 men. The War Expenditure Committee has inquired into the position at the works. It has obtained first-hand information, and has brought in reports which clearly show that the industry is not being used to its full productive capacity, as it cannot obtain the requisite war orders from the Munitions Department in Melbourne. Although it is an industry that the Board of Area Management in Sydney, under the chairmanship of Sir Phillip Goldfinch, stated should be used to full capacity, it is not getting the orders to which it is entitled. It was producing trench mortars at the rate of 70 each week, and the number could have been increased to 100. Suddenly the orders were stopped because the Army authorities stated that they had enough mortars. Surely, however, this cannot be true, now that so many troops are coming to this country. It would be better to have the work done here than to have the mortars made in the United States of America and shipped here, -with all the risks attendant upon the voyage. These works have produced the largest locomotives made in Australia, and also the greatest crane, which was to the order of Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited for installation at Whyalla. The men say that they could produce tanks, if need be. I know that the Prime Minister (Mr. Curtin) has intervened in the matter, but so far no satisfaction has been obtained.To-day, I raised with the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr. Ward) the subject of production committees in a number of industries. I desire to bring under the notice of honorable members the following report, published in the Sydney Morning Herald, dealing with what has been done in this way in the United States of America -","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[34]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Whereas the present Government has gazetted regulations controlling banking, nothing has been done to regulate these other financial institutions which play an important part in the life of the community, and which make large contributions to government loans. 1 propose to cite a case so shameful that it merits the serious consideration of the Government. It may be considered advisable to bring in legislation to control life assurance companies and their activities, with particular reference to the relationship of master and servant, so i hat persons who peddle life assurance for the companies may be assured of the benefits of workers compensation. This is the case of a gentleman named Walter Rothwell Archibald, who shared in the Archibald estate. He contracted with the City Mutual Life Assurance Society of Sydney to borrow money on his interest under a will. Altogether, a sum exceeding £3,000 was lent up to the time when Archibald found it necessary to assign absolutely to the assurance company his interest under the will. The assurance companys solicitors were not satisfied that his interest was a vested interest at the time the assignment was made. Therefore, in order to make sure that his interest was not contingent upon his aged mother predeceasing him, it was suggested by the company, and agreed to by Archibald, that he enter into a contract with the company in the amount of .£5,000 against the contingency of his dying before his mother. In consideration of this assurance of £5,000, which was a nonprofit assurance, he was to pay to the company £385 as a single premium. The unexpected happened, and Archibald did not survive his mother. When the estate came to be distributed, Archibald having assigned his interest under the will, an amount of £13,000 was paid to the life assurance company. I have here a photostat copy of the policy for £5,000 which matured on Archibalds death. The company objected to paying the £5,000 on the ground that the premium had not been paid, but here is a deed issued by the responsible directors of the company which sets it out that the premium was, in fact, paid. This matter would have gone to law except that Archibalds widow, who has . two small children, was left without means, and the executor himself, in the event of the action, going against her, would have had to pay the costs.","Shop Committees","BRITAINS WAR OUTPUT- RUSSIAN CRITICISM","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[36]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I reminded the honorable gentleman that this right which he said was vested in the democracy has only been discovered by him since he ceased to be a Minister. I have made no change in this practice. The censorship stands on precisely the same footing as it has stood on since the commencement of the war. It is true that nothing i3 better calculated to assist the enemy than the creation of a feeling of distrust and alarm among the public. It is clear that countries have the censorship in order to promote security, and attacks upon the bona fides of the censorship, if widely circulated, would have the effect of undermining respect for the censorship and, indeed, arouse suspicion about the purposes for which it was being used. In that way, the security of the country would be affected. As the result, the Press Censorship Order, made under National Security Regulations before I became the Minister in charge of the department, prohibits any published reference to any specific act of censorship. That is the characteristic of censorships all over the world, including censorship in democracies.","Shop Committees","BRITAINS WAR OUTPUT- RUSSIAN CRITICISM","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[36]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

About a year ago, the previous Government agreed, at my suggestion, to appoint a parliamentary committee so that in formulating legislation to deal with broadcasting, we should have a detached series of constructive recommendations as to how this extraordinary service to the community could be placed upon a fair and proper basis. The committee was set up. I have asked that the committee expedite its report, and I await, as I am sure the House as a whole awaits, the conclusions of the committee, because we need guidance in respect of the way in which Parliament shall legislate for the control of broadcasting activities.","Shop Committees","BRITAINS WAR OUTPUT- RUSSIAN CRITICISM","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[36]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[2]/continue[24]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I say quite clearly that, so far as the Government is concerned, the Australian Broadcasting Commission is operating under its statute and will continue to operate under it, but I do nope that Parliament will have the opportunity to deal with the report of the committee, and I am confident, having regard to the personnel of the committee, that the report will be of use to Parliament. For my part I shall be prepared to give effect to all its substantive recommendations, because I am sick and tired of the wrangling between political parties about the way broadcasting shall be organized.The honorable member for Richmond (Mr. Anthony) directed attention to the state of affairs in Canberra in regard to air raid precautions. All I can say to him is that the matter is under proper examination. Advice has been tendered to the Government in respect of not only Canberra, but also a great number of other places in Australia. There is an order of priority in this matter, having regard to the capacity of the country to make provision, and I consider that members of Parliament are quite capable of sharing the risks of the community. With regard to the preservation of documents, [ assure the honorable member that steps have already been taken.The honorable member for Reid (Mr. Morgan) referred to munitions and I am sure that the Minister for Munitions (Mr. Makin), who heard him, will take that matter up.I tell the honorable member for Cook (Mr. Sheehan) that I shall indeed look into the disabilities which are suffered equally by those who have volunteered for, and those who have been called into, the Military Forces as the result of their having to give up incomes much higher than can be got in the Defence Forces. Their obligations in regard to rent and hire purchase and the like are embarrassing. We shall do our best about that matter.With respect to the matter raised by the honorable member for Watson (Mr. Falstein), I have only to say that it looks to me as though it were a moneylending transaction by the life assurance society, and on the submission made by the honorable gentleman, it would appear that thesociety has acted harshly. That would be my judgment if what he has said represents the whole story, but, before I arrived at a decision, I should have to ask that the company itself should present its case. At any rate, it is a matter of great regret that this Parliament was not able to deal with life assurance in time of peace. A measure was introduced in the Senate and whatever that chamber may have thought about the bill, it was a workable plan, and, I think, could have been passed.Question resolved in the affirmative.","Shop Committees","BRITAINS WAR OUTPUT- RUSSIAN CRITICISM","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[36]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[2]/continue[27]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
