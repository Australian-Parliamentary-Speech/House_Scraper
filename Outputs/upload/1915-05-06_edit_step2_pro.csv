The motion of the honorable member for Angas refers to the proportional system as I know it in Tasmania. In that State we first introduced the Hare-Spence system, which was later improved upon by the late Mr. Justice Clark. That gentleman gave a lot of attention to the matter, and was assisted by Mr. R. M. Johnston in evolving the system up to its present form. As a result, there is in Tasmania a system of proportional representation equal, if not superior, to any system in the world. Recently I read that the authorities in England are about to send out a Commissioner to inquire into the working of the proportional voting system in Tasmania. Therefore, I think I shall be justified in taking that -system as the basis of my arguments on this motion. Since speaking on this subject a fortnight ago I have had an opportunity of looking into some documents I had in hand, and I propose to quote somewhat fully this afternoon from a very valuable report submitted to the Parliament of Tasmania by Mr. H. E. Packer, the then Chief Electoral Officer in Tasmania; Mr. E. L. Piesse, LL.B., Assistant Deputy Returning Officer for the districts of Denison and Franklin; and Mr. J. F. Daly, who is now the Chief Electoral Officer of Tasmania. Mr. Piesse is a worthy son of a gentleman who did excellent work in this House.

Honorable members will remember that when I was speaking to this motion on a previous occasion I pointed out that this system of voting tended to bring about a clique form of government. In my opinion, the. usefulness of the system ceases when the whole political body is divided into two great camps - the  ins  and the  outs, or Labour and Liberal. The report to which I am referring deals with the Tasmanian election of 1912, which was one of the most important elections which, has been held under this system, and it says -It has been assumed, in preparing the table, that a voters party allegiance is shown by this No. 1 choice. All papers on which the No. I choices are given to Liberal candidates are assumed to be the ballot-papers of followers of the Liberal party, and so with the Labour party. The scrutiny showed that some electors gave their No. 1 choice to one party, and their No. 2 and higher choices to the other party; and in such cases it may be that No. 2 and the higher choices indicate the voters party, and that the No. 1 choice was given to a candidate of the other party for a personal reason. _ But it is thought that the assumption is a fair one for the purposes of this table, and the table contained in the Appendix.","N/A","SENATE : PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[1]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

My view is that the No.- 1 vote is the effective one. In the Tasmanian election of 1912, the proportions were obtained by the parties all right, but what was the result? A table in this report shows what the result was. For each electorate six members were required. In the electorate of Bass, the Liberal proportion of voters was 3.1, and the Labour proportion 2.9. The result of the election was that the Liberals returned three members and the Labour party three members. In Darwin, the Liberal proportion was 2.8, and the Labour proportion 3.2; but, again, each party returned three members.","N/A","SENATE : PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[1]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is clear, then, that the rules of the Electoral Act have produced proportional representation of the parties.Then bitter complaint was made of the smallness of the majority. That is the great trouble.  But the election has resulted in the larger party having only two more members than the smaller, and it is of interest to examine how far the system of the Electoral Act must necessarily produce such result.In speaking on the subject previously, I stated that the system of- voting advocated by the honorable member for Angas would give greater representation in the Senate to the minority, and that the consequence would be that an Administration would have so small a majority to support it that it would be difficult for it to get its measures passed. The report from which I am reading continues -It is to bc noticed, in the first place, that in a small House, a narrow majority must necessarily occur when parties are nearly equal in the constituencies, and that if these were larger, the majority would probably be increased relatively as well as absolutely. If each district had returned ten members in place of six, making a House of fifty, one party would probably have had twenty-eight members, and the other twenty-two, giving the sufficient working majority of six.I have spoken of the waste of votes caused by the proportional system of voting. This is what really occurred in Tasmania during an election under the proportional system of voting -In preparing Table V., some 37,000 papers wore considered. Losses occurred from 1,650, or about 4i per cent., of these papers, owing to cross voting. In addition to these papers, there would be others on which there waa cross voting, which did not become effective owing to election or exclusion of candidates. The total amount of cross voting is, therefore, not shown in the table; but the table shows that there was cross voting, which resulted in loss on about one paper in twenty, and that the loss from each of such papers was about half a vote.The most important objection to the honorable members proposal is the difficulty of counting the ballot papers. During the general election held in Tasmania on 30th April, 1912, there were six members to be elected for the constituency of Denison. The ballot papers numbered 16,600, of which 444 were rejected as informal, leaving 16,156 formal ballot papers. The quota was obtained by dividing the number of formal ballot papers by seven and adding one, which gave 2,309. I have here a facsimile of the sheet showing the counting on which the return was made. The final choice was arrived at only after the one hundred and thirtieth count. Two members were elected on the first count, because of the No. 1 votes cast for them. These were Sir Elliott Lewis and Mr. Woods. Two Labour men - Mr. Barker and Mr. Edmunds - ran very close together. Mr. Barker secured sufficient votes to keep him in the count, but not enough to reach the quota, even though he was elected. He was elected on 1,708 effective votes, Mr. Edmunds, who obtained 1,670 effective votes, being rejected. Therefore, even under the proportional system of voting, a number of persons remains unrepresented.","N/A","SENATE : PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[1]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

132,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"SMITH, William","KTU","N/A","ALP; NAT from 1917","N/A",2925,"- I question whether every honorable member of Parliament understands it. Honorable members can imagine the amount of calculating necessary to get out a return such as that for Denison. Sir Elliott Lewis got 2,732 votes, and was declared elected. When I stood for election in Tasmania I had to obtain 9,500 votes before being elected. Little parties can be formed all over the place, and so long as a candidate gets over the quota of 2,309, in he goes. I take it that this system is all right when there are many different sections desirous of returning members directly concerned with the temperance question, or the religious question, and so forth. But now that the parties are so clearly defined, it is not at all necessary. As an instance of how the people are divided into two distinct parties, I might cite one of the Senate elections in Tasmania, at which Colonel Cameron was a candidate.Colonel Cameron had occupied a seat in the Senate, and might be described as one of the most popular gentlemen in Tasmania, for whom a personal vote could safely be relied on. But Colonel Cameron came out as an Independent candidate, and he did not obtain nearly, uie number of votes recorded for either the selected Liberal candidate, or the selected Labour candidate. I think that similar results could be found all over Australia at the present time; and it is for that reason that I think proportional voting now is of no earthly use. I admit that it would affect the representation of the State ; but of what value would that representation be? Any change in this regard could only have the effect of retarding business. We know how, in the case of the late Government, the party stuck closely to the leaders, who were thus enabled to hold office for a much longer period than any of us would have anticipated. The effect of proportional representation in the Senate would simply lengthen the sittings without having any effect whatever on the legislation.","N/A","SENATE : PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[1]/continue[12]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It would be idle for any one to submit a proposal of this kind and claim that it represented a perfect system. No system is perfect, but any plan that aims at giving people representation in proportion to their numerical strength - except, of course, sections so small that representation cannot be given to them - is a step in the direction of affording the opportunity not only to exercise the franchise, but to voice their views in the legislative halls of their country. The Minister of Home Affairs, as one who has given this question a good deal of consideration, seems to take up a very anomalous position. He opposes this motion, but at the same time he is in favour of the initiative and referendum, which would greatly extend the power of a proportion of the people outside, though what that proportion is has not been definitely stated by the Labour party. However, if we take the figures in the case of some of the American States, or of Switzerland, we find that 8,000 electors may be able either to compel the introduction of legislation, or to demand a referendum on proposed legislation. The Minister of Home Affairs told us that he would not give to any minority outside the power of direct representation in this Parliament, but, as I say, he is at the same time prepared to permit the initiative and referendum, with the consequences I have indicated.","N/A","SENATE : PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Is the initiative and referendum merely intended as a sop to the minority outside?

When this motion was introduced by the honorable member for Angas, the honorable member for Maranoa offered some remarks on it; and if we do not always agree with the honorable member for Maranoa, we must admit that he invariably brings robust common sense to bear upon the questions before us. I think that he was drawing upon that store of common sense rather than upon the principles of equity, in relation to electoral law, when he said,  Mr. Speaker, the system that gets me into this House is good enough for me. The proposal that parties should be given something like equitable representation in this Parliament, according to their numerical strength, is one to which no true Democrat can object. The Minister of Home Affairs was at some pains to explain how such a system might be manipulated, and that the ideals sought to be achieved by it might never be reached. The honorable member for Denison, speaking to-day, pointed out that, at the present time, there is a strong wave of public opinion in favour of the abolition of the liquor trade. He urged that we might have a party springing up having that for its sole object, with the result that the country, if this system were in operation, might be under the administration of a minority party representing, for the time being, the opinion of the majority on that one question. Let us consider for a moment the argument so advanced. If the opinion of the Australian people were overwhelmingly in favour of the abolition of the liquor traffic, then, under this system, the people would have their way. And if Parliament is to be a true reflex of the mind of the people, it must give the people their wish. This Anti-liquor party, having wiped out what it believed to be a blot on the national life of the country, might consider that it had served its purpose, and we might once more return to ordinary party lines. I hold that no one need take alarm if, from time to time, the people change their views. We have no right to feel that we are permanently entrenched in public favour. My experience of public life is not a very lengthy one, but it lias been sufficient to satisfy me that, with many of us, the feeling grows that we are here for life - that we are permanent members of the Commonwealth Legislature. That, to my mind, is not a good thing for the country. A man can remain too long in a Parliament, and I believe in giving the people greater facilities than they have to-day to change their representatives without changing their principles.","N/A","SENATE : PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[2]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

153,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"RODGERS, Arthur","KZT","N/A","LP; NAT from 1917","N/A",2927,"- No; I am speaking of political parties generally. I recognise that the principle of preferential voting for the House of Representatives, and proportional voting for the Senate, would do much to bring about that condition of affairs to which the honorable member for Angas has referred : that parties would then be rather inclined to look for points. of agreement in respect of which they could serve the whole community, rather than for points of difference. They would cease to try to set up policies in direct opposition to each other for no other purpose than to insure the maintenance of a strict party system. The Minister of Home Affairs alluded to the position of parties in the Old Country, and expressed the opinion that the party system is alone the basis upon which all political issues have to be determined. I do not share that view. Since the outbreak of war we have had to consider many measures of a non-party character, with the result that the House has been less shackled by party considerations than before, and we have consequently found honorable members in agreement on many questions regardless of the side of the House on which they sit. Bui where strict party lines are maintained, we never find honorable members from both sides coming together, even on questions concerning which their views are very much alike. This is a world of diversity- a world in which 1,700,000,000 souls exist, and in which no two persons are exactly alike. How is it possible, then, to imagine that a mould can be produced to fit the minds of half the people of this country ? Every day, by means of party principles, we are making greater exactions upon the people. We are asking the people more and more every day to make an abject surrender of their own personal opinions in order that they may join certain parties. They are asked to subscribe in advance to codes of politics which sometimes they may not have fully considered. The old idea of a deliberative assembly is, to my mind, the better one. In this House seventy-five men - drawn from every corner of the Commonwealth - are expected to meet to deal with the affairs of the country. The Commonwealth was divided into seventy-five electorates, so that each division might have its logical representation in the halls of Parliament, so that each might select as its representative a man who knew the conditions of life there, who knew its wants, and the conditions of its industries. In this way it was intended that the House of Representatives should contain the corporate wisdom of the whole nation rather than that it should consist of a collection of units on the one side, all subscribing to the one set of principles. The idea was that we should have here seventy-five men of diverse thoughts; that the doors of the halls of Parliament should be thrown open; and that with the press of the country present, and the light of day shining upon our deliberations, we should give expression to our honest opinions and pass measures designed to benefit the whole of the people. I regret to say, however, that we are stepping backwards in the matter of political representation. We are in the bog and the rut of party politics. The honorable member for Adelaide smiles, and is in disagreement, I presume, with the views to which I am giving expression; but he himself is tied and bound by the rules of his party. I do not wish to hurt his feelings in any way, but he must admit that before he could obtain a seat in this House he had to join his party, that he had to surrender his own views and to pledge himself to carry out the platform of his party.","N/A","SENATE : PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[2]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This House cannot hope to reasonably reflect the evolutionary development of the political life of the country if the members of any political party, before . coming here, pledge themselves to any particular electoral system, and so render it impossible for them to assist in moulding a better system. I am not politically pledged to any electoral system that can be improved upon. I am free to vote for any suggested improvement that will be in the interests of the people, no matter from what side of the House it may come. My party gives me that freedom. The proposal made by the honorable member for Angas deserves the special consideration of the Opposition. It is democratic, in that it would give substantial minorities, subject to the quota to which the honorable member has referred, an opportunity to secure direct representation in the Parliament of the Commonwealth - in the only place where that direct representation can be of any use to it. Why should any party fear to allow any person to enter this Chamber, as the logical representative of a substantial minority, to represent the views of that substantial minority as they can never be voiced outside? I believe that this system will make for the enlargement of the political thought of Australia, and that it deserves well at the hands of the House.","N/A","SENATE : PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[2]/continue[15]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
168,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"YATES, George","L1T","Adelaide","N/A","N/A",2929,".- I should not have spoken but for the remark made by the honorable member who has just resumed his seat - that in the matter of electoral reform the people of Australia were stepping backwards. To my mind, a proportion of these who are supporting this proposal for proportional representation are not sincere. I cast no doubt on the sincerity of the mover of the motion; but I believe that the Liberal party would not be in favour of the introduction of such a system, and that they would carry this motion only for party purposes. In South Australia we had the spectacle of the Liberal party, while in opposition, declaring itself in favour of proportional representation, altheugh it was hard to determine whether they referred to proportional representation or effective voting. They declared that they would bring such a system into force, but when the time came to test their sincerity these gentlemen failed to do what they promised. They wished to make themselves secure, and one Liberal Minister declared that under the system which they proposed they would remain in power for fourteen or twenty years. Liberalism, we were told, was going to rule in South Australia, but, as on previous occasions, it over-reached itself, and the Liberal party, instead of being in power in South Australia to-day, is a forlorn crowd. It is hard to find any one prepared to man the Liberal ship there nowadays, because of the wrecked condition to which it has been reduced. Before taking office, the Liberal party in South Australia proposed to establish what it described as a sane system of representation, under which the people would not be hampered by the restrictive pledges which, it was said, Labour imposed upon its nominees. But the fact that when they had the opportunity to put the system in operation they failed to do so makes me more than ever believe that the proposal now before us is not genuine. According to the honorable member for Wannon, we are going backwards. As a matter of fact, it is only the party on this side of the chamber that has ever pushed anything forward in politics. The honorable member instanced the position of this House, and he claimed that there had been no Labour Government in Victoria, but, in my opinion, if you scratch a Liberal in Victoria, you scratch the same individual in any other State. Liberals are all the same, no matter from what State they come, and therefore, although they may be gathered together in this House from various States, they are the same set of individuals. The fact that in their own State Houses, which have far greater power in regard to the development of the States than has the National House, they do not relieve us from the dead hand of the past in the shape of the restricted franchise for the Legislative Council, is a strange commentary upon their protestation that they desire to relieve the body politic of the shackles which they claim the Labour party has placed upon it. I told the electors in the district that I have the honour to represent that I should oppose this proposal when it came forward, not because I was not prepared to realize that a proportional representation system has not many merits, and perhaps would be good for the Commonwealth, but because I considered that before I should be ready to give away that for which the Labour party had fought in their backward progress - if I may use the paradox - in gaining their present position in the Commonwealth, the other party should first show their Iona fides, and in the State Legislatures urge reform in regard to that House which has been the bar to the progress of the community. If the Liberal party would show their bona fides in that direction, I am satisfied that a majority of honorable members on this side of the chamber would be prepared to meet them in the direction of making progress more stable, sound, and prolific by making it wider.","N/A","SENATE : PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

174,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"YATES, George","L1T","N/A","N/A","N/A",2930,"- The honorable member should not forget that a thin majority can often PUt something on a platform. Evidently the honorable member is quite prepared to accept what a thin majority might do in South Australia, but is not prepared to accept what a thin majority has done in regard to the constitution of the Senate. If he accepts the verdict of a thin majority in the one case, why should he not allow a thin majority to dominate the affairs of the Commonwealth as it does to-day ? I am not prepared to argue the matter of proportional representation from the stand-point of equity, because I believe that honorable members opposite are not sincere. Last session I heard the honorable member for Cook opposing a motion on the ground that those who had proposed it were; not sincere in their proposal. Whatever advantages we on this side of the House possess have had to be fought for over a long series of years. The Labour party has had to grow from nothing to the power it is to-day; and while it was coming into its own, there was ample opportunity for the other side to give way in the direction of proportional representation, and the recognition of minorities. But no; everything we have got has been wrested from the other side, and yet to-day we have an appeal to the f air mindedness of the party now in power to give away that for which it has had to fight in the past. In the other sphere of politics and activities governing our daily lives, our opponents in State Houses hang like grim death to the dead hand of the past, not giving away one iota. Even after a recent referendum of the people in South Australia, some of them are hoping to heaven that the hard-crusted Tories in that State will not listen to the voice of the people, and will turn the referendum down. The Honorable C. C.: Kingston, who admirably adorned this House, took a referendum on one occasion on the subject of adult suffrage for the Upper House, and the people carried it by an overwhelming majority; but the Tories of the Legislative Council would not accept the will of the people, and turned adult suffrage down. Yet to-day, because there are only five Liberals in the Senate - and one of them is only half a Liberal, because he was returned on the Labour votes in South Australia - we are asked to give away that power which is ours by reason of that just system of adult suffrage. We are asked to give back what we have wrested from the other party by sheer hard work in the direction of educating the masses, and showing them that we could do some good for them. Only last session the Commissioner of Crown Lands in South Australia made the statement that the Government had made the Liberals safe in South Australia for the next fourteen or twenty years; but that gentleman spoke without realizing what public opinion was in regard to re-electing him and his confreres. His Government repudiated the principle of proportional representation, and gerrymandered the electorates in such a way that they hoped to be in power for that period ; but they were mistaken. Again, going back to the move prior to that occasion, when the Democracy were allowed, as far as the then head of the Government would allow them, a say in regard to how they should be governed, they said, in no uncertain voice, that they were satisfied Democracy should govern, and that this reform should be brought about. But when the matter went to the House of privilege, the House by which the Liberal element will always stand, and for which it will always fight hard, it was turned down. They even tried, by gerrymandering, to further entrench the House of privilege by increasing its numbers, notwithstanding that the proposal was against the opinion of the general community, as far as could be ascertained without a vote having been taken on the question. This House of second-hand thought was increased in numbers, not with the idea of giving to the Democracy greater privileges and powers of self-government, but in order to preserve to those who had so long held the reins of government, if possible, even greater powers. To revert to what brought me to my feet, the charge of the honorable member for Wannon that we were going back in politics, I say that it is only because we are going forward that this reform is urged from the other side.","N/A","SENATE : PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[3]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Liberal element hold privileges to which they have no right, and which the dead hand of the past has given them. Let them, therefore, be generous and give way. Let the honorable member go to his Premier in Victoria and ask him to bring in a Bill for the reform of the Legislative Council. Let him ask the Liberals in South Australia to give support to the present Premier of South Australia when he asks for a redistribution of seats and incorporates a system of proportional voting. But they will not hear of it in South Australia, and the Bill would be kicked out of the Legislative Council, as was the referendum initiated by the Hon. C. C. Kingston. The honorable member knows full well that the Legislative Councils will not give way; and he knows, also, that to-day this motion is brought forward without any sincerity. I do not say that the honorable member for Angas is not sincere, for I have every confidence in his sincerity; but those who support him, and those who still support the State Houses of Legislature as they are constituted, ask for this reform with their tongues in their cheeks. The honorable member for Wannon asked me whether I signed the party pledge because I could not trust myself. I pledged myself because past experience has taught the Labour party that there are many who cannot trust themselves. The body politic is only human; and knowing that many are liable to fall - we have had some in this Parliament with which South Australia has had to deal - the party behind demand that all, good, bad. or indifferent, should sign the pledge, and accordingly we sign it. That we should be twitted with taking a retrograde step in politics is rather funny. We are told that the Labour party are hampered and leg-roped, and progress sideways like the crab, yet the Liberal element pay lis the compliment of copying us even in regard to the plebiscite. When I was secretary to the Labour party in South Australia, I had sent to me the pledge of the Liberal party. It was foolscap size, whereas our pledge is on paper about a quarter foolscap size.

At the last election the Western Australian Liberals were within 3,000 votes of obtaining a seat in the Senate, and an additional 5,000 votes cast in our favour would, I think, have given us all the Senate seats. For years I have advocated that the States should not be regarded as single electorates for the election of senators. The Constitution gives power to divide the States into electorates for the purpose of electing members of the Senate; but that legislative power has never been utilized. Such a division of the States might not give a perfect system, but it would give far better results than the present system of treating each State as one electorate.","N/A","SENATE : PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[4]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I have advocated that, for the purpose of Senate elections, each State should be divided into three electorates, because I believe that that system would give a better opportunity for the various interests in the State to be represented in another place, instead of being, as they are in more than one State, altogether swamped by the votes of one interest in a portion of the electorate. It is also very desirable that the electors should have an opportunity of knowing the candidates for whom they are voting. It is impossible for a candidate for the Senate to visit the whole of a State like Western Australia, and, therefore, the electors have to vote according to the party ticket, as I indicated many years ago would be the result of the present system. I then predicted that people would not vote for persons they knew or had seen, or even heard of, but for persons nominated by cliques, unions, and leagues. I do not regard that as a very effective system of repre- sen tat ion. Several of the States have, in connexion with the elections for the local Legislatures, departed from the system of bare majorities, and have adopted some system of preferential voting. Tasmania has practically boxed the compass by trying all sorts of electoral schemes, and the people are not satisfied yet. There is no doubt, however, that the preferential system is fairer than an electoral system by which the party which obtains merely a portion of the votes recorded - not a majority - can obtain the whole representation of a State in the Senate. Indeed, I understand that the preferential system finds a place in the Labour partys machinery in connexion with the selection of candidates to contest elections.","N/A","SENATE : PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[4]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

204,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MASSY-GREENE, Walter","KNF","N/A","LP; NAT from 1917","N/A",2933,"- Exactly, and I hope to convince honorable members that if the method I propose be adopted it will, in all probability, lead bo the establishment of the Federal Capital in a shorter period of time. Moreover, that system can be put into operation without incurring any very heavy additional financial obligation. I find that the actual sum expended on the Federal Capital last, year was £252,245, the largest expenditure which has been incurred on those works in any year since they were put in hand ; whilst in the current financial year an expenditure of £270,000 is estimated. Those sums may seem very large to those who do not desire to see any expenditure at all on the Federal Capital, but when we take into consideration the whole of the ultimate cost necessary to make that Capital site habitable, those sums represent a very small proportion indeed, and at such a rate of expenditure it will be a great many years before a sufficient sum will have been expended to make it possible for the Federal Parliament to hold its sittings at Canberra. Not only was this relatively small, though large, sum spent on the Capital site, but it was taken entirely out of revenue. Having regard bo the fact that this Capital is to last through the history of this great Commonwealth, the foundations of which we are laying to-day for the generations bo come, ib does nob seem fair that we should continue year after year baking out of the revenue of the country smaller or larger sums to build the city, and ultimately hand the completed Capital down to posterity as an absolutely free gift. It does not seem right that the taxpayers of today should have to bear the full burden of the establishment of this Capital city, lt must be perfectly evident to everybody that the time is rapidly, approaching when, if we are to seriously attempt the building of the city, we must abandon the endeavour to finance that work out of the Consolidated Revenue of the country, and if progress is to be made at the rate we desire, float a loan for the purpose. Australia is rapidly drifting into a position where its credit resources, great as they are, will be altogether inadequate to the enormous charges to be made upon them. When we consider the enormous task of development that awaits the efforts of our infant nation - the railways that must be built to give communication to the vast areas that are now practically uninhabited, the variety and extent of the activities with which the Australian people desire to associate their system of government - it must be evident that, wherever it may be possible to shift the burden from being a direct charge on the credit of the country, by raising money by other means than the charging of that credit, we should do that. It will be a sufficient burden to charge on our revenue and credit in the near future the erection of a Parliament House, a Governor-Generals residence, and the buildings necessary to house the heads of Departments and other officials who will be employed at the Federal Capital. That work will mean a quite sufficient charge on either our revenue or our credit, because it will cost a considerable sum. Were the building of the Federal Capital in the hands of private enterprise, which has been so much maligned, those responsible would, at the outset, endeavour, to put the whole thing upon a business basis. Were a syndicate of business men to buy a large tract of territory to be cut up for the creation of a city, they would make the proposition finance itself. All parties are agreed that the land which constitutes the Federal Capital Territory 6hall not be sold, but shall remain for all time the property of the nation, and it must be evident that we have in the city site an asset of considerable value, and a business proposition which could be made to finance itself from the outset. As soon as the Seat of Government is ifr. Greene. transferred to Canberra, and the Commonwealth Parliament meets there, a considerable population will be attracted to the city. How large that population will be it is difficult to say. All sorts of estimates have been made. Obviously, however, the value of the land which, now constitutes the Capital site will increase enormously. That land will acquire a rental value which now it does not possess. Therefore, the sooner we are in a position to make use of the Territory, the sooner shall we realize the values which we shall create by establishing the Capital there. It is to the public interest to transfer the Seat of Government to Canberra at the earliest opportunity. The question that always presents itself to my mind in this connexion is,  How can Parliament best make use of the land values which it will create by establishing the Federal Capital ? In my opinion, the best way would be to vest the Federal Capital Territory in fee simple in a Commission, giving to the Commission the power to borrow on its. own bonds guaranteed by the Commonwealth. Of course, we should thus be charging the credit of the country, but only indirectly. If that were done, the Federal Capital proposition would finance itself.","N/A","FEDERAL CAPITAL TERRITORY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[1]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Commissioners would be made a body corporate, like the Railways Commissioners of a State, and in them the lands of the Territory would be vested in fee simple, to be leased to those who desired to settle there. I am not prepared to say how many Commissioners there should be, but there should be at least three - a competent engineer, a competent architect, and a competent businessman ; the last named preferably a business man who had had very extensive experience in house and land agency. Were what I suggest done, it would not be long before we began to receive a considerable amount of revenue from .the Territory. Had the Territory been vested in Commissioners during the last few years, we should have already received a considerable rental from it, and a large population would be permanently settled there.

This is too important a question to hand over to the untrammelled control of any body of men ; and I should like to know for how long it is proposed that this Commission should be elected. I take it that the members of the Commission would be elected by the members of this Parliament - by the Senate and House of Representatives combined - and not nominated by the Government, so that there might be no fear of the pulling of strings or gerrymandering. It is only in the United States that we find cities ruled by Commissions; and the plan is giving splendid results, owing to the fact that the sole object is the benefit of the whole of the city communities. Some 253 cities in the United States are thus controlled; and, as I say, the plan works very well, mainly because the citizens have the power to recall the Commissioners if they do not do their work properly. I strongly resent the suggestion that I de- sire the Seat of Government to remain in Melbourne. On the contrary, I desire to witness what I believe will be the greatest experiment in land tenure ever tried, not only under the British flag, but in the whole wide world. The nearest approach to anything of the kind is found in Hong Kong, where, with the exception of a few allotments, no one owns private land. There is a number of 999-year leases; but the large majority of the leases are for seventy-five years, and these represent the sole source of the revenue of Hong Kong. That revenue doubles itself every twenty years, and is unequalled in any other country. The Leader of the Opposition once said that he believed the Federal city could be built without its finally costing the community one single penny piece. With that view I agree; but I do not agree with the borrowing of money for the purpose. It may be a little dangerous under present circumstances to speak of another note issue, even with the splendid security that we have in Australia; but I ask the honorable member for Richmond whether it would not be worth trying what was successfully done at St. Helens, in Guernsey? In that town it was desired to build a market; and it was not so easy to borrow in those days as it is now. However, there was a very wise Governor in the island; and he asked why the brickmakers, stonemasons, carpenters, and other artisans of the community should not build the markets themselves. Some seven years later the work was carried out, and the money was provided by the issue of 4,000 of what were called market currency notes. These notes, the contractors, workmen, shopkeepers, and others agreed to accept, thus providing that circle which is always necessary in finance - there must be paying out and receiving in. Immediately the markets were built all the stalls were let, and every year so many of the notes were burnt. The result was that in ten years every note had been destroyed, and the people had a property producing a rent of £500 a year for ever. When peace happily comes, why should we not issue currency notes based on the value of the Federal Capital ?","N/A","FEDERAL CAPITAL TERRITORY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[2]/continue[13]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Why should we not issue notes, and earmark them for the purposes of the FederalCapital. If, for example, the Parliament Houses would cost £1,000,000, the Government would have to pay £50,000 as a rental at 5 per cent, each year; and, if the plan I suggest were adopted, the whole of these notes would be redeemed and destroyed in twenty years. If a member of Parliament desired to have a villa or a house, he could get one built according to plans prepared in the Central Administrative Department, and the cost would be met by these notes, the occupant paying a rental of 5 per cent. In this case, again, the whole of the money would be paid in twenty years; and, of course, a member would not enter into such an agreement unless, in case of his leaving the Parliament, his successor would take up the property. The same plan could be pursued in the case of hotels, banks, shops, and so forth; and in twenty-one years the capital would be built, and yielding a large revenue, merely at the cost of printing the notes. The financial circle would be completed by the Government receiving the notes in the payment of taxes and rents, and issuing them to the public servants. I commend this suggestion to the honorable member for Richmond.","N/A","FEDERAL CAPITAL TERRITORY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[2]/continue[14]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Finance was not as well understood in his time as it is to-day, although there was then in operation what I might describe as a kind of land boom finance. There has never been a commission of inquiry equal to that appointed by the United States Government, on which the keenest financial brains of the republic were represented, and which inquired into the great banking systems of the principal countries of the world. Surely no note has ever had such a backing as would be behind these notes of which I speak. Every penny raised by them would be spent in the Federal Territory on necessary buildings, tramways and carriageways generally. Every penny would be spent within the Federal Territory, the lands of which are nationalized for all time, so that there would be a magnificent security. And behind all this there would be the pledge of the only Government in the world that controls a whole continent. In the days of John Law, in -France, the word oi the King was law, and it would have been impossible for any man, even had he possessed ten times his ability, to establish a banking system based upon the foundation of security and justice. 1 hope for a change in regard to the building of the Federal Capital. The Minister, having sprung from the people, and since he is in office by the vote of the people, will take care, I hope, that justice is done to men of Labour sympathies in the Federal Capital who have been crucified. He will see, I trust, that they are not tyrannized over by men whom no union has any cause to thank. The secretary of a union is willing to give evidence that the honorable member for Darwin, when Minister of Home Affairs, had to order one of these men to do his duty by paying the members of his union the wages to which they were justly entitled. Having regard to the expenditure of £252,000, to which the honorable member for Richmond has referred, I think that more than 700 men should be employed in the Federal Territory. It would be interesting to know what has been the cost of the Administrators residence. As to the expensive surveys to which allusion .has been made, I maintain that the only surveyors needed up there are those at present in the field. I have disposed of the question of the fee simple of the Federal Territory lands. I do not think that any Government will ever sell one foot of land in the Federal Territory; but should such an attempt be made while I am in Parliament it will meet with my vigorous opposition. Why should we not meet in the Federal Capital without further delay? Why should we wait until all the necessary permanent buildings have been erected? The Victorian Government did not take long to house the State Parliament - and to house it very comfortably - in the Exhibition Building when it was decided to hand over this huge edifice to the Federal Parliament. A temporary Parliament House could be speedily erected in the Federal Capital, and there we might have day sittings. Once established there I do not think we should have as many deaths amongst members of the Commonwealth Parliament as have taken place. The gaps that have been made in our ranks have been caused largely by the long railway journeys, which many members have to make every week-end between Parliament and their homes. Any honorable member who has reached, or has passed, the meridian of life is very foolish if, week after week, he travels a thousand or fifteen hundred miles in order to attend Parliament. Our late revered Speaker, Sir Frederick Holder, almost collapsed at the Spencer-street station on one occasion shortly before he passed through the shadows. When we meet in the Federal Capital we shall do more work than we do at present, and do it in less time, because we shall sit every day in the week.","N/A","FEDERAL CAPITAL TERRITORY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[2]/continue[15]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The scientific thought of the world is tending towards the view that if all the advantages of machinery, all the genius of inventors, were used for the benefit of the whole, instead of the few, the work of- the world could be done, in a two-hours working day, better than it has been done in a working day of ten or twelve hours. We have machines that are capable of doing in eight hours more than a thousand men could do in the same time. I am looking forward to our occupation of the Federal Capital and to the working out of ideals there that will make Australia an example to every other country. We shall certainly set an example to the rest of the world in regard to land tenures. Queen Victoria during her lifetime helped to make experiments in land tenure that are at present only dimly understood. I have spoken of the experiments made in Hong Kong. Let me remind honorable members of another that was made at Norfolk Island. In accordance with a promise made by Labouchere - a namesake of the one-time editor of the English Truth - those who were conveyed from Pitcairn Island to Norfolk Island were allowed to rule themselves, and if a man from the mainland married a girl on the island, or an island boy returned from the mainland with a wife whom he had married there, the couple were allowed to take up an area of 20 acres, a house was built for them, and they were otherwise assisted. But New South Wales, to its discredit, on taking over the administration of Norfolk Island, broke the sacred pledge which Queen Victoria had given the ancestors of the present occupants of the island, since they were evicted from the houses they had occupied for fifty years. If the original experiment in land tenure had been carried on, we should not have seen a church, preaching the gospel of Christ, monopolizing 1,200 acres of land on an island where there are only 5,000 acres available. The church to which I refer will not even teach the English language in its seminary on the island. It is teaching a dead language - the Motu language of the New Hebrides. Are not those who are converted worthy of being taught the language of the people whose flag flies over their island?","N/A","FEDERAL CAPITAL TERRITORY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[2]/continue[16]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Commission proposed by the honorable - member for Richmond might remove the Federal Territory from the divided control that now exists, and make the administration more efficient and continuous. I have always held the opinion that the Territory might be so managed as to return interest on the money spent upon it. In my opinion, it should have been treated as a separate administrative responsibility from the very first.; at least, it should have been removed from the control of a Minister to that of an independent board, which could have laid down a policy, and carried it on in the same way that Railways Commissioners carry on the important work of controlling State railways. That some drastic alteration is necessary is shown by the history of the work done by the administration in the Territory. An opportunity has recently been given for some investigation into what has bees going on, and some explanation is due from the Minister as to how far the conflict of opinion that has arisen between the architect for the Capital site and the officers of the Department, or even the Minister himself, has been adjusted, because I am satisfied that what has been going on has not been in the interests of the Commonwealth and taxpayers. In the first place, plans were invited from any architect in the world prepared to enter into the competition, and after the plans were received, an independent Board, composed of Mr. J. M. Coane, Mr. J. A. Smith, and Mr. John Kirkpatrick, was appointed to adjudicate on them. Two members of the Board, or a majority of them, chose three designs, and placed them first, second, and third - the first prize being awarded to the design submitted by Mr. Walter Burley Griffin, architect and landscape architect, Chicago, United States of America. A representation of each of the three designs appeared in a schedule, No. 9, issued by the Department of Home Affairs; and on the 27th June, 1912, the Minister appointed a Board of officers of the Department to investigate and report as to the suitability of the designs for adoption for the purpose of the lay-out of the city. This Board consisted of Colonel David Miller, Colonel T. P. Owen, and Messrs. C. R. Scrivener, G. J. Oakeshott, J. S. Murdoch, and Thomas Hill.","N/A","FEDERAL CAPITAL TERRITORY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[3]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

There is no evidence to show that it took into consideration more than the first, second, and third prize plans which had been purchased by the Commonwealth, and were Commonwealth property, and with which it had a perfect right to deal in order to evolve a more practicable and suitable design for the lay-out of the city and the carrying out of the works. Drawing out a plan and submitting it to a Department is different from taking a plan and applying it to the levels and lay-out of the Capital site generally. The latter is an engineering problem. Therefore, it might have been found quite impracticable to lay out the Territory on the lines suggested in the designs, and accordingly Schedule No. 16, issued by the Department of Home Affairs, says -It was decided by Cabinet on the 28th July, 19.13, to invite Mr. Walter Burley Griffin, the author of the first premiated design, to visit Australia, with a view to conferring with the officers constituting the Departmental Board. Mr. Griffin accordingly arrived in Sydney on the 18th August, 1913, and proceeded to Can berra on the following day. To enable Mr. Griffin to form his own conclusions as to the Boards departure from his plan -I understand that the Board, after mature deliberation, took certain features from the different plans and embraced them in a report to the Minister. The schedule proceeds -On the 25th August the Assistant Minister explained to Mr. Griffin and the Board the course he wished their deliberations to follow. Mr. Griffins plan was to form the basis of their discussion. . . . The Board had accepted Mr. Griffins design for the administrative block of the Capital when the joint deliberations were interrupted by that gentlemans appointment as Federal Capital Director of Design and Construction.","N/A","FEDERAL CAPITAL TERRITORY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[3]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We have arrived at the point that Mr. Griffin was appointed Director of Design and Construction at the Federal Capital, and conferred with the Board, in order that some proper design might be adopted. According to the terms of the agreement with Mr. Griffin, he was appointed to -For the purposes of the creation and development of the Federal Capital city at Canberra, prepare general designs, specifications, plans, and documents, and generally direct the details and execution of works necessary to give effect to them, and, in particular, but without limiting the foregoing words -Public ways and parks.Paving of roads and other ways.Street and park planting.City beautification.Services and equipment.Accessory structures.Advise upon the future development of the Federal Capital city, including the location of structures, their co-ordination, construction, materials, and relative scale and proportions.Advise upon and (if so requested by the Minister) prepare conditions of competition for public buildings and works for the Federal Capital city and preliminary feature plans for the guidance of competitors.Not compete in any of the said competitions.Advise upon the allocations of zones for various purposes of occupation in connexion with the Federal Capital city.Draft a code of regulations covering the general character of private improvements, as well as safety and sanitary requirements of constructions.Perform any other work in connexion with the Federal Capital city which is in keeping with the character of the position of Federal Capital Director of Design and Construction.Although Mr. Griffin, as stated in his agreement, was appointed Federal Capital Director of Design and Construction, evidence tendered to the Public Works Committee in Sydney a little while ago shows that he has been superseded in connexion with this important work. In reply to a question, Mr. Griffin told the Public Works Committee -I do think most decidedly that, properly speaking, all the works at the Federal Capital come under my purview as Director of Design and Construction. I am unable, at the present time, to quote the terms of my agreement with the Department of Home Affairs. I had the agreement here yesterday, when I referred to its terms, but I did not bring it with me this morning. The terms of the agreement, however, may bc seen in Schedule 16 issued by the Department. The agreement sets forth that I shall prepare plans and specifications for the works, and it includes surveys and equipments. In my opinion, it means, not only that all works to be constructed there by the Government have to be designed by mo, but that the works have to be designed under my instructions, and carried out under my supervision. That is the position I occupy in the Department by my contract. The contract has not been carried out as regards the details that I require. The staff that I need, and the full information that I require to make my position effective have been withheld from me. So far, no plans of the proposed works have been submitted to mc from the Department, except in relation to the sewer.I do not wish to go into the whole matter. Mr. Griffin dealt with it in detail, and pointed out that he had considerable difficulty with the Department of Home Affairs; that he had been denied the position he had been brought from America to occupy; and that the Department had not given him facilities to which his position entitled him for carrying out his work. There is divided authority at the Federal Capital. There are certain public works going on under the direct supervision of the Ministers responsible officers, and, as Mr. Griffin claims, in defiance of the distinct terms of the agreement under which he was appointed. I pass no opinion upon Mr. Griffins merits as an architect and designer, and I cast no reflection upon the officers of the Department - they are very competent men - but it is not in the interests of the taxpayers, and does not reflect credit on the Parliament that we should have a great work going on in the Federal Territory under divided authority, and where there is conflict of opinion continuing between responsible officers of that Department.","N/A","FEDERAL CAPITAL TERRITORY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[3]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Before Mr. Griffins arrival a Departmental Board put forward one scheme, and now we have the Director putting forward another scheme, and we do not know what is the intention of the Government, or whether they are prepared to rely on the advice of Mr. Griffin or that of the other officers of the Department. It is time that the conflict which now exists between Mr. Griffin and the other Departmental officers was terminated, and the Minister should inform the House what are his intentions in that regard.Mr. AUSTIN CHAPMAN (Eden- bers who hail me as the  Capital King  seem not to know their geography. They think the Capital Site is in my electorate. They do not take enough interest in the business of the House to know that the people in the Capital Territory are disfranchised. Nevertheless, I think it my duty to speak up for them at times, because they are old constituents of mine,, and the fact of their not having votes should not prevent me from standing up for their rights in this chamber. I am entirely in favour of the motion. There ought to be a Commission appointed. I have previously advocated the adoption of a system of management similar to that which is in successful operation in Washington, but I do not agree with those who say that we need architects and theorists on a Commission. We require practical business men, because the management of the Capital Territory is a business proposition. I only wish that I had control of a proposition of the kind, and, with my little business capacity, I would make it pay. The Capital Territory should be made to pay; instead of being a drag on the finances of the country, it could be made into a source of profit. I favour the creation of a Commission with powers similar to those of the Metropolitan Board of Works and the Sydney Harbor Trust, so that it could borrow money and expend it in a profitable way. Will the Minister tell us what he has done in. this matter!? I do not want him to tell us that Mr. Griffin has not this power or that power. The Minister is at the head of a great Department, and he should explain to the House why it is that an officer, speaking on oath, told the Public Works Committee that he had been unjustly treated. It is the Ministers function to show that he really controls this work. At present the people of the country are being fooled. There are foolish people who think that the expenditure on the Federal Territory should cease, and some who think that the site is not yet decided, even though three-quarters of a million pounds has been expended on the Territory. At first I was not in favour of the present Capital Site, but I bowed to the decision of Parliament, and I am prepared to admit now that we have chosen a good site. But the work of creating the Capital is progressing at a snails pace, and the sooner somebody applies a spur to the Minister the better. It is of no use to say that there is no conflict between Mr. Griffin and the officers of the Department. There is friction, and the Minister ought to be able to tell the House whose is the fault. He ought to be able to tell us that the man or men responsible for the delay in the Capital works will be removed. I do not care who the men are; they should not be allowed to prevent progress. The Minister should have backbone enough to take control of the Department. On previous occasions we have heard talk of the india-rubber stamp period in the Home Affairs Department; has that state of affairs been revived 1 The delay in the Capital works has been astounding, and the expenditure has been extravagant. My constituency surrounds the Capital Territory, and if I consulted my own interests, I would not cavil at the expenditure, because my constituents say it is a good thing to have heavy expenditure there. But I am not afraid to do my public duty, and I Bay that it is a bad thing for the country that money should have been wasted in that or any other place.","N/A","FEDERAL CAPITAL TERRITORY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[4]/continue[10]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

On one of the main avenues a bank with a chamber suitable for one of the largest banking institutions in the city has been built. It is due from the Minister that he should give an explanation of what is being done. I believe he is full of good intentions, but I remind him that the way to a warmer place than Canberra is paved with good intentions. If the Federal Capital works are to be constructed on a business basis, they should not be made a charge on the revenue of the country. I ask the Minister why he blocked the efforts of his predecessor by refusing to withdraw the advertisement for competitive plans for the parliamentary buildings of the Capital ? On a previous occasion, when we asked for information, the Minister led us to believe that we would get it in a few days; no doubt he hoped that we would forget it in the meantime. Let him tell the House to-night what has been done. If the officers are in conflict, it is his business to settle the trouble. Let him answer the charge that Mr. Griffin has made. The honorable gentleman poses as a friend of the poor, and I ask him to explain why he finds it necessary to drag poor men, who hold a few acres of land, before the High Court, and ruin them, instead of appointing an arbitration tribunal to deal with the unfortunate land-holder who is required to give up his home. It is easy for the Minister to say to the poor settlers, I will meet you in the High Court, but whether the settler wins or loses, the action in the Court spells ruin for him. Within the last fortnight the Minister has dragged several poor men before the Court, and they are nearly ruined. Let the Minister explain to the House what is Mr. Griffins position, and what is Colonel Millers position. Colonel Miller has been at the Capital site for the last eighteen months or two years, and has been called the Administrator of the Federal Territory, while some other officer has been doing his work in the Department on a smaller salary, no permanent appointment as Administrator having been made, as it should have been. I will not attack the officers, many of them are good officials. The person primarily responsible for all that is done at the Federal Capital is the Minister, and the second responsibility is on those who, in this House, support the Minister. It is my intention to call a meeting of members who are interested in this matter in order to see if we cannot consider it apart from party points of view. This is a question that is above party, but it seems as if an earthquake will be required to move the Minister, and, if necessary, I will cause that earthquake, or know the reason why.","N/A","FEDERAL CAPITAL TERRITORY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[5]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Let us consider what the much abused departmental officers have done and are doing. Tenders were called by the late Government for the construction of the channels and dams in connexion with the water supply for the city. Every facility was given to the contractors throughout Australia to tender for the work, and plans and specifications were provided. The tenders submitted were much higher than the departmental estimate. Fresh tenders were called for, the Government of the day actually promising to carry the material to be used to the positions in which it was to be placed. But again the tenders submitted were 25 per cent, higher than the departmental estimate. The work is now being done by day labour, under departmental supervision, and done effectively and well for 25 per cent, less than the price submitted in the tenders that were received. The last Government was prejudiced against the day-labour system, and stopped all works, so that tenders might be called for. The charges against the departmental officers have been based on hearsay evidence. The honorable member who made them was evidently misinformed.

The dam across the Cotter River is almost finished, and the supply of water is the purest that I have seen, coining as it does off granite country. The pipe-line is nearly finished, and there is a huge reservoir in course of construction. When it has been finished, the water supply works will be complete. There is also a station for generating electricity, which is one of the finest in the southern hemisphere, and equal, I think, to any in the world. Mr. Christie, the engineer-in-charge, explained to me the labour-saving machinery which has been installed there, and it appeared to me better than anything I have seen in Switzerland, France, or Great Britain. He assured me that they would get 12 per cent, of the effective capacity of the coal used; and the honorable member for Henty knows from practical experience that it is considered good to get 6 per cent, of the effective capacity of the coal. I saw the mechanical stokers, the boilers, and the arrangements for consuming the smoke, to prevent smoke nuisance. The station will supply all the power needed at the Capital for many years to come.

At Canberra, however, the roads are being constructed as no contractor would make them. They have there the necessary material and the necessary men, and the roads are equal to any in Australia - good macadamized thoroughfares that will last for years. I saw a traction engine there drawing on the roughest of the roads 30 tons of material, and I understood the Administrator to say - I am not positive that my figures are correct, and, therefore, do not wish to bind him by this statement - that when tenders were asked for the moving of material from one part of the Territory to another, the price asked averaged £2 a ton, but that the Department is doing the work for 3s. a ton. I should like the Minister to ascertain whether I am correct in that statement. Why do honorable members say that nothing has been done at the Territory? The Public Works Committee did all that was asked of it. Mr. Griffin wanted to empty the. sewage round about the city at two or three places. Another engineer desired to take it a little further out.

The Committee, however, was of the opinion that it is not desirable to waste a single drop of water in Australia. We thought that the effluent, after it had been treated as the Department suggested, should be carried away beyond the city, to be distributed. The officers are now doing the necessary work. The secret of the success of the Capital will be found in the fact that instead of the roads being made and then being destroyed again to lay down water supply pipes, everything is being done in its order, and all will be in readiness for the building of houses and the laying out of gardens when they are required. A great deal has been done at the Capital. An honorable member asked, What about the lake? I know nothing of engineering, but I understand, from my reading, that it is questionable whether a dam such as that proposed by Mr. Griffin could be made. The earths crust will bear only a certain weight of water. I understand from an engineer that the dam which Mr. Griffin suggests would be three times the size of the Burrinjuck dam, and bigger than any other in the world. He suggests the damming of the Murrumbidgee below the entrance of the Cottar, thus filling up a huge ravine, and giving a volume of water with a surface from 30 to 50 miles in length, and with an enormous depth. The pressure on the dam would be enormous, and the embankment required to support it would be colossal. I should not have risen but for the attack that has been made on capable departmental officers, whose ability should not be questioned by any honorable member of the House. They are men who have the courage of their opinions. They lay their schemes before the Minister and the people, and invariably these are adopted. A more careful inquiry than that of the Public Works Committee could not have been made. Practical men did their best in the interests of Australia, and with regard to their own reputation. They had the opinions of one or two of the most able engineers in Australia. The Chief Engineer of the State of New South Wales gave his views freely, and without charge.If honorable members read the report of the Committee, they will ascertain what is being done. The country that we travelled over was granite country, and we found that millions of gallons of water are flowing down the Cotter, and that there can be no pollution of the stream.","N/A","FEDERAL CAPITAL TERRITORY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[6]/continue[11]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

During the last hour or so I think we have had sufficient evidence to show that, at all events, the attitude of the Department is not all that could be desired. There is a difference of opinion amongst the officers under the Minister, who is prepared to take the responsibility for everything - even for sitting down on the work that we wish to see progress.

In my short experience in this House it has become evident to me that it is not only in connexion with the Federal Territory that there are differences of. opinion amongst the officers. I challenge any honorable member to tell me that their experience has not been the same as my own in regard to, say, the construction of post-offices. If we inquire about any postal construction works, we find ourselves referred to the Department of Home Affairs, then dodged to the Postal Department, and then to the Public Works Department of the State; and all through we find differences of opinion, with the ultimate result that the Department of Home Affairs is prepared to take all the responsibility. This leads me to the conclusion that the sooner the Federal Territory is placed under a Commission the sooner we shall have continuity of policy and continuity of administration. Under a Commission there would never be those differences of opinion that the Minister permits amongst his officers. The railways in Australia were put under a Commission when it was found that Ministerial supervision was not satisfactory; and I am sure all will admit that to-day we are getting better service on the railways than we could ever have enjoyed under political management. At any rate, I venture to say that under a Commission it would not be possible to have such evidence as the following from Mr. Griffin-At the present time I occupy an anomalous position. The Minister has requested me not to proceed, pending the submission to him of certain details of the plan for his consideration. He has restricted my operations to the preparation of a plan of the streets for submission to him for investigation of details, I presume. That means the suspension of my authority as Director of Designs and Construction. I recommended that alternative schemes should be considered before the scheme proposed by the Department was finally adopted, because the responsibility for the character of the works executed rested upon me. I gained a knowledge of the character of the departmental proposal from seeing the plan of Colonel Owen.The whole circumstances disclose an internal squabble, and show that, up to the present time, the Minister has not exercised proper control. I hope the Minister will not take my words as of personal application when I say that a successful man in his position is one who runs the Department, and does not allow the Department to run him.

I, therefore, asked Mr. Griffin to supply me with ono showing the levels of the dams, bridges, and main roads. I did not demand a complete plan showing every work to be carried out in the Capital ; but it was not until the 20th March last that I was supplied with the plan for which I had asked during my first week of office.

Had I called in the officers of the Department, they would have given me the levels and they would have been right, but it would have been said  They are the departmental levels. I therefore said to the distinguished gentleman whom the late Leader of the Opposition brought out here,  Give me the levels.

The House must accept my assurance that the matter is one of urgency, that the Bill does not alter the substantive law, that it does not create an offence in respect to an act done which would not have been, and which was not, an offence when the act was done, but merely creates a Commonwealth Court before which the offence can be tried. The Bill simply gives effect to the alteration in the law made last week. It takes away from no man a right that he now enjoys so far as creating a new offence is concerned. It does give to the Commonwealth the right to take the matter before another tribunal, namely, the High Court, instead of, but not to the exclusion of, a State Court. I give the House that assurance, and make the positive, statement that the retrospective action of the measure does not create an offence where no offence punishable by State law existed. The punishment for an offence will not be affected by the change in the tribunal. The same kind of tribunal - that is trial by jury - and the panel from which the jury is drawn will be exactly the same if we take any proceedings under the measure - will be the same as for the State Court. Whether proceedings will be taken is not certain, but it is most important that the measure should pass without delay.","N/A","CRIMES BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

However, I understand that during war time things keep cropping up which require special powers to meet them, and that this is only another instance of the ineffectiveness of the present Federal laws to accomplish all tilings to make a State secure during war time, and see that the ordinary war precautions are carried out in their entirety. I understand that the Attorney-General now wishes to take power in order to deal more quickly with some pending cases than he would be able to exercise if he took them to a State Court. The honorable member knows best what he requires, and he must take the responsibility. We are not able to follow him through all the motives and reasons for this, among other things. In fact, he is not able to disclose the reasons for seeking this power. This is one of those cases in which we must trust the Government to use the power wisely and properly, with regard to matters arising out of the war. The Government require this power - otherwise they would not seek it in this peremptory and quick way - and I can offer no objection to the Bill.

I wish to urge again the point I put last night that a proposal that vests in the Minister power to place trade advantages in the hands of an individual to the disadvantage and exclusion of others, should be submitted to this House before action is taken. No reason has been urged for granting this power solely to the Minister. It comes in the same category as the granting of bounties, as it purports to be required for protective purposes, and should come under the control of Parliament like the granting of those and other trade favours. The Ministers statement that a Board of Trade at Home controls all these matters is against his own case. Unfortunately for the Commonwealth, we have no Board of Trade here, divested of political influence. In England it acts as a great body controlling wisely and well the many industrial concerns of the State, and taking under its special control the conferment of these special advantages. Those powers are exercised there without any trace of favoritism. As we have no Board of Trade here, the powers ought to be exercised by the House, and there ought to be a distinct reference to the House before an exclusive trading privilege is given to any individual. It is not a question of the quality or validity of the patent. It is simply a question of who is to become the privileged recipient of all the advantages of a patent conceived and executed by somebody over the seas. No power of that kind ought to he exercised by the Minister on his own initiative and without reference to Parliament.","Third Reading","PATENTS, TRADE MARKS.

It is dealing with an absolutely unprecedented state of affairs, and of necessity imposes on the Minister of the day more or less liberty of conscience, and very considerable individual power, in acting on the merits of questions as they are submitted to him. The question raised by the Leader of the Opposition in regard to the submission of these matters to Parliament strikes me as being in theory a most desirable practice, when one considers the enormous responsibility of such a granting of patent rights; yet the proposal is hedged about with a certain amount of difficulty, because, after all, the House would find it very difficult to become seized of all the merits of a question concerning any particular patent. A patent might be of such a nature that very extensive machinery would be required for the proper exercise of it; and the question as to the best person or persons in a position to carry out such an enterprise is one which must necessarily be gone into very carefully by the departmental officers. But, whilst the power rests with the Minister, undoubtedly tha whole responsibility rests with him. If the House is not to share the responsibility, and the Minister is to exercise the exceptional power conferred by the Bill, on him will rest the responsibility of seeing that to no particular person or persons is given, to the detriment of other persons, a monopoly for his or their own individual enrichment. I have no criticism to offer with regard to the framework of the measure, but it does place a very considerable load on the Ministers shoulders. I sincerely trust that the Attorney-General will rise to the occasion, and that we shall see him bearing this great load of responsibility in a worthy manner.","Third Reading","PATENTS, TRADE MARKS.

But there are still two questionable provisions to which honorable members on this side of the House have directed attention tonight. The first question came from thu honorable member for Wimmera, who raised an interesting point which, if not carefully provided for in the Bill, may lead to complications after the declaration of peace. The whole of this legislation is to enable us to deal, in the interests of the community, during the currency of the war, with patent rights held by enemy subjects; but beyond that there may stretch arrangements for individual residents of Australia to utilize enemy patents. It is possible, however, that at the end of the war, part of the terms of peace may be the reciprocal restoration of all civil and patent rights. If that be so, in what position will the Commonwealth be in regard to an enemy patent of some importance, a licence for which had been granted for a period of ten years? Would the Minister then be competent, without subsequent legislation, to cancel the licence he had given to an Australian citizen to use the patent, or if he were not able to cancel it, would he be able to restore the rights to the original patentee? That is the whole question raised by the honorable member for Wimmera, and the Attorney-General would oblige members on this side of the House if he would dear up any doubt there may be in our minds as to the probable effect of this legislation in that respect.","Third Reading","PATENTS, TRADE MARKS.

In the Mother Country there is a body to which is entrusted important issues of this kind, which, I understand, are dealt with by the Comptroller-General exercising his powers as head of the Board of Trade. We have not a precisely similar body in Australia, but we have in the Inter-State Commission a Board with somewhat analogous powers. That body is not popular at present with a certain school of fiscal thinkers. I believe it is called by some a Free Trade party, but whether that is so or not we will have an opportunity to decide when the Tariff is under consideration. Whether or not the InterState Commission was fitted for the work it was asked to perform by a former Government does not concern us at this moment, but the Act by which the Commission was created contemplated that body performing a similar work to that which we are now discussing. In Part III. of the Inter-State Commission Act, dealing with investigations, the wide powers given to the Commission to examine embrace, amongst other things, the encouragement, improvement, and extension of Australian industries and manufactures. There are a number of identified and related matters which this Commission may inquire into, and we may well ask them, in either their investigating or judicial character - whichever is the least injured by the recent decision of the High Court - to consider and recommend to the Minister, either the individual licensees who shall get these exclusive rights, or the terms and conditions upon which such rights should be granted.","Third Reading","PATENTS, TRADE MARKS.

It is clear in some cases that the Minister will grant licences for one or two years, but if the utilization of any patents involves a large capital expenditure, it may be necessary, in order to encourage the manufacture of patented goods in Australia, to give double or ten times the period. Every application must be dealt with in view of all its admitted circumstances. Parliament cannot possibly deal with matters of this character. Under the provisions of the law, as we are now asked to pass it, power to deal with these patents will rest with the Minister, and the question before us is whether we should leave the grave responsibility of deciding as to what individuals should enjoy these licences, and the terms and conditions under which they are to be operative, with the Minister. I think the Attorney-General will, on more mature reflection, probably agree with some of us, that to unload that duty upon the InterState Commission would be a wise Ordinance. The Commission would discharge the duty after the complete investigation provided for in  their Act without fear or favour - as the Minister himself would also do- but the Commission would naturally debate the principles of every action in a manner that the Ministers own busy life would render it almost impossible for him to do.","Third Reading","PATENTS, TRADE MARKS.

My point is that the Minister should consider the advisability and the wisdom of entrusting certain of the discriminating powers with which he i3 now to be dowered, to the Inter-State Commission, in the hope that then the public will see that there is no politics in any of these discriminations, and that they will be exercised by a body outside of party, that each case will be examined carefully with the elaborate machinery available to the Commission, on its merits, and decisions and conclusions arrived at that will be equitable to all parties concerned. These are the observations that I recommend, with respect, to the Minister in charge of the Bill in the hope that either here or elsewhere some of them may recommend themselves to his judgment.","Third Reading","PATENTS, TRADE MARKS.

406,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"GLYNN, Patrick","KCO","Angas","N/A","N/A",2953,".- Yesterday evening I drew attention to the point as to what position a patentee would be in as soon as the war is over in regard to his rights under a suspended patent. These rights are not abrogated, but they may be suspended under this Act, and that is the point to which the honorable member for Wimmera has now called attention. The Attorney-General promised to look into that matter, so that I understand there may be an opportunity of something being done when this Bill is before the Senate. The honorable member for Parramatta raised a question as to whether it really was expedient to vest the whole of this administration in the Attorney-General, which, of course, will mean, under him, in the Comptroller of Customs. It struck me last night that perhaps, if there is a difficulty, it could be got over by making the provision regarding licences in the Act of 1909 - the principal Act - apply to this Act. For instance, if the manufacturer of a patented article lis not resident in the Commonwealth, an application may be made to the Commissioner by petition asking that the patent may be revoked. If the Commissioner thinks there is no justification, no prima-facie case made out, he can dismiss the petition; but if he thinks there is a prima-facie case, he can send it on to the High Court, and then the question of whether a licence shall be issued or not will be tested by a tribunal which is absolutely unfettered by any consideration except that of doing justice to the Department. That is the provision we have in our Act at the present time. We threshed this matter out last night, and I merely offer this suggestion to the Attorney-General now for his consideration. There may be an opportunity of dealing with it in the Senate.","Third Reading","PATENTS, TRADE MARKS.

The power proposed to be vested iri the Minister to grant patent rights to applicants in the way suggested is one that is altogether too great. I do not wish to cast any reflection upon the Minister. I am speaking from a purely non-party point of view. The- same argument would apply, whoever occupied his position. I would not envy the Attorney-General if he took upon himself this power, as it may be responsible for a great deal of unpleasantness; but I think the Minister should explain to the House, in the event of his taking this power, how he would propose to deal with applicants. What will be his modus operandi? How will he give priority ? I think, nevertheless, in his own interests, and in the interests of the country, he will be wise to accept the advice of the Leader of the Opposition and delegate these powers to the Inter-State Commission. We do not know how many patents there are belonging to enemy subjects in Australia. I understand there are hundreds of them, and it would be quite impossible, as the member for East Sydney has suggested, that these questions should be threshed out in. the House. It would take us too long. The Minister himself could not go into the hundreds of questions and give them the consideration to which they are entitled. He would, therefore, be compelled to delegate his authority to some official in the Department. I suggest, therefore, in justice to himself, and in the best interests of the country, that the questions should be referred to the Inter-State Commission, which seems to be the proper body for dealing with matters of this kind.","Third Reading","PATENTS, TRADE MARKS.

410,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"WEST, John Edward","KZA","East Sydney","N/A","N/A",2954,".- I would not have made any observations on the third reading of this Bill but for the fact that our friends opposite seem to have some suspicion about the capacity of the Attorney-General and his Department to administer this Act. I am one of those who are not too anxious for the business of the country to be taken out of Ministerial control and put under any Commission. The public interest is best safeguarded by giving the control of public affairs to a Minister whom Parliament can call to account at once, if it thinks that his actions are prejudicial to the public good. It is to be remembered that the Bill is to have force only during the currency of the war,, which we must all pray may be a very short period. My experience in connexion with patents makes me think that there are many now in force which, in any case, would lapse within six months, and others which may not have two years; to run. The honorable member for Wimmera talked of the granting of a monopoly. If a monopoly is to be granted by the handing over of patent rights to a licensee, surely Parliament, and no one else, should possess the power to control it; and the power of the Parliament cannot be exercised more quickly than through a Minister. The honorable member for Balaclava wishes to provide other machinery. If this power were given to the Inter-State Commission, Parliament, could discuss its actions much less freely, and would interfere only with more difficulty than will be the case if the administration of the Act is left to a member of the Government. I am not desirous of rushing things to the Inter-State Commission. We have been trying to get from the Commission a report on the Tariff, and it seems possible that some of us may be dead before that can be done. The House may be certain that the members on this side will take care that no monopoly shall exist a day longer than is needed to provide an opportunity for Parliament to deal with it.","Third Reading","PATENTS, TRADE MARKS.

Subject to those conditions of peace, justice will be done to the individual without respect to persons, whether he be German or English. No discussion should have arisen on this Bill as to the exercise of the power to licence, seeing that that power is given under the Act of last year, whose provisions were copied from the British Act. Under this Act the power is exercised by the Board of Trade, whose President is a Cabinet Minister. According to the Patents and Designs Temporary Rules 1914, dated 7th September, 1914, which I read last night -The Board may, at their discretion, grant in favour of persons other than subjects of any State at war with His Majesty licence to make, use, exercise, or vend any registered or patented design.As the honorable member for East Sydney has pointed out, the measure is to have force only during the war, which we hope will be a very short period; but, whether it be short or long, I contend that the relations of Parliament and a Minister are more intimate than those of Parliament and any outside authority. The procedure now is for the Commissioner of Patents to take the evidence of Applicants, and for me to come to a decision upon that evidence. I do not delegate the reading of the evidence to any one. I say, further, that any member is at liberty to read the evidence that has already been taken, and the orders that have been made in relation to it, at any time for which he cares to make an appointment.Question resolved in the affirmative.Bill read a third time.","Third Reading","PATENTS, TRADE MARKS.

412,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"HUGHES, William Morris","DQC","West Sydney","ALP","Attorney-General",2955,". - I move -That this Bill be now read a second time.This Bill relates to contracts, and particularly to contracts with an alien enemy, or for his benefit. It arises directly out of this dreadful war in which the Empire and its Allies are engaged, and it concerns us in a most vital way. Interests of a most important nature, and vast in their extent, are involved. And in the very nature of things, therefore, it is not only necessary but urgent. The Bill annuls contracts with enemy subjects or for their benefit. The necessity for such action arises directly out of the war. The effect of war upon contracts is to suspend some, and terminate others, according to their nature. Some of the contracts with which this measure deals are not contracts between the alien enemy and subjects of the Empire, but legally considered are contracts between British subjects. Nevertheless, they are contracts for the benefit of an alien enemy, although they are not affected legally by the war. Great uncertainty exists as to the result of the war on contracts, and it is to resolve that uncertainty that this measure has been introduced. It has been introduced for another and a still more important reason, namely, to afford the enterprise of Australia an opportunity to develop and expand itself at a time when, owing to this world-wide struggle, its efforts at development are in danger of being strangled.I may now shortly state the legal position in regard to the effect of war upon contracts. I have said that the effect of war is to suspend some contracts and to discharge others, according to the nature of the contract. So far as concerns that part of the performance which would have fallen due to take place during the continuance of the war, it is clear that there is a discharge, and not merely a postponement of performance. The case is not like those in which the only outstanding obligation is the periodical payment of a sum of money. Where a part of the obligation of the contract having failed of performance, each party being disappointed of what he stipulated for under the contract, the substantial question is whether that partial failure of the contract affects the whole. The law practically leaves the matter on the basis of the expectation and intention of reasonable men (Brett, L. J., in Honck v. Muller). But a breach of one stipulation, even a material stipulation in a contract, does not, of itself, terminate the whole (Collins, L J., in Cornwall v. Benson; and Mersey Steel and Iron Co. v. Naylor). Where the parties to the contract are respectively aiming at a continuous and regular market for their ores, and a continuous and regular supply for their works, a substantial failure in this respect appears to go to  the root of the contract, and to be within the test suggested by Anson (Contracts, p. 325) : I have lost all that I cared to obtain under this contract: further performance cannot make good past default. Pitt Cobbett, p. 71, recognises that the rule of suspension does not apply to executory contracts in which time is essential, that in such cases the whole contract is terminated. Admittedly, a party to a contract cannot say, I am compelled for the present, and for a term the length of which I cannot foresee, to suspend performance; but I may be able to resume performance before the contract runs out, so take the notice that I treat the contract as still subsisting, so far as concerns those acts of performance which may fall due after I am in a position to resume. But where, by a term of Wie contract, definite provision is made for suspension on outbreak of war, and for revival and performance after the war of those obligations which were suspended during the war, and would have been performed during the period of the war, the position of the parties is clouded by uncertainty. That, shortly, is the legal position, so far as it is necessary to set it forth in connexion with this measure. 1 have said that this Bill deals with a vital matter, touching us intimately, affecting, as it does, vast and important interests. I admit, that it is perhaps without precedent, at all events, without precedent in a British country, but it arises out of conditions that are absolutely without precedent. But if this Bill is without precedent in a British country, it is not without precedent in other countries. We are unable to learn what Germany is doing in relation to contracts, or to private property generally; but if we are to believe what we hear, it is certain that the rights of persons under contracts with Germans, rights in regard to private property, including patent rights, for instance, have been swept aside. It is certain that contracts have been annulled, and I do not. think there is anybody in this country so credulous as to believe that, in the event of Germany being conqueror, contracts for the benefit of Britons will stand. If there be one who holds that opinion, he stands alone, so far as I am concerned, for I was never, nor am now, of that opinion. This Bill deals with exceptional circumstances arising out of the war, and cannot be looked at and judged, except in the lurid glow that arises from this dreadful conflict, in which the hosts of Christendom are arrayed for the purposes of mutual destruction. This is a world-wide war, and it is being waged for the purposes of a world power. This is not merely for the purpose of military power, although the means of achieving world power are necessarily military in their nature. But the war is waged by Germany for the purpose of achieving commercial, financial, and industrial domination of the earth. That is the great purpose to which she has devoted her tremendous systematized energies for nearly half a century. And I must remind honorable members of how nearly Germany was achieving this without any war at all. I think that that nation has committed the most fatal blunder in its whole history in entering the lists of battle when she could have achieved her whole purpose without (risk, and with comparatively little expenditure and loss of time.","Second Reading","ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

414,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"HUGHES, William Morris","DQC","N/A","N/A","N/A",2956,"- I am going to prove what I have said. I desire now to show what the position of Germany was at the outbreak of the war, and what it will be when peace is concluded, so far as we are concerned, unless by action we change it. Australia is a country infinitely rich, both potentially and actually. Its mineral wealth is almost boundless. It has been estimated that the value of the annual output of base metal in this country is not less than £13,000,000. And over this the control of Germany before the war was almost complete. I cannot do better, in order to develop this part of my argument, than refer honorable members to some remarks I made last year in the form of an answer to a question by the honorable member for Barrier. Honorable members will find the report of my remarks in Hansard of 10th December, 1914, page 1508. I then said -Shortly stated, the facts show beyond all question that German capital and German influence exercise a monopoly of the base metal industry of the civilized world; that this monopoly is for all practical purposes so complete as to exclude effective competition; that it covers the whole sphere of the industry, limiting output, controlling markets, determining the channels of distribution, and fixing prices; that the war, by closing most of the channels through which the metallic products were distributed, and the markets in which they were disposed of, has very seriously affected the industry, throwing large numbers of working men out of employment, causing great loss of wealth production, retarding the development of our great resources, and seriously menacing the welfare of the whole community; that peace holds out no prospects satisfactory, or even tolerable, to British and Australian interests, since it would but revive that complete domination of the industry by German influence, which insures the building up of German instead of British and Australian interests.Ho patriotic citizen can contemplate such a prospect without the most serious misgivings. This war will have been waged- in vain; the blood of our best and bravest citizens shed without purpose; the Empire will have endured the dreadful horrors of modern warfare to no purpose, if, at its conclusion, when victory tardily, and at a dreadful cost, has been won, we are again compelled to pour into the lap of Germany the lions share of the wealth created by Australian enterprise and Australian workmen.Before the war, German capital and influence had created a splendidly organized system by which it was enabled to levy toll upon the world. The cream of the profits arising out of the metal industry of the world - profits upon a turnover which, at a rough estimate, cannot fall short of £200,000,000 - found its way through various channels to the pockets of the great German financiers, thus strengthening Germanys position commercially, industrially, and nationally, enlarging the scope of her operations in other directions, and maintaining and perfecting that terrific instrument of destruction by which she now seeks to batter all who dare withstand her, into submission, it is a humiliating but irrefutable fact that Australian capital, enterprise, and labour have materially aided the enemy in this dreadful conflict.","Second Reading","ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I am sorry the extract is so long, and I shall endeavour to make it as short as possible -A few figures will clearly establish this position. The value of the metals, lead, zinc, copper, tin, produced annually in Australia, estimated upon an average price for the year 1!112, amounts to nearly £13,000,000, or, including silver and gold recovered in the extraction of these commoner metals, £15,000,000. Even upon a fair average price for the past ten years, the gross value is not less than £13,000,000. All this wealth was produced in Australia, but - with the exception of gold and silver - the industry was and is controlled by German influence, so that output, destination, and price were matters in which Australia had no say whatever.I put this forward to substantiate my statement that the position of Germany in her efforts to secure world power had reached a point when it needed no mort than that she should press on in the direction she was going in order to achieve it. Without exaggeration, one may say that the control of the metal industry of Australia was dominated by Germany. I take the metal industry as typical, and, perhaps, as the one in which German influence is most marked ; but it is certainly not unique, because German influence is dominant throughout the many industries of Australia.","Second Reading","ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

422,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"HUGHES, William Morris","DQC","N/A","N/A","N/A",2957,"- I desire now to show honorable members exactly what our position is, so far as the metal industry is concerned. Most, if not all, of the mining companies of Australia have entered into contracts for the disposal of their products up to the year 1921, and many of those contracts contain clauses providing for suspension in the case of war and revival after the war, and operate in such a way that the period of the war is added to the original term. So that if the original term of a contract expired in 1921, and the war lasts three years, then the term of the contract is extended to 1924. That is the position in which many of the mining companies in Australia find themselves to-day. Whether these contracts, or any of them, are actually discharged by the war I am unable to say. That is a question which can only be answered when we consider the terms of each contract and the circumstances surrounding it. But, speaking generally, I am able to say that there is amongst all these companies uncertainty and doubt as to their position, and such uncertainty and doubt as to affect, not only their present operations, but to seriously hamper their future development.The position in which they are placed, indeed* threatens to paralyze every effort, not only to develop their business, but to divert trade from Germany to Britain and its Allies. They are unable, for example, to enter into any contracts with any one, but the agency through which German influence operates for the sale of their products. Naturally, manufacturers in Great Britain are unable to enter into contracts for the purchase of such products. Yet before a group of capitalists can be induced to invest £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 in the manufacture of spelter, or the zinc of commerce, they must be assured of an ample and regular supply of the metal they require. That is precisely what cannot be assured to them under existing conditions. The companies of Australia, and the capitalists of England, are unable now to come to the point where it is possible to divert to British or friendly channels the metal which flowed sometimes to Germany, to Belgium, to France, or to other countries, the lions share of the profits from which went to Germany. They are unable to do so, not only because of the contract relating to the supply of metal, but also because they have contracts which give the exclusive selling agency to one firm which for all practical purposes is German. We may now deal in detail with the extent to which the control over lead, zinc, copper, and tin by German influence goes. The position before the war was this: Practically the output price and sale of all lead was governed by the Lead Convention; zinc by Aaron Hirsch and Sohn, Beer Sondheimer and Co., and the Metallgesellschaft j copper by Aaron Hirsch and Sohn. Upon the outbreak of war the Lead Convention was reconstituted nominally without the German element, but, to all intents and purposes, the control of lead to-day is exercised by the same people as before the war. The same element is dominant, and it is through that channel, and that channel alone, that every pound of lead is purchased by the Admiralty and the War Office. There is no other means of obtaining lead except through the one channel.I should here state exactly how the control of the metal industry has been brought about. It originated through the opera-A/r. Hughes. tions of the firm of Merton, of Frankfort-on-Main. The ramifications of this firm or group are world-wide in their nature. It is represented in almost every civilized country, and its methods are typical of the German character. They are systematic and thorough. They resort in this regard to the same methods ;n the development of their business as they do for the development of their national power. That is to say, they take upon themselves the national cloak of the country in which they find themselves established to disguise the purpose which they have at heart. This German group have their head-quarters at Frankfort-on-Main, and exercise power in every country in the world. They have daughter companies - off-shoots - in America, Africa, and Australia. The Metallgesellschaft, which is one of the first forms in which the Merton combination expressed itself, dominates the market in America, Africa, and Australia, through daughter companies. The Australian Metal Company, for example, under which name the German group operates here, is a company registered in Australia. This brings me to what I mentioned at the outset, that in form we have not to deal only with contracts between an alien enemy and a British subject, but with contracts between persons who are nominally British subjects - between a company registered in Australia and another company also registered in Australia. The Australian Metal Company, to all intents and purposes, is the Metallgesellschaft, and the Metallgesellschaft is a German combination working in conjunction with the Merton group. The Merton group in Frankfort-on-Main working conjointly with the Merton group in London, dominates the metal industry. It is impossible in England to buy lead except through Mertons in London. The companies of Australia have a contract with Merton, through whom their selling is done. They cannot sell to anybody but Mertons, and Merton, although registered in England, and a naturalized citizen of that country, is, for all practical purposes as much German as is the Merton of Frankfort-on-Main. The Metallgesellschaft,, Mertons, and other firm names by which the combination expresses itself are only various forms through which this group of German capitalists exercises its great power.","Second Reading","ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

424,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"HUGHES, William Morris","DQC","N/A","N/A","N/A",2959,"- I do not know whether it would or not. If we are to say here only what we could prove in a Court, I ask the honorable member for Wentworth what his position would be, and where would any of us be if we had to do that? The facts I am giving now are derived partly from official and partly from other sources. If honorable members ask me, in connexion with a particular statement, whether I have the information from an official source, I shall be prepared to tell them. When I say, for example, that Mertons is the sole selling agency for lead, that is official. My statement that the Australian Metal Company is, for all practical purposes the Metallgesellschaft is based on official information. The Australian Metal Company has contracts with the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, by which the latter contracts to supply it with its metallic ores until 1921. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company has also contracted with Mertons, of London, to sell through them, and through them alone. All these are official facts. Now this contract is typical, and is, in form, not an enemy contract at all, but one between British subjects. Yet this British nationality is in many cases only a cloak. It is iu this case, as the list of shareholders of the Australian Metal Company shows. The directors of that company aro Messrs. G. E. Schuster, G. Schwarz, C. L. Budd, A. Beker, C. R. Euler, and R. Merton. The authorized capital of the company is £50,000, in 5.000 shares of £10 each, and the shareholders are as follow : - J. A. Amschel, 7 Gracechurch-street, London, 20 shares; S. Baer, 1 share; C. L. Budd, 10 shares; Deutsche Gold and Silber Schoide Anstalt, Frankfort-on-Main, Germany, 200 shares; C. R. Euler (Bockenheimer Anlage), Frankforto.uMain, 10 shares; A. Merton, of the same address, 10 shares; Merton Metallurgical Company . Limited, 1,440 shares; Metallgesellschaft. Frankfort-on-Main, 1,490 shares; and Metallbank and Metallurgische Gesell, A. G., Frankfort-on-Main, 980 shares. There are also a number of minor shareholders. The greater number of shares are held by Germans. The company is controlled byGermans, and for all practical purposes the company is German. The LloydZieitung, a German newspaper, in its issue of 8th July, 1913, published an article by Professor Robert Liefmann, of Freiburg, under the heading of  The International Organization of the Frankfort Metal Trade, of which the following translation of an extract may be quoted -Last] j, there belong to the Merton concern two more companies which bear testimony to the international character of the concern by their very name, viz., the African Metal Company and the Australian Metal Company, of London and Melbourne. These two companies are sub-companies of the Metallgesellschaft and of Henry R. Merton and Company, and transact for the latter firms the purchase and sale of metals in Africa and Australia. They are, therefore, agencies which were given the titles of independent companies chiefly for legal reasons.The Merton group lias companies all over the world. I shall not burden honorable members by reading a full list of them.  They are in every civilized country, and everywhere serve the purposes of Germany under the cloak of the nationality in which they find themselves. The latest development is the War Metal Company, which is a combination of various German companies, formed with the object of providing metals for carrying on the war. In that combination the Merton group, the Metallgesellschaft Aaron Hirsch and Beer Sondheimer an veiy prominent. Let me now repeat the position in regard to lead, zinc, and copper. The lead trade is largely dominated by the Lead Convention, which, before the war, was composed of Mertons, the Metallgesellschaft, and the Broken Hill Proprietary. After the outbreak of war it was reconstituted, and it now consists of the Broken Hill Proprietary,. Mertons, and another firm.The position in regard to zinc is very similar. Zinc, as honorable members know, plays a most important part in the metallic wealth of Australia. It is treated here, and sent away in the form of concentrates, which are manufactured into the spelter or zinc of commerce. The persons or firms who control the zinc trade - that0 is to say, who decide how much zinc Australia shall produce - as well as what the price shall be, are Aaron Hirsch, Beer Sondheimer, and the Metallgesellschaft. The position is practically the same in regard to copper, so far as the firm of Aaron Hirsch is concerned. This, then, is the position of Australia, and the extent of the German control. I want honorable members to grip hold of th© fact that nothing but the sharp edge of legislation of this sort can cut the tangled web of contracts that binds the Australian companies and Australian commerce to German influence. There is a positive network of contracts, and the Australian companies are helpless unless we come to their rescue. Let me give one illustration. In this city we have the offices of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, which is tied up with a contract with the Australian Metal Company. The Australian Metal Company said to it,  We give you notice that we propose after the war to hold you to your contract, and that contract continues until 1921, plus, of course, the period over which the war extends. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company has given notice of its intention to annul the contract; but whether that notice is good or not in law neither I nor any one else can say. Take yet another case. Negotiations have been going on for some months with a view to encouraging the manufacture of copper rod, wire, barrel, and sheet copper in Australia. Magnificent opportunities exist in this country for the development of the copper industry. Do honorable members realize that in this matter we have to deal with a company one-third of whose shares are held by Aaron Hirsch? Do they realize that there is practically no one else in Australia to whom we can say,  Will you establish this industry?  And this company is not the only one in which German influence lies covered by an Australian registration. There are contracts which fetter the limbs of Australia at the present juncture, in a hundred, aye, in a thousand, different ways, and in this regard we are acting, not against the interests of any companies, but for their benefit. Many of them not only approve but welcome this measure. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company - I think it is only fair to say this - has given three months notice to Mertons, London, under the new agreement, to terminate the selling contract. That is very good, as far as it goes; but we must lee that no contract is made during She . war by an Australian company with an agency of- Germany, under what- ever name it may disguise itself. To sever the contract with Mertons, if it is to be renewed with some other agent under whose personality German Protean influence hides itself, will not benefit us. The Government will use every power in its possession to prevent German influence dominating Australian trade. To show how keenly the Australian companies are alive to the importance of this legislation, and in what light they regard it, I may give the House the view taken by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company of the matter. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company has given an undertaking -To give three months notice to terminate the existing agreement with Mertons;To sever all connexion with any firm or agency representing or influenced by German, or Austrians, or German or Austrian capital ;To undertake not to enter into any contractual or business relations with such firm or agency relating to the sale, distribution, or price of the products of the company, either during the war, or after the termination thereof; andTo give preference in the sale or disposal of any products of the company to any bondfide British buyer.That is the sort of evidence which, I submit, should weigh with honorable members, and which we advance as the justification and necessity for the Bill. Yet, although this company is desirous of giving effect to its undertaking, it cannot do so, unless we help them, for it is bound hand and foot. The company may give the notice, but that notice does not terminate the agreement. And this applies generally. In South Australia we find that a firm like Elder, Smith, and Company was tied round with contracts. It has broken the contracts, but it has not broken them legally, and it may be still liable, or will be liable after the war in the Courts to such litigation as the* immensely powerful interests that are at the back of these German concerns can bring against it. Do honorable members realize that we are speaking now of influences that have behind them literally hundreds of millions of pounds, that their power manifests itself not merely through Germans and naturalized Germans, but through persons of our own race ? Where there is such tremendous power it manifests itself in every direction. I said a little while ago that we were resolute in our determination not to permit any Australian industries to be fettered by any influence that was German in essence. We are not to be imposed upon by any subterfuge. There are firms in London now working in close conjunction with Mertons who are British in origin as well as in name, yet they are in all essence Germans. They are the conduit pipes through which the profits go to Germany ; they are the wires by which the German influence is transmitted and through whom it effects its purpose. We have ample proof in the Department to show that these three firms - some of whom are British in origin as well as in name - are to all intents and purposes German in essence.I come now to refer to another point of this matter. I have already said that the position in respect to lead is that the companies are tied up with long-dated contracts, and that remark applies also to zinc and copper. There is on foot a proposal, to which we take no sort of exception, to amalgamate -certain mining companies here for the purpose of more effectively treating and smelting Australian metals. We welcome that from our present point of view, and for our present purpose, but we declare that, so far as German influence is concerned, we shall look to the amalgamation to give the same sort of undertaking that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company has given in regard to its relation with German influence and capital.Coming, now, to the Bill itself, the objects of it are two : to provide for the continuance of the Australian output during the war and to prevent the renewal of German control after the war. The difficulty in doing this arises out of the very nature of the case. First of all, the trouble is to know under what law the contracts are to be enforced - whether by Federal law or  by the law of one or more of the States, or by Imperial Courts. There are some of these contracts made in England which can be dealt with by Australian law; there are some contracts made in Australia which can be only dealt with by English law; there are some contracts made in one State which could probably be dealt with by the Federal Courts. The law in relation to interpretation and enforcement of contracts need hardly be stated, but, generally speaking, it may be said that in the interpretation of a contract the law of the country in which the contract is made, or in which it is proposed to bt> carried out, prevails.The Bill provides for the annulment of enemy contracts. The main provisions are in clauses 3 and 4. Under clause 3 they become null and void ipso facto. The Bill also provides in clause 4 for another class of contracts, namely, those contracts suspended by the war. These contracts are terminable only at the option of either party. A party may find himself unable to discharge his contract, or to fulfil his obligation. For example, he may be under a contract to ship goods to England, but he cannot get freight. He may b> under an obligation to do things which the war has prevented him from doing. Clause 4 gives him the opportunity to terminate the contract.Dealing more particularly with contracts with the enemy covered by clause 3, and the difficulties of determining precisely under what law a contract is to be dealt with, the Government have been in frequent communication with the British Government. The matter has been the. subject of very lengthy cable communications, of which I have a number with me, but to which, owing to the nature of them, I am unable to give publicity. Generally, I may say that the British Government have been keenly alive to the importance of the position, and are very anxious to know exactly what we propose to do as to action by the British Parliament. They have stated that they are giving the matter most careful consideration. A cable containing the text of this Bill has been sent to London, for the information of the British Government.","Second Reading","ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

That is all I can say. I am perfectly satisfied that in our case legislation is not only justified, but also necessary. Control by Germany of industries in Great Britain may not be proportionately as great as it is in Australia. I say most emphatically that, upon a fair review of the position, a measure such as this is absolutely essential if we are to do our part as citizens towards developing the resources of Australia, and freeing our commercial, financial, and industrial population from the effect of contracts tying up their enterprise and preventing the proper development of the Commonwealth. I say, further, that at the present time the persons under contractual obligations arc unable to say where they are; they are unable to make any move to look for fresh markets, because they do not know to what extent their present contracts bind them. I emphasize the fact that, as the State Governments, through the various Premiers, have pledged themselves to introduce this legislation, all actions for breach of contracts made iu Australia, or made el°f»where to he executed in Australia, will be covered by a full and satisfactory defence.The necessity for this legislation is very plain. Persons under contracts affected by the war do not know where they are.The Zinc Corporation made, for example, an effort to obtain a pronouncement in the English Courts, but failed because the enemy defendant was not represented. A Bill had subsequently to be passed by the Imperial Parliament to enable such cases to be dealt with. Most of the contracts to which this Bill will apply are governed by Australian law; whether Commonwealth or State law it is difficult to say. With regard to Broken Hill products, for example, the mine may be situated in one State, the contracting parties may be in another State, and the contract may be formed in a third State. Personally, I believe that the Commonwealth has jurisdiction to deal with this matter under the heading of Defence, but if not the States will have jurisdiction under the heading of Contract. The Bill is not confined . to metal contracts. What applies to metals applies all round. The Bill has two main clauses dealing with enemy contracts and contracts that are suspended during the war. In regard to the former, the Bill term i.n ates these contracts altogether, and the difficulty of identifying them is set : it rest by the certificate of the Attorney-General. That is to say, though it is not necessary to do so, a copy may be filed with the Attorney-General, and his certificate is proof that the provision applies to it. One exception is made. There are German life assurance companies operating in Australia, and therefore contracts of life assurance are excepted. The contracts dealt with in clause 4 are made terminable at the option of either party - that is to say, suspension for the indefinite period of the war creates such a deadlock that power to terminate them is necessary. Notice of termination made before the passing of the Bill is to be as good as if it is made afterwards. I urge on honorable members the importance of the Bill and the necessity for its early passage into law. Every effort ought to be made to develop new industries and strengthen old ones. Since the trade with Germany and Austria, exports and imports, prior to the war, covered nearly £15,000,000 annually, it is clear that the closing of these channels has created conditions which nothing but the most determined activity on our part can remove. We must, therefore, do whatever is possible to free persons from obligations under contracts made before the war for Che benefit of alien enemies, and to find them new markets. Although the Bill applies to all contracts, it is specially applicable to metallic products which are tied up by long-dated contracts which threaten to hamper vitally all effort to deal with this great question. I have omitted to touch upon the position of the tin industry. Lead, zinc, and copper are controlled by contracts which run as far as 1921. Tin is controlled by similar influences, though not to the same extent. Tin is an industry capable of great development here. At a meeting of the Y-water Tin Mining Company, New South Wales, held yesterday, it was stated that their tin was being sent to be smelted at Mount Bischoff, and the arrangement was found very satisfactory. The practice hitherto has been to send most of the tin to Singapore, where it is smelted by coolie labour. Singapore is largely dominated by Mertons. Why should not all tin be smelted in Australia? This instance affords another reason why we should do all in our power- to enable mining companies to have their products treated in- Australia. The Bill will enable men to free themselves from obligations undertaken prior to the war which they cannot possibly fulfil during the war, and which, in 99 cases out of 100, they do not intend to go on with after the1 war, unless compelled to do so. The measure is one suggested by common prudence, and ought .to bo supported by every patriotic citizen. It is one which the circumstances call for,, and that all parties, so far as I have been able to ascertain, approve. I commend it to the House. 1 admit that it deals with difficulties by cutting through them ; but there is no -other way to deal with the matter than by the sharp edge, of such a law as this.Debate (on motion by Mr. Joseph Cook) adjourned.","Second Reading","ENEMY CONTRACTS ANNULMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech/continue[10]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
