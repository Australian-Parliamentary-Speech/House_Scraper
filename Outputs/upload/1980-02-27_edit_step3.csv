I invite him to have something to say about the wool industry dispute seeing that he has a lot to say about other things. The fact is that this wool industry dispute is reaching very serious proportions. Last night the Government met representatives of the growers throughout Australia and discussed the issue. This afternoon the Minister for Industrial Relations and I are meeting wool brokers, growers, private traders and others interested in the wool industry. Opposition members might not be interested but a great many people in the electorate are interested. It is about time honourable members opposite started to wake up to the seriousness of the situation. The fact is that the wages of members of the Federated Storemen and Packers Union are protected by an arbitration and conciliation system. The fact is also that consequent upon appeal a Full Bench made a judgment on the level of wages that ought to be paid to these people. They are not prepared to accept the umpires decision, and that is the final umpire. There is no further umpire after a Full Bench. The only view one can take about the action of the members of the Storemen and Packers Union is that they are blatantly holding the country and the wool industry to ransom. There is no question about their intention. They are causing enormous hardship now for growers, who cannot be paid until the wool is removed from the stores and shipped. Some $150m worth of wool has been sold through auction, but the growers cannot be paid until it is moved. Another $ 1 50m worth of wool is held up and cannot be put into the auction system because the action of the storemen and packers has ground the auction system completely to a halt. Their action is causing enormous disruption to the ships that service this country. It ought to be noted that this matter is reaching serious proportions. The secretary of the Storemen and Packers Union, whose father was a respected member of this House, I must say seems to lack the qualities of his father. Nevertheless, I appeal to him to take another view of the action into which he has led the storemen and packers. The matter is serious, and this afternoon when the Minister for Industrial Relations and I meet the growers and other representatives of the wool industry, we propose to try to work out an appropriate strategy, an appropiate course to follow, for all those interested in the wool industry and in the future of this country.

It is equally correct that because the rate of inflation in this country is significantly below the rate of inflation in a number of other countries, the effects of international economic development on the interest rates structure in this country have been less than they have been in other parts of the world. That is precisely what the Government has been saying all along. That explains the differential between interest rates, to which I referred in Question Time yesterday, and it explains why the interest rates structure in Australia has demonstrated remarkable restraint to worldwide economic development.

It is one which I recall and which no doubt a large number of honourable members also recall. I can do a little better. On 2 1 November 1977 and, I think, on a number of other occasions both the Prime Minister and I have indicated that there are aspects of the existing taxation system which affect single income families in a way in which double income families are not affected. Let us be realistic. This matter has been the subject of considerable discussion and debate in the Press, and there is no reason why it should not be. No taxation system is ever perfect. No taxation system is ever without anomalies. I would be the last to suggest that our taxation system did not contain a great deal of anomalies and has not done so for a long time. I believe that there are aspects of the system which bear differently and disadvantageously on single income families. The extent to which those concerns can be accommodated and those distortions ironed out is always taken into account when governments are considering taxation changes. The honourable gentleman would be naive in the extreme if he thought that I would take the matter any further at this stage.

When the deputation came to see me I informed it of the timetable that was proposed for the Bill as it stood, but the deputation pressed its point. I suggested to it that appropriately it should go back to the State Ministers for Agriculture as it was their responsibility for the ultimate carrying out of the program.

I am more than happy to respond to a question about this Governments taxation record to remind the House of the fact that when we took over there were seven steps in the progressive rates scale. Now we have three simple steps of 32c, 46c and 60c. I also remind the House that there remains undenied the promise of the Leader of the Opposition about a year ago to increase the upper marginal rate of taxation in this country to 70 or 80 cents in the dollar. He talks about a taxation system that has incentive. The honourable member for Werriwa referred in his question to the words of the Prime Minister about the taxation system having incentive. What incentive would there be in a taxation system that contained an upper marginal rate of 70 or 80 cents in the dollar? The Leader of the Opposition made that statement more than a year ago. He has had plenty of opportunity to deny it, but the fact remains that it is part and parcel of the Labor Partys platform.  As I said in answer to an earlier question, no taxation system in the world is without anomalies and our taxation system is no exception. The fact remains that the personal income tax system contains more incentive now than it did in the past. In Australia a person has to earn about $21,000 a year before he pays more than the rate of 32c in the dollar. Compare that situation with the situation which existed under the rate scales of the Leader of the Opposition in December 1975. The rate was 45c in the dollar for a salary of about $17,000. That is the sort of comparison that ought to be taken into account. I should remind all honourable members in this House that we all ought to preserve a sense of proportion about the level of taxation in this country. Australia happens to be one of the least taxed countries in the industrialised world. The average rate of taxation in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries is about 36 per cent of gross domestic product. The percentage of gross domestic product taken by taxation in Australia is less than 30 per cent.","GOVERNMENT ELECTION PROMISES","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[11]/answer/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

As a result of the taxation reforms in the corporate area, private companies now have a retention allowance of 70 per cent. I was talking earlier about international comparisons. Australia pays 29.7 per cent of her gross domestic product by way of taxation. The OECD average is about 36 per cent. We ought to preserve a sense of proportion. We ought to recognise that the rates of taxation in this country are relatively low by industrial standards. Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition and some of his colleagues, who are always eulogising countries like Sweden, would like the taxation levels of those socialist countries. Perhaps they would like a taxation level of 53.4 per cent of gross domestic product, which is the situation which prevails in Sweden.

Is it also a fact that since this Government came into office four years ago wages, salaries and supplements have increased by about 50 per cent, indirect taxes have increased by over 80 per cent and income tax has increased by over 90 per cent? By any objective measure, and on the basis of those facts, is it not established beyond any doubt that Australian families today are immeasurably worse off after tax in the real spending power which is available to them as a consequence of the savage taxation policies of this Government?

"0","1","0","0","0","0","0","1","HOWARD, John","ZD4","N/A","LP","N/A","406","It is a fact that if one compares I think the Leader of the Opposition used the correct description total Commonwealth receipts on the basis of the projections contained in the 197980 Budget, one will get the figure of about what the Leader of the Opposition mentioned. I was asked a question on notice on this subject by the honourable member for Gellibrand. I do not seek to quibble with that. Those figures are a matter of record. I think that the Leader of the Opposition also would know two things: He would know that prior to the election of the present Government there was a system of rebates so far as payments to families were concerned and he would know very well that the family allowance system was in effect financed out of the abolition of the child endowment system and the rebate system. If one is to make any proper comparison one has to make allowance for the fact that by that change there was, as it were, an artificial inflation of taxation receipts because all of that was transferred from the revenue side of the Budget to the expenditure side of the Budget. If one is to make any proper comparison of absolute tax levels between one period and another one has to make allowance for that.  The Leader of the Opposition quoted a figure for nominal increases in tax collections during the lifetime of this Government. I will have that figure checked. Quite frankly, off the top of my head I cannot confirm or deny whether it is correct. I think that even the Leader of the Opposition would have to admit that there was no year in the history of the Commonwealth of Australia in which the level of taxation increased at such an astronomical level as occurred during 1975. Any examination of the figures will show that the rate of increase of taxation during that period was the highest ever. The Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer for half that period. He will know that 197879 was the first year in over a decade that the real level of personal tax collections in Australia actually declined. The Leader of the Opposition will also know that the equity and fairness of a taxation system relates not only to the overall size of the tax take but also to the burden and distribution of that take.","BUDGET SECTOR REVENUE","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[13]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","1","0","0","0","0","0","1","FRASER, Malcolm","QS4","N/A","LP","N/A","406","I think we will have to reserve judgment until we get a report from the election observers. Australia is part of the Commonwealth team. We also have our own independent national observers present. They are there to judge and advise whether the elections are free and fair. It would be wrong to preempt that judgment at this point, as the elections are just starting. But let me say that there have been difficulties throughout Rhodesia. There have been concerns and breaches of the cease fire, probably by all parties, and breaches, to an extent therefore, of the Lancaster House arrangements. I think the Governor has had an extraordinarily difficult task. The extent of the bitterness in Rhodesia is probably hard for those of us in this House to realise. They have been fighting a guerrilla war for 1 5 years and it is not easy suddenly to set that aside and to adopt other habits. By and large the reports we are getting up to this point indicate that whilst there have been breaches of the ceasefire, there is no reason why free and fair elections in the terms of the Lancaster House agreement cannot and should not be held. That is the important point. A final judgment cannot be made until we have had the report from those who have been sent there specifically for that purpose and until that report has been examined.  It is worth noting this is one of the encouraging signs that there have been reports in recent days that a battalion of Nkomo s army and a battalion of Mugabe s army are being integrated into the official Rhodesian forces. Whilst that is only a small element of both their armies, the very fact that that has happened, the very fact that they, in a sense, are putting down guerrilla arms and taking up arms which are standard with those of the Rhodesian forces must indeed be one of the encouraging signs of events that are occurring in Rhodesia. Nobody has suggestedthe Government certainly did not seek to suggest that when monitors and observers were sent to Rhodesia there would be no element of danger or risk to Australian personnel. Obviously the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Defence, where it is appropriate, are keeping very closely in touch with the situation to make sure everything possible is done to protect the security and safety of our Australian people in Rhodesia. The element of risk is plainly there and has to be recognised, as so clearly appeared in relation to Tony Joyce of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. He knew in carrying out his responsibilities as a journalist for the ABC that there was an element of risk which, in his case, led to tragic and most unfortunate circumstances. We have to recognise that. Against that, on the other side, we have to recognise the dangers through which Rhodesia has been passing over 1 5 to 20 years and look for real prospects for agreement and a final settlement that give the best hope for peace for the remainder of this century to southern Africa. If the Lancaster House agreement blows apart, if what happens as a result of the election is not accepted and the war continues, I am quite certain that the Soviet Union will put in arms, there will be Cuban surrogates, of whom there are no fewer than 40,000 in Africa at the moment, and there will be war over southern Africa, devastating not only Rhodesia but also the surrounding front line states. Therefore, if there is a risk in relation to some of our own people, it has to be set against the contribution Australia has thus far been able to make to the very large purpose of bringing peace to southern Africa.","ZIMBABWERHODESIA","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[14]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Is it a fact that if allowance is made for the net effect on revenue in the Commonwealth Budget sector as a result of the introduction of family allowances, that is, in relation to the taxation structure and burden, the reduction of revenue by that sort of adjustment is no more than about 0.5 per cent of gross domestic product and that accordingly, by any measure, total Commonwealth Budget sector revenue this year will stand at a postwar record? In response to the Treasurers claim that the Government has sought to introduce equity and justice into the taxation structure and the distribution of its burden, is it also a fact that nonetheless, in the four years this Government has been in office, the tax burden for the top 10 per cent of income earners has been reduced and the tax burden for the bottom 10 per cent of income earners has been increased? What sort of equity and justice is it that the Treasurer proposes whereby the poor have to pay more so that the rich can pay less?

The fact is that one of the remarkable features of our taxation changes is the very large number of people who have been freed altogether from the liability to pay tax.

In his earlier question the Leader of the Opposition asked me to look at Budget receipts as a percentage of gross domestic product. During the time between his first question and his second question I have had the opportunity to look at the papers attached to the last Budget. Interestingly enough, I find that the increase in tax collections this year over those for the previous year is 1 5.4 per cent, for the previous year again it was 8.9 per cent and for the year before that 9.7 per cent. That takes us back to the four previous years, where the respective increases were 25.9 per cent in 197374, 28 per cent in 197475, 19.7 per cent in 197576 and, to be fair, 17 per cent in 197677. As a proportion of gross domestic product, the figure for 197879 was 25.2 percent.  The final proportion of gross domestic product for this year naturally cannot be determined until all the receipts and the like have been calculated. If the Leader of the Opposition seeks to have an argument about the burden and the equity of taxation, he is pushing fairly heavily uphill to explain away the quite dramatic rise as a proportion of gross domestic product that occurred in Budget receipts under the Whitlam Government, of which he was Treasurer for part of its time in office.","BUDGET SECTOR REVENUE","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[15]/answer/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

He has refused to sit on the front bench of this Opposition led by this Leader of the Opposition. I refer also to Senator Grimes and Senator Elstob. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for KingsfordSmith (Mr Lionel Bowen), was prepared to acknowledge in a debate in this House that the results of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the results of the invasion by Vietnam of Kampuchea present, to the region in which Australia is situated, a very dangerous situation. All honourable members of this House and the Australian public should be thankful that there are members of the Opposition who are prepared to defy their leader and to come forth in this House and condemn the action of the Soviet Union in a way which they mean.  I would like now to refer to some of the statements that have been made by various honourable members. Let me take some things that were said by the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) in the Sydney Morning Herald of 3 1 January this year. He said: the Soviet Union ... is certainly ... a threat to those nations which are unstable, are near its borders, and could in some way constitute some economic or physical threat to the Soviets themselves. I suggest that the logic of that statement is to justify and excuse the invasion by a great power such as the Soviet Union of a smaller independent nation which the great power sees as an economic or physical threat to it. On 3 1 January, on Nationwide,Senator Wriedt was asked: .. what happens if next the Soviet turns right into Iran or left into Pakistan?

What is the man in the street to conclude from that statement by the shadow Foreign Minister? Looking at those two statements by the honourable member for Corio and Senator Wriedt, does that not constitute justification for the assertion by this Government that the crisis presented by the Afghanistan situation is potentially the gravest threat to world peace since the last war? It is noteworthy that, in all the condemnations by Opposition members of the inclusion of those words in our motion, they constantly omitted the word potentially. This was the point of the remarks of the Prime Minister, that potentially it represents the gravest crisis to the world since the last war. That does not detract from anything that happened over Cuba, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Vietnam or the Dominican Republic. I ask honourable members to listen to what was said by the honourable member for Burke during the debate. He said: . . in this troubled area  I suppose it is a kind of throwaway line. He continued: it is not surprising that the major power should seek to stabilise the situation. Is not that a justification for an invasion? Is not that an excuse for brutal aggression?

I turn to what was said by the honourable member for Hunter. We know where he stands, of the proRussian sympathies that he has. All that he says about the Russian invasion is that it is a Soviet presence in Afghanistan. He even seeks to deny that it was an invasion, apparently being prepared to accept that the Soviet troops were invited to that country. If we turn to the speech of the honourable member for Parramatta we can see the hallmark of his philosophy and why he comes into this House to condemn the Government for its condemnation of the Soviet invasion. One has only to look at Hansard, at pages 257 onwards to confirm that. I regret the need in this House to have heard such a speech, in which the honourable member spoke of the archpriest of national divisiveness, the late former Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies. Is there any doubt where the sympathies of the honourable member for Parramatta lie? Is there any doubt about what he believes to be in the interests of patriotism in this country?

He condemns and rampages against the United States support of South Vietnam. Yet, having condemned Russian imperialism and what he calls United States imperialism, he offers nothing in place of the action that has been taken by the Australian Government to match his own condemnation of the invasion. He suggests nothing to bring home to the Soviet people the worlds abhorrence, indeed his own abhorrence, of that invasion.  The honourable member for Parramatta said that the Government was just indulging in a political debate, just kicking the communist can, as Sir Robert Menzies was accused of doing years ago. Thank God for Sir Robert Menzies actions in the days when he was prepared to kick the communist can. If we cannot kick the communist can by condemning the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan then who will in this country? Certainly, the Leader of the Opposition will not do it. It is about time more people in this country were prepared, as are honourable members on this side of the chamber, to kick the communist can, to stand up and be counted amongst the nations of the world, to speak in condemnation of, and to act in response to, the kind of aggression that we have seen in the Soviet Union. I direct the attention of all honourable members, especially members of the Opposition, to the speech by Senator Wheeldon and invite them to compare it with that of Senator Melzer. There, if one could ever find one, is an attempt to excuse or justify the Soviet invasion much along the lines of that of the honourable member for Parramatta, the honourable member for Corio, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports and others.

The Minister, who is the Prime Ministers faithful spaniel, failed to give a decent defence of the Prime Minister, even though he had 24 hours in which to prepare it. There was in his speech not one word in defence of the Prime Minister. His was an unrelated and erratic presentation that, in most cases, was out of context regarding what had been said by members of the Opposition. By and large, it vindicated what we have been saying that there is a substantial degree of bipartisanship on this issue and that the dispute is about the appropriateness of responses. We repudiate the emotionalism of the Prime Minister and his haste to create a second Cold War atmosphere for Australia.  What is this all about? Twentyfour hours ago not one member of the Government would stand in defence of the Prime Minister. Such is his reputation, such is the affection that he has within his own ranks, that no one was prepared to come forward and stand beside him. What valiant heroes he has to cleave a pathway in defence of his reputation! All I can say is that they are not great warriors, but they are very wise. There is nothing there to defend. What is this exercise about that fails so dismally? It is an exercise to pump up the deflated reputation of the Prime Minister, one of Australias best known and most successful exporters of wool to Russia. Malcolms wool keeps the Russians warmthat is the slogan for the next election. The Prime Minister this morning, in a kerbside interview, referred to barnyard politics. We concede that the Prime Minister knows what he is talking about when he talks about barnyard politics. That is where he gets the hides that he sells to Poland to shoe the Russian army. It is right next to the wool paddock from which he gets the wool which is keeping the Russian soldiers warm in the bitter Afghan winter. That is the crux of this issue.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","HAYDEN, Bill","RK4","N/A","N/A","N/A","413","Mr Speaker,let me make this point: The fact is that the Government has attacked the Opposition for expressing a concern, not in opposition per se to an Olympic boycott, that an Olympic boycott would be unfair, futile and derisory, will give a counter propaganda victory to the Russians and ought to be repudiated. In that sense we have no hesitation at all in stating bluntly what our attitude is. If boycott measures are effective, we support them. That is the view of Australians, 70 per cent of whom indicated their views as such in a public opinion poll published in the 17 February 1980 edition of the National Times. People were asked whether they believed that athletes should be prevented from participating. Seventy per cent, or seven out of ten people, said that they should not be prevented.  Of course, the Prime Minister is seeking desperately to cloud the real issues. The real issues are that the Government has been far from honest in the way in which it has promoted this issue in the community. We are encouraged to believe, on the statements of the Prime Minister, that the world, and specifically Australia, is in dire peril because of events in Afghanistan. We should bear this in mind soberly and weigh it up. One response, which is not unreasonable if someone genuinely believes that, is to increase defence expenditure and to outline a program of acquisitions of new equipment over the next five years. Yet we find that in the fiveyear program from this year on the proposed acquisitions will result in a total level of acquisition of new equipment for the Defence Force which is well below that proposed in 1976 in the White Paper for the fiveyear defence program then. Let us contrast the two periods. The 1976 period was a rather pacific period. International tensions were at a low level and there was no hyperreaction from the Prime Minister about problems internationally. In spite of that the real level of expenditure for the fiveyear program from 1976 was proposed to be much higher than that proposed for the new fiveyear program.","N/A","RESPONSE TO SOVIET INVASION OF AFGHANISTAN","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[2]/continue[25]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In fact, the current fiveyear program is some $ 1,500m below the level outlined in 1976. The new program does not even overcome the backlog that has developed in the course of this year. The fact is that there is no bipartisanship with the Government on substantial matters because we do not know how to get bipartisanship with a tiger snake. Who could trust the Prime Minister? The community does not. Seventy per cent repudiate him on his proposals to boycott the Olympic Games but to grab all the roubles that he can from the sale of wool to the Russians. That is the unfairness of what this is all about. We propose to move an amendment. I move:  That all words after That (first occurring) be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: this House is of the opinion that the Government should be condemned for not seeking a bipartisan policy in relation to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and for its deliberate attempts to seek political advantage by the adoption of double standards in sanctions against the Soviet Union . That is the crux of the issue, the double standards and the hypocrisy of the Government in the way in which it is presenting this issue. As always, those with great wealth will be immune from all sacrifice and all burden of surrender in the course of this great issue which the Prime Minister has proposed. But the unfortunate athletes, who have trained for several hours of every day of every year for the past four years in the hope that they will reach their peak and having reached the peak that they will not be able to regain on some future occasion, and in the hope of going to the Olympic Games, will be deprived for ali time of the opportunity of participating in the Olympic Games. If the Olympic Games go ahead we say unreservedly that Australia should participate. If there is an effective boycott, the Opposition supports it.","N/A","RESPONSE TO SOVIET INVASION OF AFGHANISTAN","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[2]/continue[27]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Last Tuesday we heard the Leader of the Opposition extoll the advantages of an effective Olympic boycott, and less than 60 seconds later he said that the Government should not be encouraging Australian athletes to take part in a boycott. This was not the first time that he effectively somersaulted on the Olympic boycott issue. A few weeks ago he said on television that he would support an international boycott of the Olympic Games. But he subsequently told a different constituency that  Labor supports Australian participation at Moscow, opposes any alternative games and proposes to fight the Government to the limit on this issue. Of course, we are all accustomed to the Leader of the Opposition posing as a man of straw, a political weathervane and a mouthpiece for whatever faction of his Party is judged to be in the ascendant at the time. What a contrast the Leader of the Opposition is to the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Malcolm Fraser) who has led this Government to the two largest electoral victories in the history of this country. He is a Prime Minister who has the trust of the people of Australia and clearly is on his way to a further resounding victory in 1 980. It is that reality which causes in this House a paralysis of apprehension and uncertainty on the part of the honourable gentlemen opposite. The Prime Minister is a leader on an international scale, a man who has won the respect of the world for the Governments policies and for Australia. Last year at Lusaka and this year in the capital cities of Europe and in the United States he made a significant personal contribution a contribution on behalf of this Government and this country to the process of maintaining international peace and order. By contrast, yesterday and again today, we saw the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow man who has been described by the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions as gutless, initiating an attempt to bring Australian political debate down to his own level, down to a squalid contest of disorderly catcalling and rowdy personal abuse. No doubt the Opposition was glad to have this opportunity to demonstrate its acknowledged expertise in this form of political activity. What is the Australian Labor Party s policy on Afghanistan? That is a difficult question. In the perception of many Australians there is not such a policy. On the subject of trade sanctions, the Leader of the Opposition said this:","N/A","RESPONSE TO SOVIET INVASION OF AFGHANISTAN","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[5]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

On the other hand, the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) says that those on his side of the House will not be so glib as to say that we could have a trade boycott. I will not venture to speculate here as to which of these gentlemen speaks for the largest proportion of the Australian Labor Party. Speculation is what we would need to be involved in if we were to attempt to define the Oppositions policy on Afghanistan. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition has given a reason for all this monumental vagueness of policy. The reason, in the minds of some members of the Australian Labor Party, is that Afghanistan does not matter. The Leader of the Opposition has assured us that Afghanistan is 15,000 kilometres from this country and that the boundary of our interest in threats to international peace should be drawn only a few thousand kilometres from our coastline. Naturally, in considering this advice we must bear in mind that the Leader of the Opposition comes from Queensland. The city of Perth is not 15,000 kilometres from Afghanistan; it is only 8,800 kilometres from Kabul. But perhaps Perth does not matter either. After all, Perth is some 3,300 kilometres from the Queensland coast obviously too far away to worry about as far as the Opposition is concerned.  That is not the only area where the Opposition has demonstrated a completely complacent attitude to recent world events. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) told us that the Soviet Union has not invaded Afghanistan, it has merely established a presence there. What a presence, Mr Speaker. Let me add that if this is the type of presents which the Soviets bestow on their neighbours, it is no wonder that its endowments are received without enthusiasm. Indeed, there are many thousands of dead, many hundreds of thousands of refugees from Afghanistan, who might have been excused for wishing that the Soviet Union had retained this particular present for its customary use suppressing the periodic restlessness of its existing satellites in Europe. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) is also on record as a Soviet apologist of some note. He informs us that we must expect the Soviets to attempt to assert influence on neighbouring nations. There should obviously be some prize for euphemism amongst the gentlemen opposite. Creative flights of fancy of this order should not go unrecognised. The Soviet Union, according to some members of the Opposition, has not invaded Afghanistan and has not even established a presence there; it has merely asserted influence. The Leader of the Opposition has also provided us with his own unique style of reassurance regarding Iran. Last week he told the House that no one could be certain that Soviet paranoia would not lead it into the northern provinces of Iran. But that is no problem. The Opposition apparently is prepared to let the Soviets have that particular area rather than allow the matter to strain a friendship. It obviously feels that appeasement failed to work with Hitler simply because it was not carried far enough. If the Leader of the Opposition finds this approach to his meek and conciliatory tastes, he obviously has a supporter in the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating). That honourable gentleman has told the people of Australia that the Soviets are most unlikely to attack Pakistan or Iran.","N/A","RESPONSE TO SOVIET INVASION OF AFGHANISTAN","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[5]/para[5]","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","LYNCH, Phillip","KIM","N/A","N/A","N/A","418","The honourable gentleman agrees. After all, he went on, who would want Pakistan? For that matter, who would want Afghanistan? That is the type of international strategic analysis which the Opposition is offering to the Australian people at this time. Who would want Afghanistan?, it asks. The Governments reply is: It is selfevident who wants Afghanistan. Who has moved 80,000 troops into that country as part of an attempt to take it over? If members of the Labor Party in this House and elsewhere cannot understand the strategic importance of Afghanistan it is no wonder that they cannot at the same time understand the strategic importance of Pakistan. I might add that even in that disingenuous exposition the honourable member for Blaxland stopped short of alleging that nobody would want Iran. After all, there must be some limit to even the Oppositions perception of public credulity.  It is obvious that in these last few weeks the Opposition has been engaged in an attempt to disguise the Labor Partys incapacity to agree on a response to Soviet aggression and its invasion of Afghanistan. It is seeking to do this by attacking and attempting to undermine every facet of this Governments firm response to the Soviet invasion. The only way in which the Opposition can hold its disparate, disarrayed and, so far as its leader is concerned, disenchanted ranks together on this issue is to produce a party line which is so vague, so meaningless and so conciliatory to the Soviet Union that the Labor leadership can continue to enjoy the support of certain elements within the Party. The Prime Minister has referred to a thread through the Australian Labor Party which has wanted to find excuses for the Soviets or to find reasons for doing nothing about their actions. I think that the origins of this state of affairs are obvious. The Oppositions political leadership is so weak, so faltering and so clearly committed to the art of the shifting compromise that it is incapable of facing its own splinter groups with any degree of firmness and resolution. The plain fact is that the Opposition is so internally divided that it is simply unable to produce for the Australian people a clear policy on Afghanistan. It is attempting to conceal this incapacity behind a smokescreen of apologies and excuses for the Soviets. We are told that we should not condemn Russia for its actions; that after all, it is paranoid. That is akin to saying: You have to excuse my brother; he is a thief. The implication is that the Soviets will not improve their behaviour in the future. We should expect to see them occasionally overrun a neighbour, enslave an independent people and kill thousands of local patriots who are so inconsiderate and ignorant as to be prepared to defend their homeland. The Opposition assures us that this type of behaviour is normal and to be expected of paranoid nations. What a ludicrous conception that is and what contempt it shows for the Australian people to expect them to swallow the line that has been put forward. The problem before us is not the lack of explanations for the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan; the reasons are all too obvious. The real concern behind the Oppositions actions is how to hold its fragmented ranks together when this final straw is added to the load of internal divisions and controversies. That is a problem that it will have to solve on its own. The Australian people want no part of this tortuous logic and these spurious arguments against taking a firm line on Afghanistan. Indeed, the spectacle of a longestablished and significant political party qualifying this countrys regional security simply to support its own internal cohesion is not one that sits well with the great majority of Australians. For its part the Government wants to see an end to the Oppositions continuing series of concerted attempts to prevent the nations of the world from responding effectively to Soviet aggression. We urge that all honourable gentlemen on both sides of this House should join in condemning the Oppositions tactics of go slow and prevarication by supporting the motion before the House.","N/A","RESPONSE TO SOVIET INVASION OF AFGHANISTAN","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[5]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

How is it that the Minister for Foreign Affairs runs around talking to the Foreign Minister in Singapore on the basis that he must support the Governments stance on Afghanistan because it is important for the defence of ASEAN. The day after the Minister for Foreign Affairs was in Singapore, the Pol Pot regime, which is recognised by the Government and which is causing genocide in Kampuchea, sent its Deputy Prime Minister, Ieng Sary, there and he was obviously welcomed on the basis that the Australian Government favoured the Pol Pot regime in Kampuchea. Can the Government not see what it is doing to the whole region to the north? Does the Government not know that a million refugees are up there now? Does the Government not know that super power involvement is there already?  Last night I heard the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) come in here and talk about human rights. In the same process he said: Well, I know there are some problems in the region to the north. The question of the Pol Pot regime is virtually a matter of some problem, nevertheless Vietnam is a much greater problem, therefore we continue to recognise the Pol Pot regime.  This is a regime that has murdered three million people. As a result, at the present time, we now have a war going on in Kampuchea between the Pol Pot and Vietnamese forces. In the whole process we have the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Peacock) and the Prime Minister doing two separate things allegedly in unison. The Prime Minister ran around as a messenger boy to Europe on two occasions and to Washington on two occasions to suggest a boycott of the Olympic Games. That will not happen and the Government knows it will not happen. Our athletes will be in Moscow in July and members of the Government will be shown up for the phoneys they are. At the same time the Foreign Minister is running around ASEAN countries trying to drum up support for the same cause on the basis that we will support those nations if they continue to recognise the Pol Pot regime. The Australian people realise that our greatest danger is to the region to our north. If Australia had a government that was prepared to do something about the matter, it would initiate the proposition now that Kampuchea should be made a neutral country. It would be taking some overt action to call international conferences to get the big super powers they are big of China and Russia, out of Kampuchea. The Government would also be working towards trying to get Vietnam to become part and parcel of ASEAN. But the Government does not want that. It does not want any solution to these problems. A debate is dragged on, for the second time, on the basis that there is something wrong with the Labor Party. The issue is clear cut from our point of view. We put it on record. We oppose the invasion of Afghanistan and that is clear. We have also proved that it is a double standard if we say to the Australian people: You should not go to the Olympic Games, but I want to sell my wool, my meat and my wheat because they are not effective as a boycott. The Australian people will not accept that. They know the Government is a hypocrite. On that basis the Government will not be able to get away with its proposal. What are we to do about standards? We have seen that the New South Wales maize growers want to sell 25,000 tonnes of maize to Russia. The Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) says: They are not going to do that. They are not going to sell the maize. They can sell the wheat, they can sell the wool and they can sell the meat, but they cannot sell the maize because I am against that as that is one of the things that Carter says is not to be sold. How silly can one be? That attitude will cost the New South Wales maize growers Sim at least because the price was going to be $136 a tonne and the best offer from Japan is about $92. There are the Governments double standards on this issue. Why will it not stand up and talk about that. If Malcolm Fraser owned the maize, very likely it would be sold. It is the same thing, but just a different name. The question now is this: Why is it that the Government adopts these double standards? The people of Australia now know that the Government is not really fair dinkum about this issue at all. The Government is really saying: Look, we do nor want to interfere with trade. But if Carter can interfere with trade, why cannot the Australian Government? The real issue is this: The Government does not want to upset the people whom it thinks will support it. That is where we come to what is the basic problem in the Governments present strategy. It is a problem to divert the Australian people from the domestic pressures they now have. If we look at the interest rate in the markets today we see that it is about 1 1.2 per cent and going up all the time. It means that the home owner who has to repay the mortgage will be up for another $ 1 1 a week. The Government is dead scared of that situation. When we ask a question about the Governments policy on liquified petroleum gas we get an answer that includes Afghanistan. That is the way it goes in this place at the present time. Why is it that all the Governments policies in relation to the tax burden, tax relief and, most importantly, the question of fuel prices and what the Government is doing for inflation, have failed. There is the situation of the interest rate which the Government has not been able to maintain, and the inflation situation which the Government has not been able to maintain. Today we get this spurious motion that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) has failed to adopt a bipartisan attitude. Let us make it very clear that any worthwhile Opposition anywhere in the world knows that it must act in accordance with public opinion. Public opinion in Australia has identified the Government for what it is. It is a sham to suggest that the Government can say to the Australian people that the biggest problem is Afghanistan, when the people are very worried about the regions to the north from where two or three million refugees could be coming within a matter of months. A war is going on in that region. There is super power involvement. But our Foreign Minister is running around saying: There is nothing to worry about. We still recognise the genocidal regime of Pol Pot.  That statement will not stand up to scrutiny. It will not stand up to history because the problems of that region are on the Governments doorstep. Last night the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) came into the House in a belated effort to retrieve the debacle of the earlier part of the day, when, as was said, his Prime Ministers credibility was in tatters. He came in here last night and again raised an issue on the basis that something was wrong with the Labor Party. All those other issues which I have mentioned are really not considered in the intelligence of international affairs. There has been just a tirade of abuse. When the Leader of the Opposition gets up to reply a motion is moved to gag the debate. This is the standard of debate. Is it any wonder that when members of the Australian public are asked in public opinion polls what they want to do about this matter they say: Continue the trade with Russia because we believe you. From the point of view of trade it must continue. Do not, by the same token, say that you will not let the athletes go to Moscow on the basis that that action will do the Russians some damage. People are asking: What are you doing to us as a nation? What about our safety as a result of what is deemed to be a massive influx of refugees? What about the war to the north? What about your taking some initiative instead of running around virtually being one of the lieutenants for Carter in his efforts to be selected in August next as the candidate for the Democrats? This is the real problem in the world. One does not see the same concern in Europe. At the present time the French are making their own arrangements, thank you very much, and they will participate in the Olympic Games. There have been discussions with Vance and others which clearly indicate that the European Economic Community will not accept the Carter philosophy of a boycott. Thatcher in the United Kingdom has said that the athletes are at liberty to do what they wish. So, part of the world which really matters I can understand that the Government would not figure in this matter can see that Carter is adopting a domestic policy which will be to his political advantage in the forthcoming few months. The European world in particular has to live with its neighbours and it will participate in what it deems to be reasonable operations from the point of view of trade or sport. That is the fundamental issue which the Government will not face up to. We could understand if the world said: We are all going to boycott the Games. We are all going to boycott trade . But the world is not doing that. The big issue, and the big mistake in what the Government is about is these famous words: Detente is dead . Detente is the only thing that is saving us from annihilation. Let us look at what Willy Brandt said. He makes the point:","N/A","RESPONSE TO SOVIET INVASION OF AFGHANISTAN","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[6]/para[5]","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","HOWARD, John","ZD4","Bennelong","LP","Treasurer","422","This motion is about the response of the Australian Labor Party, and in particular the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden), to what the Government has done about the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. One could be forgiven for thinking that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) was taking part in another debate. Rarely in the course of his speech did he touch upon the motion. Rarely in his speech did he address the question of whether the response of the Labor Party to what the Government has done over Afghanistan is proper and appropriate for a responsible Opposition. Over the past two days we have seen the Opposition lay bare in a very crude and obvious fashion its tactics for the remainder of the parliamentary year. It is quite obvious that, in good, plain and simple Australian terms, the Labor Party is going to play the man and not the ball for the rest of the year.  It is quite obvious that in plain simple terms, the manic response of the Opposition to anything done by the Government will not be a constructive alternative. It will simply shout liar at the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) or his colleagues. In case there should be any doubt about it, I say to the Opposition, through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that that tactic will fail as miserably this year as it failed last year. I warn the Opposition that if it believes it can establish itself as a credible alternative government simply by shouting innuendoes and untruths at the Prime Minister, it is doomed to an even more abysmal failure and defeat at the end of this year than was likely a few weeks ago. We have not had any constructive alternative proposals from the Opposition so far as Afghanistan is concerned. All we have had is blinding confusion, an array of contradictory statements which have left the Australian people absolutely unable to determine where the Opposition stands. Where does it stand on the question of the Olympic Games? The Leader of the Opposition has said time without number, and he has not denied it, that an effective boycott of the Olympic Games would be very good because it would drive home to the people of Russia that their Government had done a very objectionable thing. There is no argument about that. That is what the Leader of the Opposition said. In the next breath, of course, he said that we should not do anything at all to bring about that effective boycott. His deputy came into the House and quoted with gloating approval an editorial from a newspaper in Malaysia criticising the quality of the Prime Ministers visit overseas. He did not say anything about the editorials in the Melbourne Age, a newspaper not always glowing in its praise of what this Government or this Prime Minister does. He did not say anything about the editorials in the Sydney Morning Herald or the Australian. He did not say anything about what those newspapers had said. He rummaged around to find an editorial that was critical of what the Prime Minister had done, and with smug satisfaction said: This is what the visit amounted to. Then with equal smugness and complacency he leaned over and said: Dont you worry over there. Our athletes will be in Moscow and you will all look ridiculous. How does that sit with the professed attitude of the Leader of the Opposition that a boycott of the Olympic Games would be an effective response? How can one believe that the Opposition has a consistent attitude towards a boycott of the Olympic Games when on the one hand the Leader of the Opposition says, If we could bring about an effective boycott, that would be a very good thing, and then the Deputy Leader of the Opposition says in gloating terms, I hope our athletes are in Moscow and I hope you all look ridiculous? Just where do they stand? The fact is that the Leader of the Opposition is, as the bookmakers say, somebody who wants to bet on the race when it is over. The Leader of the Opposition wants to be in a position to say, if there is an effective boycott: I supported that all along. I think it is an excellent idea and I am very glad that it has been effective. But for heavens sake, dont ask me to do anything to make it effective. Dont ask me to commit myself. Dont ask me to get off the fence. Let me have it both ways. Let me say to the Australian people: Yes, an effective boycott is a great idea. It will bring home to the Russian people just how strongly we feel about this issue. But for heavens sake, dont embarrass the Labor Party by asking it to state an attitude. Dont embarrass the Labor Party by asking it to get off the fence. Dont embarrass the Labor Party on a foreign affairs issue because it is on those issues that we are most sensitive. Nothing has divided the Labor Party, in its history of more than 80 years, quite so much as a foreign policy issue. As honourable members on that side of the House know only too well, ever since the middle 1 950s the Labor Party has literally shuddered in its boots at the prospect of a foreign affairs issue because it brings out all the latent hatred, mistrust and confusion inside the Labor Party. It brings to the surface all the lack of conviction about the real interests of this country. It brings to the surface the ideological commitment of so many people in the Australian Labor Party towards the internationalist view of world affairs. It makes it necessary for somebody like the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), who normally tries to identify himself with the dominant right wing of the Labor Party, to go before the left wing Young Labor League in New South Wales as president of the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party and say: Forget about Afghanistan. Who cares about Afghanistan? Where is it? Forget about it.  It also makes it necessary for that darling of the moderate right wing of the Labor Party, the New South Wales Premier, to get onto the same track.

He did not think Afghanistan was a far away country that could be forgotten or ignored. He thought what the Soviet Union had done was reprehensible and ought to be the subject of effective action. As we go again and again through the responses of the Labor Party we find only one thing emerging, without ambiguity and without confusion. One thing alone emerges from their response. They are morally embarrassed by any foreign affairs issue. If there is one thing that terrifies members of the Labor Party it is the prospect of having to come out into the open and argue about foreign affairs. They are absolutely incapable of making up their minds where they stand. Their Leader believes and says that an effective boycott of the Olympic Games would be a very good thing. Then he sets about undermining the attempts being made by the Government of this country which his foreign affairs spokesman has said has the right to make decisions while it has a mandate from the Australian people, to bring about an effective boycott.  How can we believe that a person is a credible leader of a political party when he says he believes in something and then works to make sure that that thing does not come about? How can we believe that he is talking about live, real political issues in Australia at the present time when the stock in trade of his parliamentary performance over the last few days has been vitriol and personal abuse against the Prime Minister, something that I think will bring him great disgust not just from supporters of the Government but also from many of his own supporters. A classic illustration of that came about during his speech earlier today when the issue of wool sales from the Prime Ministers property was raised. The issue is very simple, as the Prime Minister has explained and as I will repeat. I can tell members of the Opposition that it will be repeated again and again until the effect of the Oppositions handling of the truth on this matter is effectively countered. The last wool sale involving the Prime Ministers clip took place on 22 November, which happened to be a month before the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. For the benefit of the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young), we are protesting against the Russian invasion of Afghanistan on 24 December; we are not protesting about the fact that previous wool sales from anywhere in Australia have taken place. So again and again we find absolutely breathtaking contradictions between members of the Opposition regarding their attitude towards the actions that have been taken by this Government. I believe, and I am sure that the overwhelming majority of the Australian people believe, that the response that this Government has taken has been a very measured and appropriate response. I believe that the visit overseas by the Prime Minister, far from being something that ought to be the subject of gloating reference based upon one newspaper editorial, which no doubt the Deputy Leader of the Opposition or his research staff spent days and days trying to find, and far from being the butt of sarcasm and criticism, ought at the very least be the subject of critical analysis and review by the Opposition. If the Opposition seriously wants respect from the Australian people as an alternative government, it should behave like one. It should not just rely on personal abuse. It should not just throw mud. It should not just get up in this Parliament and use as its stock in trade the word liar, which is what it has done over the past couple of days. It has not offered any alternative policies to those being followed by the Government. It has not tried to analyse constructively the policy statements made by the Government. All it has done is hurl personal abuse at the Prime Minister. As I said earlier in my remarks, just as that tactic failed completely last year, it will fail completely this year. We on this side of the House have, I believe, an appropriate response which is in sympathy with the views and the aspirations of the Australian people towards what has happened in Afghanistan. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who spent a quarter of an hour regaling us, said on 1 9 February, in a debate on Afghanistan, when talking about the Association of South East Asian Nations area: .. unless we get the Soviet Union out of the area altogether, we are in a very dangerous position. That is what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said only eight days ago. Well, if we are in a dangerous position by having the Soviet Union in the ASEAN area, how is anybody on the other side of the House seriously going to argue that we can call the Soviet presence in Afghanistan, which is the first occasion on which the Soviet Union has gone out of the Warsaw Pact area since the end of the Second World War, a phoney issue as Mr Wran called it? How can Afghanistan be dismissed, as the honourable member for Blaxland has done, as being a far away, irrelevant, totally indifferent country? Again and again we have these divisions within the Labor Party, not only involving the leftleaning faction of the party represented by people like the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes), but amongst those like the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Blaxland who normally regard themselves as ideological allies. The honourable member for Blaxland says that Afghanistan is a far away, remote country that nobody cares about while the Deputy Leader of the Opposition says that it is very dangerous to have the Soviet Union outside its own sphere of influence. So the Labor Party is desperately divided on this issue apart from the other issues on which it is normally divided. We have to understand one simple thing: The tactic of personal abuse and vilification has been used in the past by the Labor Party and will be used again by the Labor Party to try to divert our attention and the peoples attention from one very stark fact, and that is that the Labor Party is a miserable and an inadequate alternative to the present Government. That attempt will fail in the future as it has failed in the past. Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (MrMillarOrder!

What is the whole basis of this debate today? This is not the first time that the issue of Afghanistan has been debated. It was the subject of 2lA days of debate last week. It is the subject of debate today because the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) was rattled yesterday at Question Time, not by any namecalling or catcalling, but by four legitimate questions three questions on interest rates and one question on liquefied petroleum gas. They were the things which rattled the Prime Minister because he has come to realise that the khaki election is no longer on. A Bulletin article carries the headline Khaki begins to fade as an election winner. That is the truth and the Government realises it. Why was the Prime Minister rattled? He was rattled because of three questions on interest rates, which he could not answer and on which he could not defend his Government, and because of a question I asked on LPG, a question which embarrassed the Government. The Government has raised the price of that commodity for half the people who live in rural Australia.  Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (MrMillarOrder! I ask the honourable member to come back to the question before the House. I am going to the basis of this debate. There is now no longer conversion of vehicles to LPG in Australia. But there was one question on Afghanistan, only one, and that was asked by a Government back bencher. The Prime Minister, in answering that question, maligned me with a selective quote from an answer I gave on petrol pricing to a journalist from the Sydney Morning Herald. He then went on to attack the Opposition by saying that we were soft on the Soviet invasion. In fact I have never seen a back bench look more stunned or more dejected with the performance of a Prime Minister than I saw on that occasion, and I have been a member of this place for 10 years. The truth is that nothing happened. The banner headline in todays Age reads: Hayden flays Fraser. Headlines in the Australian Financial Review, the Adelaide Advertiser and the Australian, in fact the lot, say the same thing.

The Government knew about the situation then, but what did it do about it then? Were there any approaches to the Soviet Union? Were Government Ministers going round South East Asia talking about the buildup of troops in Afghanistan? Of course they were not. Was the Government taking any diplomatic initiatives? Of course it was not. The Government waited until the invasion actually took place and then and only then, when it saw the prospect of political capital, did it get on its hobbyhorse about it. The fact that the Government was advised of the Soviet buildup in September 1 979 by a senator of Australia and that the Government is prepared to ship to Russia the wool that the Prime Minister sold on 22 November wool which is still on the wharf demonstrates the lack of credibility of this Government and the complete humbug with which it has approached this issue of Afghanistan.  The Government has no policy. There are no embargoes. The Government talks about lifting the cultural links with the Soviet Union. I know that the Soviet Union wants our culture; it is desperate for it! The Prime Minister, in his address last week, said that the Soviet Union will not have ministerial visits. When we got through all the miserable, mundane initiatives that the Government is supposedly taking against the Soviet Union, what did it come down to? An Olympic boycott. The Government talks about an appropriate response and about human rights, yet it watched 300,000 people slaughtered in Timor. That powder puff of a Foreign Minister (Mr Peacock), who prides himself on knowing every foreign minister in the world and regards foreign policy as having good social relations with his opposite numbers in other countriesregardless of their politics and the abhorrence of their actions watched the incorporation of these people in Timor into Indonesia. Four days after the United Nations carried a motion condemning Indonesia the Government recognised the incorporation of Timor into Indonesia. The Government talks about human rights. As has been pointed out by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen), the Government is still recognising the murderous communist Pol Pot regime in Kampuchea. Yet the Government talks about human rights and examines the attitude of the Opposition. We will not let the Government examine our attitudes because our attitudes stand up. The Opposition has condemned the Soviet invasion. We are talking about the responses. If there is to be any response there can be no response other than a substantial response. By its own admission this Government has said that as trade sanctions will be effective, it will have no bar of them. It gets back to the Olympic boycott. What is so dangerous about the Olympic boycott is that the major body of world opinion the United Nations, which overwhelmingly condemned the Soviet Union in that supremely important motion of condemnation by that most supreme international body is swept aside. What is now important is the question of who will go to the Moscow Games. If the Soviet Union pulls off a successful Moscow Olympic Games it will be vindicated. When in fact the spotlight should be put upon the United Nations motion of condemnation, this Government is putting that condemnation at risk by its tomfoolery in playing at getting an effective boycott of the Moscow Games when there is no definition of effective when 34 nations boycotted the Montreal Olympics, and 23 nations boycotted our own Olympics in Melbourne in 1956. By any definition there can be no such thing as an effective boycott. If the Games take place in any shape or form the Soviet Union will stand vindicated, when it has no right to be vindicated. The United Nations proposal is just crushed underfoot under the body of world opinion with this crazed concentration upon the Olympic Games. When we look at what this Government will do we find this great, glaring gap of credibility. My honourable friend the Deputy Leader of the Opposition raised the question of maize. Someone else raised the question of rams. What is the difference between maize and rams and wool and wheat? What is the difference of principle upon which we have asked the Government to enunciate? On television the other evening Mr Hawke confronted the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon). He asked one simple question: What is the difference in principle between maize and rams and wool and wheat?. There is no difference. The only difference is that the Governments rural constituency will remain affected if wheat and wool sales are touched. The Government is not prepared to do this. The Government chides the Opposition on the position of Afghanistan. It chides us about our sense of responsibility and it quotes selectively. It cheats upon the integrity of people on this side of the House. In my own case, at every stage I have condemnd the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, but I argue only as to the response.","N/A","RESPONSE TO SOVIET INVASION OF AFGHANISTAN","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[8]/para[3]","N/A","N/A"

But in Australia it is to be kept an issue only for the Liberal and Country Parties, as though it is their little private issue. Only those parties could keep the advice to themselves. Only those parties could market the issue and start dredging up the communist can. But when they were advised in that regard two months before by Senator Wheeldon they sat and did nothing. Yet they talk about credibility. But the truth remains: What is the intelligence behind the whole issue? The intelligence behind the issue is that the Labor Party continues to hold up in the public opinion polls, despite the goings on of the Prime Minister. Why? It is because the domestic issues are still telling. We have double digit inflation; interest rates back where they were in 1975; unemployment at over half a million, double what it was when the Government came to office; billions of extra taxes including indirect taxes on petrol, cigarettes and liquor and other sales taxes; and we have had drastic cutbacks in Government services. The health scheme is in chaos. Thousands of Australian families are no longer covered for health protection. No wonder the Government wants to divert the issue on to foreign affairs. It took the GovernorGeneral, in his Australia Day message, to stick up for the unemployed. The GovernorGeneral had to address himself to the question of the unemployed because the Government decided to wash its hands of the proposition altogether. When we examine the credibility of the Government and we ask this weak Prime Minister questions about his credibility, he has another Minister answer for him. We have all the broken promises: To maintain Medibank, broken; tax indexation, broken; wage indexation, broken; to reduce interest rates by 2 per cent, broken; to reduce unemployment within 12 months, broken; and to have propriety in Government. Eleven Government Ministers have either been sacked or have resigned. Another broken promise. It promised to give tax cuts. The Government gave them and took them away five months later. It promised them again a month ago but reneged on that promise. Another broken promise. Promise after promise has been broken.  We have seen the Governments strategies. The first strategy was the investmentled recovery, then the consumerled recovery and then the exportled recovery. All those failed. Do honourable members remember the taxled recovery and the wageprice freeze which failed? We now have the resourcesled recovery. That also will fail. But now the biggest recovery of the lot is the Russianled recovery. All the money and hopes of the Government will be put on the Russianled recovery because that is what it hopes will save it. I invite honourable members to look at the American magazine Business Week. In this weeks edition there is the headline: Australia, a bleak year despite the mineral boom . The cocks are crowing about the fact that Australia is in for another dose of inflation, another dose of unemployment, that retail sales are down, savings bank deposits are up, and the motor industryAustralias major manufacturing industry is falling apart. This Government has forfeited any right whatsoever to be the government of this country. The Government has no credibility on any basis of objective assessment on the management of the economy. The Government asked for three clear years. It has had four years and is now in its fifth year, yet it wants three more years.","N/A","RESPONSE TO SOVIET INVASION OF AFGHANISTAN","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[8]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

On any basis of credibility and on any of the economic issues that I have mentioned, the Government stands condemned. There is an attempt now to shift the debate back on to the international issue and to talk about the Olympic boycott and all the rest. There is nothing which can come as any tangible response from Australia at this stage to the Soviet invasion.  The Prime Minister made a mindless tour through South East Asia and a mindless trip through the northern hemisphere which brought no results. We even had the Prime Minister saying to the world that the United States would use tactical nuclear weapons in Iran, just as he said in Southern Africa when he leaked the Lancaster House proposals and nearly completely blew apart the Rhodesian settlement. Then he said that we would be at war in three days. He cannot be trusted out of the country, much less in the Parliament. This sleazy, snivelling attempt by the Government to put this debate up today is only a smokescreen for the Prime Ministers failure in the House yesterday. He stands condemned in front of the Parliament, the Press Gallery and the public, as a Prime Minister leading a government out of control, without any economic direction, without any credibility for its continued existence. The Government is trying now to get back on the phoney issue of Afghanistan on the basis that there is something wrong with the Opposition. We condemn the Soviet Union and will continue to condemn it, but we are not selling wheat and wool to it. We are not prepared to take Russian roubles while we sacrifice Australian athletes according to a double standard such as has been adopted by the Prime Minister. If he has any integrity left he will boycott the sale of wool by Australia to the Soviet Union. Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (MrMillarOrder! The honourable members time has expired.

Indeed, had I been the draftsman it would have been in much stronger terms. In my judgment, there is nothing more shameful than a political party, in this case the Australian Labor Party, seeking to make cheap political capital when the national security is at stake. There is nothing more contemptible than a Leader of the Opposition, even a temporary Leader of the Opposition, who seeks to divide a nation when national unity is of the essence in the eyes of the world. Where the motion uses the words undermine the efforts of Australia I would say that a more appropriate wording would be white ant because if we have ever seen a party of white ants with red faces we see it when we look across the chamber at the Australian Labor Party. It is appropriate in 1 980 for the people of Australia to make the judgment that the people of Great Britain made in the 1930s. But in this case the people of Australia will decide who are the Churchills in their Parliament and who are the Chamberlains. They will not need to look very far or ask too many questions in order to find the answer.  It is appropriate, since I mentioned Sir Winston Churchill, that I quote to Her Majestys Opposition his words of 21 September 1938 when he said: .. the idea that safety can be purchased by throwing a small state to the wolves is a fatal delusion. He went on but one month later to say that the world: . . should know that we have passed an awful milestone in our history . . . and that the terrible words have for the time being been pronounced against the Western democracies: Thou are weighed in the balance and found wanting and do not suppose that this is the end. This is only the beginning of the reckoning. This is only the first sip, the first foretaste of a bitter cup which will be proffered to us year by year unless by a supreme recovery of moral health and martial vigour we arise again and take our stand for freedom as in the olden times. With those words of Churchill ringing in our ears, would the people of Australia like to ask which party has been fair dinkum, to put it in Australian terms, in opposing the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan? The Government parties, under a strong and determined Prime Minister, have been totally united. Her Majestys Opposition I emphasise those words in view of something that I will be saying later is in total disarray. Left is split from Right. Contradictory statements come out day by day. Let me remind honourable members of the words of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) when asked at a Press conference on 31 January:","N/A","RESPONSE TO SOVIET INVASION OF AFGHANISTAN","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Secondly, he has done this country, in my judgment, a great disservice. Over and over again he has made statements which, on a fair reading, can only be interpreted as apologising for, explaining away and in any other manner lowering the seriousness of the situation and the guilt of the Soviet Union in its brutal invasion of Afghanistan.

I will say this: He is weak, vascillating and apathetic.

That claim was that this is the greatest crisis since World War II. We have not heard any member of the Government use that term in this debate. Obviously, the first term used by the Government or by the Prime Minister was used to arouse hysteria over the Russian intrusion into Afghanistan. If we were to replace the word Afghanistan with the word Vietnam we would have again all the Government speeches we heard before in the 1960s. Again it is a question of which party is the most patriotic. Let us make a test of which party is the most patriotic. Were the Liberal Party and the National Country Party patriotic because 510 young Australians lost their lives in Vietnam, or was the Australian Labor Party patriotic because it said Australia should never have been involved in Vietnam? Who is right in 1980 about that question? Who will be proved right about the Russian intrusion into Afghanistan?  I asked last week: Who advised the Prime Minister to take off in his Boeing 707 in a jaunt around the world to speak to President Carter, President Giscard d Estaing, Chancellor Schmidt and Mrs Thatcher, the Prime Minister of Great Britain? Who advised him that Australia had an influence equal to a super power, which sent the Prime Minister spiralling around the world in order to use the voice of Australia to beat up the cold war again? No more disgraceful statement has been made in this whole debate since the Russian invasion of Afghanistan with its troops than the statement made by the Prime Minister who declared to the world that the Parliament in Australia had declared detente dead. He said: I declare detente dead. These are the words of the Prime Minister. They are not the words of the Chancellor of West Germany, nor the words of the President of France, nor are they the words even of the President of the United States. They are the words of the Prime Minister of Australia who was telling everybody that we are going back to the early 1950s where, perhaps, we can beat the cold war into a hot war. This is the fifth day of sitting of this Parliament. It is the fourth day on which we have discussed Afghanistan. It is the third occasion that the Government has refused to discuss interest rates or housing loans. It is the third occasion in five days that the Government has refused to discuss domestic issues. But the Government brings on, without any notice, with the Ministers getting up here with prepared speeches, a discussion on Afghanistan again. Members of the Opposition and the public are entitled to be cynical about the Governments attitude to this question. Not only did the Prime Minister say that detente is dead and that this is the greatest crisis since World War II, but he also told us that there could be war in three days. What kind of a maniac would go around the world telling people that there could be war in three days? We are not fighting wars with bows and arrows any longer. We are now fighting wars with weapons so destructive that it is almost incomprehensible as to what they could do. But the Prime Minister of Australia tells us we could have war in three days. On the plane on the way from the United States to Europe the Prime Minister leaked that the United States had told him that it would use tactical nuclear weapons in the Persian Gulf area. The United States denied it. Someone on that plane going from the United States to Europe was telling lies about what the United States had told the Prime Minister and his party on their visit.

German diplomats throughout the world, including in Australia, are making it clear that no such suggestion was made by Chancellor Schmidt to Mr Fraser. This was another grotesque, diplomatic lie in the whole facade of trying to pump up the Russian invasion of Afghanistan into our role of what we can do in this part of the world.  Not only are we not a major economic or military power or super power in this world, but also we are not even the largest democracy in our region. The largest democracy in our region is India. India is saying things quite different from what we are saying.

India is printing in its foreign affairs magazines the communiques released by Mrs Gandhi and other visitors.

What relationship do we have with India that we can discuss our concern about our region? The Foreign Minister of this country, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), has been shadow Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs since 1972. With the advent of the Afghanistan crisis he made his first trip to India. Mrs Gandhi asked him: Is this your first trip? You have not been here before. She is entitled to know whether we are serious about the region or whether we are just exploiting the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan for our own political purposes. Mrs Gandhi saw the Minister from Australia for 20 minutes. She saw Mr Peacock for 20 minutes. She spent more time with Muhammad Ali two days later than she spent with the Foreign Minister of Australia. That is how much respect we have got here.  What member on the Government side of the House has mentioned the word Afghanistan before? Not one. We are not putting on the rubbishy rhetoric that members of the Government are putting on. Not one member on the Government side has ever mentioned Afghanistan, but all of a sudden they are concerned. The Prime Minister said in a personal explanation after Question Time: The accusation that I am selling my wool to the Russians since the invasion is incorrect. He said that he sold his wool last November just before the invasion. The fact that the wool is still in Australia and has not been sent does not matter to the Prime Minister. But if he looks at all the briefings that he has received, whether from the Office of National Assessments, the Department of Foreign Affairs or any of the security forces of this country, he will know that there have been thousands of Russian troops in Afghanistan for two years. Of course, he is not going to take the same stand on trade with Russia that he took on trade with Vietnam. In relation to Vietnam, this Prime Minister, the then Minister for the Army and the then Minister for Defence, put up his hand in Cabinet and said: We will not trade with North Vietnam. The Government stopped the export of a product from an abattoir. It did not stop Australia from trading in millions of tons of wheat, bales of wool, lead, zinc and rutile and all the other things that are bought from us by the Soviet Union, but it stopped the export of one product from a Victorian abattoir. That product was tallow. The Australian Government stopped a Victorian abattoir from sending tallow to North Vietnam. But now the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman), the mouth from the south, says that members of the Labor Party are traitors and we are not as patriotic as members opposite because we will not ban the Olympics. Why should we ban the Olympics while the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon), the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony), the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Street), the Prime Minister and a whole host of back benchers are sitting on their farms sending their products to the Soviet Union?

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","YOUNG, Mick","EV4","N/A","N/A","N/A","433","That has always been my view. That is my view and in line with that view I am saying that we should not boycott the Olympic Games. The Government is making Ministers millionaires and our athletes povertystricken. It has a different attitude to its Ministers. How can honourable members opposite sit behind the Ministers and watch them pour money into their pockets from the sale of their products to Russia while at the same time they say to the athletes: You cant go? One of the honourable members opposite said last week: We have a very serious request from the West. There are 12 Russian dissidents who say that it would be a good thing if we boycotted the Olympic Games. The honourable member opposite said that we should listen to the Russian dissidents because it is important that we back their cause, and so it is. But I tell the House that we have some dissidents in Australia, people who are circulating petitions asking members of parliament to send the kids to the Olympics. I will name a few of the dissidents. They include Dawn Fraser, the greatest sportsperson this country has produced, Kevin Berry and John Devitt. Honourable members should just remember those names because they are now the Australian dissidents. They are the people who are saying that we should go to the Olympics. All the time we have this sham of the Liberal and National Country Parties who say: This is the way we are going to fight the Russians. Ships are unloading in Leningrad, Vladivostock and all the other ports around the Soviet Union. The Soviet workers must be whistling Waltzing Matilda as they unload the wool, the wheat, the silver and the lead while Government Ministers line their pockets.  Why do honourable members opposite not make a decent decision and face up to it? What influence do they think it will have if we do not run, swim or jump in Moscow in August of this year? They are prepared to take the easy option. The easiest option to this Government is not to go to the Olympics. How fortunate it is for the Government that the Olympics are to be held in Moscow this year. What is the Government going to do after the Olympics? Probably it will keep out the basketballers or the volleyball players. It will be doing things that will not injure the personal gain of its Ministers. It will make sure that they do not have to go without a quid. If ever any government this country has ever seen has selfinterest as its prime motivation it is this Government. Even the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt), who is sitting at the table now, knows that he will benefit from our continuing to trade with the Soviet Union. He can put up his hand and say to one of the kids in Australia: We know that you have been training for four or five years, but bad luck. This boycott suits our politics. Government members do not want to talk about interest rates; they do not want to talk about petrol prices; they do not want to talk about housing loans; they do not want to talk about domestic issues; they want to keep talking about whether the Labor Party is patriotic or whether they are more patriotic than it is. They want to keep talking about whether in fact they are taking the right attitude to the Russians in Afghanistan. They have to keep that issue alive because that will do them more political good than any other move they can make. They can do it for as long as they like but the fact is that their policy is faltering with the Australian public. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) tells us that we ought to adopt different attitudes in the House. From my observation, the best day that we have had in the House since 11 December 1975 was yesterday, because yesterday, for once and for all, the Prime Minister was established as the greatest liar who has ever stepped into this Parliament.","N/A","RESPONSE TO SOVIET INVASION OF AFGHANISTAN","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[10]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","LUCOCK, Philip","KIH","Lyne","N/A","N/A","434","I rise to support the motion moved this afternoon by the Leader of the House (Mr Viner). Perhaps it is appropriate that I should follow the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young). If political thinking were classified as advertising the honourable member for Port Adelaide could be subject to prosecution for exaggeration. I know that he is an optimist. He has been into the electorate of Lyne. The unfortunate thing is that he has been encouraging the Labor candidate there to think that he has a slight chance in the forthcoming election. I realise that many members of the Opposition have to be extreme optimists in order to be here, but I think that is carrying things to a really unreal conclusion.  Quite seriously, I wish to refer to one of the factors relating to this motion and to what has happened in this House. I think it is something that everyone in Australia has to look at. I fully appreciate the fact that one has to be careful when one is getting on in years a little not to look back and say: Well, things are not like they were when we were younger. But there is reason for serious consideration of the political situation in Australia today. It appears to me that some members of the Opposition have almost a death wish never to be members of a government and never to be able to form a government. If one looks at what has happened in recent years, one realises that one of the weaknesses of any democracy is the weakness of an Opposition. That has been the situation in Australian politics for a long period. As I have said, that should cause the people of Australia a great deal of concern. There was an article in one of the newspapers regarding the performance of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) both in the House and in the country. The article called him the champ, which is perfectly correct, and talked about how easy it was for him to be able to defeat the Leader of the Opposition in the ring, using a boxing match as an illustration. I cannot quite accept that illustration because, to my mind, the Prime Minister would have to be the greatest shadow boxer in the world to have any success against the Leader of the Opposition in the ring, as every time the Leader of the Opposition climbs up onto the steps to get back into the ring someone in his own party or organisation kicks the stairs from underneath him. He has yet to get into the ring to engage the Prime Minister with any strength or capacity. This is not good. Unfortunately, this carries through to the economic situation in which we in Australia find ourselves. We have problems and difficulties with our unions and their leaders. Some sections of the industrial wing of the Australian Labor Party are doing everything they can to undermine the economic strength, progress and development of this country. I say quite seriously that if this country is to progress and if we are to achieve those things that it is possible for us to achieve, because of the great advantages that we have, there will have to be a change of outlook by something like 90 per cent of the members of the Opposition, the unions and the left wing people in this country. They are doing everything they can to undermine the progress and development of this country in the twentieth century. That is one of the elements of the debate this afternoon. It is one of the elements that has been indicative of the debates and discussions in this House. I hesitate to quote a member of the Labor Party in an endeavour to show how he thinks because I know, firstly, that it presents difficulties and, secondly, that sometimes it is unfair as one can quote that member out of context, but I have had quite an association with one of its members, Senator Wheeldon, who is a senator from Western Australia, and I want to quote him. He was the Chairman of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence on an occasion when I was a member of it. There were many occasions on which I disagreed with him and there were many times when our thoughts and considerations were exactly opposite, but I think that the words that he used in the speech he made in the Senate in regard to this matter should be considered very seriously by many Australians, particularly by members of his own party. He said:","N/A","RESPONSE TO SOVIET INVASION OF AFGHANISTAN","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[11]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","0","0","1","0","1","LUCOCK, Philip","KIH","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan is inexcusable. It is a monstrous action of imperialism which the Soviet Government has taken against a neighbouring country. I do not believe that anybody would criticise an Australian government or the government of any democratic country for taking strong action to show its disapproval and condemnation of what the government in Moscow has done. It is an outrageous piece of behaviour. It is a piece of the most rampant aggression that one could imagine. What has happened is that a small country neighbouring the Soviet Union has been invaded. The people of that country are being subjected to brutality and armed intervention and are being placed in the position where they will be reduced to an appendage of the Soviet Union, a colony of the Soviet Union. It is an action which is contrary to principles of international law and contrary to principles devoted to the preservation of world peace.  I believe that the statement which was made this month at the meering of the Socialist International, the international body of social democratic and socialist parties throughout the world an organisation to which the Australian Labor Party is affiliated is a completely appropriate one. It states that the Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan has violated international law as well as the sovereignty and right of selfdetermination of that country. The Socialist International condemns the intervention of the Soviet armed forces in Afghanistan and calls upon the Soviet Union to withdraw all of its troops from that country. I think that is the only position to which any civilised person who believes in democracy and in equitable and just relations between nations would subscribe. Condemnation can be the only consequence of the Soviet action in Afghanistan.","N/A","RESPONSE TO SOVIET INVASION OF AFGHANISTAN","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[11]/quote[1]/para[1]","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","LUCOCK, Philip","KIH","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","There are some things which Senator Wheeldon said and which I do not agree with, but that is a basis for approaching the matter. All the fobblebobble in the world from the Opposition cannot disguise that fact. Members of the Opposition can say: You should not do this, that or anything else, and they can say in words that they condemn the actions of the Soviet Union but it is only by stopping the participation of Australians and others in the Olympic Games that we will give tangible expression to our obvious opposition to the actions of the Soviet Union. That cannot be denied.  I know that there are problems and difficulties. President Carter did say that if the Soviet Union took certain action the United States of America would go ahead with the Olympic Games. I know that it will pose problems if we stop them training and then suddenly turn round and say that it is all right for them to go because certain things have happened. That brings me back to the fact that our participation in the Olympic Games is an indication of our acceptance of the Soviet Unions policy. If we dissociate ourselves from it we are at least producing evidence of our strong disapproval of the Soviet Unions actions. I have had the great privilege of being able to go to Kenya on four or five occasions. It is rather an indictment of certain sections of Australian thinking that we are fiddling and muddling about with this matter whereas a small country like that has said what action it will take. We have to give a lead. It is no good saying: If you do it, I will do it. It is like a kid going out into the backyard and saying: I will play if you are going to play, but I will not if you are not. If you dont do it in the way I want I will take. my bat home. Australia has to support the Prime Minister by saying where it stands on the matter. One of the proudest moments of my time in this House, irrespective of politics, was when the late Sir Arthur Fadden said: This policy is correct and no matter what the reaction is I certainly will stand by it. Some of the older members of this House may recall that he once said about a meeting of his friends that he could have it in a telephone booth and it would not be overcrowded. He stood firm on an economic decision. He said: If we lose seats it does not matter.

It turned round and by employing a ruthless dictatorship took over a country that was endeavouring to show a degree of independence. I had the privilege of being at the United Nations in that particular year. A motion of the United Nations was carried unanimously when the United Nations was a little bit more important than it is today. What effect did that resolution have? The Soviet Union told the United Nations to go and jump in the lake. It told the United Nations something else but if I said what was actually said you, Sir, would rule my remarks as unparliamentary. This is the same type of thing as far as any resolution of the United Nations or anything else that we can do is concerned. In regard to trade, I still think we should keep that factor and action fluid. But the one thing that the Soviet Union will see is the lack of participation of countries in the Olympic Games. This I believe, as I said earlier, is the one thing that can have a more damaging effect on the Soviet Union than anything else.  Let us have a look at what has happened in regard to the human rights of individuals in the Soviet Union. Has any protest, motion or action had any effect? I would be prepared to say that if one goes to the Soviet Union and talks to the people one would find that they would not even know that the United Nations had passed a resolution, they would not even know that this or that or something else had happened. If we do not participate in the Games there has got to be an explanation and there has got to be a reason for our not being there. If the major countriesthis is on the conscience of the major countriestake this action they will be taking action on something that will have the effect of showing this is where we stand and this is where the line has to be drawn. One other thing that I must confess rather amazes me is the number of people who say that sport and politics should not be mixed. Did those people say that when they stopped South Africa participating in cricket, tennis and football and all of the other sports? Many of us said: Look, let these people come because we can talk to them. Let them come because their government is taking some action and we are hoping to encourage them to take further action . But these people said: No, let us have nothing to do with them at all. Is it not strange that these ratbag left wing elements in that party and in the unions are now suddenly piously and sanctimoniously throwing up their hands and saying: Do not let us participate in the sport and politics mixture. Let us keep it out, and let us have sport without polities. I support the Government and I hope that we continue to take this stand in this situation.","N/A","RESPONSE TO SOVIET INVASION OF AFGHANISTAN","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[11]/para[10]","N/A","N/A"

We saw the Government totally humiliated by the Opposition yesterday and now it has provided us with an opportunity to do so again. We will do so again if we have not already done so by this stage in the debate. The most amazing thing about this debate is that the Government has brought into the House a motion relating to a debate which took place for all of last week and ended up last week with the passage of the motion. That resolution, which was passed by this House without opposition from this side of the House, did exactly what the Government wanted. It condemned the invasion of Afghanistan and called on the Russians to withdraw immediately from Afghanistan. Any one would think, listening to the contributions of the people from the Government side who have spoken and particularly that outrageous speech from the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman), that we had opposed that proposition. In fact, if anybody cares to look he will see that we proposed an alternative motion. It was an alternative form of words to those contained in the Governments motion which said similar things in slightly less hysterical terms.  We do not dispute the basis on which the Government is wanting us to agree with it. We do condemn the invasion of Afghanistan and we call for the immediate withdrawal of the Russian troops. To listen to this debate today one would think that the Opposition had welcomed that invasion. It was rather extraordinary and indeed unique to have the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Lucock) quoting with some approval a resolution of the Socialist International. I am sure that that is a first for the honourable member for Lyne. It is a pity he did not go on to say that the Socialist International is not prepared to abandon detente and that is the important question in this whole debate. It is a matter of keeping that question in proportion. It is a situation of not scuttling the idea of detente which has been so studiously worked for by many world leaders for many years. That is a very important difference between the attitude of this side of the House and of the Government. What did we have as far as the Government was concerned? We had the most outrageous of all the Ministers in this outrageous Government come into this House and propose a motion to us immediately after Question Time. That Minister, the Leader of the House (Mr Viner) is so pathetically sycophantic that he will completely disregard the truth. His speech amounted to a series of misrepresentations, distortions and fabrications. He attempted to quote, misquote and quote out of context speeches of honourable members on this side of the House and indeed of Labor senators in another place without regard to accuracy or truth. I must say that this debate as unnecessary and trumped up as it is, does give me an opportunity to place on record my position regarding the question in Afghanistan. It will be noted that I was not able to participate in the debate last week. I interpolate and say that I had prepared two speeches last week the third was this week on taxation and the plight of small business. Because of preoccupation with the Afghanistan situation I did not have an opportunity to contribute to debates on those important matters simply because the Government was not prepared to have debates on them. The reason I was not able to be here for the end of the debate and indeed to vote was because it was necessary for me to return to the Kimberleys in Western Australia to ensure that members of the Liberal Party did not, once again, conspire to deprive the people of Kimberley from exercising their vote in the State elections on Saturday last.","N/A","RESPONSE TO SOVIET INVASION OF AFGHANISTAN","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[12]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

He sends in the Ministers who are responsible for key economic areas. The only reason they want to debate this question is that they cannot get a look in on the issues that are supposed to concern them. They cannot get a look in on the questions of employment, the economy, and industry policy because the Government is not prepared to have a debate with the Opposition, or anyone else for that matter, on those important questions. The only chance they get to enter into debates is on matters such as this spurious motion that has been presented to us by way of a diversion. The only thing this Government is concerned to do is to manufacture public panic in this country. It is trying to escalate hatred for the Soviet Union. It did so all last week and apparently is going to do it for the rest of this week as well. This motion suggests that there should be a bipartisan approach to the problem in Afghanistan. With the greatest of respect, I should have thought that if there was going to be a bipartisan approach to this question, the first thing the Government would have done would have been to give the Opposition access to the Governments own strategic assessment.","N/A","RESPONSE TO SOVIET INVASION OF AFGHANISTAN","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[12]/continue[16]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","DAWKINS, John","9E4","N/A","N/A","N/A","439","The official strategic assessment of this country, supplied by the Office of National Assessments, has been on the front of a newspaper for everyone to see. The Government did not have to trust us. Its prime intelligence unit leaks like a sieve, and that is where the countrys security is placed. It is placed in the hands of an organisation which leaks like a sieve. In any event, let me return to the motion. The Government would not give a briefing to the Opposition because it did not want us to know what ONA thought. It did not want us to have the ONA assessment. It wanted us to know only what the Prime Minister thought. The Prime Minister did not want to be embarrassed and humiliated by having trumpeted before the Australian people the fact that he disagreed with the assessment of the organisation he himself established. He established it because he thought the intelligence services in Australia were inadequate. Now, a year later, he has turned around and called it a complacent organisation. He has rejected its advice in favour of his own crazy obsessions about the international state of affairs. He is not prepared to listen to anyone who disagrees with him.  Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. Mr Deputy Speaker,it is clear that the Government is not really all that keen on this debate as there are only five Government members in the chamber. Prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was referring to the Governments entirely inconsistent position on the question of Afghanistan. I refer to the remarks of the honourable member for Denison who spoke about half an hour before I began my speech. It is his view that the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan is designed for two purposes: Firstly, it is aimed at threatening the oil fields which supply the Western economies, and secondly, it is designed to threaten the sea routes which carry the oil from the oil fields in Iran to the Western economies. Therefore, by inference, it is a threat to the whole of the security of the economies of the West. It is interesting to note that the analysis of the honourable member for Denison is entirely inconsistent with that of the Office of National Assessments. It is entirely out of touch with the views of the ONA which does not agree with his position at all. But even if his position is correct, why is it that France does not agree with him? Why is it that West Germany does not agree with him? Indeed, if it is correct, why is it that the Governments response is not more consistent with that analysis? Let us look at what the Government has done. What has been the real action taken by this Government in relation to the socalled threat which is manifestly clear as a result of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan? All we have seen is a highly publicised trip overseas by the Prime Minister. It is clear that the Prime Minister had some ground to make up in relation to his standing internationally. We know that last year the Prime Minister went overseas and tried to intervene in a number of international affairs. But we discovered at the end of the year that the President of the United States, President Carter, would not even see him. Giscard d Estaing vetoed the Prime Ministers attendance at the meeting in Tokyo. Mrs Thatcher would not trust him because of the way in which he behaved in Lusaka and even Mr Muldoon of New Zealand refused the offer of a ride home on the Prime Ministers aeroplane after the Lusaka meeting. So the Prime Minister did indeed have some fence mending to do overseas. That is what this exercise is all about to try to salvage his greatly diminished reputation in the eyes of the rest of the world. Let us look at the Governments real response in terms of its commitment to upgrade defence. We find that it was absolutely pathetic. Apart from a couple of items, there was nothing new in what the Government said. All we got was a commitment to get another frigate at some time in the future, probably not before five years. There is no timetable in relation to the tactical fighter force jets; in fact, we do not even know for sure what aircraft will be selected. We do not know what the replacement for HMAS Melbourne will be. HMAS Melbourne continues to float around the world, aimlessly and for an unspecified time, as some sort of latter day Marie Celeste. We do not know what her replacement will be when in fact she is a very important part of our naval fleet.","N/A","RESPONSE TO SOVIET INVASION OF AFGHANISTAN","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[12]/continue[19]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","CARLTON, Jim","DF4","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Let us look for a moment at the seriousness of the present situation. We have had a lot of debate today not really directed to the real issues. It is important that we remember that at this moment there are in excess of 90,000 Russian troops in Afghanistan. About 800 people were killed this week during an uprising in the city of Kabul. President Tito of Yugoslavia is gravely ill. We all know that Yugoslavia is a critical nation in the European balance of power and that there is a grave possibility that the Soviet Union might find it necessary to move into Yugoslavia if it has the same kinds of feelings about Yugoslavia after Tito that it appears to have had about Afghanistan in recent times. I regard that as an extremely grave possibility.  Let us look at the situation since the end of World War II. The movement into Afghanistan is the first movement of Soviet troops outside the Iron Curtain since that catastrophy. It has also been done in the context of a vastly changed balance of might between the Soviet Union and the United States. In this respect, I absolutely agree with the assessment of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) of the seriousness of the situation that it is a totally different threat from those we have faced since the Second World War, and for those two reasons. Therefore, it is a matter of very great concern. The Governments response to this is the measured and sober statement of the Prime Minister which is recorded in Hansard and which has been published in the Press. None of the contentions in that statement have been seriously questioned by the Opposition. Most of the Oppositions questioning has been in relation to various interpretations of what the Prime Minister is supposed to have said, various things that are supposed to have been said by him or to him when he was abroad, and the absence of Press comment in certain overseas centres when he was abroad. It is a pretty poor show if this Parliament is going to rely for its judgment of the seriousness of issues or contributions on judgments made by certain journalists in certain foreign places about what our Prime Minister said. I lived in London for many years and during that time I hardly saw anything in the newspapers there about what was happening in Australia. But I did not assume for that reason that nothing that happened here was of importance. The Prime Ministers statement stands; it can be read. It can be challenged and it can be argued; but it is a sober statement. It does not go overboard and in no way could it be matched with the Oppositions response which appears to be based entirely on an assessment of the 1980 political situation in Australia. As evidence of this I quote something that was said in the House the other night by the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson), the chief Opposition Whip, a former minister in the Whitlam Government and a person, I would have thought, of some importance in the Opposition. The honourable member for Hughes said this:","N/A","RESPONSE TO SOVIET INVASION OF AFGHANISTAN","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[13]/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","CARLTON, Jim","DF4","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","I make two comments in respect of that finding. The first is that people were being asked whether they thought athletes should be prevented from going to Moscow. The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ellicott) has said quite categorically that nobody would be prevented from going to Moscow. Therefore, one could say that it is not surprising that a large number of Australians thought that athletes should not be prevented from going to Moscow. But they were not asked the question about an actual boycott of the Olympic Games against any sort of background. Nonetheless, the answers in these public opinon polls obviously had a profound effect on the way the Opposition treated the matter of the 800 people who were killed in Kabul this week, the 90,000odd Soviet troops in Afghanistan, and the potential threat to Yugoslavia following the death of President Tito.  The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) has taken a similar approach to that of the honourable member for Hughes. In a Press statement on 22 January he said:","N/A","RESPONSE TO SOVIET INVASION OF AFGHANISTAN","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[13]/para[6]","N/A","N/A"

Of course, there have been many Olympic Games when there have been conflicts. One could even say that our own Games in Melbourne helped people to forget what had happened in Hungary earlier that year. In that total table of Games which was incorporated there was no case in which the host country for the Games was currently in a state of occupation of another territory and actually killing people at the time.

Is it the normal response of that person to come out and say that there are certain things with which he agrees, such as an effective boycott, and to do nothing about it? At the same time, is it reasonable that he should raise totally unrealistic fears on the part of those who might feel personally affected in order further to undermine the policy of the Government in meeting this crisis? All that the Leader of the Opposition has done is to treat this desperate issue as one purely for the 1980 election politics and to indulge in personal attacks on Ministers to try to divide that nation and to give comfort obviously to those in the Kremlin who in 1974 took a calculated decision about the Games and continue to make a calculated decision on the amount of help that they will receive from people like the Leader of the Opposition.

Because a newspaper such as the Melbourne Age has come out and told the Australian people what the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) did to the Prime Minister he has had today to find some way in which to rally the troops behind him. This is about squeezing the last drop of political blood out of Afghanistan. It is about dividing the nation and dividing the Parliament.

It has not hesitated to use brutal military force, as it did against Hungary and Czechoslovakia when it felt that one of its satellites was taking an independent line. Honourable members should make no mistake about the Oppositions resolve toward the Soviet Union. We hold it in deep, full and abiding contempt. When this recent outrage by the Soviet Union occurred and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) called for embargoes and boycotts, our first reaction was that the Prime Minister really believed what he was saying about the Russians aggression and was prepared to call upon all Australians to make sacrifices. Economic, cultural and sporting embargoes were to be imposed that would be shared equally by the Australian people.

If ever that was brought home to me it was brought home on my recent trip to the United States. I was in Hawaii just before the Prime Minister arrived, and in Los Angeles just before he arrived. I went to Mexico and came back. He had just left. I went to Washington just after he had left and was back in San Francisco. The American people would not have had a clue that he was there. It is not because he is Mr Fraser, although that probably has something to do with it. No Australian Prime Minister would get much coverage in the United States, least of all this one. There was not a word in the media. One would not have known that we were in the country.  When I came back I read the Australian newspapers. One would have thought that only three national leaders in the world were considering the question of Afghanistan President Carter, Mr Brezhnev and Prime Minister Fraser. What a laugh! We just do not rate. We are a very ordinary, middle order power. For our newspapers to present it in this way is, frankly, laughable. We now know that it was done for one reason and one reason only. This Prime Minister needed an issue in order to take the disastrous economic policies of this Government off the front pages. The Prime Minister desperately needed a khaki election. The old faithful foreign affairswas trotted out because it has been such a winner in the past. Government supporters said: Let us repeat the success of the 1950s and 1960s of the Petrov affair; of the 1 963 election and the confrontation with Indonesia, in the course of which we had to rush out and buy all those Fill aircraft; of the 1 966 election; of Harold Holt and the Vietnam election; of the downward thrust of China, a people whom we now find are our staunchest friends and allies. How long ago was it that if a Labor Party member even went near China he was considered a traitor? Now Government supporters are falling over each other trying to rush there. They love the Chinese; they are wonderful people. Recently we had the honourable member for St George (Mr Neil) doing a bit of kite flying for the Government. He was going to have six weeks conscription for every Australian. This is the last throw of the dice as the Government goes down the chute. Unemployment has reached 473,000, Inflation has reached 10 or 11 per cent. Interest rates are up again today. Car sales are down again today. The stock market is falling. For the last week we have been told what great economic managers this mob are. It is a joke. During the debate last week we were fascinated to hear that unless we agreed that this was the greatest crisis since World War II we were traitors. What about the Berlin airlift? Was that a crisis that could have led to World War III? What about Hungary? Was that any different from this crisis? Was not Hungary just as bad? What about the Suez crisis of 1956? Could that not have brought about World War III? What about the Cuban missile crisis? We were told for days that the world teetered on the brink of war. In my view the Cuban missile crisis was a much worse crisis than is the present one. What about the SixDay War of 1967? What about Czechoslovakia in 1968? What about the Yom Kippur War of 1 973? I will agree that the present crisis is one of a series that have occurred but to say that we are wrong when we do not agree with the Government that it is the only crisis is nothing short of absurd. It may be a debating point. We can argue the merits of each crisis, but the arguments that Government supporters put forward last week were patently ludicrous. The whole crunch, the reason why honourable members on this side of the House are so critical of the Government, comes down to three things wool, wheat and rutile. That is why the Australian people now hold the Government in complete contempt. It is happy to boycott the Olympics but not one cent will Government supporters give up from the pockets of its friends and business associates. They say: Oh, no; sell them wool, sell them wheat, sell them rutile. Everyone is talking about wool, but I happen to think that rutile presents the worst case. From rutile comes titanium a low weight high strength material that is used in the construction of jet missiles and planes. Do Government supporters have any understanding of why the Australian people are swinging against them? If they cannot see it, God help them. I have talked about this matter to hundreds of people, most of whom are not Labor supporters. They say that the Government is off its rocker, is not fair dinkum. That is why the polls show that 70 per cent of the people do not agree with the Governments policy. Anyone who questions the gungho rhetoric of this Government on Afghanistan is now to be labelled as a traitor. That is what it amounts to. Let me turn to the subject of the Olympic Games. It comes down to this: The only people to carry the can are the athletes. When the question was raised as to whether the athletes should get compensation for their efforts we were told; Steady, whoa back. We will give the wool growers, the wheat growers and the sand miners compensation if it comes to that, but not people such as young Peter Hadfield who spent $12,000 of his money, with his wife, last year in training. He is about the fifth or sixth in the rankings of decathlon athletes in the world and has a great chance of taking out a gold medal for Australia. He did not even receive an Olympic Games grant, not even a miserable $2,500. 1 repeat, he is one of the finest athletes that this country has ever produced. Will the Government compensate the athletes for the time, effort and money they have expended? I repeat, last year Peter Hadfield spent $12,000 in Europe just to bring glory to this country. So far, the only major nations to withdraw from the Olympic Games have been the United States","N/A","RESPONSE TO SOVIET INVASION OF AFGHANISTAN","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[14]/para[3]","N/A","N/A"

They are the two most powerful winter sporting nations. They took 1 8 of the gold medals in the winter Olympics. No, that did not happen.

Two delegations go there from Australia each year. The fact is that there is an open vote by the Government parties as to their membership of those delegations. I cannot answer for what happens on the other side of the House, but the Government has exerted no influence over the Opposition s membership of those delegations.  This is, of course, not the point that I was making in my speech. I draw the attention of the House to what I said which is recorded at the beginning of page 369 of Hansard.

We assure the Government that people will notice. They have noticed already what is happening in the economy, particularly what is happening to taxation. They will also be well aware that it is an incontrovertible fact that the Fraser Government, which came to office loudly proclaiming its determination to reduce significantly the burden of taxation, has instead greatly increased it. Under Fraser taxes have increased to the highest  Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (MrMillarOrder! The honourable member will address the Prime Minister by his correct title. Under the Fraser Government taxes have increased to the highest level in our history. Furthermore, this overall result has not been achieved by a uniform distribution of the increased tax burden; rather it has been achieved by increasing taxes heavily on low and middle income earners and reducing taxes on high income earners. Under the Fraser Government the poor pay more and the rich pay less. I ask the House to take note of some examples of the Fraser Governments myriad promises to cut taxes.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","WILLIS, Ralph","ZJ4","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","There can be no doubt at all that the Government has repeated often its promise to reduce the general level of taxation, but the opposite clearly has been the case. The tax burden has been very considerably increased. This is undeniably so both in overall terms and at the level of the individual for most Australians. If we look at the Commonwealth tax receipts as a percentage of gross domestic product for the three years of the Labor Government we see that they averaged 22.5 per cent. In the first three years of office of the Fraser Government total Commonwealth tax receipts as a percentage of gross domestic product were 23.4 per cent, which is significantly higher than Labors figures. If one looks at 197980 and uses the Budget estimates the figure becomes 23.8 per cent. Those figures were given to us today by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in answer to a question on notice which I put to him in August of last year.  We can see that Federal taxes under the Fraser Government have been at a notably higher level of gross domestic product than they were under the Labor Government, especially in 197980. They are budgeted to be at the highest level ever. Furthermore the 1 97980 level will be even higher than the budgeted level. This is because oil taxes will be well above Budget estimates as a result of the latest oil price rise, which gives the Government an extra $440m in the second half of 197980. Taking account of this additional revenue and assuming that the Government does not cut taxes in this financial year, total tax receipts as a percentage of gross domestic product in 1 97980 will rise to 24.2 per cent compared to the average for Labor of 22.5 per cent. That is far and away the highest figure in our history. How has this substantial increase in the tax burden occurred under this Government which promised substantial tax cuts? It has come about firstly because of the substantial increase in the burden of income tax, which in turn is attributable to two factors. Broken promises in respect of income tax account for those two factors. The income tax surcharge was a broken promise. It was introduced in November 1978 after the Government had cut taxes for the purposes of the 1977 election. The tax cuts lasted for nine months. In November 1978 a one and a half cents in the dollar surcharge was introduced for that year. This temporary surcharge, as it was described at the time, was continued at a reduced level in this financial year at 1.07 cents in the dollar. Therefore, this broken promise has substantially added to the tax burden. The second broken promise related to tax indexation, which was introduced in 1976 and which was a basic promise of the 1975 election. I wish to quote what Mr Fraser promised in 1975. He said:","Discussion of Matter of Public Importance","TAXATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/para[3]","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","WILLIS, Ralph","ZJ4","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Despite these assurances tax indexation has never been fully introduced by this Government. In 197677 the Government gave us 93 per cent of tax indexation. In 197778 it was 80 per cent. In 197879 it dropped to 35 per cent and in this current year there is no tax indexation at all. Clearly the Government has never fulfilled this promise. It has progressively reduced the extent of indexation until now it has been completely abandoned. Despite assurances to the contrary, the Fraser Government has relied very much on the secret tax of inflation to use its words and has clearly decided against making government honest. The cost of these broken promises is a higher level of income tax overall than ever before in our history. It means that personal income tax receipts as a percentage of gross domestic product have gone from 12 per cent in the three years of Labor to 13.1 per cent for the first three years of the Fraser Government. They will be 13.3 per cent this year. They are going up all the time.  For wage and salary earners in particular there has been a large increase in the tax burden. Net payasyouearn taxes that is, taxes paid by wage and salary earners as a proportion of wages, salaries and supplements paid have gone from 16.3 per cent in the three years of Labor to 18.5 per cent in the three years of the Fraser Government. They will be 19.4 per cent this year according to Budget estimates. They are far above the level set under the Labor Government. These points have all been in general, broad terms, but what does this mean for the individual? What it means is that there has been a substantial increase in the tax burden for almost everyone. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard two tables which deal with the increase in the tax burden over that period. Leave granted. The tables read as follows: I thank the House. These tables show what has happened to the increase in the income tax burden resulting from the Fraser Governments changes to the income tax schedules between 197576 and 197980. The first table deals with taxpayers without dependants. It shows for a person who earned $6,000 in 197576 and had an increase in his pay at the same rate of average weekly earnings over that four year period, which was 46 per cent, that his growth in money tax is 57.8 per cent. The tax of a person who had an income of $50,000 in 197576 and whose income increased by 46 per cent in line with average weekly earnings has gone up by only 36.2 per cent. That is a tremendous difference. There is almost a constant decrease in the growth in the money tax as the income increases. What this means is that the people at the bottom end of the scale for a man who was earning $6,000 in 197576 and who is now earning $8,800 it is $2.36 a week are paying more in tax than they would have been paying under Labors scales. At the top end of the scale, someone who was earning $50,000 a year in 197576 and who is now earning $73,000 is paying $49 a week less than he would have paid under Labors scales. The cutoff point is somewhere around $15,000. Everyone earning below $15,000 who has no dependants is paying more tax than he would have been paying under Labors scales. The same situation applies, with slightly different figures, for taxpayers with a dependent wife and two children, which is covered by the other table which I incorporated in Hansard. These figures show not only that there has been a large increase in the overall income tax burden but also that it has been quite inequitably distributed. The poor pay more and the rich pay less. Additionally, despite higher taxes there are fewer public benefits because of the Fraser Governments cutbacks on public expenditure, especially in regard to health insurance. In 197576 all Australians were entitled to free or near free medical cover. Today they pay many dollars a week for medical insurance. Taxpayers are now being forced to take out medical insurance in the order of $4.20 a week for 100 per cent medical cover for a single person or $8.30 for a family. These figures are like an additional medical tax. They are not paid to the Government, but in comparison with the situation in 1 97576, we can treat them as a tax. They greatly exacerbate the loss of welfare for people when compared with the situation in 197576. Furthermore, although the tax schedules have been made increasingly inequitable, that does not give a true picture of the tax burden at various income levels. The explosion of tax avoidance which has occurred has meant that many high income earners do not even pay the reduced levels of tax imposed on them by the Fraser Government. In 1978 the President of the Taxation Institute of Australia, Mr Pascoe, stated:","Discussion of Matter of Public Importance","TAXATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/para[7]","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","WILLIS, Ralph","ZJ4","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","He is saying that 1977 and 1978 is when tax avoidance became a big business. It was not when Labor was in office, but when this Government was in office. We find that some $400m is outstanding in tax which has been the subject of tax avoidance schemes and $250m is provided in this years Budget for additional loss of revenue through tax avoidance. All this is tax avoidance by high income earners and it means that the high income earners are not even paying the reduced rates of tax which this Government has kindly allowed them to pay if they were to pay their taxes as originally intended. Also there has been a massive increase in petrol taxes. The tax rise on oil has been explosive under the Fraser Government. The crude oil levy has increased from $257m in 197576 to $2.5 billion in 197980, an increase of 875 per cent. When we add on the increased excise on refined petroleum products we find that there has been an increase of a little under a billion dollars in petrol taxes to $3.5 billion in 197980, which is a rise of almost 250 per cent in four years. Petrol taxes have risen from 4Vi per cent of total tax receipts to 9 per cent in this period. Petroleum taxes now raise more revenue than company income tax.  So it is clear that under the Fraser Government every petrol pump has become a tax office. Every cent rise in the price of petrol, because of increased petrol tax, raises almost an additional $200m. This tax is grossly inequitable. A litre of petrol costs the same regardless of income. Whether one is a millionaire or on the minimum wage one pays the same tax. This clearly has contributed to making the tax system less equitable. A large increase in this form of tax has increased the inequity of the tax structure which was already very inequitable. An article which I have not got time to go into and which appeared in the Australian Economic Review of the third quarter of 1979 demonstrated that the tax structure in 197576 was already inequitable in that for the middle 75 per cent of taxpayers it was proportionate if one took into account all taxes, including company tax, and the way that they were paid by people eventually through higher prices. In the middle 75 per cent of taxpayers the proportion of income paid in tax was the same. It was only for the high income levels that it went up. The Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research went on in the Economic Review that I mentioned to make the point that with the changes made by the Fraser Government in income tax, with the inequitable increases in indirect taxes, and with the explosion of tax avoidance, we now had an income tax structure which was regressive. For the main group, which is the middle 75 per cent of taxpayers, the proportion of income paid in tax reduces as income goes up. That would be even more so now than when the Economic Review wrote the article last year because of the additional large increase in petrol taxes which have occurred since that time. What should be done about this? We say, firstly, that the Government should abandon its oil taxing policy, but if it persists with that oil taxing policy the very least it should do is immediately cut taxes as promised by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) earlier this year by the amount of the additional tax the Government has been levying since the end of December through the increased crude oil levy. Such a tax reduction should be made in a way that will offset the highly regressive impact of the crude oil levy. So the Government should cut other indirect taxes or increase subsidies such as health insurance. Of course, the Government is doing the opposite. It has been reducing subsidies for health insurance. Alternatively, if it is going to reduce income tax the greatest percentage reduction should be given to the lowest income groups because they are the people who are paying far more tax under this Government than they were under the Labor Government. There is no guarantee the Government will do any of that, but those are the forms in which we suggest the tax cuts should come. Such measures would do no more than redress the inequity that has resulted from the latest oil tax rise. There is, in addition, a pressing need to restructure the total taxation system so that the burden of taxation is reduced for lower middle income earners, and to ensure that high income earners are made to bear the share of taxation that they have the capacity to pay. The gross inequity of the tax system that has developed under this Government is nothing short of a national scandal and the next Labor government will ensure that equity is restored to the tax system.","Discussion of Matter of Public Importance","TAXATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/para[14]","N/A","N/A"

Nonetheless, there are some problems with the speech of the honourable member for Gellibrand. I would like to deal with a few of them. I am certain that these were not deliberate statements of untruth and I am certain that when I point out to him where he has made mistakes he will recognise those mistakes. For example, for him to say that tax avoidance began under this Government and to quote an authority is a deceptive style of debate which I am unaccustomed to hearing from the honourable member for Gellibrand. I wonder whether he remembers when the Curran affairs began, in what year that matter came before the courts and in what year that decision was handed down. It was the greatest bit of tax deception that the Opposition failed to do anything about. The Labor Treasurer at that time said, We will do something about that naughty, wicked device, and did exactly nothing. That is the record of the Labor Party in tax avoidance and tax evasion and for its members to come into this House and pretend with this holierthanthou attitude that nothing happened in relation to tax evasion until we got into power is straightforwardly nonsensical. The honourable member said that the whole problem of tax avoidance and tax evasion only began he quoted an authority after we came into power. That is arrant nonsense. This Government has done a great deal to correct the three years of idleness of the Opposition when it was in government and when it introduced no major antitax avoidance legislation whatsoever. That they come in and talk that sort of nonsense is disappointing. It is disappointing to hear that from the honourable member for Gellibrand. It is also disappointing to hear from the honourable member for Gellibrand the comment the incorrect comment that the poor are getting a worse deal and the rich are getting a better deal under the present Government.

It is interesting to see the dramatic reductions in the rates of tax that have taken place under this Government because of changes to the Hayden tax scales. The Opposition may say: We would have changed them in the meantime. The Hayden tax scales introduced in 1975 would no longer be in operation. In fact that is patently untrue. The Opposition has fought two elections. In those two elections it had the opportunity to say that it would reduce those tax rates. On both occasions it refused the opportunity. The Labor Party decided that it would not do so. In fact, in the 1977 election a specific statement was made: Not only will we not go along with the LiberalNational Country parties policies on tax reduction, we will also maintain those taxes because we think it is wrong to reduce personal income tax. It said positively that it thought it was wrong to reduce personal income tax. It had another system, a system of mucking around with payroll tax. It was a crazy system which would not have worked. Frankly, for members of the Opposition to come into this House and talk about an excessive level of personal income tax when they have had two opportunities to say that they would reduce it is arrant nonsense.

I am getting it into Hansard for the honourable member, just to demonstrate to the people of Australia that the only line of attack many members of the Opposition can sustain is personal vitriol, abuse on a personal level. We cannot discuss any matter of major importance in this House without personal abuse. Not only is there a consistent policy of personal abuse, but it is personal abuse in the knowledge that that abuse, those insults, those attacks, are totally without foundation, cannot be sustained, are malicious and deliberately untrue, and aimed at denigrating this House as well as the people in it.  It is a determined policy of attack on the principles under which this House is run. It is denigration of the democratic process which is a deliberate and determined policy by some members on the other side who, having found that they cannot achieve their objectives within this House because the public of Australia will not support them, are prepared to go to any lengths whatsoever to achieve those objectives outside this place by denigrating and diminishing the capacity of this House to run the country. There is no doubt that tax cuts are needed. There is always a need for tax cuts. The big question is this: How many governments set about seriously to achieve those tax cuts? Every government is under continual pressure to do things for people. At the same time, every government is under continual pressure not to spend peoples money doing those things. It is interesting to note the different methods of achieving those objectives. How do various governments succeed in holding back tax rises? This is where the basic hypocrisy in this matter of public importance develops. The Opposition refers to the need for tax cuts to relieve the increased burden of taxation that has occurred under the Fraser Government. There has been no government in the history of Australia under which the tax burden has not increased. Not one government in our history has achieved a reduction in taxes because governments are continually doing more and more things. Many people do not support that proposition. They do not want it to happen. In fact, this Government has come under increasing pressure because it has cut back so many of the expensive projects, projects that involved the spending of taxpayers money, that were introduced under the Labor Government. Let us see how successful we have been, when compared with the Labor Government, in cutting back the rate of rise in tax. We can see which Government is serious about it. For example, we can see that the Labor Government had a massive rise in income tax collections while it was in office. In three years there was something like a doubling of total tax collections. That is not just personal income tax but all taxes. There was a doubling of tax collections in only three years. In four years under the present Government that rate has been reduced to only 6 1 per cent. The runs are on the board. There is clear evidence of the dramatic cutback in the rate of rise in tax, remembering that every government that has existed in Australia has increased taxes. What would the Opposition do if it got back into power? Would it continue to increase taxes? Let us face it. It did that when it was in office. The history of it is all too clear. Let me quote what the Leader of the Opposition said in the F. E. Chamberlain lecture on 2 March 1979. This is what he said about what Labor would do with taxes:","Discussion of Matter of Public Importance","TAXATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

As the shadow Minister for the Capital Territory and as the spokesman for the Australian Labor Party on this matter, I welcome the Bill. I also welcomed the announcement by the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Ellicott) some six months ago that there would be an inquiry. That act was laudable. It is pleasing to see that the machinery of this Government is so well oiled that after a mere six months a simple short piece of enabling legislation is ready for debate by the Parliament. Nonetheless, the Bill is now before the House and is subject to scrutiny. Scrutiny of the Bill proves to me that it has been prepared at least if explanations are not forthcoming from the Minister in a very sloppy way indeed. It contains only two important paragraphs, the remainder being consequential or machinery amendments, and it would seem that even the legality of those two paragraphs is open to question.  Amendments to an Act must be within the ambit of the original or principal Act. That ambit is defined by the title of the Act and the title of the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act 1973, as amended, is:","Second Reading","COMMONWEALTH GRANTS COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 1979","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","INNES, Urquhart","KJA","N/A","N/A","N/A","457","I bow to the superior legal knowledge of the Minister. He assures me that this amendment is not necessary. We will simply test the situation during the Committee stage. If we can be assured by the Minister that may well satisfy us. I hope that in the future he will stand by the decision and the information that he has given to the Parliament. As we indicated before, the Act appears to restrict the ambit of the Commission in carrying out its functions visavis the Australian Capital Territory. If that is correct, we would have some criticism of the way in which the legislation was drafted. If this is not the case, perhaps we can be satisfied by an explanation from the Minister.  We also think that the Bill is inadequate not just in substance but in spirit. The Bill proposes that the Commission, upon reference to it by the Minister, be empowered to inquire into matters relating to the financing of works and services within the Capital Territory, with the rider that these works and services must be similar to those provided within the States by State or local government bodies and authorities. This is a much more restrictive form of wording than that empowering the Grants Commission to examine State or Northern Territory finances. But the Opposition accepts that this is largely a necessary result of the fact that the Australian Capital Territory is a nonselfgoverning body. Canberras total finances are gathered together in purely notional accounts. The Australian Capital Territory has no separate budget as such and the elected representatives of the Territory do not control its purse strings. What the Opposition does not accept is that any Grants Commission inquiry into Canberra financing should examine only aspects of that financing related to what are normally State or local government functions. The Australian Capital Territory has a unique place in Australia, containing as it does the national capital. Within the Australian Capital Territory many millions of dollars are spent by the Government to enable Canberra to fulfil its national functions. To look at State and local governmental activities only without examining Commonwealth responsibility towards Canberra is a futile exercise. All are parts of one whole. Should one section not be examined the remainder cannot be seen in perspective. To give a specific example, the Commonwealth Government and its authorities do not pay rates as such within the Australian Capital Territory. They make a contribution to the municipal accounts for general services, water and sewerage services, but these contributions have never been anything but voluntary and remain unchecked so far as being fair or otherwise in the circumstances. The Government pays no general rates for municipal services on its millions of dollars worth of property in the Australian Capital Territory. In lieu thereof the Commonwealth contributes $2.9m towards expenditure on municipal services, This is only 1 1.9 per cent of the estimated expenditure on municipal services. Until this year the Government contribution was just $2m, which was only 9.3 per cent of estimated expenditure. It is questionable in the extreme whether the Government owns only 1 1.9 per cent of rateable value in the Australian Capital Territory, and whether it receives merely 1 1.9 per cent of the worth of the municipal services that are provided in Canberra. Of course the same story applies with water and sewerage rates. Estimated expenditure and receipts on water and sewerage services are calculated and the Commonwealth contributes 15 percent and 14.4 per cent respectively of the expenditure on each budget. Once again, no independent check has been applied to determine whether these ersatz rating procedures are adequate or accurate. In fact, procedures are so poorly organised and dominated by the Federal Government that on the same day as the Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for the Capital Territory announced that there would be a Grants Commission inquiry, he announced also that rates in the Australian Capital Territory would rise, on average, by 14 per cent, an impost of $43 on the average Canberra ratepayer. Under the proposed Bill, any true evaluation of Canberras accounts does not appear likely. The Bill does not give the Grants Commission specific powers to examine Commonwealth finances within the Australian Capital Territory or, indeed, powers to examine Government charges and imposts such as those represented by municipal rates. Similarly, the Commonwealth refuses to add to the notional Australian Capital Territory municipal accounts the 1.75 per cent of income tax receipts which is available throughout the remainder of the nation for local government purposes. Clearly the public funding of the Australian Capital Territory deserves a full and proper inquiry. The parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory called for a Grants Commission inquiry as long ago as 1973. But the wheels of industry grind along ever so slowly. For some years the Canberra Times has been editorialising for just such an inquiry. There has been a lot of public debate about it. People have been pushing for many years to have such an inquiry take place. An inquiry should not be restricted in the sense that it will not deal with the whole ambit of costs to the citizens within the Australian Capital Territory. The Australian Labor Party has sought this inquiry also for many years. Six months after the Minister for the Capital Territory announced that an inquiry would go ahead, the Government now brings forth this enabling legislation restrictive in its sense, as we see it which, in all likelihood, will prevent the wideranging inquiry that is so justified in this situation. For too long the people of Australia have seen Canberra as a city cosseted by governmental activity and unnecessary expenditure. When one considers the national capital purposes of Canberra this claim becomes very doubtful and, in fact, the reverse may be true, should the Government not be contributing its fair share towards the running costs of the city. Only a wideranging public inquiry by the Grants Commission can reach the truth in this matter. Yet this Government appears to be hamstringing the only possibility of such an inquiry. Without an amendment to the Bill that becomes a danger. The possibility of having an inquiry should not be put at risk. I believe that the legislation now before us ought to be withdrawn and redrafted specifically to allow such a wideranging inquiry and also to remedy the omission of the Australian Capital Territory from the title of the Act. Unfortunately the scope of any such inquiry is not just hamstrung by restrictions placed on its terms of reference within the legislation. The legislation proposes that a reference to the Grants Commission may be provided only by the Minister for Administrative Services. Given the nonselfgoverning nature of the Australian Capital Territory, this is an unfortunate but unavoidable state of affairs. The Opposition accepts that as it is the state of affairs that exists at this point in time. However, it is only at the Ministers whim that any inquiry will be wideranging or, indeed, that there will be any inquiry at all. I would hope that the Minister, in reply to what we have said if that is his intention will answer some of the questions that we pose on the ambit of the terms of reference contained in the Bill. I would ask the Minister also to repeat the statement that he made last August that there would be a Grants Commission inquiry into the public financing of the Australian Capital Territory and to give an assurance that that inquiry will have the widest possible terms of reference. I should like him to assure the House also that the inquiry will report before the next Budget. Before the inquiry is convened the terms of reference should be floated for public debate. In my opinion the terms of reference should permit the fullest possible analysis of Commonwealth financing in the Australian Capital Territory. Any inquiry should produce proper accounts for the Territory and determine fair and just Federal subventions to those accounts for the purposes of municipal rates. Should the people of the Territory have to wait it will not be long until the Labor Party is returned to the Treasury bench in this country before a proper inquiry gets under way, then at this point in time the Opposition gives an undertaking that, if there is any restriction, there will be a wideranging debate held in accordance with the principles that I have outlined. There should have been an inquiry some years ago. Certainly it should have occurred before the selfgovernment referendum held in the Territory in 1978. A full examination of Australian Capital Territory finances and the ability of the Territory to generate revenue may well have made a considerable difference to the results of that poll. In that election people voted not knowing what the price of selfgovernment might mean. People and interests friendly to the philosophy of this Government torpedoed selfgovernment for the Australian Capital Territory with specious claims about the impossibility of local self sufficiency. As it is now, any inquiry should report before the next Budget to enable rationalised funding for the Territory to be implemented for the coming financial year. There should never have been an increase in municipal rates on the same day as the Minister announced an inquiry into local finances. There should have been a stay of the announcement by the Minister. In accordance with these principles I give an indication to the Minister that at the Committee stage the Opposition will be moving the amendments that stand in my name. I would be pleased if he would give an explanation as he indicated across the table in the course of my speech in regard to the long title, the status of the Bill without the amendments, and whether or not the Bill in its present form contains the terms of reference and covers the necessary ambit and meaning to carry out wideranging investigations.","Second Reading","COMMONWEALTH GRANTS COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 1979","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[1]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I can appreciate that some of the terms of that speech may be rather narrow but I am encouraged, in looking at the history of the Commission, to remember that it has built up expertise through experience and, in a sense, through the application of case experience in evaluating economic relationships. Having noted what the Commonwealth Grants Commission has been doing since 1933, once it has investigated certain features of the Australian Capital Territory I am confident that it will be doing more in the future rather than less. For example, one could look at a particular paragraph of the Ministers second reading speech and say that it was drawn very narrowly.

I note that he is now leaving it again. The body which is to carry out these investigations has over the years developed a great deal of expertise, expertise that has been quite particular to the functions that it has served. It has also pursued flexibility in what it has done. That was manifest in 1974 when, under continued pressure from States, fuelled often by a deliberate misunderstanding of what it was doing, it changed its whole procedures in such a way that it would not be liable to endemic and consistent misunderstandings. I am confident that when such a body begins to investigate matters in the Australian Capital Territory those investigations, given its expertise, will not simply end there. After all, the Commission comprises people such as Professor Mathews, Mr Lane of the University of Queensland and Mr Justice ElseMitchell, with whom I have clashed in the past. They have developed great expertise and I do not believe that it ought to be ignored.

To what extent will this body, in investigating the references to it on the Territory, just accept the market in the Territory as it is. To what extent will it make judgments as to the market which supports the standard of living? I know that all of these questions will be answered when the Minister for the Capital Territory winds up the debate. He has been sitting at the table agog with excitement and interest, noting every word that has passed across this chamber. (Quorum formed).  In light of the principles which the Commission will bring to its task I ask: Will its investigation of a particular service in the Territory represent just a costbenefit analysis of that service or will it merely look at the service in terms of the principles of cost recovery? They can be very different, as is the case with a number of Commonwealth instrumentalities. The honourable member for Canning (Mr Bungey) is an expert in the cost recovery process for airline operations in Australia, for example. To what extent will a judgment be made as to the effect of the enormous differences between household incomes in the Territory and those of the rest of Australia. The differences can be so enormous that they cannot be simply wished away. For example, household income in the Territory is often 20 per cent and more above that obtaining in other States of Australia. Under those circumstances, to apply principles of cost recovery, without bearing in mind the very different levels of household income would be to miss a great deal. I know that the Minister would be reluctant to give instructions to the Commission, or make precise requests in terms of those principles, but in conversation with its members I hope that he will ask that they be borne in mind. There will undoubtedly be a number of matters of judgment which ought to be considered and not put aside. I ask further: To whom are the charges made? Why ought the charges to be made in respect of the units that would utilise the service? Which generations will bear the charges made? For example, if there were in the Territory a national project which had enormous local spinoff effects, how would the cost recovery process be assessed? I know that it is often said that if there is a national project in the Territory it must be regarded as such, and the spinoff effects which benefit the people of the Territory ought to be totally ignored. To do so would be to be unjust to the people of the rest of Australia and of the Territory itself. Both of those matters should be considered and the Commonwealth Grants Commission especially the one that will be asked to do this work being such an excellent body, will be able to make judgments and the appropriate calculations. If a service which assists private enterprise in the Territory is required and it is made available, how will judgments be made concerning it? For example, some of the Bureau of Statistics services have a particular application to the Territory and can be localised for the benefit of business. That is a service which, in a State, one could never accomplish. For example, an examination of retail trade in an area of a couple of hundred thousand people could never be achieved in Victoria or elsewhere. If a charge is to be made in respect of that, it ought not to be ignored. I have spoken for sufficient time. I merely say in other words that because a decision here is not made only because the Australian Capital Territory has a local authority but is made because it is a national capital, that ought to enter into the calculation as well. I refer the Minister for the Capital Territory to the fourth line of proposed new subsection 16B (2) which states, in part: by the Commonwealth or an authority of the Commonwealth that are of a similar kind to works and services provided, in respect of a State, by the State or an authority of the State, or, in respect of a part of a State . . . To what extent is that restrictive and to what extent would that exclude many of the works and services which exist in the Australian Capital Territory and which also benefit the people? I finish by saying that I am an optimist concerning this matter. I am pleased that the Commonwealth Grants Commission is considering the Australian Capital Territory. I do not know whether its consideration will be as narrow as the Bill intends it to be, but once it has got into the area I hope that its work will be expanded. To that extent it would be to the benefit of Australia. After all, in its consideration of the standard of living and the provision of services in any part of Australia it might accept the market as it is or it might make judgments as to the value of increased production which supports a market. If its consideration is on the former basis it can be very narrow, because the market which supports a standard of living can be very artificial. If it is on the latter basis and if the latter basis is investigated, it would be to the advantage of this House and of the Australian Capital Territory.","Second Reading","COMMONWEALTH GRANTS COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 1979","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[2]/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

The long title of the Principal Act is amended by adding and the financing of the Australian Capital Territory.. (2) Clause 3, page 2, lines 4 and5, omit financing of works and services provided in respect of, substitute receipt and expenditure of public funds within . (3) Clause 3, page 2, proposed section 16b, omit subsection (2), substitute the following subsection: (2) In subsection ( 1 ), receipt and expenditure of public funds includes all aspects of public finance whether of a type normally provided or collected by Commonwealth, State or local governments either together or separately. . . There is no necessity for me to enlarge on what I have said previously during the course of my speech at the second reading stage. In that speech I did state that the Opposition proposed to move an amendment to the long title of the principal Act by adding and financing of the Australian Capital Territory to the long title. The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ellicott) who is sitting at the table has indicated that it would not be necessary. I understand he will make some explanation of this during the Committee stage of the Bill. I am indebted to the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns) for his contribution to the second reading debate. He referred to some of the matters that we envisage could be problems. With those views in mind, we feel that the second reading speech of the Minister clearly did not go to the point of any explanation that would satisfy the Opposition that the terms of reference were wide enough to cover all of the aspects of the finances that are necessary in reference to the Commonwealth Grants Commission to ensure that the finances of the Australian Capital Territory are properly examined and that the people of the Australian Capital Territory will not be in a worse position than their counterparts in other States or Territories. I think that what I have said both now and during the second reading debate will suffice. So we have lost five years although the present Government promised selfgovernment in the leadup to that election and in all subsequent elections except the last one. That is consistent with this Governments record of breaking promises, of course. It failed to eventuate despite promises by previous Ministers, particularly Minister Staley who promised all sorts of things and who, I think, tried very hard to get selfgovernment and to get the Grants Commission to work out some sort of formula for the financing of Canberra. He was let down, of course, by Cabinet and nothing materialised. Instead, the people were treated to a shoddy referendum which the Government knew would be defeated before it embarked on it. It was defeated because of the lack of clarity and precisely because of the failure of the Grants Commission to clarify what the financial arrangements for Canberra would be. The people were afraid of what selfgovernment would mean in financial terms. The Government failed to explain what it meant and the referendum was rejected. It also reflected a lack of confidence in the sincerity of the Government in what it was trying to do. The Government failed to grant selfgovernment and failed to carry out the recommendations of the Joint Committee regarding the Grants Committee and to give people what everybody else in Australia has and is entitled to have selfgovernment and access to the Grants Commission including the people of the Northern Territory. After five years of government by people who treat promises that they make during elections with complete contempt and several ministries later, the people of Canberra do not have selfgovernment. We still limp along with no firm arrangements and with a very ad hoc idea about how the city is to be financed. Of course, decisions are made by ministers and treasurers and prime ministers on local issues and quite often on domestic issues for which they have no direct electoral responsibility. They are not elected by the people of Canberra. Yet they make all sorts of decisions, even local government decisions. This Government has shown itself to have complete disregard for the welfare and viability of the national capital. Instead of having a national capital and seat of government of which we and the nation can be proud, it now suffers a reputation which is a disgrace to any government and is a far cry from a reputation which any national capital and seat of parliament should enjoy. I do not want to list all the shortcomings of the Government and the problems that now confront Canberra, but I will mention a few. Canberra experiences high unemployment. Almost 9,000 people are unemployed or 7.3 per cent which is higher than the national average on yesterdays figures. Thirtysix per cent of the unemployed are in the 1519 age group. The same group comprises only 20 per cent in the national average so the figure is almost twice as high. The building and construction industry has been gutted. The work force has been reduced by half. Apprenticeships have been terminated. The National Capital Development Commissions new works budget is now down to $ 13.7m this year which is an alltime low. It has come down from about $120m. Many major projects have been promised but none has eventuated. There is to be no casino, about which there has been a lot of talk. No new post office has been established although the Australian Post Office has been ready to proceed for a couple of years. There has been no bus interchange and no Casey University. Of course, it is extremely doubtful that that will get under way at all because there is a lot of opposition to it from within the Government itself. The Government has sold off a lot of Government enterprises including the brickworks, the Government sawmill and now, I believe, it is considering selling off the very successful and very profitable Mugga Quarry. The Mugga Quarry has provided building material for nearly all of the main buildings and roads in Canberra. It is a profitable enterprise and, I understand, it is about to be sold off. Public Servants have been subjected to all sorts of intimidation and threats and staff ceilings which have, of course, restricted their opportunities. These Government enterprises would have been retained if we had locally elected people who were responsible to the local people. They would have been retained if they had been paying propositions and would not have been sold off to private enterprise. The Minister has spoken a lot about broadening the base of Canberras economy. This is very commendable. What has he done? How sincere has he been? One small local industry, the egg industry, is now under threat. This week eight people have been sacked because the Minister has failed to increase the egg quota for the Australian Capital Territory. The Minister has been fiddling with this problem for two or three years. He has to come to grips with it. He has to stop this erosion into the few small industries we have and to try to retain the little bit of industrial employment we have in Canberra. I know that he has a difficult problem in this respect but he has been putting it off, hoping it can be resolved. In the meantime, State egg marketing boards have been standing over the Canberra consumers. They are now trying to prevent Canberra producers from producing eggs for Canberra. Although all sorts of commitments were made about increasing the egg quota, it has not happened. I think it is time the Minister did something about it. Hundreds of small businesses and some larger ones have become bankrupt and many others are in severe financial difficulties. The Totalisator Agency Board is in difficulties and this has put pressure on the Canberra Trotting Club Incorporated, the Canberra Greyhound Racing Club Incorporated, the racing clubs and many other sporting enterprises. As I said, this legislation is long overdue. I hope that the Grants Commission will now move quickly to overcome the neglect of the Government in taking so long to come to grips with this quite simple amendment. There has been an unfortunate delay and the people of Canberra have suffered in the meantime. The Grants Commission, for its part, has had five years notice. It knew that it would be required to carry out this task and I hope that it will respond quickly. It will be interesting to see whether the Commission is able to come up with suitable recommendations before this Government is thrown out of office at the end of this year. I might say that if the Grants Commission placed the Australian Capital Territory on a similar footing to the less populous States of the Commonwealth, the Australian Capital Territory would not require any greater subvention than these States if due allowance was for the expenditure in Canberra on the national capital aspects and the seat of government aspects. The Department of the Capital Territory has done a lot of commendable work in separating those charges which can be attributed to the local community and those which can be attributed to the role of Canberra as the seat of government and as the national capital. I should like to give these figures regarding per capita grants: The per capita grant for 197879 for Tasmania, for instance, was $ 1 ,036 per head. If we apply the same per capita grant given to Tasmania and multiply that amount by the population of Canberra that means a subvention of $228m for Canberra. I think it is only fair that the matter be approached in that way. I think we should be given the same access to funds as people in the rest of the Commonwealth. I refer to general revenue grants, capital purpose grants and specific purpose grants. That is the measure of the money that would be made available to Canberra. I hope that the Grants Commission will be able to have a good look at this matter. I hope that it will look very closely at those costs which can be attributed to the national capital and to the seat of government functions of Canberra and then develop a formula so that the administrators of Canberra will know where they stand and will not be just dependent on ad hoc decisions of a particular Minister for the Capital Territory, a particular Treasurer or a particular Prime Minister. There will be a well established formula so that as the population of Canberra grows the grants from the Grants Commission will grow. By that means people will be able to budget on a sound planning basis. They will know where they stand and they will be able to make responsible decisions. That has not been the case in the past.","In Committee","COMMONWEALTH GRANTS COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 1979","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[1]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is a great pity that, for electoral purposes, he is doing this. If he wants to talk about things such as the Totalisator Agency Board, I can tell the people a pretty sorry story. Let us identify the things that are destroying the TAB. One is the competition from the other forms of gambling and the other is the expensive building that the TAB built. Both of those decisions that is, the decision to introduce poker machines without holding a referendum and the decision to build that building were made in the time of the Labor Government. The TAB is in trouble today simply because of those stupid decisions which were made without reference to the effect they would have on the capacity to sustain a TAB in the Australian Capital Territory. As to unemployment, if we look at the Australian Bureau of Statistics figures we will find that since last year unemployment in the Australian Capital Territory has actually fallen. According to the Commonwealth Employment Service figures unemployment has gone up marginally by 200. There is very little reason for the honourable member to complain that disaster is around the place. Disaster is not around the place.  So far as the egg quota is concerned, I have been very active as Minister for the Capital Territory. I do not apologise for any time that has been taken. In the meantime, the honourable member for Fraser apparently has been taking another strange attitude. He has decided to look after private enterprise instead of looking after the consumers of Canberra. He has suddenly become a great champion of the private enterprise sector and has forgotten the fact that the ordinary consumers of Canberra have been getting the advantage of cheap eggs. I should have thought that his function as the member for Fraser was to look after those consumers who elected him. However he can rest assured that private enterprise, in the form of Parkwood Eggs Pty Ltd, is very secure in the Australian Capital Territory. Decisions which that company makes to put people off have nothing to do with egg quotas. They must have something to do with something else. On my understanding Parkwood Eggs is increasing the number of birds in its sheds so the honourable member should not tell me that the sackings are a result of the egg quota. The difficulty that we face in that area is well known. It is a difficulty with which I am dealing.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","ELLICOTT, Bob","YF6","N/A","N/A","N/A","464","It is important. We are debating the Commonwealth Grants Commission Amendment Bill. May I say first of all that the Government has not treated these amendments in other than a proper fashion. We have taken them up with Parliamentary Counsel. Parliamentay Counsel assures us that it would not be appropriate to amend the title by adding the words and the financing of the Australian Capital Territory. On no construction is the Bill doing that. It is not financing the Australian Capital Territory; it is only authorising an inquiry. Parliamentary Counsel has informed the instructing officers that it is not necessary to make that amendment. As to the other two amendments proposed by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes), Parliamentary Counsel again says that if those amendments were made they would have the effect of limiting the inquiries that could be undertaken under the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act. It is not intended to make the inquiry a restrictive one. Just how far the inquiry can go into such matters as national buildings is a matter for determination on the basis of the definition in that subsection which talks about services and works provided by States or local government.  Let us take the case of the National Library. In saying this I answer in part the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns). No doubt if some part of the National Library provides a service to the Australian Capital Territory, that is a service which may be provided by a State and to that extent it could be taken into account. Really, the sorts of issues that the honourable member for Lilley raised are matters which can be undertaken in the ordinary course, depending on the extent of the inquiry on particular matters that is submitted by the Minister of the day to the Grants Commission. Parliamentary Counsel says that if we accepted the Oppositions proposed amendments they would have the effect of limiting the inquiry rather than extending it. The words matters relating to the financing of works and services provided in respect of the Australian Capital Territory,  are very wide. I know that the definition is there but the words matters relating to the financing of works are very wide. A lot could be taken into account from them. What really is important, of course, is the width of the reference which the Minister puts in.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","KLUGMAN, Dick","SH4","Prospect","N/A","N/A","465","Before starting the debate on the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Amendment Bill I think it is appropriate to point out why the Opposition opposed the motion to negative the adjournment tonight. The Government brought in a frivolous motion this afternoon, spent a lot of time on it and then tried to avoid an adjournment debate when private members have a chance to raise issues. As long as the Government does that we will oppose the motion which negatives the adjournment. The Government introduced this legislation in about October last year. The Opposition supports the amendments contained in the legislation. It may be appropriate to remind the House that the basic aim of the Bill is to bring about amendments which were recommended by an inquiry which was called the ReidNossal inquiry into the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. The report of the inquiry was tabled in this House in May 1978 and, basically, the Government has accepted the recommendations in this report.  For those of us who have followed the question of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories it has been an issue for some time, as to just what the Laboratories could do, what functions they could perform and how they could improve their function. The principal amendments to the Act have the effect of expanding the role of CSL to enable it to produce nonbiological as well as biological pharmaceutical products. I suppose that has been the main issue. The Bill clearly distinguishes between the commercial activities of CSL and the socalled national interest activities, that is those carried out at the direction of the Minister with the Commonwealth meeting the costs of these national interest functions. Until now the profit which CSL made in its commercial activities had to be used to cover the national interest activities and there was never any money left for expansion. It allows an increase in the number of commissioners and makes a number of machinery amendments. Ever since I have been in this House other people have made the point that there ought to be a removal of the biological restrictions on CSL and the ReidNossal report recommended along those lines. There are a number of reasons for this. One of them is the lack of scientific precision in classifying certain products as biological and nonbiological. There are substances such as hormones and so on which do not easily fit into one or the other category. Just as importantly there are many biological and nonbiological products which have very similar therapeutic goals and CSL should have the freedom to produce the most effective product. It does not have this freedom at the present time. The new legislation certainly helps CSL. It does, of course, mean that CSL could, in theory, go into the production of any therapeutic goods and therapeutic products. The legislation provides that CSL can engage only in commercial activities in relation to pharmaceutical products on the basis that a regulation must be tabled in Parliament and Parliament could disallow that particular regulation. One of the reasons why the previous Minister has looked kindly on CSL is because of the production of the publication called Inside CSL. The last issue that I have seen is the September/October issue. It is a four page collection of photographs of the Minister. Only five of them are in this particular issue. But 1.2 photographs per page is not a bad average. It certainly helped CSL in its success in persuading the Government to take the appropriate course. I congratulate CSL on this. I suppose CSL will now have to have five photographs of the present Minister in the next issue of Inside CSL. One of the points that ought to be made is the related question of the Fawnmac group of companies which was purchased by the then Whitlam Government when the honourable member for Capricornia (Dr Everingham) was the Minister for Health. The Fawnmac group of companies is now up for tender. The Government has said that it will sell it. I understand that one of the tenderers for Fawnmac is in fact CSL. I hope that the Government will look at the tender from CSL and look at the basic advantages, if any, of acquiring Fawnmac and keeping it under government control.","Second Reading","COMMONWEALTH SERUM LABORATORIES AMENDMENT BILL 1979","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","KLUGMAN, Dick","SH4","N/A","N/A","N/A","466","If the honourable member for Isaacs asks at Question Time tomorrow, I will be pleased to answer. One of the reasons for the purchase of Fawnmac by the Government was to produce some competition in the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry in Australia and to enable the Government to have access to certain figures and information which was previously available only to the private pharmaceutical companies. The question of pharmaceutical manufacturing is an important one. Those who have taken some interest I am sure that the honourable member for Isaacs has not will be aware of the socalled Ralph report which was tabled in this House about three or four months ago. It followed an inquiry which was set up by the Department of Health or the Minister for Health and the Ministry for Industry and Commerce. It made some very valuable observations and it made a lot of recommendations which would significantly alter the method of selling pharmaceutical products in Australia. I hope the Government will come back with some recommendations or some reply or response to the Ralph report very soon so that we will be able to see just what we can look forward to if this Government were returned to office in regard to pharmaceutical manufacturing and the distribution of pharmaceutical products.  I think it is fair to say that in the last few years, whilst the pharmaceutical manufacturing companies have made a lot of money they made huge profits in the 1950s and 1960s those profits have gone down. The pharmaceutical manufacturing industry is a very important industry as far as Australia is concerned. Even now, having been run down, it employs a significant number of people something approaching 10,000 people. About 13,000 to 15,000 people were employed in the industry before. We are ideally situated with technology and the technical know how which is available in Australia a large number of people have gone through universities and so on to be pharmaceutical manufacturers for a large area in South East Asia and in the Pacific area. We have not been able to take up the challenge, so to speak, to provide these pharmaceuticals for those areas. There are a number of reasons for that. I do not want to go into them at this time tonight but I do think that the Government ought to be looking sympathetically at expanding the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry in Australia. As I said a few moments ago, it is an important industry. There was a lot of prejudice against it, and I think some of that prejudice is still justified in relation to some of the pharmaceutical manufacturers. However, I do not think their profits now are anywhere near the excessive levels that existed in the 1960s. If we want the industry to continue, if we want to employ people in Australia, and we are always looking for industries which will absorb our school leavers and so on, we ought to be looking at this sort of industry which requires highly skilled technical people. I commend the Bill to the House as a step towards ensuring the continuation of CSL as a commercially viable institution.","Second Reading","COMMONWEALTH SERUM LABORATORIES AMENDMENT BILL 1979","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[1]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","LLOYD, Bruce","2E4","Murray","N/A","N/A","466","The Bill to amend the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Act has been long awaited by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories management and Commission and has been achieved only after years of constructive lobbying and independent inquiry. I note from the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) the support of the Opposition for the amendments before us. I believe that everyone in the Parliament supports the need for CSL. However, doubts have been expressed from time to time by many people about the request by CSL to be allowed an expanded role because it could be impinging on the commercial pharmaceutical market, which should be left to the private sector. This doubt, and the need to resolve the issue of the biological products restriction, led to an independent inquiry being established by the then Minister for Health in October 1977.  The inquiry also provided the opportunity to examine several other problems raised by CSL and others about the financing and structure of the CSL organisation. The Minister was fortunate to obtain the services of two outstanding Australians, Sir Gustav Nossal and Mr John Reid. Their backgrounds in medical research and industry produced a nice balance in philosophy and expertise. They were also prompt with their report. The Government members health and welfare committee took considerable interest in the report and on two separate occasions discussed the recommendations at length with the two inquiry members. On behalf of the health and welfare committee, I wish to record our appreciation for the courtesy they extended to us. The committee made certain recommendations to the Minister and to the Government on the ReidNossal recommendations. How does the legislation we are discussing follow the recommendations of Reid and Nossal? Recommendation three, which is the inquirys major recommendation, is to remove the biological restriction. The Government members committee was impressed by the arguments put forward that the now outdated and restrictive concepts in 19a, the biological restriction concept, should be removed. The health and welfare committee has been assured on a number of occasions by Dr Neville McCarthy of CSL that that organisation does not intend suddenly and massively to enter the general pharmaceutical market. Nevertheless, the committee recommended that any intended pharmaceutical product be prescribed and thus subject to parliamentary scrutiny. This is really nothing more than the 1961 legislation provided because 19A in that legislation also has the prescribed restriction. However, the committee has been further reassured by the words of the previous Minister for Health, now the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt), who said in his second reading speech:","Second Reading","COMMONWEALTH SERUM LABORATORIES AMENDMENT BILL 1979","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","LLOYD, Bruce","2E4","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","The second major amendment relates to their recommendation on 19A and 19B, that is, that the research and finance activities, including those done in the national interest, should be clearly distinguished. Everyone who has been associated with this CSL issue will be pleased that the new legislation clearly distinguishes between those two; that is, between the commercial or 19A activities and the national interest or 19B activities, that the determination or distinction will be made by the Minister, and that, where it is a 19B activity, it will be financed by the Government. Reid and Nossal also recommended that the DirectorGeneral of Health should make the determination on the national interest. The health and welfare committee considered that the Minister rather than the DirectorGeneral should make the determination as this was more in keeping with ministerial responsibility and parliamentary accountability. I am pleased that in this legislation we have provided for ministerial determination. The CSL management believes that the distinction between the commercial and national interest activities that has now been arranged is more rational and will make CSL a more commercially oriented organisation. The previous arrangement was a significant disincentive against CSLs maximising profit. With the change, it will be possible for CSL to obtain its capital for commercial activities in the loan market.  Recommendation 2 1 of Reid and Nossal was that CSL should adhere to the code of good manufacturing practice. A check with the National Biological Standards Laboratory has confirmed that CSL has now been included. Recommendation 32 refers to the lack of cooperation between CSL and those responsible for the construction of the Australian National Animal Health Laboratory, or ANAHL, at Geelong. CSL has expertise in the production of vaccines, including foot and mouth disease vaccines, which of course is the major purpose of the Geelong laboratory. I understand that two of its experts are returning from Indonesia, where they have helped to establish a production facility for foot and mouth disease vaccine. I understand also that there is now good cooperation on this question between the two organisations. Recommendation 35 refers to additional commissioners, and to doubling the number of commissioners from four to eight. Reid and Nossal also recommended increasing the number of commissioners, and the recommendation has been accepted because it will provide better geographic representation. The health and welfare committee agreed with the increase, but added that this provided an opportunity to allow additional expertise as well as geographic representation. There are other amendments following on from the ReidNossal recommendations which relate to the Governments accepting the cost of foreign aid, parts of CSL work, and updating the contract amounts the CSL management can accept. To conclude, I want to reiterate the support of the Government members health and welfare committee for these amendments, which are overdue. I want also to record that this Bill is a good example of a case being made for change, of a well conducted independent inquiry, of adequate consultation, of scrutiny of a report by members of Parliament and now the passage of amending legislation with the support of both sides of the Parliament. Question resolved in the affirmative.
