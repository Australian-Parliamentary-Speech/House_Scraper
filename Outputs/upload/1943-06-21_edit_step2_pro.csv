The name of John McNeill will, however, be remembered most by the workers of this country for his zealous and untiring labours on behalf of the principles and ideals of the trade union movement, of which he was both a pioneer and a leader. He gave his life to this work, and the results of his efforts still live on. To the Australian Workers Union, of which he was general president and also secretary of the New South Wales branch, he gave almost a lifetime of service, and to it, as well as to the nation generally, his death is a severe loss. We extend to his widow and family our deepest sympathy in the irreparable loss of one who, by his sterling character, won the affection of all who knew him.","N/A","N/A","/hansard/chamber.xscript/business.start/para[8]","N/A","N/A"

He was characterized by the highest degree of integrity, and I venture tobelieve that his name will endure in the industrial history of this country for many decades. He played a foundational part in the development of the great Labour movement -of Australia. He championed always the rights of the bottom dog, but he stood loyally by the principle of conciliation and arbitration, believing that if just claims were fairly stated the impartial consideration of them would result in an increasing measure of justice being accorded , to the masses on whose behalf he pleaded. It was my humble privilege, at the first conference that I attended in any capacity in my association with the Labour movement, to sit next to John McNeill. At the time, I was very young; in fact, I was not quite 21 years of age. He helped me very greatly on that day, and all through the years that have since elapsed I have been his debtor. I pay tribute to the work of a great Australian, in thebelief that his memory will endure.","N/A","N/A","/hansard/chamber.xscript/business.start/para[9]","N/A","N/A"
