4,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"LYONS, Joseph Aloysius","F4O","Wilmot","UAP","Prime Minister",532,"- by leave - It is with very great regret that I refer to the death of the Honorable John Barnes, which occurred in Melbourne on the. 31st January last.John Barnes had a long and honorable parliamentary career. He was elected to the Senate for the State of Victoria at the general elections of 1913 and 1914. Defeated at the general elections of 1919, he was again elected to the Senate at the general elections of 1922 and 1928, holding his seat until the 30th June, 1935. He was again successful at the general elections on the 23rd October last, and was due to take his seat in the Senate on the 1st July, 1938. He attained Ministerial office in the Scullin Government, being Assistant Minister for Works and Railways from the 22nd October, 1929, to the 3rd March, 1931, and Vice-President of the Executive Council from that date to the 6th January, 1932.John Barnes was a close persona! friend of mine. He was a very sincere man, and a lovable personality. To know him well was indeed a privilege. His absolute integrity and personal worth were reflected in his wide circle of friends throughout the Commonwealth, and it is a tribute to the, character of the man that many of his staunchest personal friends were those who did not have his industrial or political outlook. His successes in the industrial and parliamentary spheres were not easily won. His life was one of very hard work, and his occupancy of high executivepositions in the Australian Workers Union over a period of many years was an indication of the value placed upon the work done by him in the interests of that organization and its members. His parliamentary and Ministerial career was characterized by earnestness and common sense. He never failed to uphold vigorously the interests he was elected to serve, but due to the tolerance of his outlook his views carried much force in the Senate.Already the short history of Australia has produced some men whose memory is cherished because of their sterling personal qualities, and amongst those names the future will place that of John Barnes. He was, in every sense, a big Australian - big physically, big in his outlook, big in his tolerance and human understanding. Pettiness had no place in his make-up. Instead, he possessed a warm heart and a generous spirit, which made him tolerant of the weaknesses of character he so often met in others. The bitter word never passed his lips. He seemed to be incapable of hurting others. He was, in short, a Christian gentleman. Yet he was a hard fighter for the cause in which he believed, and, what is more, a hard and an uncompromising fighter for Australia. Whether his opponents agreed with bini or not, they never doubted that he was always actuated by motives which were aimed at his countrys advancement. His death removes from Australian public life a. figure which we can ill afford to lose. To the people of this country, particularly the young people, I commend the life of John Barnes as an example of devotion to high ideals of personal and public behaviour.A particularly sad feature of his death was that, after having successfully contested the last general elections, he was not spared to enjoy the fruits of his victory.I trust that it will be some consolation to Mrs. Barnes and family to know of the very high esteem in which her husband and their father was held in the public life of this country. We extend to them the sympathy of this House in their bereavement. I move -That this House expresses its deep regret at the death of Senator-elect the Honorable John Humes, u former member of the Senate and Commonwealth Minister, places on record its :i appreciation of his meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to ais widow and family in their bereavement.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HON.

He was a very remarkable man, whose personality not only was striking, but also had in it that quality which won respect for himself, and also gained a great deal of support for the views that he held. The members of .this Parliament will miss him very much. Those of them who sit on this side of the House mourn the death, not only of a loyal colleague and a warm personal friend, but also, of one who to the younger members of the Labour party was a guide and, in tunny respects, a philosopher. He knew Australia. He knew not only its metropolises, but also its great open spaces.Wherever he bad lived in the past ho not only made friends, but also obviously must have learned wisdom, for, as the Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons) has said, he was a. man of immense common sense who also held very high ideals. Ha linked a practical purpose with a far-off goal. That goal can be well stated a3  the advancement of Australia. His association with the Australian Workers Union was one which gave to him service in that organization from what we may describe as its most bumble offices to the most exalted office that it had to offer to any of its members. He was a shearer, a shearers representative, a district secretary, and a delegate to its very important conventions and was always present when important decisions were reached. For many years he had been its general president, and for no office that he contested in that organization was he defeated. The high regard which the workers of Victoria entertained for him can be appreciated when I say that he never suffered defeat in any p re-selection ballot in which he was a candidate. He was a picturesque personality as well. I think we may say that, in every sense of the word, he was a great Australian. I sincerely hope that we who mourn him today may be able to contribute something towards the realization of those purposes for which he worked, and in that way give continuance to his own career.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HON.

They will not be refused.In recent months several important developments in the international situation have focussed public attention to an increasing degree on foreign affairs, and I wish, for the information of honorable members, to review certain of those recent developments.First, I propose to deal with the circumstances of the resignation from the British Cabinet of Mr. Eden, the late Foreign Secretary in Great Britain. Honorable members will recollect that the immediate cause of Mr. Edens resignation was the difference of opinion which had arisen between himself and his Cabinet colleagues as to whether official conversations should at once be opened by the British Government with the Italian Government. Mr. Eden held the view that these conversations should not be begun unless three conditions precedent were fulfilled, namely, the cessation of Italian propaganda of an antiBritish character in the Near East, the withdrawal of some of the Italian troops in Libya, and the conclusion of a satis factory agreement as to the withdrawal of foreign volunteers from Spain. The view taken by Mr. Chamberlain and other members of his Cabinet was that the seriousnessof the European situation was such, that unless an immediate move was made by Great Britain to alleviate it, the inevitable result might well be serious.At the time of Mr. Edens resignation, there was certain criticism to the effect that there had been a substantial change of British foreign policy, especially in respect of the League of Nations, without the dominions having been consulted. As to the alleged reversal of foreign policy, Mr. Chamberlain said in the House of Commons on the 21st February, that his foreign policy was based on three principles -The protection of British lives and interests.The maintenance of peace and the settlement of differences peacefully and not by force, andThe promotion of friendly relations with other nations who were willing to reciprocate and keep the rules of international conduct without which there could be neither security nor stability.It will be remembered that representatives of Empire governments at the 1937 Imperial Conference expressed the desire to base their policies on the aims and ideals of the League of Nations. The Commonwealth Government believes that the principles of British foreign policy outlined by Mr. Chamberlain are in effect an expression of the essential aims and ideals of the League and in no way in conflict with them. Further, the Imperial Conference in 1937 registered the view that differences of political creed should be no obstacle to friendly relations between governments and countries, and that nothing would be more damaging to the hopes of international appeasement than the division, real or apparent, of the world into opposing groups. The recent approach made by Great Britain to Italy with a view to alleviating strained relations in no way represents a departure from the resolutions adopted at the Imperial Conference.It was alleged at the time that the British Government had departed from its former policy of supporting the League of Nations, based, apparently, on the statement by Mr. Chamberlain that the League as at present constituted was unable to provide collective security for its members. In making that statement, he merely recognized a state of fact which unfortunately cannot be denied. The present weakness of the League in dealing with international questions has been widely recognized by the various States Members in their submission, of proposals for the reform of the Covenant; and Mr. Eden himself said, at the council meeting on the 26th January, that we were compelled regretfully to recognize the fact that by the defection of some of its more important members, the area of league co-operation was restricted, and its ability to fulfil the functions originally contemplated for it thereby seriously reduced.A perusal of various speeches recently made by Mr. Chamberlain and other members of the Government of the United Kingdom, clearly shows that there is no intention whatever of withdrawing support from the League of Nations. Mr. Chamberlain claims that he has served the best interests of the League by taking a realistic view of its present ability to discharge the tasks originally imposed upon it, and that it is dangerous and misleading to small and weak countries to continue to pretend that the League, with the defection of some of its most powerful members, is to-day an effective instrument for collective security.T.u order to be in a position to confirm the belief of the Commonwealth Government that the Government of the United Kingdom had not abandoned its support of the League, I communicated with Mr. Chamberlain on the 6th March, - am i obtained his authority to state that the British Government still adhered io the policy which had been adopted by members of the British Commonwealth of Nations at the Imperial Conference in 1937, and that, in particular, there had been no change in principle in the attitude of the British Government towards the League of Nations and collective security.The Commonwealth Government has, for its part, never deviated from its support of League principles. It stands firmly by the statement of League support arrived at at the 1937 Imperial Conference. It feels that the League still remains the best means of striving to give effect to the principles of international co-operation, and its faith in the aims and ideals which originally inspired the League remains unshaken.With regard to the question of consultation between the dominion governments and the British Government at the time of Mr. Edens resignation, as there had been no change in the fundamental aims and objects of British foreign policy, it was unnecessary formally to consult the dominions on what was purely a domestic matter concerning a difference as to time and method for the conduct of certain negotiations. Had there been a major change of foreign .policy, it would have been necessary, of course, that the Government of the United Kingdom should consult with the dominions. I should like to say that, throughout the whole of this period, the Commonwealth Government was kept fully informed of all the international developments, and on the attitude towards them of the British Government. I should like here to refer to the last words of a telegram I sent to the British Prime Minister early in February: -We agree that the present situation calls for action, and we feel that the re-opening nf conversations with Italy is of the utmost importance. I should he glad if you would continue to keep hie fully advised as to the situation.The events which culminated in the absorption of Austria by Germany are generally well known to honorable members but there arc certain aspects in connexion with them which I should mention. In view of the agreement reached between Austria and Germany in July 1936, the rapid march of events which led to the elimination of an old established European State came as a shock to world opinion. These occurrences aTe of great interest to all countries - even to those that are not directly concerned - and it was inevitable that Austrias absorption by Germany should have created alarm and tension, and a fear that similar methods, if adopted elsewhere, might lead to serious consequences. This anxiety applied particularly to the future of Czechoslovakia.The tension was lessened when Great Britain announced that assurances had been received from Germany that the independence and integrity of Czechoslovakia would be respected. I may add that Great Britain is at the moment using its best efforts -to ensure appeasement. On the 24th March, Mr. Chamberlain, in a notable speech in the House of Commons, reviewed in detail the foreign policy of the Government of the United Kingdom. He began by stating that recent events in Austria had resulted in a profound disturbance of international confidence. He then outlined the existing commitments of the Government of the United Kingdom which were: First,, the defence of France and Belgium against unprovoked aggression, and secondly, the treaty obligations which  had been entered into with Portugal, Iraq and Egypt. In addition to those defence commitments in relation to particular countries, Mr. Chamberlain stated that British armaments might also be used to bring help to a victim of aggression in a case arising under the Covenant of the League of Nations. There was no automatic obligation to take military action in such cases, but it was not to be thought that the British Government would, in no circumstances, intervene as a member of the League of Nations in order to restore peace or to maintain international order.Mr. Chamberlain stated that the Government of the United Kingdom was not prepared to declare its readiness to guarantee the independence of Czechoslovakia, but he pointed out that the inexorable pressure of facts might well prove more powerful than any formal pronouncement,, and that a dispute in Central Europe might involve countries which were not originally parties to such a dispute. He added that, so far as Czechoslovakia was concerned, now was the time to enlist all the resources of diplomacy in the cause of peace.Before this speech was delivered the Commonwealth Government was apprised of its contents, and I made a public statement to the effect that I felt that the majority of the people of Australia would approve of the policy outlined by Mr. Chamberlain, and that the Commonwealth Government was, on all vital points, in agreement with the statement.I turn now to the Anglo-Italian Agreement which was signed on the 16th April. Honorable members will, I am sure, agree with me that any move must be welcome which has for its object the alleviation of international tension. The general aim of the Anglo-Italian Agreement was to re-establish on a firm basis the traditional friendship which, until the last few years, had existed between the British and the Italian peoples. I need hardly remind -the House that Australia will welcome the improvement in the relations between Great Britain and Italy which, it is confidently expected, will result from the Agreement. It will be noted that although the Agreement was signed on the 16th April, it will not come into operation immediately, as the Government of the United Kingdom regards a settlement of the Spanish foreign volunteer question as a pre-requisite of the Agreement taking effect. In addition, the subject of the recognition of Italian sovereignty over Ethiopia remains to be settled. The Government of the United Kingdom, however, has taken the necessary steps to have the position of Ethiopia brought before the League Council when it meets on the 9th May. It regards it as an anomalous situation that many States Members of the League, including no fewer than five of those represented on the Council, should recognize that the Italian Government exercises sovereignty over Abyssinia, while others, including Great Britain, have not done so.The terms of the Anglo-Italian Agreement were fully reported in the Press, and I need only refer to certain provi-sions of particular interest relating to Spain, Libya and the Suez Canal.Intervention in Spain has long been regarded as one pf the major causes of European tension, and some uneasiness has been felt as to the objectives of Italian policy in the event of a victory by General Franco. Any permanent occupation of Spanish territory or the acquisition of territorial and other rights by Italy would have seriously disturbed both Great Britain and France by creating a sense of insecurity regarding theirMediterranean communications. Italy has, however, given an assurance that it has no territorial or political aim, and seeks no privileged economic position, in regard to any Spanish territory, and has no intention of keeping any armed forces in Spain at the termination of the civil war.Another subject which has given rise to anxiety has been the great increase of the Italian garrison in Libya during the last eighteen months. As Libya adjoins Egypt, it will be appreciated that anxiety arose in the minds of the Egyptian Government as to the reason for such a concentration. Italy has now agreed to reduce the Italian forces there to about half their present strength, and, as a symbolic gesture, is now withdrawing about 1,000 men every week.An item of importance to Italy was the re-affirmation by the Government of the United Kingdom of the Convention of 1858 by which liberty of transit through the Suez Canal was guaranteed to all nations. With a large overseas territory to administer, the freedom of the Suez Canal is of great importance to Italy in the maintenance of its communications. There is no need to emphasise the importance to Australia of these guarantees, for they concern an essential artery between Australia and its principal markets.In the Sino-Japanese conflict, hostilities continue to be concentrated in southern Shantung. Meanwhile the Government of the United Kingdom has continued to seek from the Japanese Government the maximum assurances for the preservation of British interests. Local problems in Shanghai are dealt with largely by negotiations with the Japanese authorities in that area. The long-standing question of the customs administration is still the subject of discussion with the Japanese Government. The British Ambassador in Tokyo has recently had occasion also to draw the attention of that Government to the discrimination still being exercised against British vessels and British trade on the Yangtse River, as well as to certain regrettable incidents at Shanghai.My next reference is to the situation in Spain. The latest information is that the operations commenced by the anti-Government forces in the province of Aragon some six weeks ago have so far resulted in their reaching the Mediterranean coast and severing the province of Catalonia from the remainder of the territory held by the Government. The anti-Government forces have also occupied a large part of the Pyrenean frontier region and many Government supporters have crossed the border into France. The effect of this rapid advance by the anti-Government armies has been to bring about a certain measure of unity among those political parties supporting the Government at Barcelona. The attitude of the Commonwealth Government, which is one of strict neutrality and adherence to the policy of non-intervention in the internal disputes of another country, remains unchanged. The policy of non-intervention, despite repeated infringements, has, it is felt, prevented the development of the Spanish war into a major European conflagration. Honorable members will, L am sure, approve of the recent action of the Government in allocating an amount of £3,000 for the relief of victims of the Spanish war, on the understanding that the action taken for such alleviation is international in character, and that war victims of both sides are to be assisted.Honorable members will have read with satisfaction of the ratification of an agreement between His Majestys Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of Eire. The Commonwealth Government is confident that this agreement will strengthen considerably the feelings of friendly understanding between the peoples of Great Britain and of Eire, and also that it will be welcomed by all other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.Honorable members will have noted recent references in the press to conversations between Great Britain and the United States of America in regard to Canton and Enderbury Islands. These islands, which form part of the Phoenix Group in the mid-Pacific, are of importance as potential air bases in any transPacific air services. Sovereignty has been claimed by both Great Britain and the United States of America. The Commonwealth Government has been kept fully informed of the course of the conversations and has cabled the Government of the United Kingdom to the effect that, apart from the question of sovereignty, it desires to be associated with that Government in negotiations whereby rights to landing grounds and full air facilities shall be safeguarded to the British Empire. It is understood that negotiations for a friendly settlement are well advanced.The friendly relations existing between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of the Netherlands are evidencedby the recent visit of His Excellency the Governor-General, Lord Gowrie, to the Netherlands East Indies during his journey to England on leave of absence. The Commonwealth Government desires to express its deep appreciation of the hospitality extended to Lord Gowrie during his stay in that country. I desire to inform honorable members that the visit of His Excellency to the Netherlands East Indies had no political or military significance whatever, but was merely a neighbourly courtesy call paid by the representative of His Majesty in the Commonwealth of Australia at the invitation of the Dutch Government, through whose territories he was passing en route.","N/A","INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS: PAPER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[2]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Such statements are entirely untrue. That is why I deny them here.In conclusion, I wish to say that, although a decrease of tension in the international situation is noticeable at the moment, there is still cause for anxiety.In view of developments which have taken place, the British Government has decided that it is necessary to revise the British defence policy, and to accelerate the various programmes. The Commonwealth Government is in accord with this decision, and also feels it imperative that measures to bring Australian defences to a level commensurate with national security should be proceeded with as rapidly as possible.In order that, as desired by honorable members, a discussion may occur on the subjects to which I have referred, I lay on the table the following paper : -Recent Developments in Foreign Affairs - Ministerial Statement. and move -That the paper be printed.On an early occasion, opportunity will be given to members generally to thoroughly discuss international affairs.","N/A","INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS: PAPER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[2]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
39,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CURTIN, John","009FQ","Fremantle","N/A","N/A",539,".- Ordinarily, after the making of such a statement as that to which we have just listened, I should move  that the debate be now adjourned; but I feel that if I take that action on this occasion it will be the end of the matter, for legislation arising out of this statement will be placed before the House by the Government before honorable members have had an opportunity to consider the data which the Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons) has just made available to us. In the speeches which he has recently broadcast, the Prime Minister has said that, in view of developments which have taken place recently in international relationships, it has become necessary for the Commonwealth Government to frame a greatly enlarged policy for national defence. In the statement which the right honorable gentleman has just made, he has repeated those sentiments. He has said -In view of the developments which have taken place, the British Government has decided that it is necessary to revise the British defence policy and to accelerate the various programmes. The Commonwealth Government is in accord with this decision and also feels it imperative that measures to bring Australian defences to a level commensurate with national security should be proceeded with as rapidly as possible.In these circumstances, the logical thing for this Parliament to do is to debate the statement of the Prime Minister before proceeding to consider an enlargement of the provision already made for national defence. It may be that Parliament, after discussion, may come to the view that the international situation, from the aspect of Australia, has not deteriorated since it made adequate financial provision, four months ago, on the advice of this Government, to ensure Australias safety. As a matter of fact, in the last week that it sat, this Parliament gave the Government the requisite legislative authority to do all the things that it believed to be necessary to ensure Australias safety. This being so, the statement that the Prime,, Minister has just made should be examined to enable us to decide whether, during the last four months, developments have occurred throughout the world which render it necessary that this Parliament should say that the state of world relations * which existed at the end of last .November has deteriorated so grievously that the measures taken at that time, in accordance with the policy of the Government, now appear to be inadequate for the safety of Australia. It has to be borne in mind that the financial provision which we did make represented a considerable increase over that of previous years. I ask myself whether recent developments, which include an agreement between Great Britain and Italy, the assurances mentioned in the statement which the German Government has given with respect to Czechoslovakia, and the references to the Sino-Japanese conflict and what has taken place in Spain, justify this Parliament in developing a condition of panic, and giving to the Government subsequently, without examination, power to impose a stupendous burden on the people of Australia to secure our safety.I am prepared to ask the Parliament to consider the facts, and I think it is important at this juncture that there should be a full consideration of Australias foreign relations as a preliminary to the discussion of how much it is necessary for us to add to the provision we have already made for defence. It may be, in the light of a much fuller debate - certainly not in the light of the statement which the right honorable gentleman has just read - that reasons could be advanced which would prove to this Parliament that it is necessary for us to spend more this year upon defence than we have already provided. I quite frankly acknowledge that it may be that this Parliament would be convinced that that is necessary. I do not know the facts, because this Parliament has been silenced for too long a period, and, when it now assembles, this almost journalistic para- phrase of information which has been available in the press for the last four months is all that is given to us. The right honorable gentleman says in his statement,  I sent a telegram to the British Government, and he gives the concluding paragraph of that telegram, but he does not give us any of the documents which would enable the House to know the nature of the communications which he himself has received from the British Government, either in respect of the reply that the British Government made to his telegram or in respect of any other aspect of the communications which have been received. It is quite true that the right honorable gentleman says that as the result of the communications, he is in a position to say what the British Government meant; but it is a most extraordinary thing that there are other commentators of no mean judgment who are at least -able to say that they disagree as to whether or not there has been any great change in British foreign policy. In any case, if there has been no change in the outlook of this Government with respect to foreign relations, and its foreign policy remains what it was, we should be told why the present situation makes demands on us which were not made when we met here shortly before Christmas. That has not yet been done. What has happened?The first part of the statement just made by the Prime Minister refers to the resignation of Mr. Eden from the British Cabinet. I submit that that is not a matter to be deliberated upon by this Parliament. It would be impertinent for this Parliament to be given an exposition of the Governments attitude to « foreign relations in which the resignation of a member of the Government of the United Kingdom was put forward as an important factor about which this Parliament ought to be informed. There have been numerous other resignations from the British Government. I am not able to recall any previous occasion on which the Prime Minister of this Commonwealth has asked the leave of this Parliament to make a statement in order to tell it that the Foreign Secretary of a British Government had resigned, and to narrate to us the contentions, pro and con, which were raised in the debate in the House ofCommons immediately upon that resignation. If any member of the Commonwealth Government were to resign, I question whether the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom would make a statement to the House of Commons informing it regarding the fact.","N/A","INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS: PAPER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

41,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CURTIN, John","009FQ","N/A","N/A","N/A",541,"- What were the circumstances? There was a declaration on the part of Mr. Eden that the Government had changedits policy. A few months ago, in this House, the Commonwealth Government was not only basing its own foreign policy upon extensive quotations from the speeches of Mr. Eden, but, in fact, was also predicating its own defence policy very largely on the declarations which Mr. Eden was making from time to time in the name of collective security. As a matter of fact, the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, in defining the Governments policy for our defence, said that the security of Australia lay within three ramparts, the first being the Covenant of the League of Nations, the second the strength of the British Commonwealth, and the third our own defence. The ex-Minister for Defence, Sir Archdale Parkhill, confirmed that declaration. He said that our first safeguard was our rights as a member of the League of Nations, the second our membership of the British Empire, and the third the defence we have set up. In the debate in which Mr. Chamberlain contended as to why Mr. Eden found it no longer practicable to serve in. the British Cabinet - and I venture to say that it is extraordinary that this Parliament should even consider the circumstances connected with that res ignati on-","N/A","INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS: PAPER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[3]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

43,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CURTIN, John","009FQ","N/A","N/A","N/A",541,"- Not because of Mr. Edens resignation, but because of the declarations which the Prime Minister of Australia was making to the press and not to the Parliament. That is the reason why I asked that this Parliament should be summoned.It is extraordinary that when we do meet we are treated to a re-hash of what has appeared in the press, without one iota of additional information beyond what one could have gained by a careful reading of the newspapers. The right honorable gentleman should have dealt with the foreign policy and the defence policy of this Government, and not those of the British Government. I submit that it would be grossly impertinent on the part of this Parliament, as the Parliament of a self-governing dominion, to sit in judgment either favorably or unfavorably on policies which have to be put forward by the Prime Minister of Great Britain and for which he is answerable not to the people of Australia, but to the free and enlightened electors of the United Kingdom. I ask the Prime Minister of Australia to be answerable to the people of Australia, not for British foreign policy, but for the foreign policy of the Commonwealth Government. That is the specific indictment I make regarding the statement which the right honorable gentleman has just made. He no more indicates to us now what his foreign policy is than he has done at any previous time. Yet he says that the position with respect to other countries in their relations with Australia is now such as to persuade the Government to embark upon a policy of defence the like of which has never been known in Australian history in peace time.","N/A","INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS: PAPER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[3]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

49,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CURTIN, John","009FQ","N/A","N/A","N/A",542,"- That is all the honorable gentleman found out of revenue this year. The rest he took out of the surpluses of previous years, and he made provision in peace time to raise an external loan. Such was the defence programme of this Government last December. What is it now?In the statement which the British Prime Minister made, and which is referred to in the statement which the Prime Minister of Australia- has just made - and that is my justification for debating it - the right honorable gentleman put forward four propositions as representing the viewpoint of the British Government regarding defence. The first proposition was protection of Great Britain itself; the second, preservation of trade routes on which Britain depends for food and raw materials; the third, protection of British territories overseas, including military, naval and air bases; and the fourth, co-operation in defence of territories of any allies Britain might have in case of war. I put it to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, who has had some experience in Great Britain with regard to foreign affairs, that the third declaration has no reference to the dominions but applies to the Crown colonies and territories. Furthermore, the Government of Great Britain has at no time asked the dominions to do anything, but has felt that as component parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations it was the dominions own responsibility to decide to what extent, and how, they were able to ensure their own,-, defence. I contrast that statement, which to me is clear and illuminating, against that of our Prime Minister. Were I . an Englishman, I should regard it as the kind of foreign policy which ought to be expected from a government responsible for the peace and security of the inhabitants of the United Kingdom.The Australian Labour partys foreign policy can be said to be almost identical with those four principles. What does the Labour party say? Its defence policy provides for the protection of the Commonwealth- of Australia as the supreme obligation of the people of Australia. But what did this Government say? It declared that reliance on collective security was the first thing, and, after that, we should rely upon aid from other parts of the British Empire. The last thing it advocated was that we should make provision for the defence of Australia ourselves. As a matter of fact, the whole of the recent electioneering campaign of the Government was an endeavour to prove that we were incapable of defending ourselves. Yet when the right honorable gentleman was unable to construe Mr. Chamberlains speech and he sought an explanation of it by cablegram, he subsequently issued it as a statement without giving publicity to the cablegram received from the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom or to any portion of it.","N/A","INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS: PAPER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[3]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

51,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CURTIN, John","009FQ","N/A","N/A","N/A",542,"- No. I am saying that the right honorable gentleman construed the reply of the Prime Minister of Great Britain, and that it is construed differently by very able men both in London and here. The Australian Press informed us that the House of Commons attached great importance to Mr. Chamberlains declaration that the maintenance of naval bases at strategic points in various parts of the world was not as vital as the defence of our own country, because, so long as we are undefeated at home, even if we sustain losses overseas, we may have an opportunity of making them good afterwards. That is something which this Parliament might construe in relation to the two concepts of Australias duty as expressed by the Prime Minister during the election campaign and as expressed by myself. I said that the greatest contribution that Australia could make to the security of the British Empire was to make the maximum provision within our capacity to ensure our ability to resist aggression, and most certainly I said, too, that that would not only add to our own security but also be a positive relief to Great Britain itself, in that we would be defending 7,000,000 British subjects and 3,000,000 square miles of British territory. I also went on to say, and I repeat again now, that if we could at least make the effort to undertake the defence of that immense area and of those millions of subjects and the millions of pounds of British capital invested in the development of the industries of this nation by ourselves without depending on anybody else it would be the best contribution that Australia could make towards the security of the British Commonwealth of Nations. But what did the Government say? The Government said that that was nonsense.","N/A","INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS: PAPER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[3]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This construction was placed upon them not by the Australian Labour party in Australia but by men accustomed to interpret in the great newspapers of the world the real significance of phrases and the meaning of declarations. The inference they drew from that portion of the speech of the British Prime Minister was that in the event of war Great Britain might not be able to defend its overseas possessions if a concentration of forces were imperative at home shores.","N/A","INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS: PAPER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[3]/continue[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

57,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CURTIN, John","009FQ","N/A","N/A","N/A",543,"- That is the very point; Australia is a self-governing part of the British Commonwealth of Nations. I submit that the honorable member for Henty (Sir Henry Gullett) has made the point even clearer than it was, because the protection of British possessions overseas including military, naval, and air bases, does not include the protection of the self-governing dominions. That, I say, is a clear indication that if this Government has not changed its outlook upon foreign affairs completely since the last elections, there is no justification for dealing with defence estimates until it explains what changes have taken place in the world in respect of foreign relations, which are of such a character as to increase the menace against which Australia must make provision to be safeguarded. It is this dominion for which we have primary responsibility just as the Prime Minister of Great Britain acknowledges that he is primarily responsible for Great Britain; his problem is of one kind, ours may be of another, but we have had no information in the statement made by the Prime Minister as to what increased danger now confronts Australia from the viewpoint of its integrity, which was not present when we gave to this Government the whole financial provision for which it asked in order to give Australian defence requisite strength. On the contrary, a first, glance at the statement suggests that the tension is less now than was formerly the case. The Italian agreement unquestionably makes the trade routes for the exports of Australia much safer than would be the case if Italian and British interests were in conflict or if the governments of the two countries were unable to effect mutual arrangements. The recent treaty which has been made, by Great Britain with another dominon in respect of trade is a further indication, I venture to say, that the English-speaking world at any rate is less disposed to quarrel with its component parts than was previously the case. I welcome, therefore, the reference in the statement to the treaty made by Mr. De Valera and the Government of the United Kingdom.What else is there? Does the position in Central Europe make it necessary that Australian defence should be multiplied to the extent of the staggering increase foreshadowed in the speech which the Prime Minister broadcast recently? The Prime Minister surely makes it necessary that we should be told under what increased foreign danger we labour that was not evident three or four months ago. But the right honorable gentleman has not told us. I venture to 6ay that from the viewpoint of Europe, the position is less inflammable than it was two or three months ago. Are there any prospective developments in Europe to justify n war hysteria in Australia out of which the war profiteers will reap a harvest? It not in Europe, where else does the danger lie? What is there that wo have to look at which gives us ground for disquietude which was not the case not so long since? I point out that preliminary negotiations have been proceeding between the Australian Government and the Government of the United States of America. I hope that between them the two governments will be able to develop a sense of fraternity, good-will and mutual respect between the. people of that great country and the people of the Commonwealth. To go ahead with those negotiations might be a more valuable contribution towards Australian safety than would be the expenditure of millions of pounds on defence.","N/A","INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS: PAPER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[3]/continue[10]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

E\,err country has contributed towards what l shall call the  spilt milk  of the twenty years which have passed since the Armistice. I do not propose to probe where the responsibility lies; I merely regret that the world has reached the stage at which it becomes possible for a dreadful cataclysm to overtake civilization; but I say that all the evidence on the position of Central Europe suggests that the tension is far less grievous than it was.From the viewpoint of Australia, we have . to consider whether the effectual situation is such on the evidence submitted to this Parliament by the Government that would warrant us embarking upon a stupendous burden for national defence knowing that by doing so we are draining the resources for the development of our country. We are already compelling the States to reduce expenditure on useful works and services, and propose to plunge Australia once again iti time of peace into debt which posterity will have to carry, because we say the situation now makes it imperative to spend a sum far beyond anything that Australia has ever conceived of spending or being capable of spending on defence in time of peace. If that is the kind of provision which the present state of the world makes necessary, what is to be the situation of this nation should war come upon us? Already we are told that we must borrow in time of peace and prosperity to prepare for defence. What would be the position of the nation if war actually happened?I venture to say to this House, and I say it to the country, that Australia ought to provide adequately for its own defence as an obligatory act arising out of its nationhood. That represents our task. We ought not to rely on Britain for our defence, because in time of emergency of the kind envisaged, after reading Mr. Chamberlains speech it is very doubtful if Great Britain could come to our aid in sufficient time to bc of that degree of substantial assistance which would provide us, without preliminary preparation by us, with the strength which we should need. That was the declaration Labour put to the country during the general election campaign. This is where I come to the statement of the Acting Minister for Commerce (Mr. Archie Cameron). Last week, I said that this Government was tending towards Labours conception of defence, and was abandoning the conception of defence which it had put forward during the election campaign.","N/A","INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS: PAPER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[3]/continue[12]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

So far as the experiments have gone, it has been definitely established that this virus is poisonous to rabbits, and that, eventually, it will rapidly exterminate them in any given locality or colony. The  rift within the lute  up to the present is that affected rabbits apparently keep themselves to themselves. Not a great deal is known about the social habits of the Australian rabbit. It is essential that we should know more about their social habits, because such knowledge has a direct bearing on the efficacy of this particular specific. It appears that affected rabbits keep to their particular colony, and do not move to other colonies, thereby carrying infection abroad ; so that up to the present stage of the investigations it would appear that the efficacy of this particular virus is limited. However, the experiments are continuing, and I hope to be able to make a further  statement to the House at a later date. So far as the last part of the question is concerned, I will refer the matter to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and advise him later something about European rabbits in America.","DESTRUCTION OF RABBITS","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/subdebate.1[1]/answer/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

314,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"PERKINS, John","KXY","Eden-Monaro","UAP","Monaro- Acting Minister for Trade and Customs",556,". - by leave - Honorable members are aware that since Parliament adjourned in December last, discussions have taken place between the governments of the Commonwealth and New Zealand bearing on the tariff and commercial relation of the two dominions. The arrangements reached as a result of the discussions relate only to the duties and conditions applicable to Australian goods imported into New Zealand and do not necessitate any amendments of Commonwealth legislation. As I am sure that honorable members will wish to be informed concerning the arrangements, I propose briefly to explain them.Since 1933, the tariff relations between the two dominions have been covered by the agreement negotiated by the Honorable Sir Walter Massy-Greene and approved by the Commonwealth Parliament in November of that year. The agreement provided for the reciprocal accord of special rates of duty on a number of commodities of interest to each dominion. In respect of some commodities, the special rates were lower than the British preferential tariff, and in respect of others, higher. The agreement also provided that any goods not included in the categories to which the special rates were applicable should be dutiable at whatever rate of duty was in force under the British preferential tariff at the time the goods were imported into Australia or New Zealand, as the case might be. A reservation stipulated that any of the special rates would be alterable by mutual agreement between the two governments or by six months notice by the government wishing to effect an alteration of rates.In consideration of the extensive grant of the British preferential rates and the special commitment of New Zealand to place producers in the United Kingdom in the position of a domestic competitor, a supplementary agreement was made in 1933, that in the event of a substantial diversion of New Zealands import trade from the United Kingdom to Australia, both governments would endeavour to devise a satisfactory method .of checking such diversion, either by the regulation of trade or by such other means as might be mutually acceptable. As a result of increasing competition from imports from Australia and. because the New Zealand Government desired to safeguard and encourage the development of industries in the dominion it decided that it was urgently necessary that steps be taken to restore and improve the competitive position of its manufacturers in their home markets. To this end, the New Zealand Government gave formal notice to the Commonwealth Government of its desire to enter into immediate discussions for a complete revision of the 1933 agreement.In the discussions which took place in December in Wellington, between my colleague, Mr. White, and the New Zealand Ministers, it was arranged that the 1933 agreement should continue in force, but that the Commonwealth Government should give its consent, in such respects as was necessary, to a number of alterations of duties which the New Zealand Government wished to put into force forthwith in accordance with the policy to which it was committed.Other subjects which have been highly controversial in the past were also brought into the discussions and amicably settled. In this category I include the potato question, which for some years presented difficulties because of impediments imposed by Australia on imports from New Zealand. The position of the Commonwealth Avith respect to the industry was placed fully before the New Zealand Government which withdrew its request for relaxation of the conditions of import into Australia.The decision of the New Zealand Government with respect to citrus fruits should remove this question from the sphere of controversy also. In future the importation of citrus fruits into New Zealand will be subject to government supervision through the organization of the New Zealand Director of Marketing, and no quantitative restrictions will apply. Purchases through the New Zealand governmental organization will be made entirely on commercial lines. The New Zealand Government, however, considered it necessary to continue the maintenance of protective measures against the importation of fruit from fly-infested areas. As Australian producers demanded and were given similar protection against the introduction of plant pests and diseases, the restrictions arising from the enforcement of similar protective measures in New Zealand can hardly be questioned.The commodities in respect of which the Commonwealth Government gave its consent to a variation of the customs duties may be conveniently divided into four groups.Group 1 consists of 36 items in respect of which the duties have been raised against all supplying countries except the United Kingdom. The increases range from 5 per cent. to 20 per cent. The principal items affected are -Items Affected by Increases of 5 Per Cent. - Soap, boots and shoes for adults (an alternative duty of 4s. per pair is also imposed on Australian boots and shoes), slippers, leather belting, and certain types of leather.Items Affected by Increases of 10 Per Cent. - Knitted piece goods of silk or artificial silk, stationery, showcards, calendars, programmes, lawn mowers, carbons and electrodes, electric irons, hardware, woodware, certain machinery.Items Affected by Increases of 15 Per Cent. - Hosiery and certain articles of apparel, rough tanned hide leathers, rubber hose and tubing, rubber parts of milking machines, rubber sheet and miscellaneous articles of rubber.Items Affected by Increases of 20 Per Cent. - Hats, caps, millinery, upholstery leather, storage batteries, wireless sets.To protect and encourage expansion of the New Zealand wine industry, the duty on Australian non-sparkling wines has been raised from 4s. to 5s. 6d. a gallon. Previously, South African wine paid a duty of 3s. 6d. a gallon, and Australian wine a duty of 4s. The differential rates have been eliminated and the duty of 5s. 6d. will apply to both Australian and South African wines. Treaty commitments with certain foreign countries precluded New Zealand from maintaining the former margin of preference accorded to Australia. Australias trade in the items in this group amounted to £550,000.Group 2 consists of six items on whichAustralia previously enjoyed lower rates of duty than other dominions supplying similar goods. The duties applicable to Australia have been raised to the level of the duties previously applicable to the other dominions. They involve an increase of 5 per cent. in the duties applicable to fancy goods and sporting goods, jewellery and platedware, canned peas, dress stands and lay figures, brushes and brooms, and an increase by 10 per cent. of the duty on electric cooking and heating appliances. The trade in the items in this group amounted to £80,000.Group 3 consists of eleven items on which the increased rates, although applied only to Australia, result in the duties applicable to Australia being very slightly in excess of those applicable to other dominions supplying similar goods. The new rates increase the duty on woollen piece goods and mouldings by 5 per cent., and the duties on toilet preparations and perfumery, paints, varnishes, ink, pickles, and stereotypes by 10 per cent. The trade in the items in this group amounted to £150,000 in 1936, of which toilet preparations and perfumery accounted for £50,000 and paint and varnishes, £78,000. The higher rates have also been applied to Canadian paints and varnishes.Group 4 consists of 13 items on which the new rates applicable to Australia are higher than those applicable to other dominions. The volume of imports of these goods from other dominions is very small but competition from Australia has, for many years, necessitated the application of special rates against Australia to protect New Zealand producers. The trade in the items in this group amounted to £30,000 in 1936 but rose sharply during 1937 following an increase of the costs of production in New Zealand. The principal items in the group are: Furniture and upholstery, miscellaneous leather manufactures, enamelled baths, tinware, plain textile articles, and electric fittings and lamps.Although the new duties cover 66 items the bulk of our trade with New Zealand is not affected. It is also unlikely that the new duties will mean a substantial loss of trade in those cases where the increases are designed to restore the former levelof protection. Naturally we would have wished to retain the whole of this trade, but honorable members will agree that the. Commonwealth could not reasonably question measures which the New Zealand Government considered necessary for the protection and encouragement of industry in New Zealand. The agreement with New Zealand has given Australia access to a valuable market, and, measured in terms of exports against imports, has operated in Australias favour. The volume of our trade with New Zealand has expanded remarkably in recent years. In the calendar year 1933 New Zealand imported Australian goods to the value of £2,808,000, and exported to Australia goods to the value of £1,393,000. In 1937 its imports of Australian goods had grown to £6,944,000, while exports to Australia reached only £1,824,000.The New Zealand Government insisted that the measures necessary for the protection of New Zealand industries were urgent and could not be delayed later than the 1st. March last. Consent to the alterations was, therefore, given by the Commonwealth Government and the new duties were put into force in New Zealand on the 1st March.Pursuant to the desires of the New Zealand Government the Commonwealth Government has also consented to accept three months notice in lieu of six months for alterations of rates of duty or for termination of the agreement. Subject to this understanding the agreement of 1933 will continue until such time as both parties find it convenient to open discussions for a new agreement.","N/A","NEW ZEALAND-AUSTRALIA COMMERCIAL RELATIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I submit to the country, if it is vain to submit it to the Parliament, that we ought to consider the merits of the general defensive capacity of Australia at present, and the circumstances that have arisen since we last made provision of this nature, in order to ascertain to what extent, if at all, it is necessary to increase that provision, before being invited to provide the money for a policy with which we may, or may not agree, and which certainly the House has not yet had an opportunity to consider.- The Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons) has just given to the House a statement of the general policy on defence which the Government has in contemplation. By an arrangement with him, because of my unreadiness to debate that subject at this juncture, the consideration of that matter has been adjourned; but I submit that it is only logical that this House should deal with the two matters that have been placed before it only since the sitting opened to-day before it authorizes the committee to consider His Excellencys message. The Government appears to be impatient to get money for a programme, the general character of which has not been deliberated upon by this Parliament.I contend that that is the wrong way to go about the matter. A discussion of the subject of defence generally, which the right honorable gentleman has submitted to us, should properly precede the consideration of the financial provision for that policy. Honorable members know that once we get into committee in order to consider this message, it is certain that all the steps incidental to the Parliament making the requisite financial provision will be completed before the Parliament has considered the general principles of the policy that has just been explained to it. I know that the Prime Minister is of the opinion that I ought not to be allowed to speak as I am now speaking. I admit that the course which I have adopted is unusual. It is the first time in this Parliament that I have risen to discuss whether a message from His Excellency should be considered by the committee forthwith ; but I do it in order to direct the attention of the country to the manner in which this subject is being dealt with by the Parliament, and because the procedure insisted upon by the Government makes it difficult for the Parliament to make any constructive examination of the problem. Having said that, I am not in a position to do more than protest against the failure of the Government, first, to complete the consideration by this Parliament of the examination of the foreign relations of the Government and its foreign policy, and, secondly, to allow the Parliament to consider the general subject of defence and to protest also against its insistence that we shall put the cart before the horse by voting money for a policy which we have not had an opportunity to discuss.","N/A","LOAN BILL 193S","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Prior to describing the measure itself, I would remind honorable members that the financial provision for defence for the current financial year was £11,500,000, and that this sum was found in the following way: - From the budget itself, about £6,000,000; from the defence equipment trust accounts, £3,000,000 ; and from loan, £2,500,000. It will be seen that, of the total appropriation of £11,500,000 for the current financial year, only £6,000,000 was found from the budget itself. Envisaging the financial provision of £15,000,000 for the next financial year, it will be observed that £9,000,000 is to be found over and above what was provided from the budget of the current financial year. As to how the Government will finally arrange to finance the total programme of £15,000,000 for the next financial year I am, of course, unable to inform the House at the moment. The budget for 193S-39 cannot be presented for several months, and it is impossible to forecast what its revenue and expenditure contents will be. In the meantime, however, it is necessary to take steps to launch this increased defence programme without delay. Certain orders for additional defence equipment have to be placed as soon as possible, and, of course, they cannot wait until the next budget is brought down.","Second Reading","LOAN BILL 193S","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The almost invariable experience in recent times has been that it is necessary to raise loans at a discount from a round rate of interest. As an indication of the urgency of the .matter, it is desired to place before the 30th of June next orders for capital works of a total value of £5,250,000. I do not mean that that amount will be expended before the 30th June, but that commitments to that extent will be entered into before that date. The actual expenditure in 1937-38 out of the proceeds of the loan authorized by the bill will be very small indeed, if anything at all. But that is not the point. The Government cannot proceed to place orders and enter into commitments for the provision of defence equipment unless it has the necessary authority provided in the bill.","Second Reading","LOAN BILL 193S","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Further and more detailed information in respect of these items will be given at a more appropriate stage.During the remainder of the current financial year it will be necessary to go ahead with certain proposals incidental to the contents of the measure, that will involve an increase in ordinary maintenance expenditure upon defence in Australia. The additional expenditure under the heading I have just described, amounting to the relatively small sum of about £70,000, it is proposed to meet in the meantime from the Treasurers Advance. The Financial Agreement exempts the Commonwealth from the necessity to bring its defence loan requirements before the Loan Council, and, in fact, exempts Commonwealth defence loan proposals and operations generally from the provisions of that agreement. In view, however, of the fact that the £10,000,000 at present required for defence will be obtained from the market which supplies requirements for State loan programmes, the Government brought its immediate loan requirements for defence purposes before the Loan Council. The position was explained to the various State Premiers who were good enough to express themselves as willing to assist the Commonwealth Government in this direction to the best of their ability.","Second Reading","LOAN BILL 193S","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Government has not considered at any time the question of raising the money elsewhere than in Australia. The honorable member has, however, now put the idea into my head. The Loan Council has decided to place on the Australian market at an early date a public loan of £10,250,000, of which £4,000,000 will, subject to this measure becoming law, be utilized for defence purposes under the terms of the bill, while the balance of £6,250,000 will be provided for public works, &c. undertaken by the various governments throughout Australia. The reason for combining the loan requirements for public works and defence purposes is that the Commonwealth Government and the Loan Council desire to minimize the number of calls made upon the Australian money market. The Commonwealth proportion of £4,000,000 will be used to finance defence expenditure during the balance of the current financial year and the early months of the new financial year. I point out that the Commonwealth proportion of the loan cannot be floated until the Government obtains the necessary authority under this bill, and I therefore ask honorable members to co-operate with the Government in securing its early passage.Debate (on motion by Mr. Curtin) adjourned.","Second Reading","LOAN BILL 193S","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In view of the relationship of that bill to certain other matters, particularly two statements made by the Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons) in this chamber to-day, and in order that honorable members who may be called upon to debate the measure tomorrow may be in a better position to do so, I ask the Prime Minister to ensure that every honorable member will be supplied to-morrow morning with a copy of the two statements to which I have referred. Unless that is done the deliberative competence of the House will be to some extent reduced. In view also of the nature of the other matters which have been listed for discussion to-morrow, I suggest that the Prime Minister might well consider the advisability of postponing the debate upon those subjects until Friday. At his behest Parliament was assembled to-day and he has placed before the House matters of the greatest importance, involving tremendous obligations upon the country, and I submit that the examination in the public interest of the details of the proposed expenditure demands that the scrutinizing faculties of honorable members should be exercised to the uttermost. Every item of the proposed expenditure should be closely examined before being authorized. Furthermore, while we have been informed of the total expenditure proposed to be incurred there has been suggested up to the present only one method of raising a large portion of that sum. The manner in which the balance is to be secured has not been outlined, with the result that Parliament is in a sense committed to a certain expenditure without having had time to study the details from the point of view of protection of the taxpayers, or to consider whether it may be wiser to employ methods other than those contemplated in order to raise the desired amount. I protest against the procedure followed by the Government in submitting these tremendous issues to Parliament, I say to the country that the Opposition will endeavour to do its duty faithfully, but that it does consider that the ordinary procedural facilities which the Standing Orders prescribe should be adhered to, and that where the Standing Orders do not prescribe, practice should be adhered to. I notice in connexion with another measure listed in the Prime Ministers policy speech, that dealing with national insurance, the right honorable gentleman contemplates that an exposition of the bill shall be given to the House and that an interval of time shall elapse before the House is asked to consider the matter. I agree that that is the right procedure for a matter of such importance, but I submit that, being right in that case, the same procedure ought to be followed also in connexion with the matters which we have discussed to-day; for what has been told us this afternoon and what is in prospect for us to-morrow and the days after indicate that, without care, this Parliament may easily hand on to posterity a legacy of veritable disaster. We owe it to the immediate generation of taxpayers, and most certainly to those who will succeed them, to see that the utmost care is taken by every member of this Parliament that not one wasteful item shall appear in the schedules of expenditure which we authorize, and, furthermore, that the forms of defence upon which expenditure is to be incurred are in themselves the most efficient that money can provide. We must neither spend more than is necessary nor must we pay higher prices for anything than patriotism makes necessary.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

345,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BEASLEY, John","JOM","West Sydney","N/A","N/A",565,". - I desire to take this early opportunity to bring under the notice of the Government its failure to adopt the very important conventions relating to hours and manning conditions arrived at by the Maritime Conference held at Geneva at the end of 1936 at which Australia was represented. Those conventions have been in the hands of the Government since the end of 1936, but although efforts have been made by myself and others to prevail upon the Government to adopt them, no real progress has been made. In these days when short, sharp and sudden attention is being directed to other matters, it seems extraordinary to me that the Government has shown such dilatoriness in giving attention to the demands of the maritime workers who are looking to better their conditions, in this instance on a world-wide basis. The Government is seeking the co-operation of the workers on the one hand in regard to defence matters, while it is totally ignoring them on the other, when it is a matter of improving their conditions. Though these conventions were agreed upon in 1936, since then the Government has been absolutely dodging the question of their adoption, seeking an excuse by endeavouring to pass the  buck  to the States. because certain matters dealt with by the conventions are State responsibilities. J hose portions of the conventions with which the Commonwealth is able to deal should be given early ratification; in fact, they should have been ratified long ago. The New Zealand Government has taken lip a very different attitude and has endeavoured to meet the situation by agreeing at least to some of the conventions. The International Labour Office at Geneva has been delighted to see at least one dominion in the southern hemisphere taking some interest in matters which concern the welfare of workers on an international basis. The point necessary to stress in this question is that the more conventions that can be adopted the better the prospects of the International Labour Office bringing backward countries into line with more advanced ones. We hear a good deal of talk from time to time about the conditions of the workers of this country, and it is frequently said that, because of them, it is difficult for Australia to compete with other countries having a lower standard. Yet, when an international organization strives to raise the level of backward countries, this Government is as dilatory in adopting the conventions as even the most backward countries in the world. When I attended one of these conferences some time ago, I found that the representative of the Australian Government, instead of voting for conventions designed to force backward countries up to the level of more advanced countries, did exactly the opposite. I desire to remove some of the hypocrisy which surrounds the Governments propaganda of its interest in the International Labour Office.. I hope that efforts will be made to force the Government to stand up to the collar in regard to these matters. Mr. J. Tudehope, who represented the workers at the 1936 conference represented them ably, and did everything in his power to bring pressure to bear on the various governments to ratify the conventions. I hope that it will not be necessary for me to raise this matter again-; I have asked numbers of questions,, and have drawn all the attention to. this question that should be required. Perhaps if the officers of the department which deals with these conventions were to give as much time to the consideration of the conditions of the workers as they do to other matters, they would do justice to their jobs. I hope there will be no necessity to prompt the Government further in this matter, and that it will proceed without delay to deal with those portions of the conventions that come within its own sphere.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Leader of the Opposition suggested that it should be treated in the same way as the national insurance proposals. That matter also, to an extent, is urgent, but not so urgent as this. The Government has decided the order of urgency, and in its opinion the matter of defence is the one that needs the earliest attention.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I can quite realize that there may be differences in the matter of outlook and policy between the Opposition and the Government. The main point, however, is that this subject has been under consideration for a considerable time, and that there is nothing novel in regard to it. I am perfectly sure that, as the Leader of the Opposition was to-day, members of the Opposition generally are always ready to make a contribution to the discussion of this matter, because it has been in their minds to such a considerable extent. If it were something entirely new, one might not be justified in pushing on with it. Even though I do not agree with the policy of honorable members of the Opposition in relation to defence, I know that they are as greatly concerned about the matter as we are. I ask them to help the Government to facilitate the discussion and the provision of the moneys necessary to make the defences of Australia adequate.Question resolved in the affirmative.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/speech[5]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
