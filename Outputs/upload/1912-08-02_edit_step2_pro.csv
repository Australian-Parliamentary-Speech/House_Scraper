Although a number of grounds were submitted on behalf of the applicants - the theatrical managers - in support of the application, the one mainly relied upon related to proceedings by the deputy registrar in Sydney. It appeared that the notification of the application for the registration of the union was published in the Gazette on16th December,1911, and on11th January the deputy registrar granted the certificate, forwarding a notification of the fact to the principal registrar in Melbourne. Subsequently the mistake in issuing the certificate before thirty days had passed for the receipt of objections to the registration was discovered, and the certificate was finally issued as of date 7th February last.Counsel for the union argued that the issue of a certificate on11th January was a mere nullity, and did not affect the valid act after the lapse of the required period.His Honor, after remarking that he was compelled to do a stupid piece of injustice, said the mistake had hurt no one, but he was obliged to give effect to the objection, because it had been taken. At one time he had a discretion in matters of this sort, but the last amended act said that if an organisation were registered erroneously, or by mistake, the registration must be cancelled. He had drawn up a certificate of registration.","AUSTRALIAN ACTORS UNION","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[1]/question/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We all realize what a vulnerable spot it is in the defence of Australia, and the great necessity, if we are to keep this country, as we hope, for the white races of the world, for filling that empty space at the earliest opportunity with people of such a class, and settled under such conditions, that they will form a contented population, developing the Territory and becoming our bulwark so far as the defence of that portion of the continent is concerned. Many honorable members have visited the Northern Territory, and know the condition of affairs there; while those who have not had that privilege have had the fullest opportunity, by means of reports, and of speeches made in thisHouse, to make themselves acquainted with its possibilities. All of us, myself included, who have been through the Territory, realize that in that great empty space there are magnificent opportunities for the settlement of a prosperous people. The experiments which have been made there in tropical agriculture have shown that many tropical products can be grown with great success ; and I understand that the present Government are establishing experimental farms, with a view to show whether there are any further possibilities in that direction. While we are all satisfied that there are many potentialities in the rich soil of that country, we must remember that settlers who go there to take up land and develop it, especially in the coastal regions, must labour under serious climatic disabilities as compared with people in the southerly portions of Australia. Time after time, even in the more favoured portions of the Commonwealth, and in other parts of the world, the leasehold system - the basic principle of the Ordinance which I am moving the House to disallow - has been found insufficient to bring about that permanent residence on the soil, and that proper development of the country, which it is so eminently desirable that we should do our utmost to encourage . in the Northern Territory. I presume that honorable members read this Ordinance, which has been drawn up in accordance with the principles of the Labour party. It is well known that that party throughout Australia are absolutely in favour of the leasehold as against the freehold system of land tenure. Doubtless they regard its adoption as the first step towards the realization of another plank in their platform which provides for the nationalization of the land. We have evidence in the press from time to time, however, that they are not in favour of the application of the leasehold system to their own private dealings, and, what is more, the Government were not at all anxious to secure a lease of the site selected in the Strand, London, for the Commonwealth offices. They would be satisfied with nothing less than the freehold of the area in question. The basic principle of this Ordinance is that of perpetual leasehold. It is set out in section 15 that -Leases under this Ordinance shall be granted by the Administrator in the name of the King, and (except as regards miscellaneous leases), shall be in perpetuity, but subject to reappraisement of rent at the periods provided by this Ordinance, or in special cases at the periods prescribed by the regulations or provided for in the lease.","Crown Lands Ordinance","NORTHERN TERRITORY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

62,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FULLER, George","JZF","N/A","N/A","N/A",1646,"- It does, and that to me is one of the remarkable features of the Ordinance. Great pastoral areas are to be taken up under the system of perpetual leasehold. It may be necessary for us in the not far distant future to resume all or portion of such areas, and when the day does come, we shall have to pay practically as much for the resumption of such land for closer settlement purposes as if we had parted with the freehold. When I say that I object to this Ordinance, I wish it to be distinctly understood that I have in mind only its application to areas that may be suitable for agricultural, dairying, and closer settlement purposes. I certainly do not wish to advocate the adoption of the freehold system in regard to the great pastoral areas of the Northern Territory. It is the application of this Ordinance to areas that may be classified as suitable for dairying, agricultural, and closer settlement purposes to which I object. It seems to me that the House should have had an opportunity to consider the system of land tenure to be adopted in the Northern Territory before this Ordinance was issued. I recognise that it is in accordance with an Act introduced, if I remember rightly, by the late Mr. Batchelor, when Minister of External Affairs, which absolutely prohibits the selling of land in the Northern Territory in fee. The Minister in issuing this Ordinance is merely following the system embodied in that Act. The Ordinance provides for the classification of land in various areas which are set forth in section 7. In the case of pastoral lands, the maximum area that may be taken up under class1. is 500 square miles ; in class 2, 1,000 square miles; and in class 3, 3,000 square miles. These areas may be taken up under a system of perpetual lease, subject, of course, to reappraisement from time to time. Division 2 deals with agricultural lands, and provides for the issue of leases as follows: -Subdivision (A). - Cultivation Farms -Class 1. - Maximum area, 640 acres.Class 2. - Maximum area, 2,560 acres.Subdivision (B). - Mixed Farming and GrazingClass 1. - Maximum area, 12,800 acres.Class 2. - Maximum area, 64,000 acres.I have carefully examined this Ordinance, and find that it possesses several objectionable features, even from the stand-point of those who favour the leasehold system. There is, for instance, the proposal to which reference has just been made to grant perpetual leases in respect of large pastoral holdings which, in time to come, may be partly, or wholly, required for closer settlement purposes. I have no desire to discuss seriatim all its objectionable features, but I should like to draw special attention to the fact that it is provided under Regulation 9 that -The Classification Board or any authorized person may require any applicant for any lease containing a covenant to reside on the land to produce to him a medical certificate of fitness.That is an advertisement to the world that the Minister believes that those who take up land in the Territory will have to work under very severe climatic conditions.","Crown Lands Ordinance","NORTHERN TERRITORY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I would remind them that, under this Ordinance, it will be difficult for a man to make provision for his wife and family. It is a well known principle of law that a system of trust cannot be established under a leasehold - that in respect of a leasehold you cannot carve out a life estate for your wife with remainder for your children. Notwithstanding that a man may hold a lease in perpetuity our system of conveyancing makes it impossible to do that. Let me quote from a speech delivered by one of the most experienced gentlemen in connexion with land matters in Australia. Speaking in the Legislative Council of New South Wales, on 20th March last, on a Bill proposing to do away with the right to obtain in that State any more freeholds from the Crown, he used these words -I do not like the idea of calling this a perpetual lease title, for i have an objection to a perpetual lease title.

That is to say, it is held that a life estate is an estate in freehold, and you cannot carve a life estate - that is, a freehold estate - out of a leasehold tenure. How is the honorable member going to get over the difficulty for the people who hold that tenure? That is what I always had to regard in respect of perpetual leasehold, if I called my old tenure perpetual leasehold.That is a reference to the Act to which, no doubt, the Minister intends to refer presently.

Sir Joseph Carruthers continued -There is the law of conveyancing, and you cannot set rid of it by mere statutes. It is a very difficult thing to get rid of or to alter. It is founded on the wisdom of centuries, and you cannot carve a life estate out of a leasehold estate, although the life estate may be only in practice for five, ten, or fifteen years. And yet the leasehold estate out of which you are trying to carve it may be for ninety-nine years. Then you have to get a lawyer and go into equity to get round the difficulty.I do not think that honorable members opposite, judging from their expressions of opinion in the past, desire to play into the hands of the lawyers -I prefer the old freehold tenure, under which you have a freehold grant, and attach your conditions as they can be attached to a freehold.Considering the difficulties and dangers of pioneering work in a. country like the Northern Territory, the leasehold system will press very much on people who go there, inasmuch as they will not be able to make provision for their wives and families out of the property on which they have spent their labour. These are not imaginary difficulties, but are well known to the law ; and I should be very glad to hear from the Minister how he proposes to surmount them. I have consulted other lawyers, some of them members of this House, and I am told that what I have read is absolutely good law. The people who go to the Northern Territory ought to be given the fullest opportunity to do well, not only for themselves, but for the wives and families they leave behind ; and to assist them in this, should be the desire of all who have the interests of the country at heart. This leasehold system, like a good many other experiments which are proposed from time to time by honorable members opposite, is as old as history. It has been tried in all quarters of the globe from the time of the Roman Empire downwards, and has proved deficient in every instance I have been able to discover. If honorable members will take the trouble to refer to the well-known historian Mommsen, they will find that the leasehold system proved a serious hindrance to the welfare and prosperity of the Roman Empire. The two Gracchi, who were the means of abolishing the system, were assassinated for what they did; but the fact remains, as graphically told by Mommsen, that the institution of the freehold tenure was the means of placing 80,000 peasant proprietors on the land, and of saving the position.","Crown Lands Ordinance","NORTHERN TERRITORY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I should now like to bring members down to the time of the French Revolution. It has been said time and again, and will doubtless be said many times in the future, that the lasting work of that Revolution was to end the feudal system and to initiate freehold peasant proprietorship in France. There is no difference, in my opinion, between a leasehold system under a landlord and leasehold under the State, except that, under the Ordinance, the land held under leasehold in the Northern Territory will be subject to reappraisement every fourteen years; whereas very often, under private tenure, the reappraisement does not come in the leaseholders lifetime. France so progressed under this system of peasant proprietorship that, at the conclusion of the Franco-German war, the French people were able to pay the tremendous indemnity of£280,000,000, and to remain in quite as sound, and probably a sounder, position than that of their victors. This was entirely owing to the freehold system of peasant proprietorship. Then, again, the development of the great Republic of America has not taken place under the leasehold system. The Constitution gave Congress the sole ownership of the public domain, and it was wisely decided that all prairie lands between the Ohio River and the foot of the Rocky Mountains could be disposed of in sections of 160 acres, half-sections of 60 acres, and quarter-sections of 40 acres, according to the quality, with a freehold title, on payment of 7 dollars an acre. The result was that 5,500,000 freehold proprietors were placed on the domain.

I refer to Ireland, and the painful history of that countrys agrarian strife. It is well known that Michael Davitt was the real author of the Irish land system, and that it was he who formed the Land League with the object of placing the land in the hands of the cultivators of the soil. History tells us that Michael Davitt was always a land nationalizer ; and his idea was for the State to purchase the land from the landlords and let it out to the cultivators on leases of 999 years. However, when Mr. George Wyndham, Chief Secretary for Ireland, carried through the Imperial Parliament the Irish Land Purchase Bill, he gave the people of that country the choice between leasehold and freehold. Although the tenants of Ireland, north, south, east and west, idolized Davitt, they declared in favour of freehold, adding that they had had enough of landlordism, and that they did not see the difference between being the tenant of a private proprietor and the tenant of a State.","Crown Lands Ordinance","NORTHERN TERRITORY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[11]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The tenants are now paying their instalments, which are one-third less than the judicial rents they paid before the scheme came into operation. They will be the real owners of their homes after sixty-eight years payment. The result of this legislation has already created a revolution so far as the prosperity of Ireland is concerned.

At any rate, the freehold system has, to a very large extent, relieved the position; and the result to-day is that the trade of Ireland is increasing, and, I think, now stands very nearly as high as that of the Australian Commonwealth. Let us now turn our attention to land tenures in New Zealand, where the difficulties to be encountered at the beginning were similar to those met with throughout the States of Australia. Land legislation and administration in New Zealand forms a very interesting history, in view of the Ordinance issued for the control of the Northern Territory. About twenty years ago, the two questions in New Zealand were whether the State should sell or lease the lands, and what would prove the most effective means of preventing land monopoly and breaking up big estates. The perpetual leasehold system was propounded in New Zealand by such well-known public men as Mr. Rolleston, Mr. Ballance, and Sir John McKenzie, men of advanced democratic ideas. So far back as 1882 Mr. Rolleston, who was then Minister of Lands, introduced into the Lower House a. Bill to dispose of Crown lands on perpetual lease, the rent being fixed at 5 per cent. of the unimproved capital value, with re-appraisement after thirty years, and, subsequently, at intervals of twenty years. The Council, however, favored freehold tenure, and amended the treasure to give lessees the right of purchase at £i an acre when they had fenced their land and cultivated one-fifth of it. Mr. Rolleston fought the amendment hard, but as the Council remained obdurate, it remained in the measure. Between 1882 and 1802 1,188,071 acres were taken up under this law, the tenure being more popular than the conditional purchase or deferred payment system until then in vogue, because the rent was lower, and there was the right to convert. This right to convert was availed of so largely that, in 1909, there were only 87,000 acres still being rented, and I have reason to believe that at the present day practically the whole area taken up under the Act - 1., 188,071 acres - has been converted into freehold. Mr. Ballance, a politician of very advanced ideas, succeeded Mr. Rolleston as Minister of Lands in 1885, and his attempt to carry out the policy of his predecessor brought about a long and memorable struggle between the two Houses of Parliament, but the Upper House again prevailed. When Sir John McKenzie, who was not then knighted, became Minister of Lands and Agriculture in the Ballance Cabinet, he proposed leases in perpetuity. Sir John McKenzie was a practical farmer, and a Scotchman of very strong convictions. He was determined that there should not prevail in New Zealand the system which had brought such disastrous consequences upon the small farmers of Scotland, and, being of opinion that when land is alienated in freehold, it is only a matter of time before all the land of the State gets into the possession of rich men, he determined that the land of New Zealand -should be held under perpetual lease. This form of tenure was designed to give the leaseholder the same interest in his holding as is possessed by freeholders. The leases were for a term of 999 years, but were called leases in perpetuity. A man could take >up 640 acres of first class land arid 2,000 acres of second class land, the rental equalling 4 per cent, on the capital value, residential and improvement conditions being insisted on. The lessees were prevented from taking up more than one block each, and there could not be conversion at any time. A measure embodying those provisions became law in 1892. Mr. Rolleston, who was bitterly opposed to the McKenzie Act, because it did not provide for re-appraisement, and, in effect, deprived the State of its share of the unearned increment - which is what the Minister ofExternal Affairs desires to get in the Northern Territory - speaking against the measure in Parliament, in September,. 1892, used these words, which were prophetic -This lease in perpetuity that the Government has accepted is practically a freehold, and there is no man who doubts for a moment that the residential tenure of the Act will very shortly be done away with. It will not require more than two or three years before the people will rise against the persecutions, limitations, vexations, and annoyances such as appear under this. Bill. There is no unearned increment to come in, no provision for revenue in aid of local government, no aid to taxation in the future. This Bill, as it must be carried out, will destroy the land revenue. It fosters evasion, gambling,, and speculation.From 1892 to 1907, owing to the great prosperity of the country, land values ir* New Zealand increased enormously. There was a great development of the dairying industry, and a. great increase in the exportation of lambs. When those who had taken up land under the perpetual lease system became prosperous and numerous and knew their political strength, they clamoured to be permitted to convert to freehold, and their agitation was so strong that they ultimately acquired the right of purchase, and are now practically all freeholders. A similar thing has happened in South Australia in connexion with what are known as homestead allotments.1 in New South Wales, in Victoria, and elsewhere. Men -are not satisfied with leasehold tenure. There is some magic : about the idea -of ownership that makes us all desire to own what we possess. This is shown by the Minister and his col leagues in private life time and again. Our very children playing on the floor show a desire to grab all that they can get.","Crown Lands Ordinance","NORTHERN TERRITORY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[14]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

He then pointed out that 7,000 homestead and settlement lessees wished to convert to a more secure tenure -The tenures under this Act will be subject to no periodical re-appraisement. There will be an absolute freehold, subject only to a condition that when the holding is transferred it must be transferred to a person qualified to take up a holding under the Crown Lands Act.Mr. Moore referred to the objection to the conversion, that it made no provision for re-appraisement -In theory re-appraisement is all right, but in practice it is all wrong. The lessees live in a state of insecurity, not knowing what will happen them. If the purpose is to take from the individual holder the unearned increment the fairest thing is to apply it generally and to every kind of holding.One of the objections to the Ordinance of which I am complaining is that those who go to the Northern Territory will never know how they stand.","Crown Lands Ordinance","NORTHERN TERRITORY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[17]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This Ordinance is, of course, only in accord with the whole of the policy of the Labour party, not only in the Commonwealth, but in the different States. Mr. Holman, speaking at Cootamundra, as reported in the Sydney Morning Herald of21st April last, said -We do propose to repeal the Bill which entitles the homestead selector to convert his holding, but under any circumstance he will have all this year in which to convert, and I think he will find that he will have six months of next year as well. We think that if we give the homestead selector twelve months notice that at the end of that time he will lose his right to convert, he will have no cause to complain.Mr. Trefle, the Minister of Agriculture, speaking at Breeza on 7th August, is reported, in the Sydney Morning Herald, to have spoken as follows -He had been specially requested by his leader (Mr. Holman) to deal fully and clearly with the position of the Labour party with respect to the Conversion Act. It was true that the Labour party intended to repeal the Conversion Act this year, but in consequence of the resignation of Messrs. Home and Dunn, a meeting of the caucus decided that the repeal of the Act would not apply to those who so far had taken up holdings, and the homestead selection and conditional lease tenures. The future land policy of the party, he went on to say, would be perpetual leasehold with re-appraisement of values for rental adjustments. The capital value would be based on the value of adjacent private lands.That is similar to the system which the Minister has adopted in this Ordinance. Mr. Beeby, speaking at Millthorpe on 24th September, was reported, in the Sydney Daily Telegraph, to have said, in regard to the Labour partys land tenure proposals, that-The Government would offer land only in living area blocks. The tenure would be perpetual lease ; the rental would be 2½ per cent. per annum on the capital value, which would be fixed by re-appraisement every twenty years, and the occupier could not sell his interests except to a person who had no other land.I am indebted to the Minister of Lands in Victoria, and to the Commissioner of Crown Lands in South Australia, for particulars regarding the freehold system in those two States. The Victorian Minister has furnished me with the following memorandum with regard to the perpetual leasing of Crown lands in Victoria -When the reclaimed area known as the  Koo-weer-up Swamp  was made available for occupation, a considerable number of the applicants was impressed with the apparent advantages of perpetual leasing, and preferred that tenure to conditional purchase leasehold, which conferred the exclusive right to freehold ; but, in a limited time, the holders of perpetual leases arrived at the conclusion that conditional purchase lessees are in a better position, as the freehold can be acquired by the latter at any time after six (6) years from date of lease, and! consequently a conditional purchase lease in the seventh year is recognised as a good commercial security.Crown lands have been available since 1stJuly, 1899, for selection under perpetual lease, as well as under a title under which the payment of the first and subsequent rent goes towards the purchase of the fee-simple; but in rare instances has a perpetual lease been preferred. It must, however, be mentioned that a perpetual lease of a selection carries with it an exclusive right to the holder to acquire the fee-simple by change of title, and although it. practically rests with him to determine the date on which occupation under perpetual lease shall cease, with a view to his acquisition of the freehold, yet even this privilege, together with other concessions, does not create any general desire for perpetual leases.I quote this to honorable members to show that if we are to induce people to go to the Northern Territory, we must, under existing conditions there, offer them something equally as good as, and if possible better than, is being offered in the more favoured portions of Australia, yet in those more favoured portions we find that people, so far from being satisfied with the system of perpetual leasing, prefer to get the freehold in every instance where it is offered. The memorandum continues -In a few cases of encumbered holdings in the Mallee country, where the lessees are not in a position to discharge the mortgages or to obtain agricultural allotment leases, perpetual leases are accepted as a temporary expedient, as the mortgages can be transferred thereto, and the freehold can be acquired at a later date. On. the establishment of the township of Wonthaggi, which comprises the State coal mine, it was intended to restrict occupation to continuous leasing, but to limit the term in the first instance to thirty-three years; and although it was subsequently decided to seek the authority of Parliament to increase the term to fifty years and to review the rentals every ten years, yet the lessees are not satisfied and press for the freehold.That only adds to the other instances to which I have referred to show the desire of all those who settle on the land to obtain the freehold in preference to the leasehold. The rather lengthy statement which I have received from the Commissioner of Crown Lands in South Australia also bears out my contention. I shall not take up time by reading it, but I should like to quote from the Handbook of South Australia for 1908, page 184, the following passage : -In 1898, in order to meet the growing demand for land, an Act was passed providing for the purchase of freehold lands for closer settlement. These were to be let on perpetual lease at a fixed rental of not less than 4 per cent, on the amount paid for purchase money, together with any expenses incurred in connexion with the purchase. Subsequent legislation provided for lands so purchased being disposed of on agreement with covenant to purchase, the purchase money being payable by sixty half-yearly instalments, with interest at the rate of not less than 4 per cent, per annum.During the 1903 session of Parliament an Act to consolidate the Crown Lands Acts became law. This Act re-enacted the provisions for Crown lands being let under perpetual lease at a fixed rental for all time, and not subject to revaluation or disposed of under agreement with covenant to purchase by sixty half-yearly payments, with interest at not less than 2 per cent, nor more than 4 per cent, per annum. The purchase may be completed at any time after the first six years of the agreement. In1 the case of lands repurchased by the Government and subdivided for closer settlement, more recent legislation (1905) provides for payment of interest only at 4 per cent, per annum for the first five years, after which interest and principal become payable as in the case of ordinary Crown lands. Provision is also made for those holders of repurchased lands let on perpetual lease surrendering and obtaining agreements with covenants to purchase in lieu of the perpetual leases. The purchases of closer settlement land may obtain the fee-simple of their holdings at any time after the first nine years on payment of the balance of the purchase money and interest up to date. Up to the 30th June, 349,802 acres - including 14,716 acres of leasehold - have been purchased at a cost of ,£883,150, and disposed of to suitable purchasers, most of whom are successfully occupying their holdings. In place of comparatively few persons on the land at the time of purchase there is now a population of 3,945 adults and children on these repurchased lands.This shews that the South Australian Government repurchased lands for closer settlement purposes, and offered them under a system of perpetual lease, but in 1905 they did away with the perpetual lease system, and, in order to get the best work out of the settlers in developing the land, gave them the right by purchase to obtain the freeholds for themselves. The system which it is proposed to adopt in the Northern Territory is part of the Socialistic scheme of honorable members opposite. The Minister of External Affairs, speaking at Broken Hill, said -This then is what the Labour movement means.. In one precise pregnant word it means Socialism. Well, Socialism is your scheme as apart from all other schemes. He was speaking, of course, to the Labour leagues and the workers, to whom he was appealing for support. It is based on social growth. It is the common holding of land, and the means of production and exchange, and the holding of them for the equal benefit of all.The leasehold system is, therefore, only a portion of the programme designed to bring about the nationalization and Socialism advocated by the Minister of External Affairs at Broken Hill. The first step is leasehold, and the second is land nationalization, but although the Labour Government in New South Wales had professed to be in favour of leasehold, and boasted at the general election that if given a majority they would immediately bring it into operation, it was found when they got into power that the only man amongst them who was game to carry out his principles was Mr. Neilsen, the then Minister of Lands, and he was forced to resign.","Crown Lands Ordinance","NORTHERN TERRITORY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[28]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The honorable member for Illawarra will be prepared to admit that in this case we have not merely to consider the question of freehold versus leasehold, but to direct special attention to what we intend to convey by the use of those terms. There are certain kinds of leases which no sane man would accept in respect of land in the Northern Territory. For instance, leases might be issued with a currency _ of one year or twenty years, and subject to arbitrary conditions as to reappraisements at the end of that period. To that class of lease in respect of the Northern Territory most men would object. Then, again, we might have a freehold system subject to certain conditions to which even the honorable member for Illawarra would not agree.

So far as a white population is concerned, fast tracts of country in the Northern Territory are as uninhabited to-day as they were when Captain Cook first set foot on Australian soil. We as a Government recognise that in adopting the leasehold system we must take care to associate with it security of tenure so that people may have some inducement to take up land. Consequently, we have provided under this Ordinance for the granting of leases in perpetuity. In some cases there will be a reappraisement at the end of fourteen years, and in others at the expiration of twenty-one years, but we have provided that those reappraisements shall not be of an arbitrary character. A leaseholder will have the right of appeal to the Judge of the Northern Territory if he is dissatisfied with the re- appraisement of his land.","Crown Lands Ordinance","NORTHERN TERRITORY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

129,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"THOMAS, Josiah","K8L","N/A","N/A","N/A",1654,"- Yes. We consider it is useless to grant leases in respect of land in the Territory unless we insist upon residence. Without such a condition we cannot hope to settle the Territory. Honorable members will recognise that as long as the conditions of a lease are complied with the area to which it relates will practically belong to the holder, so that it will be seen that we have made full provision for security of tenure. I think it only fair, in pitting the leasehold against the freehold system, to take these points into consideration. If we were to adopt the freehold system in connexion with the lands of the Northern Territory we should, of course, have to alienate lands from the Crown, and I should like to ask honorable members what price that land would fetch at auction today. I say advisedly that most of the land suitable for agricultural purposes in the Northern Territory is to-day practically unsaleable, not because of any deficiencies in the matter of soil or climate, but because of its inaccessibility to a market, and because at the present time, with few exceptions, land there could not be profitably devoted to agricultural purposes. That being so, if we proposed to part with the freehold of such land at its present value we should have practically to give it away.There would be a rush for the land in such circumstances, especially if there were no conditions as to residence. It may be said that we could part with the freehold and attach to the land, not its present, but its prospective value - that we should take into consideration the added value that will be given to it by the construction of roads, bridges, and railways. To do that, however, would be to ask the people to pay for something that did not exist, and that is not the policy of this Government. Our policy is to lease the land under conditions that will enable a man to apply to the development of his holding whatever capital he possesses, whether it be large or small.","Crown Lands Ordinance","NORTHERN TERRITORY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I am pleased that the honorable member for Illawarra quoted Sir Joseph Carruthers, because I, myself, intend doing so. In 1895 Sir Joseph Carruthers was Minister for Lands in the Reid Ministry, and had for one of his colleagues the honorable member for Parramatta. Speaking on this subject, he said -Now, what are the advantages of this conversion? Let me say, for the information of those who think that the conversion will not be availed of, that the popularity of the homestead selection system has been demonstrated beyond dispute. I have thrown open in Riverina, where there has been the greatest demand for land, special areas which have not been taken up. I have thrown open there land for ordinary conditional purchase, but there have been no conditional purchasers. The moment the tenure of the land has been changed to homestead selection there has been a rush for it. The homestead selection areas which have been thrown open in Riverina have been eagerly snapped up. ..... The honorable member for theMurray introduced to me a delegate from a large number of Victorian farmers, who subscribed together to pay his expenses so that he might interview me. It transpired in the course of the interview that he represented a large number of families and of men who were waiting for land to be thrown open, some of them being encamped on the Murray. I said that I should be declaring certain land open for selection under the old law, and his answer to me was characteristic of the feeling which is very strong on the part of those who understand the law. Do not do that; we do not want that; we have not the money with which to pay the deposit and to meet the initial expenses of ordinary conditional purchase. Give us the chance of taking up homestead selections; we can pay a fair rent for the use of the land ; that is what we want, and have been waiting for. This has been my experience in other parts of the Colony where land has been thrown open by hundreds of thousands of acres under ordinary conditional purchase, and has not been taken up. In the majority of cases where land has been thrown open under this rent system, a demand has immediately set in. People are beginning to recognise that the value of land is not its speculative value, but the value of the product you can get from it. As soon as people understand the difference between these holdings and the old freeholds, with their fictitious values, we shall have a larger demand for this particular class of tenure.It is rather strange that only recently I received a letter, and a very interesting letter it is, from an English immigrant, to the foi lowing effect : -I most heartily approve of the opening up of the Northern Territory, and of the conditions of settlement. It is an opportunity for working men which has seldom been afforded them. I, for one, shall be more than pleased to take advantage of it. I might add that I am an Englishman, and that I came to Australia two years ago with the intention of taking up land. I have hitherto met with more difficulties than I had anticipated from the statements of Government officials and circulating literature in England. The cause of this difficulty, I believe, is that I am a man of small capital; but in the Territory, it appears to me, I shall be able to meet your requirements, and, as regards character, I shall have no difficulty in furnishing you with references.","Crown Lands Ordinance","NORTHERN TERRITORY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[15]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Then Mr. Kirwan,1 the then member for Kalgoorlie, a gentleman, who is not a member of the Labour party, but who knows a good deal of the subject, moved for the insertion of a clause in the Papua Bill to provide for the non-alienation of land, and he said -In my judgment, it is to be deplored that the authorities of Australia-In Australia, mind, not in Papua - did not early adopt the principle which I am advocating. Had they done so, we should now be receiving a revenue from the land which would be far in excess of the expenditure necessary for the purposes of government.I may say that, at the same time, the late Mr. G. B. Edwards, whose loss we all deplored, strongly advocated the leasehold principle. The honorable member- for Angas, in the course of the debate, said -During the sitting of the Convention the present Attorney-General of New South Wales and myself both brought forward provisions to prohibit the alienation in fee-simple of any part of the Federal Territory, and an argument which influenced a good many members of the Convention against that proposal was that the Constitution should merely create the machinery for legislation, and should not itself legislate. No such objection could be urged against my present proposal, however.I have no desire to place words in the mouth of the honorable member for Angas, for no one could have a fairer opponent than that gentleman ; but I think it is fair to infer that, in his opinion, had it not been for the fact that a majority of the members of the Federal Convention thought they were creating nothing more than a machinery measure, our Constitution would have provided that there should be no alienation of land in the Federal Capital Territory. I admit that there is a considerable difference between land in the Federal Capital site and land in the Northern Territory, but, in view of the remarks of the honorable member for Angas, and of the fact that it was carried on the voices that no land should be alienated in the Capital area - that members of all shades of political opinion were agreed on that point - I do not think the Labour party can be blamed for acting on the same principle in the Northern Territory.

The honorable member for- Illawarra has shown that in New Zealand, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia, when opportunities have been given and availed of for the taking up of land .on lease, the lessees, have subsequently brought pressure to bear to get freehold tenure, and that this movement has been successful. Let me point out what has happened in South Australia. Some years ago, the Labour party of that State, led by Mr. McPherson, desired that there should be no further alienation of Crown lands. After a good deal of discussion, areas were set apart to be taken upon lease; and,: among others, an area of land was provided)-, near Adelaide for what were known as blockers; and the blockers settlement became one of the sights of the place. Just as a visitor to Sydney is asked,  Have you seen the harbor? a visitor to Adelaide was asked,  Have you seen the. blockers settlement? and the Minister, with great pride, would drive you round, it. Had it not been for the leasehold tenure adopted, the men who were put on that land, who were men without capital, could not have got on the land at all. At first they worked for two or three days a week to earn -money to keep themselves going, employing the rest of their time in improving their holdings, until finally they were able to devote the whole of their time to the care of their blocks. Having begun to make money, and having got on to their feet, they clamoured for freehold tenure, wishing to secure the unearned increment, and ignoring the fact that but for the leasehold tenure they would never have got on the land. Does that make leasehold tenure a wrong tenure as compared with freehold tenure, or does it prove it the better tenure for the settlement of the country ? The large area taken up in New Zealand under the leasehold tenure shows how beneficial that tenure was in settling the Dominion. Directly people realize that there is something to be gained by acquiring the unearned increment, regardless of the interests of those who have no land, they clamour for freehold tenure, and use political pressure to obtain it. That happened in South Australia. As the honorable member for Boothby knows, men who obtained possession of land because of the efforts of the late Mr. Thomas Price acted with the basest ingratitude towards him, and tried to bring him down because he would not give them freehold tenure.","Crown Lands Ordinance","NORTHERN TERRITORY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[29]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

When resumptions are_ needed, the Government resume on the basis of the value that the selector himself has put into the land, and not upon the value that has been given to it by the community. The Government pay fully, and I hope generously, for the improvements and for the work and capital put into the land by the occupant, but do not pay a single penny of unearned increment. I venture to say that that is the crux of the question as between thea leasehold and freehold principles. Men are anxious for the freehold because, if the time ever comes for them to sell their land, or for it to be resumed, they want to be paid, not only what, they themselves have put into it, but also what the community has put into it. Men are to be induced to go to the Territory, according to the argument of those who advocate freehold, not so much for what they can earn out of the soil, as for what they may possibly be able to get out of the added values given to the land by the community. No man has a moral right to this, and, as far as this Government are concerned, we do not propose to give him the legal right. In the leasehold system, we are not parting with the land. We compel the occupier to use it, and we say that no man has a right to own land merely for speculative purposes. The ownership of land must carry with it the utilization of the land. We give every facility to people to settle upon the land, but we demand residence. We say it is necessary for those who obtain land in the Territory to go there to live. It. is of no good to the Territory that persons should purchase or obtain land without settling on it. Leasehold gives the Government the opportunity of offering to the present occupier every possible advantage, without bartering the rights of posterity. Freehold, which admits the  sacred rights of property, to use the words of the honorable member for Parramatta, has cursed every community. We desire to save ourselves and save this Parliament from the curse of future generations, and so we have nailed our flag to the principle of leasehold.

I tried also to show why the presence of free moisture was a necessity, and endeavoured to explain the technical reason why 16 per cent, has been accepted by all the great butter-producing countries as the best percentage of moisture to allow, with a view of securing the greatest quantity of first class butter. I have no desire to elaborate the arguments that I put before the House yesterday, but I wish to refer to one or two replies made by the Minister of Trade and Customs to questions put to him in this House - replies which show conclusively that the information at his disposal is faulty, and based upon what, to my mind, are mere prejudices, having no real foundation in fact, A few days ago, the honorable member for Maranoa asked the Minister whether he was aware that 16 per cent, of moisture was that allowed under the regulations of the British Board of Trade for butter imported into the United Kingdom from any part of the world. The Minister replied to that question -Yes ; but as the standard of 16 per cent, in Great Britain was determined merely to meet the trade in Irish firkin butter, heavily charged with water, it has little application to or influence on the Australian standard, the object of which is to encourage the manufacture of pure high class butter. . . .In that answer, we have a mis-statement, due, probably, to the fact that the Minister is not acquainted with the true situation of the butter trade in England, and two absolute misconceptions. In the first place, butter carrying 16 per cent, of moisture, which is the standard in Great Britain, is not   heavily charged with water.   Fourteen per cent, is recognised as the standard for absolutely superfine butter, and no one will contend that an additional 2 per cent, would make a butter heavily charged with moisture.","N/A","MOISTURE IN BUTTER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

There is a percentage of water in everything we eat and drink, and, as I have said, 16 per cent, has been found all over the world to be the best standard to fix in order to secure the greatest proportion of good butter under varying conditions of manufacture. The Minister of Trade and Customs said that the standard of 16 per cent, fixed by the British Board of Trade had been determined upon solely to allow of the introduction of Irish firkin butter into England. That is an absurd statement.

I showed yesterday afternoon that there is a point beyond which you cannot press water out of butter without producing an article that will not keep as well as if the water had remained in it. Let us take the case of two samples of butter, each containing 8 per cent, of water. In one case the butter, in grain and general appearance, might be all that could be desired, whilst in the other it might be so overworked that it would not keep. One must be aware of these facts in order to be able- to express an opinion on the subject. The Ministers contention that the less water you have in butter the better it will keep is mere nonsense. Everything depends on circumstances. I impress on the Minister of Trade and Customs, as I stated in my opening remarks yesterday, that the method of Denmark, our greatest competitor in the London market, is to draw together the whole of those engaged in the industry, and to associate them with the Government in the making of regulations, some of which, I willingly admit, are necessary. The Minister of Trade and Customs has a grand opportunity, if he will avail himself of it, to so associate himself with the dairymen of Australia, who have now, practically, complete control of the industry in this country through the co-operative channels. They .have appointed their own agents in London to assist in the sale of their produce at the other end of the world; and if the Minister is really desirous, as I believe him to be, of framing regulations which will assist the industry, I suggest that he take steps in the direction I have indicated. There is now in Australia a body which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of butter, and which, I believe, would be only too ready to offer the Minister every assistance possible. For a number of years, the dairymen of Australia have been gradually drawing their interests into one common centre; and, without any assistance whatsoever, they have, during the last twelve years, brought this industry from its infancy to the position of being of the third largest, apart from mining, of the industries on which Australia is dependent for its existence. It will readily be conceded, under the circumstances, that the dairying industry is entitled to the fullest consideration at the hands of the Minister; and he ought to hesitate long before he makes any recommendation or regulation which is diametrically opposed to the opinions of the dairymen who have done so much for the producers, and for the country as a whole.","N/A","MOISTURE IN BUTTER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[1]/continue[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Dr. Thorpe, an eminent chemist, whose expert opinion is entitled to great weight, has stated -The Committee came to- the conclusion, after hearing a vast amount of evidence, that_ the amount of water which might be present in a properly-made butter need not exceed 8 per cent. ... I think that every member of the Committee was prepared to consider a report fixing the amount of 8 per cent, as being the fair and proper amount.Proceeding, Dr. Thorpe states that formerly the average moisture of butter imported into the United Kingdom did not exceed 11 per cent. ; that, in considering the fixing of a maximum of 8 per cent., the question arose as to whether some margin or working allowance should not be provided for. Lastly, special consideration was given to the trade in Irish firkin butter,  which is made by comparatively poor farmers, often with very small herds, one or two cows at most, and which was heavily charged with water.He concludes - We ended up by putting it at 16 per cent. The effect has been unfortunate. New Zealand and Australia had prided themselves in sending us butter very dry; they do not wish to carry water all the way from Australia or New Zealand to England. The Danes had seldom exceeded 11 per cent. Those great butter-producing countries, when the law stepped in and made 16 per cent. the legal limit, said there was no obligation on them to furnish dry butter; the law would condone an amount of water up to the extent of 16 per cent. I am sure that the amount of water in butter now is larger than it was when we took up the question, and the consumer would have been better off if we had never handled the question of water in butter at all.The Danes did not attempt to put 16 per cent. of moisture into their butter until that was generally allowed.","N/A","MOISTURE IN BUTTER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[2]/continue[15]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The House of Commons will then pass legislation giving the necessary protection. Dr. Thorpe says that there is no doubt whatever that the effect of the limitation as to the amount of water which may be in butter has worked out to the detriment of the consumer. In Victoria, since 1906, and in New South Wales, butter cannot be sold locally which contains more than 15 per cent. of moisture, and, during the past three seasons, the percentage of moisture in the butter exported from the Commonwealth has been considerably below 14 per cent. Mr. Crowe, the Government dairy expert of Victoria, is of opinion that the 15 per cent. maximum has been of considerable benefit to manufacturers, as it has been found that the lower temperature necessary to keep the moisture within the standard assists in recovering more butter fat in the churning, and thus compensates the factories for the extra trouble taken. Mr. OCallaghan, the New South Wales dairy expert, has pointed out that butter with a low percentage of moisture is of undoubtedly better quality than butter with a high percentage. The mover of the motion said that increased moisture did not deteriorate the quality of butter.","N/A","MOISTURE IN BUTTER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[2]/continue[17]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The keeping quality is bound to suffer to a considerable extent, because the process of fermentation which is brought about by bacterial agency will be carried on much more rapidly in the presence of 16 per cent. of water than of 12 per cent. ... A salted butter containing 16 per cent. of water, unless the maker is a very good artist, will undoubtedly be of a weak texture, and will show a lot of free moisture on being tried with the butter borer. Thus the intending purchaser is prejudiced, and will not feel disposed to buy at top prices. . . The more one looks at this question in detail, the more one is inclined to ask the question -  Is the gain that is possible by the manufacture of a butter on the border line of the moisture boundary worth the risk of the bad advertisement which any factory, or country, is sure to gain, if its produce is frequently found on its arrival in England to contain an excessive amount of water?I ask honorable members who have interrupted me in such an ungracious way this afternoon what they have to say to that opinion.","N/A","MOISTURE IN BUTTER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[2]/continue[18]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

AH they want is fair, square, open competition. Why the Minister of Trade and Customs should want to make Australia the real white lily of the whole of the butter trade of the world is beyond- me. The honorable member for Capricornia made great capital out of the report of the Victorian expert.

Give the masses a thoroughly food and reliable article, and a greater consumption may be expected from the same number of people.Queensland butter holds its own well on this market. The relative positions as regards average prices of the various descriptions of Commonwealth butter are this season the same as they have always been, though Queensland brands made a great advance a couple of seasons ago.And, again - and to this passage I wish to direct the particular attention of the Minister and of the honorable member for Capricornia -A large proportion of Australian butter is used by distributers for blending and milling purposes. The butter that the public buy at a shop is, to a very great extent, compounded of several different descriptions. This practice is perfectly legal and justifiable, assuming that the moisture limit is not exceeded, and that only pure butters are mixed.","N/A","MOISTURE IN BUTTER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[3]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

His firm, who are exporters of butter, are not anxious that the moisture standard should be increased, except to put them on the same footing as exporters from other countries. He says -You will observe that I advocate 16 per cent, maximum, whereas the Federal new regulations are to be 15 per cent, maximum. The London buyers are quite satisfied with 16 per cent, maximum.

I . am taking this stand more for that reason than for anything else.I think if you were to make inquiries at the offices of our Department of Agriculture, you will find that the average percentage of moisture in butter exported last year from Queensland is less than 144 per cent. At first glance it would appear that if the average is only i4i per cent, why object to 15 per cent, maximum, but it was 14^ per cent, because the factories do not care to run any risk at all of being fined for excessive moisture at 16 per cent. If this reduction to 15 per cent, maximum comes into force, the factories will pay the dairy farmers 1 per cent, less for their cream, consequently the dairy farmers are 1 per cent, worse off.That is another consideration that appeals to me.

325,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"PAGE, James","KXO","N/A","N/A","N/A",1668,"- I do not pose as an expert; but my own opinion is that inferior butters, manufactured in, or imported into, Great Britain, and containing a large percentage of moisture, are mixed with the good butter obtained from Australia, so that the moisture contents of butter sold as of Australian production are thereby increased. Mr. Mant continues -The present chart by which cream is purchased from the factories is worked out on the basis of 84.01 per cent, butter fat for 1 lb. of butter, and it is proposed now to prepare a new chart for 84.85 per cent, butter fat, in other words, pay the dairymen the same price for 84.85 per cent, butter fat as against 84.01 per cent, in the old chart. I hope you will induce the Minister not to bring the new regulations into force on the 1st July, but get the matter put off until it can be thoroughly threshed out, if. necessary, in Parliament, because it means a tremendous loss for possibly a small gain. During 1909-10 season the imports of Australian butter into England were, say, r, 150,800 boxes, at £2 ros. - ^2,877,000, which, at 1 per cent., means ^28,770. A fairly tidy sum to be taken out of the pockets of the dairymen. This season it would be over ^40,000 if the present rate of export continues. Then, besides this, there were some 46,000 boxes exported from Queensland to other places during the 1909-10 season, say, another ,£1,150, at 1 per cent., at a very low valuation, also all the butter that is consumed in Australia as well as the quantity exported to other places by the remaining States. You will observe from these figures that it is rather an expensive matter to the dairymen, and it is in no wise a certainty that the butter will bring a higher price by having the moisture reduced. The Federal Government may also argue that Mr. Meares, of Sydney, stated that the co-operative companies were prepared to accept 15 per cent, moisture (he did this as the Government in the first instance wanted to make it 14 per cent.) thinking, no doubt, that  half a loaf was better than no bread, but he did not speak for everyone, and had the matter been put in the light that I have tried to put it, surely the Government would have agreed to 16 per cent. I fancy the arguments used by the Federal Customs are that they wish the quality of Australian butter to be raised to a higher standard by reducing the maximum moisture to 15 per cent., and they say this ought to assist their object. As far as Queensland is concerned, when the Agricultural Department have any butter submitted for export giving over 16 per cent, moisture, the factory is fined, and the butter must be re-worked and brought down to the correct percentage before it can be exported, and I understand that in only very few instances in England, Queensland brands of butter are fined for excessive moisture, but I believe that the State laws in the South are somewhat different. As far as conveniences of checking the moisture by the Government are concerned, in Queensland the churn marks are put on all the boxes, but in the South I believe there are no churn marks put on. The consequence of the latter is this, a consignment of 800 boxes may come in from a factory, the owners do not want it grade marked, so the Government officer picks out 80 boxes, they may only be from five (5) churns (he cannot possibly tell) and they may be found to be right as far as moisture is concerned, and he puts the  approved for export  stamp on the whole lot, whereas, there may be some of the churns that contain excessive moisture, which latter are all exported. In Queensland one box is taken from each churn and the moisture carefully checked. The result is that in Queensland butters the fines in England can be practically counted on your fingers, whereas, I understand that there have been hundreds of fines imposed in connexion with Southern butters. Possibly this is another argument the Federal people may use for reducing the moisture to 15 per cent., but I should think it is rather rough on Queensland to have to suffer until the present system in vogue in Queensland is given a trial as far as the other States are concerned.That is the opinion of an export agent, and I am satisfied that it is a fair and unbiased one. When T received this letter I made inquiries, both on the Darling Downs and up in the Maranoa, as to the accuracy of the statements which it contained, and every one to whom I spoke - both factory managers and dairy-farmers - assured me that they were absolutely correct. Here is another statement by Mr. Mant -We certainly think that, as far as Queensland is concerned, at any rate, 16 per cent, maximum is necessary. We fail to see why it should be altered, considering that this standard passes the London market, which practically rules the world. If the moisture limit is reduced to 14 per cent, the buyers in London are more likely to reap the benefit than the producers, and there is no doubt about it that butter containing 16 per cent, moisture can be of excellent quality. 1 have no desire to labour this question, as I know that honorable members are anxious to proceed to a vote. I hope that the House will recognise the need for some revision of the regulation. As a matter of fact, if J. were the Minister, I would not allow the motion to proceed to a division. The dairying industry ranks third among the industries of Australia, and its exports to England in 1909-10 were approximately of the value of ,£2,877,000. Surely that is worth some consideration. I ask the Minister now to agree to the motion.","N/A","MOISTURE IN BUTTER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[3]/continue[16]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

As a matter of fact, during the last forty years I have spent my whole energies in the manufacture of butter, so that anything I say to-day will describe my own experiences and express my own opinion. I have no desire to quote the opinions of others, except, perhaps, for the purpose of refuting them. The honorable member for Capricornia quoted Mr. OCallaghan and Mr. Crowe as dairy experts who he contends have recommended 15 per cent., but if the honorable member will look at the Journal of Agriculture of Victoria of 12th June, page 380, he will see, under the heading of  ButterAnalysis, a table showing the difference in results between butter containing boric acid and butter without any, together with the composition of each. It is shown that in sample numbered 19, the butter contained 83.92 per cent, of fat, 14.50 per cent, of moisture, .43 per cent, of salt, 1.06 per cent, of curd, and .092 of boric acid, and that the points awarded were 90 per cent. This means, I suppose, points awarded either by Mr. Crowe or by some of his experts. In another sample, numbered 37, the fat contents were 88.68 per cent., the moisture contents 9.00 per cent., the salt 1.55 per cent., the curd .77 per cent., and the points awarded were 87 per cent. It will be seen from this that butter which contained 14.50 per cent, of moisture was awarded three more points than butter which contained only 9 per cent, of moisture. Points may be awarded on the taste and smell of the men who judge the butter, but analysis is the only sure way of ascertaining the amount of moisture. I know from long experience that there is nothing more deceptive than the moisture contents of butter; it is almost impossible for any one to judge by looking at the butter, or by sticking the trier into it. I am surprised to see the evident anxiety of the honorable member for Melbourne to curtail the moisture percentage, and I think such views come with bad grace from a member of the medical profession. I remember, some time ago, I paid a medical gentleman 7s. 6d. for a prescription made up of 1 oz. soda hypo, and 15 ozs. aqua pura, and I paid a chemist 2s. 6d. for making up that prescription ; but I can believe that the water was the better part of the medicine. Some twelve months ago, when a deputation waited on the Minister of Trade and Customs from the Co-operative Companies, he said he would give the 15 per cent, regulation at least twelve months trial, although experience all over the world has fixed 16 per cent, as reasonable. In order to show that the industry is an important one and deserves some consideration, I may point out that the figures for 1910, which are the latest available, show that there was in that year exported from Australia 87,894,943 lbs., valued at .£3.951, 131- Charges have been made in this House and outside by some of our friends on the Ministerial side, to the effect that moisture in butter puts money into the coffers of the manufacturers or middlemen; indeed, the honorable member for Capricornia hinted this afternoon that it is the commercial men who benefit. 1 Mr. Higgs. - I believe the commercial men will get more of the benefit than will the dairy-farmers.","N/A","MOISTURE IN BUTTER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I wish to emphatically deny the imputation that butter manufacturers have any desire to adulterate their product. The honorable member for Richmond has made out a very good case, and has given us a let of expert opinion as to how butter should be manufactured, and so on. It is absolutely necessary, in order to make good butter, to wash it thoroughly, and the next question is - How much moisture should be taken out, or how much should be left in, good butter? Of course, what the honorable member for Capricornia desires to pump into the ears of the people of Australia seems a terrible indictment, but may T remind him that every ton of bread which is consumed contains half a ton of moisture? Vet nothing is said about that matter. I think that this new regulation will confer no benefit upon the producers; but, in time to come, it will undoubtedly lead to more adulteration than exists at present. Its only object is to protect the consumer on the other side of the water, who, I am quite sure, is well able to protect himself. It simply means allowing blenders oversea to manipulate our dry butter to their own advantage. Mr. Higgs. - How can it be manipulated ?","N/A","MOISTURE IN BUTTER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[4]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
348,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"SINCLAIR, Hugh","KRN","N/A","N/A","N/A",1671,"- A large proportion of our butter is being bought up for blending purposes. Quite recently a considerable quantity of it was sent away in an unsalted condition. That butter will be bought up by blenders on the other side of the world, and milk, and probably water, will be pumped into it. Every ounce of moisture that we take out of it here merely affords an opportunity to blenders oversea to put exactly that much more into it. I wish now to refer to an answer which was given by the Minister of Trade and Customs to a question which was put to him on the 10th July by the honorable member .for Maranoa. The honorable member asked -Whether he is aware that the British Board of Trade regulations allow butter containing up to 16 per cent, of moisture to be imported into Great Britain from any part of the world?I am quite sure that the Minister was not responsible for the reply given to that question, which reads -Yes; but as the standard of 16 per cent, in Great Britain was determined merely to meet the trade in Irish firkin butter, heavily charged with water, it has little application to, or influence on, the Australian standard, the object of which is to encourage the manufacture of pure high-class butter, and enhance its reputation abroad.The following, table shows the average moisture contents in butters tested for export from the Commonwealth and New Zealand during the past three years : -N/ANow. it has been contended that since this new regulation came into force there has been an increase in the moisture contents of butter. I do not think that tHat is the case. It is a well-known fact that during the past year the Department which has charge of this matter has paid a great deal more attention to butter than it did previously. During the past twelve months more samples have been tested by it than were tested formerly. Here I may be permitted to interpolate that it is not the sample that shows the most free moisture which contains the most moisture. The honorable member for Richmond was a little mixed upon this aspect of the question, but with the remainder of his speech I am in entire agreement. When I refer to  free  moisture, I mean moisture which will run away from butter or shows itself freely. I wish now to refer to an article which was written by Mr. Crowe, and published in the Agricultural Journal. It is a very useful article, although, to some extent, it tells against the argument which I am now advancing. I commend Mr. Crowe for the article, and if it were not for the fear of wearying theHouse, I should be very glad to get the whole of it into Hansard. In speaking of the moisture contents of butter, he says that the average moisture contents of all samples analyzed during the past year was 13.91, as against 13.82 for 1910-11. That is an increase of only . 9 per cent. He further says that the Western District averaged 14.12 per cent., the Co-operative factories showed a percentage of 14.9, and the proprietary of 14.15. In Gippsland the average was 14.06; Co-operative, 14.12; proprietary, 13.89. In the north and northeast, the average was 14.01 ; Co-operative, 13,96 ; proprietary, 14.16. In the city the average was 13-74.This is what I particularly wish to call attention to -One hundred and thirty-one consignments, representing five thousand and eight boxes, contained over fifteen per cent. The following is a summary of the 3,394 samples analyzed - over 16 per cent., 45 samples, 1.33 per cent. ; over 15 per cent., 154 samples,. 4.53 per cent. ; over 14 per cent., 1,458 samples, 42.96 per cent. ; over 13 per cent., 1,231 samples, 36.27 per cent. ; under 13 per cent., 506 samples, 14.91 per cent.It will be seen that, although the average moisture contents in Victoria were 13.91, a large number of samples were tested which contained over that amount, whilst 199 odd samples contained over 15 per cent. At this stage I ask leave to continue my remarks on a future occasion.Leave granted ; debate adjourned.","N/A","MOISTURE IN BUTTER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[4]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The telegram which I have received in reference to the matter reads as follows : -I have complaint to make about the treatment I received from the free labourers working for Federal Government on telegraph line from Nullagine to Peak Hill. Started to cook for the gang on the 22nd May; all went well to the 10th of July, when the free labourers insulted me in the execution of my duty as cook; told the manager get another cook, I would not cook for such men ; reached Nullagine on 16th ; one of the same men assaulted me in camp, and another called out,  Give it to him. I reported the matter to the manager, Mr. Grant. Will the Postmaster-General have inquiry at Nullagine, as all the party are here, and decide who will have to go on the road, unionist or free labourer.As these men may be scattered shortly, I suggest that immediate action, with a view to an early inquiry into the circumstances, should be taken. It is extraordinary that a man should be set upon in this way, apparently because he happens to be a unionist. First of all, I see no reason why free labourers should be employed on work of the kind where equally competent union labour is available. I notice that the right honorable member for Swan is willing to cheer an assault on unionists.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I happen to know sufficient about the inner workings of newspapers to enable me to discount their criticism of my conduct. My experience on the press as a reporter warrants me in saying that I know what is expected from a reporter. And I doubt whether any decent newspaper expects its representative in this Parliament to take up a partisan attitude, or would knowingly allow him to gratify in its columns his personal bias. It certainly was not expected of journalists in my time on the press. I never object to what a newspaper says about me if it represents fairly what I have .said and1 done. I think that the position of politicians generally is this - that newspapers can say whatever they like about them, as long as they report them fairly, and give the public an opportunity of learning the true facts on which the journals comment. Unfortunately, however, that is not the experience of honorable members in this House. For instance, I hold in my hand a copy of a report sent to the Sydney Morning Herald about the debates in this House last week. Of course, this is not the first time that the creature who is responsible for these reports - and I say, as an old newspaper man, that in my opinion he is utterly incompetent for the position in which, he is placed-","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[2]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Then there is an implication that Ministers were insincere in voting in favour of the report of the Commissioners, and that the whole thing was a put-up job. The real truth is, of course, that Ministers took a very high stand, quite different to that of the late Government in similar circumstances. If our Ministers had followed the precedent established by honorable members opposite, they would have voted for the rejection of the Commissioners report. I think, personally, that Ministers acted under a mistaken sense of loyalty to the Commissioners. The . latter - are fallible human beings, liable to err like the rest of us; and if the House thinks they have made an error, there is no . reflection on them in sending their report back for reconsideration.

There is a general implication throughout the whole article that the Labour party, in voting against these divisions, endeavoured to gain a party advantage. Although all the members of the Labour party, outside the members of the Government, with the exception of the Whip, voted against the scheme, I point to the remarkable fact that every member of the Opposition, to a man, was whipped up to vote for it. If there is any party movement on one side, there certainly is a party movement on the other.

407,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CATTS, James","JWO","Cook","N/A","N/A",1676,".- I wish to ask the Attorney-General when his Department will be in a position to announce the best way of giving effect to the policy of the Minister of Defence on the question of the fining of cadets for non-attendance at drill ? Injustice seems to have been meted out in a number of these cases in New South Wales. The lads are called up before stipendiary magistrates, and bundled through without any consideration being given to their cases. In Several instances it could have been shown, if the boys had been allowed to state their case, that it was impossible for them to attend the drills, but the magistrates, as I have often noticed in Police Courts, have the lads simply bundled up and charged, no statement of the case is allowed, the cases are run through as fast as possible, and a fine or imprisonment awarded. I understand that the Minister of Defence has decided to adopt a policy of fining the lads 2s. for each hour lost at drill, and compelling them to make up their lost time. He stated that the matter had been referred to the Attorney- Generals Department on 25th July, so that the necessary steps could be taken to enable the Governor-General in Council to give effect to his ideas. I wish to impress on the Attorney-General the urgency of inviting the officers of his Department to go into the matter immediately, so that the cases of injustice which are occurring under the law as it stands may be remedied.Another matter to which I wish to direct the attention of the Attorney- General is the Bill that has been drafted by the Victorian Cabinet to provide for the voluntary surrender to the Commonwealth of various additional powers and functions, on the lines agreed upon at the State PreThe control of labour and employment, so far as is necessary to enable the Federal Parliament to prevent and settle industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State, and to provide that any condition of employment determined by any award or order of any authority constituted under any law of the Commonwealth for the prevention or settlement of any such industrial dispute shall, if such authority so determine, be a common rule of the industry concerned in the case of any State or States where -Wages or conditions of employment in the industry have been determined by a State industrial authority, orThere is no State industrial authority empowered to determine wages or conditions of employment in the industry.Provide that any condition of employment determined by any award or order or common rule of such authority shall be binding upon all persons subject to such award, or common rule, notwithstanding that such persons may be subject to the award or order of any State industrial authority ; and shall to the extent of any inconsistency prevail over such last-mentioned award or order.That is so involved that I, as a layman, cannot understand what the proposed transfer of industrial powers amounts to. Will the Attorney- General arrange with the officers of his Department to draft a memorandum indicating to honorable members what it really means? There is another proposed transfer of power with regard to monopolies which is stated in this way -On the question of monopolies, the Bill will provide for the surrender to the Commonwealth of authority over -Combinations and monopolies in relation to the production, manufacture, or supply of goods or services so far as is necessary to enable the Parliament of the Commonwealth to control or to acquire on just terms the business or industry of any such combination or monopoly, when such business or industry extends beyond the limits of any one State, and when such combination or monopoly has been declared by the High Court to be in restraint of trade or commerce to the detriment of the public ; or to carry on the business or industry so extending by or under the control of the Parliament of the Commonwealth to the exclusion, if the Parliament of the Commonwealth so determines, of all other persons; or to acquire upon just terms any property used in connexion with such business or industry of any such combination or monopoly.I am in the same position with regard to this proposal. This is a matter which concerns the Commonwealth Parliament as well as the State Parliament, and I think that honorable members might very well have the services of the Attorney-GeneralsDepartment placed at their disposal in order that they may be informed as to the -extent of the proposed transfer of powers. The third proposed transfer of powers is stated in these words -In order that the Commonwealth may have further power to deal with competition arising between the States, the measure will further declare that -A State industrial tribunal shall have power to make complaint to a State Court that an industry is injured by unfair competition in -the same industry in another State.A State Court shall be empowered to refer the complaint to the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, or to any authority constituted under any law of the Commonwealth for the prevention or settlement of any industrial dispute extending beyond the limits of any one State.Such Commonwealth Court or authority shall have power to inquire into the complaint.Such Commonwealth Court or authority on being satisfied that the injury is solely caused by the conditions of labour under which the employes in the competing industry work, may determine and adjust the matter complained of and prevent unfair competition.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is very desirable that we should have a memorandum prepared by the Attorney-Generals Department, to supply us with precise information as to the extent of the proposed transfer of powers from- the -States to the Commonwealth.There is another matter to which I refer, which concerns the Minister of the Department for External Affairs. As the honorable gentleman is not present at the moment, I hope that he will see the report of my remarks later on, and will make inquiry into the matter. In the Sydney Sun during last week, an article appeared from the pen of Harry S. Gullett, dated from London, 21st June, in regard to the immigration policy of the New South Wales Government. I quote the following paragraph from that article -Tas Family Scandal.Another point about which the emigration agents are concerned is the almost absolute refusal of New South Wales to accept working men with families. Lately I have heard of .a number of cases of farm labourers of the best kind, and also of small farmers possessed of a little capital, who have been refused assistance to New South Wales. They are told that they cannot be accepted because of their children. One recognises the difficulty of placing such mcn in country employment. Obviously the farmer who wants a labourer fails to sec why he should be obliged to support the labourers wife and half-a-dozen youngsters too young to be of any assistance. But, while admitting this, it is most unfortunate that the immigration movement should find it impossible to include the very best material that is on offer.The proportion of ultimate failures among child emigrants would certainly be much lower than that among adults. It is extremely difficult to explain to the British people that an immigration scheme which is really sincere can find no room for the healthy growing child. New South Wales has been especially hostile to children ; Queensland has been far more sympathetic, and so has Victoria; while Canada has also had an open door for them. They are carried cheaply by the shipping companies, and it is a great pity that the State Government cannot devise some means to receive all that are on offer.I do not know whether that statement is correct, and I should be very sorry to think that it is. I refer, to the matter because this Parliament cannot altogether escape responsibility in connexion with the question of immigration. It is one of the matters over which we have authority under the Constitution. If we find that the State Governments are carrying out an unsatisfactory immigration policy, if is, in my opinion, our duty to exercise our authority. I suggest that the- Minister of External Affairs should make inquiries from the New South Wales Government with respect to the matter to which I have directed attention.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[4]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
