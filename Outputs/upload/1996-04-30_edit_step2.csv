I table a statement of reasons justifying the need for these bills to be considered during these sittings, and seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard .Leave granted.The statement read as follows —Therapeutic Goods Amendment BillN/A1996 Winter SittingsN/AStatement of reasons for introduction and passageN/AAmendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act will address a major industry concern about the length of time involved in processing the less critical therapeutic goods for approval.International pharmaceutical and related product manufacturers are increasingly concentrating manufacture in countries where the regulatory environments provide quick and efficient clearance of their products. Australia has been able to expand significantly its pharmaceutical industry over recent years partly because of its efforts in streamlining the regulatory arrangements. The amendments contained in the Bill will support a new Electronic Lodgement Facility (ELF) system which will reduce the processing time for the large volume of less critical therapeutic goods from the current average of 5 months to a maximum of 14 days, with significant cost savings to industry and Government.Due to extensive publicity since June 1994, virtually all significant Australian manufacturers have adjusted their operational arrangements in anticipation of the introduction of ELF, including the purchase of new hardware and the ELF software packages and undertaking staff training. Many have built up a substantial backlog of products in anticipation of being able to take advantage of the new system on commencement of the ELF. Early passage of the amendments in the Winter Sittings 1996 is critical in reducing the disruption to the industry caused by delay in the availability of new products to Australian consumers. Delay in passage of this legislation has resulted in:. capital losses alone of about $4m at the end of 1995, escalating by between $3000&hyphen;$11000 per day per major company;. extra staff costs to Government of maintaining the current inefficient assessment system; and. failing to capitalise on the $.75m already invested by Government in the new ELF system.Search and seizure provisionsWith the passage of time, existing problems to be addressed by the proposed amendments will become more widely known and vulnerable to abuse by less scrupulous operators seeking to avoid or undermine the regulatory framework applying to therapeutic goods.Circulated with the Authority of the Minister for Health and Family ServicesHealth Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment BillN/A1996 Winter SittingsN/AStatement of reasons for introduction and passageN/AThe purpose of the proposed Bill is to amend the Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Act 1994 (the Act) by removing the sunset clause (clause 2) from the Act. A consequential amendment will be made to repeal Item 68 of the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Act 1995 .The reason for seeking introduction and passage of the legislation in the same sittings is that the sunset clause means that the Act in entirety will cease to be in force from 1 July 1996.Without the removal of the sunset clause, the Health Insurance Commission will have no powers of investigation.What this means, in effect, is that the very reason for the HICs existence in terms of investigating fraud and overservicing will be undermined. It will not be able to actually conduct investigations and take action to eliminate fraudulent practices without the powers entrusted to it by the Act, which include the power to obtain and execute search warrants. Without these powers, the effectiveness of the HIC as a regulatory body over medical practices is debilitated and without substance.The sunset clause was successfully moved as a result of a hearing before the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs investigating concerns expressed by a number of medical and other organisations that the Commission could abuse the powers of investigation the Bill was to provide.The introduction of the sunset clause ensured that there would be ample opportunity to review the manner in which the Commission has exercised its powers of investigation before considering whether the Commission should keep those powers.Amending legislation was not introduced earlier to ensure that the Parliament would have a maximum period in which to assess whether the Commission had or had not abused those powers of investigation since the Act came into effect on 21 July 1994.Circulated with the Authority of the Minister for Health and Family ServicesN/AStatement of reasons for introduction and passageN/AHazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1996N/AAgreement of the Senate is sought for introduction and passage in the current Sittings of the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1996 .The purpose of the bill is to amend the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1989 (the Act) to enable Australia to meet its international obligations under the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Waste and Their Disposal (Basel Convention) and relevant Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Council Decisions. The Act is at present deficient in that it generally only covers wastes for final disposal (incineration, landfill, etc), whereas the Convention also regulates wastes traded for recovery operations (reclamation of metals, recycling, etc).The reasons for seeking introduction and passage in the current Sittings are:existing legislation does not ensure Australia will meets its international obligations under the Basel Convention and the other international instruments relating to hazardous waste to which it is a party. Clear breaches of our international obligations have occurred in the past and may potentially be repeated because of the Governments incapacity to carry out the proper notification and consent procedures. The existing legislation does not cover all materials that, under international law, should be regulated. Amendment to the Hazardous Waste Act is necessary to ensure Australia can discharge its international law obligations.As a result of the deficiencies in the existing legislation, shipments are being delayed and in some cases they have been held up at their destinations or prosecutions have been threatened.Australias credibility in current international debates on hazardous waste issues continues to be damaged by the deficiencies in the present Act. It is imperative that Australia be in a strong position to influence future developments in relation to the Basel Convention.If the Bill is not debated this Sittings, there will be at least nine to twelve months before the Govern ment will have the authority to ensure trade in hazardous wastes is properly regulated.Circulated with the authority of the Minister for the EnvironmentN/A","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[3]/speech/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

refused to table documents, claiming that to do so would be contrary to the public interest; and(c) noting that such refusals are a prima facie contempt of the Senate; and(d) conscious of the merit of creating an agreed parliamentary mechanism for the production of government documents which:(i) respects the constitutional powers of the Senate; and(ii) enables a responsible, balanced and confidential assessment to be made of the effects on the public interest of the release of particular documents; and(e) recognising that the Parliament has, in legislation such as the

the governments claim to maintain the secrecy of certain documents, even when those parliamentarians undertake to observe the most rigid secrecy in assessing those documents; and(iii) demonstrates in such actions its lack of faith in the parliamentary system and in the cogency of its own case for secrecy; represents a threat to the stability, integrity and effectiveness of the parliamentary

print media ownership referred to in paragraph (20) be laid before the committee, by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Robert Hill) as soon as practicable after, but not later than 48 hours after, the committees first meeting.(13) That, if the documents referred to in paragraph (12) are not laid before the committee as required by the order of the Senate contained in this resolution, the committee is to report that fact to the Senate as soon as practicable.(14) That, when the documents referred to in paragraph (12) are laid before the committee as required, the

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator HILL","BH4","N/A","N/A","Leader of the Government in the Senate)","N/A","—I move:That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death, on 18 April 1996, of the Honourable Sir Hubert Ferdinand Opperman OBE KSJ, a member of the House of Representatives for the division of Corio from 1949 to 1967, Minister for Shipping and Transport from 1960 to 1963 and Minister for Immigration from 1963 to 1966, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.Sir Hubert Opperman was born at Rochester, Victoria, on 29 May 1904. He started his working life as a messenger boy for the Melbourne Herald . It was not long before he joined the Postmaster&hyphen;Generals Department, where he rode a bicycle as a telegraph messenger and began his lifelong passion for cycling.Sir Hubert entered his first bicycle race in 1919, and quickly went on to make cycling history, both here in Australia and overseas. Among his many cycling achievements, Sir Hubert held the title of Australian road cycling champion in 1924, 1926, 1927 and 1929; captained Australias Tour de France team in 1928 and 1931; won the French Bol dOr race in 1928 and the Paris&hyphen;Brest&hyphen;Paris marathon in 1931; set a new record for riding between Lands End and John OGroats in England; and won the Bidlake Memorial Prize in 1934.Sir Hubert retired from cycling in 1940, but not before breaking more than 100 records in a 24&hyphen;hour cycling marathon around the old Sydney velodrome. At least one of his cycling records, remarkably, still stands today, making him one of the great national sporting legends of all time.Sir Hubert served in the Royal Australian Air Force from 1940 to 1945, was commissioned in 1942, and held the rank of flight lieutenant when he was discharged in 1945. Sir Hubert entered federal politics in 1949 when he won the seat of Corio. His maiden speech in Parliament was characterised by his concern for the less fortunate: rural Australia, pensioners, war widows and war veterans. He believed in a community pulling together for the common good, and expressed his faith in the Australian worker.Sir Hubert served this Parliament for 17 years, in the various offices that I mentioned earlier and on a number of parliamentary committees. He was also a trustee of the Parliamentary Retiring Allowances Trust from 1959 to 1960.It was Sir Huberts task as whip to welcome new members and help them settle down, answering their questions on when to speak, on leave and about their offices. It was at one of these meetings that a tall young member from country Victoria, one Malcolm Fraser, asked, `How tough can you be on the opposition in your maiden speech? Sir Hubert was said to have advised in a characteristically short, simple and sturdy manner, `Malcolm, if you have something to say, say it. No-one will think any the worse of you for that.In 1967 Sir Hubert resigned from parliament to become Australias first High Commissioner to Malta, where he served until 1972. As Minister for Immigration he helped speed the demise of the White Australia policy by relaxing naturalisation requirements for non&hyphen;Europeans—an achievement he singled out for mention in his valedictory address.Many distinguished parliamentarians have passed through this parliament but few could claim such remarkable achievements in a multitude of careers—in sport, in politics and in the service of this country. Sir Hubert was appointed an officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in 1953 in recognition of his outstanding service during Australias Golden Jubilee celebrations in 1951, when he was given the complex and difficult task of organising the sporting section of the celebrations. He received his knighthood in 1968.Sir Hubert documented some of his remarkable life and career in his book Pedals Politics and People , published in 1977. In the foreword to the book, Sir Robert Menzies had this to say about his former minister:Hubert Opperman was, and is, a man of singular understanding and remarkable courage. During my term as Prime Minister he was unquestionably one of my greatest assets.Sir Hubert continued to lead an active life after his retirement. He was the Vice&hyphen;President of the Association for the Blind for 12 years and then continued to serve as an honorary councillor. He was also an honorary member of the St Kilda Rotary Club. In 1984 Sir Hubert was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame. In 1991 he received one of Frances highest awards, the Golden Medal of the City of Paris.`Oppy, as he became known to us, held a unique place in Australian history and in our hearts. He will be sadly missed by all of us. On behalf of the government, I extend to his wife, Lady Mavys, son Ian and other members of the Opperman family our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[26]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

He was the son of a butcher. Oppy left school to join the post office as a telegram boy, which was a tremendous advantage for him because the job allowed him to ride a bike.During the twenties and thirties he set more than 100 world cycling records, some of which stand to this day. As Senator Hill has said, in 1928 he won the Bol dOr in France. This was a remarkable achievement. He came from 17 laps behind to do that. That was even more extraordinary when you consider that the bike he was to ride in the race had been sabotaged. Not only did he overcome that obstacle, but he set a new world record. Another of his outstanding wins was in 1931 in the 1,160 kilometre Paris&hyphen;Brest&hyphen;Paris race, which is the worlds longest non-stop road race.In 1937 he broke the Fremantle&hyphen;Sydney record by an incredible five days. In 1939 he held nine world records, four English road records, 13 interstate records, five Australian records and 32 state records. His Sydney&hyphen;Melbourne record of 39 hours 41 minutes stood for 38 years until 1967. In fact, so great were his achievements as a cyclist that many competitors wanted to see the rules changed so that they could have a crack at some of those records.As Senator Hill has said, he enlisted in the RAAF in the Second World War as an aircraftman and was discharged as a flight lieutenant. In 1949 he was successful in winning the seat of Corio. He was the government whip from 1955 to 1960, Minister for Shipping and Minister for Immigration. As Minister for Immigration he inaugurated the Opperman doctrine, which effectively spelt the beginning of the end of the White Austral ia policy. He resigned from parliament in 1967.It was a very great achievement for him to win the seat of Corio. He defeated a very popular and outstanding local member in J.J. Dedman, a minister in many Labor governments. It took Labor a very long time indeed to win that seat back. Eventually, Gordon Scholes won the seat of Corio after Oppy had retired. Gordon Scholes had contested the seat and had been very roundly defeated when Sir Hubert Opperman was the Liberal Party candidate.He was an extraordinarily popular local member. His record in that seat—which he won by a very narrow majority in 1949, then building the majority to many thousands—was a great achievement on his part, even though it did cause the Labor Party great agony for a very long time in that seat.Oppy will be remembered as one of Australias greatest sporting heroes. He contributed a very great deal to Australia. I do not think his achievements will ever be forgotten. On behalf of the opposition in the Senate, I offer my most sincere condolences, and those of the opposition, to Lady Opperman, other members of his family and his very many friends.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[26]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Sir Hubert Opperman was one of Australias greatest sporting legends and one of the best cyclists the world has ever seen. His story is one of great achievement and personal triumph, rising from telegraph boy to winner of so many medals and so many events. He set more than 100 world records along the way and at least one of them stands now, over 60 years later. He is also to be remembered for his great contribution to Australian public life through his war, parliamentary and government and diplomatic service.Sir Hubert was born in 1904 in Rochester in Victoria. He first developed his cycling skills in one of his earlier jobs delivering telegrams for the post office. His first cycling win was at the age of 17 against a champion field, and that showed the way. His dominancy of Australian and international cycling was to hold for the next 20 years.Included amongst his wins were the Australian road cycling titles in 1924, 1926, 1927 and 1929. He twice captained the Australian Tour de France team and won the 24&hyphen;hour road race in 1928. Sir Huberts superlative efforts in the 1939 non-stop cycle marathon at the Sydney velodrome, where he broke 101 Australian and international records, was one of his greatest achievements before he retired from competitive cycling in order to make a contribution to Australias war effort by joining the RAAF in 1940 as an aircraftman. He rose to the rank of flight lieutenant and was based at a squadron in Queensland.In 1949 Sir Hubert embarked on the next successful phase of his life when he entered federal politics as member for the seat of Corio under the Menzies Liberal government. His capabilities were recognised by Mr Menzies and he held a variety of key portfolios during his 18-year political career. After serving as government whip in 1955, Sir Hubert was elevated to shipping and transport minister in 1960, which ministry he held for three years. As immigration minister in 1963, his policy decisions allowing non-European migrants possessing qualifications positively useful for Australia to settle in Australia, as well as reducing the qualifying residential period for non-Europeans from 15 years to five years, were the first critical steps towards the end of the White Australia policy. It was during that time that he was knighted in recognition of his immense sporting achievements and his great contribution to public life.When he stepped down from public office in 1972, Sir Hubert continued to make a contribution to Australia through his tireless voluntary work for the Association for the Blind in Victoria, where he served as vice-president for 12 years and then as honorary councillor. In 1977 his autobiography Pedals Politics and People was published.Sir Huberts love for cycling remained with him all his life. At the great age of 90 he took his last ride on his beloved 50&hyphen;year&hyphen;old Mal vern Star bicycle through his home town of Rochester, cheered by thousands of adoring spectators. We all mourn the loss of such an outstanding Australian, and on behalf of the National Party in the Senate I extend sympathy to Sir Huberts widow and the Opperman family and friends.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[26]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator SHORT","DJ4","N/A","N/A","Assistant Treasurer)","N/A","—I too would like to join in the condolence motion moved by Senator Hill for the passing of Sir Hubert Opperman, who was a truly great Australian. His sporting prowess, reflected in his achievements and international reputation, ranks him amongst the all&hyphen;time greats of Australian sportsmen. He has been compared most closely to Sir Donald Bradman as being one of the true greats of Australian sport. Others have spoken of his achievements in that area and I do not wish to go over those. Although the strength of his sporting prowess overshadowed his other achievements, it was the variety of things for which he built such a great reputation that made him such a great Australian.Sir Hubert was a very notable politician. He was one of the new breed of politicians that swept to power with Sir Robert Menzies in 1949. He successfully contested eight federal elections against some very strong opposition. As has been said, in winning the seat of Corio in 1949 he defeated a very influential and highly respected member of the Labor Party in the late John Dedman. He fought off many fierce challengers in the ensuing years, including—in one of his earlier contests—Bob Hawke, who later became Prime Minister of this country.In his parliamentary service, Sir Hubert was the government whip for more than four years. He was a minister in the parliament for almost seven years. As the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) noted in his comments, during a very notable period as Minister for Immigration, in March 1966, Sir Hubert presided over changes to Australias immigration policy and Immigration Act. Those changes are generally recognised as marking the beginning of the end of the White Australia policy. Many people, including me, would regard the decisions that were taken by Sir Hubert Opperman as the Minister for Immigration in March 1966 as effectively abolishing the white Australia policy, although the final vestiges of that policy were swept away later on by successive governments.After leaving politics, he was appointed as Australias first High Commissioner to Malta. Malta at that time, as it still is now, was very important for Australia because of the very significant Maltese population in this country. Indeed, it is often said that there are more Maltese in Australia than there are in Malta. As the first High Commissioner to Malta, he was instrumental in building on the relations with the Maltese community in Australia and between the two nations.He had a distinguished career of service in the forces during the Second World War. After his retirement he spent many years doing very active and very valuable work on behalf of many persons in the Australian community—that is, those aged persons in our community—particularly in his own later years.On his death many things have been said and many tributes paid. The one that struck me as summing up in many ways the essence of Sir Hubert Opperman came from Sir James Killen, who was interviewed on radio shortly after Sir Hubert died. He said:But Opperman captured what to me is the greatest of all human qualities and he expressed it splendidly. He understood the greater state of humility. No matter what he did or where he went, Oppie was always the same. Now, throughout the whole of his life, that diffidence was there. Oppie never, to use an Australian expression, put on any side at all. He was always the same, no matter where you saw him, no matter what was going on. He was the simple, uncluttered Hubert Opperman.I had the pleasure of knowing Sir Hubert a little. I had met him over a period of 30 years, and I think Sir James Killens summation of the character of Sir Hubert Opperman was very accurate indeed. He will be very sadly missed by Australia. He will be remembered as a very great Australian. I join other speakers in conveying to his wife, Mavys, our deepest sympathy at his passing—a passing that will be mourned by us all.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[26]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator OCHEE","EU4","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","—It is with a sense of deep humility that we rise today to address the condolence motion on the passing of this great Australian because, by any measure, Sir Hubert Opperman was a great man, a great parliamentarian and a great Australian. His achievements will live on for many years yet, even though he has left us. But I think it is important that we celebrate the character of Sir Hubert Opperman, the very fine qualities for which he stood. I note in his autobiography, Pedals Politics and People , he spoke with a sense of humility about the people in England who cheered him on as he cycled from Lands End to John OGroats. He said:They still represent to me, however the Olympic oath may be read, and its spirit be extolled, a demonstration of the most admirable and self&hyphen;effacing fidelity to sport and the stranger in their midst I have yet encountered.Those words could equally be applied to Sir Hubert Opperman because he believed in all of the self&hyphen;effacing fidelity to sport and also had a warm welcome for the stranger in our midst. It was his achievements as Minister for Immigration which changed the face of this nation, not just in a literal sense but also in a very real spiritual sense. I stand here as a demonstration of the achievement by Sir Hubert Opperman of a fairer Australia.I also stand here being the beneficiary of his mentor, Sir Bruce Small. Some honourable senators may know that Sir Bruce Small followed Sir Hubert Opperman into politics but it was Sir Bruce Smalls example as a leader of men and as somebody who encouraged others to find their true worth which was always extraordinary.I remember the story of Sir Hubert Opperman finishing at John OGroats. As he got close he said to Sir Bruce, `Ill be lucky to reach John OGroats—Ill have to forget the 1,000—miles, that is. Bruce Small said, `Sure, if you can now break the End to End, after the 24—that is, the 24 hours—`thats good enough. You can have a go at the 1,000 some other time. Little did Sir Hubert Opperman know that what Sir Bruce Small meant by `some other time was four hours later because, having reached John OGroats, Bruce Small gave him four hours slumber then woke him up, dressed him, put him back on a bicycle and sent him off in pursuit of the record for 1,000 miles, which he achieved in three days, one hour and 52 minutes. That is an extraordinary achievement by any stretch of the imagination. I think it would be fair to challenge any of todays cyclists, on the roads of that time and on the bicycles of that day, to equal that achievement. In that story you can see the immense commitment and courage that Sir Hubert had.I conclude by saying that I was fortunate enough to speak to Sir Hubert on the phone on one occasion but I regret never actually meeting him. The condolences of all of us must go to his widow. Certainly we are much the poorer for his passing. He was a man of extraordinary humility and outstanding courage. With passion in his heart and guided by a sense of fairness for all, he made our nation a better place not just for his generation but for my generation and for generations who are yet to come.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[26]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator MICHAEL BAUME","LE4","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","—The late Sir Hubert Opperman maintained his commitment to sport and sports people to the very end. He even died riding his exercise bike, which is the nearest possible thing to his beloved Malvern Star. I would like to acknowledge in particular the kindness, courtesy and advice he gave to me during my years as shadow minister for sport.Despite his advanced age, Sir Hubert Opperman showed a great and continuing interest in sport, and its role in politics and vice versa, and in politics itself. In recent years he and his wife, Mavys, attended the Confederation of Australian Sports, Sports Star of the Year Award, which was held in Melbourne. There he gave encouragement and advice to young athletes. By his presence he enhanced the status and significance of those awards. He was a great Australian.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[26]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator KEMP","WW4","N/A","N/A","Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security)","N/A","—I wish also to support the condolence motion before the chamber today for Sir Hubert Opperman, fondly known as `Oppy. The outpouring of emotion which occurred on his death I think reflected the enormous standing that he had in the Australian community and the great affection that many Australians felt for him. In many ways he was an example of the great Australian dream—that someone, perhaps from a difficult background, through a stint of hard work, talent and ambition was able to achieve a great deal with his life.Others have spoken in detail about Sir Hubert Oppermans sporting record. I will not go over those matters which have been well raised by Senator Faulkner and others. But I will mention that one commentator in the last week rated Sir Hubert as one of the three greatest Australian sportsmen of all time—along with Don Bradman and Walter Lindrum.My colleague Senator Short referred to Sir Huberts great political achievement in winning initially, and holding on to, the very difficult seat of Corio, which prior to and after that had always been exceedingly difficult for the Liberal Party to win. He was able to hold on to Corio for 17 years, winning eight consecutive elections. He first won the seat of Corio in 1949, by 234 votes. He was able to increase that majority to close to 8,000 votes in his last election. The fact that Mr Gordon Scholes demolished this majority, winning the seat in the by-election after Sir Huberts retirement in 1967, is a testament to Oppys high standing in the community and his popularity. The seat has remained in ALP hands ever since.Others have spoken very highly of the record of Sir Hubert Opperman as a minister in the Menzies government. It is interesting to reflect on what the then Treasurer, Mr McMahon, said on the retirement of Sir Hubert Opperman: Oppys philosophy was that all men are equal, that all men have an equal right to success. Mr McMahon also said that no-one had made greater changes and greater reforms in our system of immigration in a few years than Oppy.In his farewell speech to the parliament, he called for the appointment of a minister for sport. I think that that was finally achieved quite a number of years later. He also lamented in that speech that the conscientious and arduous service by many men and women who choose to serve their country in this parliament is not always widely appreciated. I think some of us may agree with that. Certainly, we can also reflect that, if there were more like Oppy, perhaps the criticisms which are often levelled at politicians would not be so voluminous. I would like to send my condolences to his widow and to his son. I am sure that that reflects the feelings of all senators in this chamber.Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable senators standing in their places.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[26]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator HILL","BH4","N/A","N/A","Leader of the Government in the Senate)","N/A","—I move:That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death, on 8 April 1996, of the Honourable Michael Jerome (Mick) Young AO, a member of the House of Representatives for the division of Port Adelaide from 1974 to 1988, Special Minister of State in 1983 and from 1984 to 1987; Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Multicultural Affairs from 1984 to 1988; Leader of the House in 1983 and from 1984 to 1988; and VicePresident of the Executive Council in 1983 and from 1987 to 1988, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.Mick Young was born in Sydney on 9 October 1936. He came from an Irish Catholic background. He left school at the age of 15 to become a trainee wool classer, but took up shearing instead. It was in those early years that Mick became an organiser for the Australian Workers Union, where he developed a taste for politics and began a lifelong association with, and loyalty to, the Labor movement. Mick won the seat of Port Adelaide in 1974.In his maiden speech in the House of Representatives, he spoke of his `long journey from the shearing shed to this chamber, and paid special tribute to his roots, referring to `the education in hard union politics and the taste for politics stimulated by shearing life which shaped his career. He stated his faith in the Australian parliamentary system and touched on a wide range of issues, including the need to move towards equitable representation of women in parliament, pay and conditions for shearers and pastoral workers, reforms to electoral laws and community participation in the arts.Mick went on to become a key minister and office holder in the Labor ministry in the 1980s. His parliamentary performance established without question his formidable reputation as a strategist as well as a debater of devastating wit. Mick will be well remembered as a colourful and effective figure in the parliament.During his time in parliament, Mick also served on a number of parliamentary committees. These included the House of Representatives standing committees on environment and conservation, standing orders, and privileges; the House of Representatives Select Committee on Tourism; and the joint committees on foreign affairs and defence and the parliamentary committee system. For his service to the Australian parliament, Mick was appointed an officer in the general division of the Order of Australia in 1990.Senators opposite will no doubt speak of Micks unique contribution to the Labor movement. His credentials were impressive indeed. From modest beginnings, he went on to hold almost every significant position in the Labor Party, including the positions of federal secretary from 1969 to 1973 and federal president from 1986 to 1988.As a South Australian, I am well aware that it was during Micks time as organiser of the local branch of the ALP that the long rule of Sir Thomas Playford was ended when Labor won its first state election for 33 years in 1965.Mick never ignored his grassroots. He was known as the King of Port Adelaide. His personality reflected the earthy community of the port, and his electorate remained staunchly loyal to him throughout his time in parliament. Micks passing has touched people on both sides of this chamber. He was a very likeable person and will be sadly missed by all of us who knew him.On behalf of the government, I extend to his wife Mary, son Michael, daughter Janine, son&hyphen;in&hyphen;law Duane, and grand&hyphen;daughter Isabella our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[28]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator FAULKNER","5K4","N/A","N/A","Leader of the Opposition in the Senate)","N/A","—On behalf of the opposition, I rise to support the condolence motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate on the death of Mick Young.Micks death is a very great loss for us. It was another real blow, in fact, after the federal election defeat because Mick made an enormous contribution to the Australian Labor Party. In whatever role he played, whether it was in the trade union movement, in the party machine or in parliament, I think his commitment and his dedication to Labors cause was unparalleled.Mick was born in Sydney in 1936 and was the fifth of seven brothers. I suppose he had what is usually described as a very typical Irish&hyphen;Catholic background. When he left home at 15, apparently he was advised by his mother to join the union, bank Commonwealth and go to mass every Sunday. I do not know about the latter two, but I do know that he certainly did the former. In fact, he cut his political teeth in the 1950s in the shearing sheds and in the Australian Workers Union, and throughout his life his loyalty to Labor was absolute. From 1964 through to 1973, he was an organiser for the South Australian branch of the Labor Party, then secretary of the South Australian branch and, of course, federal secretary of the Labor Party.He is rightly credited with masterminding Gough Whitlams successful 1972 campaign. There was a great accolade from Gough Whitlam about Mick Young. Gough said that finding Mick Young was one of the greatest pieces of good fortune that the Labor Party ever had. He really was a very important force in forging the modern Labor Party, in making Labor a viable electoral force, in fact, in making the Labor Party electable. That often involved tough decisions and of course Mick Young was one of those parliamentarians who had a machine background.There are many people who represent the Labor Party in the House of Representatives and the Senate who come from a Labor Party machine background—I happen to be one of them and I am very proud of that—but there are very few who come through their time in the Labor Party machine unscathed. There are very few who come through their experiences in the Labor Party machine with their reputation enhanced, and that is exactly what Mick Young did. His advice and his counsel were sought often and I must say that when it was sought, it was heeded.He was always willing to lend a hand. In 1986 he became the national president of the party, and again he served the party with distinction. Just last year he was asked to conduct an audit into the Queensland branch of the Labor Party after Labors reversals in the most recent Queensland election.I suppose for many of us in this place it was when he was elected as the member for Port Adelaide that we recognised that Mick Young had become one of the most effective parliamentarians we have ever seen. He was a very prominent member of Labors shadow executive during the Fraser government years and during that difficult time for Labor he honed all his parliamentary skills.When Labor won in 1983, Mick Young became Special Minister of State and Leader of the House. As Leader of the House, I think his contributions were always effective—they were always hard&hyphen;hitting and they always demonstrated his trademark wit. I think Mick Young had real parliamentary style.Of course, it was not all peaches and cream in the parliament for Mick Young. I think there were three occasions when his ministerial career was interrupted, put on hold or, finally, brought to an untimely conclusion. But he will be, as Senator Hill has said, remembered by many for his efforts, particularly as a minister, in reforming Australias electoral laws and as immigration minister in moving Australia towards multiculturalism.As Leader of the House of Representatives, Mick Young had no equal. As a Labor Party loyalist, Mick Young had no equal. He was a great raconteur, a great wit, and he used those attributes as effectively as any person ever has in Australian politics. He was a great mate to many of us in the Labor Party, and mateship was all&hyphen;important to Mick Young. It was the Labor movement, in which Mick Young had so much faith, where he was most admired and most loved. Mick Young was a very great son of Labor. Our deepest sympathy goes to his wife, Mary; his daughter, Janine; his son, Michael; and all his family, his many friends and comrades. Mick, from all of us in the Labor Party, thanks.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[28]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Universally, I know that we were all saddened to learn of the passing of Mick Young after his battle with leukaemia.He was the basic person who represented social justice for the worker, a fair go for the underdog and an overriding notion of mateship. Mick Young was the essence of the traditional Australian Labor Party. He was born in Sydney and he was educated at Marist Brothers. He left home at 15 to become a wool classer. From there he worked his way through the Australian Workers Union, the South Australian branch of the Labor Party and, in 1968, was the South Australian secretary.In 1969, aged only 32, he became the national secretary of the ALP. As national secretary, Mick Young was the campaign director of the federal campaign that resulted in the Labor Partys landmark win after 23 years in opposition. In some ways, it was a great paradox that the quintessential representative of the old&hyphen;style Labor Party was responsible for engineering the campaign to widen the appeal of the Labor Party beyond its traditional base in order to make it electable for the first time in a quarter of a century. In doing so, he was responsible for its metamorphosis from the party of the blue&hyphen;collar battlers and the true believers into the ALP machine.Mick Young was elected to the House of Representatives from Port Adelaide in 1974 and held the seat for 14 years. He held a variety of ministerial appointments. He also held the post of minister for immigration, where he made a great contribution. He was also the Special Minister of State, and he oversaw significant changes in the electoral act. He also served as Leader of the House for five years and was highly regarded for the leadership and tactical skills he demonstrated in that role. He had a quick wit, a wonderful turn of phrase and impressive debating skills that he had developed, no doubt, in the shearing sheds and later in the party organisation. His use of humour, whilst not malicious, was nevertheless a very effective weapon in the parliamentary bearpits.In 1988, Mick Young stepped down as Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and resigned his seat in parliament. In the later years of his career he contributed to various advisory bodies and undertook consultancy work. Mick Young always remained true to his fundamental beliefs of social justice for the worker, a fair go for all and the defence of the underdog. A devoted family man, Mick Young will be greatly missed. I am sure all honourable senators will join with me in extending sympathy to Mick Youngs widow, Mary, children, Michael and Janine, and the remainder of his family and many friends.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[28]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator BOLKUS","XE4","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","—I also rise to speak on this condolence motion for Michael Jerome Young. Much has been said about him. Much has been written about him. I, and probably most speakers from the Labor Party side tonight, will probably get a bit more personal than others who have discussed Mick over recent weeks. Most of us on this side felt as though we had a special relationship with Mick Young. In a sense, that was part of his charm, part of his engaging character. If you met him and spent some time with him, the intimacy that grew between you and Mick was something that you well and truly remembered.I met Mick some 30 years ago. The night he died I was having dinner with John Rau in Adelaide and we both commented on the fact that for us there was probably very little we could remember in terms of life in politics before we met Mick Young in the mid to late sixties. Clyde Cameron quite often used to joke about the fact that he and Mick first came across me when I was still wearing shorts. That highlighted the fact that we had known each other for quite a long time and knew each other in a way that rarely happens in politics, certainly not as often as it should. For someone like Mick, who was dominant in politics in Labor in the sixties, to open himself up to younger people is something that I remember very well from those days in the mid to late sixties.He was a political associate. He was a friend. As a friend, I was pleased that he was able to accept the invitation to be master of ceremonies at my wedding to Mary just a couple of years ago. I was not so sure that I was impressed with some of the nicknames he used to give me over the years, but I can say we did have more than one meal together and during the course of those meals our friendship did grow.We worked together in opposition. I am sure Mick would have a few concerns about his condolence motion this afternoon. I am sure he would have preferred the condolence motion to have been moved by Labor in government. We had shared some time in opposition in the seventies and early eighties. I had worked for him during that period. I had worked for him in some of the portfolios that he held. We also worked together in South Australia on national campaigns and in the area of Port Adelaide. During Micks tenure of the seat of Port Adelaide, Port Adelaide became very much a focal point of Labor activity in South Australia.In more recent years since his retirement, I was pleased that he chaired the National Multicultural Advisory Council for me and pleased that he also played such a pivotal role in the visits last year, as part of the commemorations of the fiftieth anniversary of the end of World War II, of the Greek musician Theodorakis.To sum it up, very few had a greater influence on my life at the start and continuing over the decades than Mick Young. Together with Clyde Cameron, he helped me win endorsement and, together with people like Don Dunstan and Gough Whitlam, he helped mould the attitudes of not just me but so many people like me who came through the Labor movement in the late sixties and early seventies. He kept on working at it. He kept on being there at the other end of the phone, whether you expected him to ring or not, with some thought, some advice, some contribution that he felt should be made on the direction of government.He taught me lots but he also taught the Labor Party a lot. We were in government for more than 16 of the last 25 years. The genesis of much of this came in the late sixties and early seventies. As Senator Faulkner mentioned, the critical turning point for Labor was the `Its time campaign at the start of the seventies. Mick was there at the creation of that campaign. He is attributed as being the creator of it.The attitude of, in a sense, nothing being too good for the shearer, for the worker, for the Labor movement was something that drove him on through the seventies, eighties and nineties and he maintained his close liaison with government after he retired. The same attitude of tolerance of youth and inclusiveness, which led him to be a core part of Labor success in South Australia for the time that he was involved there and for a while thereafter, is something that I am sure we will strive to get back as we resurrect our fortunes.Mick taught many of us how to engage with the broader community. It just was not good enough to be isolated in Trades Hall on South Terrace. It was important that we branch out. In terms of branching out, Mick explored and enjoyed many of his loves in life, one of those being football—the team Port Adelaide comes to mind. Mick was a very important character in the Port Adelaide area and, to have any credibility in that respect, association with the Port Adelaide football club, which Mick had had for a long time, was important. It was not just a pastime for him; it was a place to build associations, to enjoy himself, and also to pick up a lot of ideas and thoughts that were applied in politics.His involvement with soccer, as chairman of the South Australian Soccer Federation, was something he took up in a full sense after he retired from parliament. Involvement in sport, involvement in soccer, is something which continued to be one of his loves but, again, it allowed him to interact with people. He was a peoples man and as such he gave lots and got a lot. I am sure people like Charlie Caruso and others at the soccer federation would remember very much Micks involvement in that federation.Mick found a lot of political inspiration through not just sport but the arts and music. Whether it was Joe Hill, Kevin Barry or Paul Robeson, whether it was African music or African dances, whether it was bringing book readings into the Port Adelaide FEC—and for those of us who have been involved in dry, ordinary branch structures of political parties to actually get someone in on a Sunday morning to read and lecture about a recent book publication was something that Port Adelaide had never seen before—for Mick it was a source of inspiration, a source of energy, that the people in the branch at Port Adelaide were entitled to have and, through having it, would have a better life.He had enormous passion, which did not come out publicly all that often. He had passion for indigenous Australians, black South Africans—those who were the victims of race discrimination. Whether it was the struggle of the ANC or the Springboks or whether it was supporting the arts of groups coming over from South Africa to Australia or the local indigenous people, his attitude was that these people were repressed—had lost lives and lost opportunities—and it was the greatest inequality for that to continue. It was a driving force for him, as was his involvement in Port Adelaide.When you look back—and I am sure Chris Schacht and other South Australians will talk about this—if you think of Port Adelaide before Mick Young and after Mick Young, you think of initiatives like the Parkes community centre, the annual picnic and the annual gala day. No-one was too good to miss the net of Michael Jerome Young and no-one was too good to miss the activities of the Port. So he had prime ministers and national entertainers down there. He awarded scholarships to those who otherwise would not have been able to pay to get through school and tertiary education. It was Mick, the local organiser, who really pushed forward the people of his area. It transpired that he did the same with submarines for South Australia and in his involvement with Roxby Downs.As someone who abhorred racial discrimination, a continuing concern of his was the multicultural society we were building here and the need for us to keep on building it. He was a strong believer in the equality of ethnic groups. I remember one night he rang up and said, `I was just watching the ABC and theyre talking about these Asian students. Dont they know theyre Australians, theyre Australian citizens? It was that sort of latent justice that he was concerned about. He was concerned, for instance, when the Vietnamese community was condemned for a murder for which they have not been tried.It was pleasing for me to have Mick officiate at what was to be his last public function, the launch of the multicultural Australia agenda of the government in Parramatta on 18 January. He was there, once again pursuing the interests of multiculturalism, but he was also there with his granddaughter Isabella, who had the chance to be introduced to the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating.He was inclusive, not only in terms of his electorate but, as Brian Johns said, if you were having lunch with Mick you did not know who you would find there or how long you would be expected to stay but you knew that you would be a full partner in it all. I was surprised once to get a phone call from him saying, `Im having a 75th birthday lunch for Gough Whitlam. Would you like to come? The array of people found there was typical of the way Mick regarded the friends in his life.He was a passionate man with a warm heart, lots of good sense and lots of humour. I remember once giving Mick a book I had discovered titled The First Irishmen was a Greek . Of course, he discounted the theory. But during question time that day a note went across from Mick to Paul Keating. Paul roared with laughter. When asked later what he had sent the then Treasurer, Mick showed me a piece of paper on which was written the heading of the book and a note saying, `Now I know what you and Andrew Theophanous have in common. Up until that moment none of us knew that they had all that much in common.I do not think that Mick deserved his premature end, either in politics or in life. In terms of the former, we have only to reflect on his achievements not just in South Australia but nationally. He did much, not just in terms of legislation but also in terms of Labors transition to government.As for his life, I suppose I was either fortunate or unfortunate to be there at the end. It was a phone call from Kim Beazley that alerted me to the fact that Mick would not survive all that much longer. Kim at that stage had spent the best part of two or three days in Micks hospital room. I flew down from Central Queensland and was able to see Mick on Saturday night and on Sunday morning, the day before he died. It was good to be able to share those last few moments with him and also to be there with Kim Beazley, whose effort in being in that hospital room for those few days was nothing short of heroic.It was all too short, his life, for a shearer who made it to the national ministry and a person who engaged so many people on the way through. I am sure that Mary, Michael and Janine, Janines husband Duane, and grand&hyphen;daughter Isabella are all fortified by the fact that they shared and enjoyed life with a person who is and will continue to be remembered as a real character in Australian politics. He achieved much, and the more I got to know him the more I realised that he would have been a great Australian Prime Minister if he had had the chance.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[28]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator COOK","RF4","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","—It is a sad occasion to have to offer condolences on the premature passing of Michael Jerome Young—Mick Young. Mick Young, I believe, was a great Australian and in many respects personified the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Labor movement.I would like to add my condolences to those already offered by a list of distinguished speakers in this chamber and in the other place to Micks wife Mary and the rest of the family. Mick Young has been much praised already in the eulogies at his requiem mass, in the newspaper columns that reviewed his career and in the speeches made in these chambers. All of the praise that has been heaped on him has been justified, well earned and sincerely given.He made an enormous contribution to the Australian Labor movement, and he made it at all levels, in most of the posts that the union movement, the party and the government have to offer. He is truly a great son of the Australian Labor movement.As has been said, he was a shearer, a union organiser, a party secretary at both state and federal level, a frontbencher when first elected as the member for Port Adelaide, and a minister. I first met him in Adelaide many, many years ago when he was a union official. He later became an assistant and then a full party secretary. I believe that, at the end of the Playford era in South Australian politics, he and Geoff Virgo were the architects of the election of the Frank Walsh government which led to the Dunstan era.Nationally, he is remembered as one of the chief architects of the `Its Time campaign for the 1972 election of the Whitlam government which, in my view, led to the creation of modern Australia and the modern Australian view of society and the world. That role was recognised by Gough Whitlam at the time and later. But Micks career continued beyond parliament. He was a consultant and adviser in business and a continuing member of the Labor Party.A lot has been said about Mick Youngs great wit. He was a devastating participant in parliamentary debate. He had what is rare these days—an ability to actually see the heart of a problem and express it in a way which devastated his critics or his target and gained a laugh from all sides of the chamber, and often the victim of his remarks as well. Wit is probably the most devastating political weapon anyone can have, and Mick had it in abundance.Mick was a shrewd judge of character, a shrewd judge of policy and politics and a person who always remained in touch with the ordinary Australian. He could express the view from the street and the view of the grassroots of the common Australian and do it succinctly and well and in a way in which policy could be moved to reflect those views. Very few people have that ability. He was an advocate for the underdog. That remained a defining characteristic of his personality for all of his life.People have commented on Micks ability as a connoisseur of Chinese food. I believe it was a taste he acquired when he, with Whitlam, first went to China and was part of the original expedition that opened China to Australia as the bamboo curtain was penetrated, before the 1972 election, in the lead-up to that election and as China was coming out from its isolation in the world. Following upon the American effort, Australia then made that contact. Mick had many friends in the Chinese bureaucracy at the very highest of levels. They are generous in their acknowledgment of him. He never conceded any policy positions but he always approached them on the basis of seeking a genuine understanding of their position—a rapprochement in the world for that nation. I think many in that country will miss him.All of those things have been said about Mick Young, as well as his legendary support for the black and whites—the magpies, or Port Adelaide—in South Australia. When I lived in South Australia I was always a North Adelaide supporter and therefore was persona non grata at football time with Mick Young. He was the archetypal mate—a genuine Australian who stuck by his friends, had a good time with them and chided them if necessary.In all of those things that have been said about Mick, there is almost a legendary character here. That is often expressed as colourful, ruffian and typically Australian. Those characteristics, true though they are and real though they are, ought never cloud the fact that Mick Young was a dedicated and serious person. He was a sophisticated politician. He was a creative thinker—a creative thinker in many respects in the working class cause—a resourceful and intelligent person and a great strategist and tactician. I regard him as the self-taught typical example of a working&hyphen;class intellectual who had a strong commitment to working&hyphen;class socialism and socialist ideology and who always sought to apply that in a modern way. He personified Labors legends, its roots and its traditions but captured that personification in ways that are relevant to the modern day and with a vision to the future as well.As I said, I met him early in his career in Adelaide. I was pleased to join with him in the formation of the centre left faction of the Labor Party in 1984 and serve with him in that faction—a faction much diminished over time but, nonetheless, one that played an important role. For me, just knowing Mick Young enriched me immensely. I owe him a great debt. He is an ideal model for many in the new Labor Party. His passing leaves not only a great gap in our ranks but also a great gap in the community of Australia.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[28]/debate.sub1/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator FOREMAN","GG4","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","—I wish to be associated with this condolence motion. Mick Young was my mate. He was always there when I needed advice. He was always wanting to have lunch or a drink. He was always telling a yarn or using his trademark rhyming slang to speak in code to his mates. His style was infectious. Those who hung around him could not help but pick up some of his quirks. We just wanted to support him because he was just so decent. Like a big cyclone, he would completely change your life while he was around. Very often you would be out with Mick and he would be working. He would be talking to people, giving advice, telling stories or, as was often the case, combining both. He liked to enjoy life, but his greatest enjoyment was gained by helping people make their contributions to the Labor movement and to the community.Probably Micks greatest role, as has been mentioned tonight, was his major role as the key architect of the 1972 `Its time campaign. Of all the political slogans that have been and gone, the `Its time campaign is one that is most remembered. This is not only so amongst politicians of both sides but in the community as well.Mick was compassionate, thoughtful and a true egalitarian. He did not place himself above others and showed a genuine concern for the lives and wellbeing of all he met. In the course of his life this relationship with people would be his greatest attribute. Nearly everyone in the South Australian branch has a Mick Young story. To many he was their hero. Port Pirie people often talk about Mick and the days when he was the AWU organiser there. Mick rose up the ranks of the Labor Party. I agree with Gough Whitlam, who once said that it was the ALPs good fortune to have found him.From shearer to cabinet minister, Mick stayed true to his values and the people he represented. Mick was loyal and committed to the industrial and political cause of Labor. He believed in the basic principles that underpin the Labor movement, but he also saw the need for the party to maintain its relevance in an ever&hyphen;changing community. Some media commentators have said that Mick was one of the old Labor men who would not approve of the modern Labor Party. Such a view does not take in account the fact that Mick was one of the most significant figures in the development of the modern Labor Party. Mick worked with Whitlam to improve the structure and responsiveness of the party. In the newer areas of public policy such as multiculturalism and indigenous reconciliation, Mick was more than just interested. As Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs he raised the profile of these issues within the Labor Party.It is true to say that Mick was a bridge between the old and new Labor eras. How ever, he really facilitated the opportunity for Labor to be broadly based and in government. Mick modernised the Labor Party after the devastating era which was dominated by the split. He took our party from a rigid organisation, which was at the time rather inward looking, to a positive, broadly democratic, inclusive party. He was one of the greatest federal officials we have had.After he left parliament, Mick was still called upon to give advice and support to Labor all around Australia. He happily contributed to the party until he died, never losing faith and never publicly attacking the party. Like everyone, he may have had problems with different aspects of policy from time to time, but he never used this to get publicity. Indeed, he shunned publicity. And who could blame him? The media treated him and his family in an appalling way during the attacks on him that he had to endure. Mick was a target because he was such an effective parliamentary performer.He was a true progressive who would never allow peoples misguided views to go unchallenged, but he would do this in such a way as to try to convince people that they should rethink their position. He was not high and mighty; he wanted to help people to see things clearly.They would be proud of Mick in Ireland. When we said goodbye a few weeks ago, we sang the old republican songs and celebrated his Irish Catholic heritage. The values that he developed from these ideas are ones that we as Australians should be very committed to. He really believed in a fair go for all.Mick was a tireless worker for the unemployed. In remembering Mick, I picked up a copy of his 1979 book, I want to work , in which he speaks on behalf of Australias unemployed at the time. Mick was committed to an active role for government in eliminating unemployment. He also believed in compassion for people who found themselves without work. I recommend to all senators that they read this book, if they have not already done so.The Labor Party in Port Adelaide has, like Port Adelaide Football Club, been an integral party of the community. In the time that Mick was the member for Port Adelaide, this was taken to new heights. In Port Adelaide he built the most effective political apparatus in the country. The large active membership and the diverse range of activities undertaken by the FEC and the sub&hyphen;branches was a model for the party. Mick supported young people in Port Adelaide by raising money to fund scholarships for educational opportunities. This was excellent publicity for the party.Mick made the port the focus of Labor activities in South Australia. With the purchase of the Colac Hotel, we had a place to meet, organise and congregate. The young up&hyphen;and&hyphen;coming Labor stars would come from all over the place to drink at the Colac. Other pubs and facilities in Port Adelaide were also a focus of Labor activity.Mick was a tireless worker for his electorate. He worked on the establishment of community facilities, such as the Parkes community centre, which reflected his desire that all members of the community should be able to live in a decent, supportive environment. On the jobs front, he was instrumental in getting the submarine contract for Port Adelaide. Internationally, Micks greatest achievement was to put the recognition of China on the agenda. This role was recognised by the Chinese government on many occasions.Since Mick left parliament, and then Adelaide, I have missed him. Now that he has left us altogether it is going to be hard, but Mick has left us with a great many memories and a party enriched by his involvement with it. Shirley and I are grateful to Mick and his family for the times we had together. We grieve with Mary, Michael, Janine, Duane and Isabella and we will always be there for the family of this true friend.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[28]/debate.sub1/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator SCHACHT","4J4","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","—I rise to speak on this condolence motion. Like other South Australian senators and Senator Peter Cook, who originally came from South Australia, I have a deep and abiding memory of Mick Young—for his contribution to both the Labor Party and the community, and also to me personally. Just as others have commented on how Mick helped them in their political involvement, Mick certainly helped me.The first thing that must be said—I agree with Senator Foreman—is that some of the commentators got it wrong when they said that Mick Young was the old Labor Party. Even Senator Boswell got it right when pointing out that it was Mick Young who rebuilt and reorganised the Labor Party to be a modern and effective political force.Many people now would not remember what the Labor Party was like in the mid&hyphen;1960s—a narrow, parochial, sectarian inward&hyphen;looking party bedevilled by states rights and bitter personal feuds going back over two or three decades. In that period there were three people who rebuilt the Labor Party. One of them was Gough Whitlam, the second was Don Dunstan and the third in the great trifecta was Mick Young.Mick Young has been given great recognition for the `Its Time campaign of 1972, and I fully endorse the remarks made in that regard. He should also be given great recognition for creating the Dunstan decade of the 1970s. It was Mick Young in the late 1960s who, in helping to modernise the party at the state level, put together the campaign that led to the Labor Party not only ending the Playford era of 33 years but also ending the gerrymander in South Australia that had kept Labor out of office for so long.Mick Young was a perfect foil to Don Dunstan. At the memorial service in Adelaide, at the ALP state council two weeks ago, Don Dunstan commented on the fact that the 1970s would not have been the Dunstan decade if not for Mick Young.I do not think that people, in commenting about the Labor Party of the late 1960s, really recognise the change that Mick Young made to the way the party operated. Until the 1969 national conference, which is a long time ago now, national conferences of the Labor Party were held in camera and there were always arguments about `faceless men. In 1963 Bob Menzies successfully used the national conference tag of `the faceless men of the Labor Party to help win the election campaign in 1963.When Mick became national secretary, he said that the party conference should be opened up to the media and to anybody who wanted to come along and sit in and listen to the debates and see that the delegates debating the great issues were fellow Australians. I did not attend the 1969 conference, but as a party supporter I remember watching with some astonishment and then pride as Mick arranged a direct telecast from the floor of the 1969 national conference on the then This Day Tonight ABC program of a fully&hyphen;fledged debate on the issue of state aid for private schools, an issue that had bedevilled and split the Labor Party. Mick said, `Well have the debate openly and people can see the arguments, and it was broadcast live on television, one of the first live political broadcasts across Australia. That was indicative of Micks vision about how politics should be played and promoted in Australia.Mick Young gave me my biggest break in politics. In 1969, when he became national secretary as well as state secretary, he was going to have to spend a lot of time out of Adelaide and so he convinced the party they should elect a temporary organiser to work for the forthcoming federal campaign in 1969 and for the subsequent state election campaign which was due some time in 1970. I was 22 years of age and Mick Young convinced me that I should run in a ballot amongst others to be elected to that position for a temporary period as a full&hyphen;time state organiser.I would not have been elected without Mick Youngs support. He rounded up the numbers as only he could do it. He convinced some very old trade union officials that they should vote for a 22&hyphen;year&hyphen;old, very callow, inexperienced youth. He did it very well: I won in the first ballot in the Labor Party and became a state organiser. It was from that step forward into the party organisation that any subsequent successes I have had in the Labor Party have come. They have grown from that initial support from Mick.All through the following years in which I was an adviser to state and federal governments, an assistant state secretary and then state secretary, Mick was always ready with advice, not in a presumptuous or bombastic way but always in a friendly way. He would make a phone call and would start off, `How are things going, Schachtie? I see there is a bit of a problem at so&hyphen;and&hyphen;so area. What do you think we should do? And in the conversation there would always come through some very sound advice about how to deal with that particular problem.Always when one was in the darkest, blackest or most difficult moments, the phone would ring and it would be Mick, to help out and provide advice. Nothing was more important to me when I became the acting state secretary of the Labor Party than his phone call on the Sunday morning after we lost the 1979 state election. When there was wreckage all around the Labor Party, Mick Young was the first to ring at 7 oclock that morning to have a chat with me, advise me and provide a morale boost and assistance on how to get on with the job of rebuilding the Labor Party. In one term, we got the Labor Party back into office in 1982.Others have mentioned Micks success as a minister. The Electoral Act amendments he put through in 1984 have meant that we in Australia now have one of the most modern and sophisticated electoral acts, one that guarantees the participation and the support of the community in an electoral system that is as democratic, open and fair as it could possibly be. One of the things Mick always committed himself to, going right back to the 1960s when he first became national secretary, was the introduction of public funding for political parties. That was his major achievement in the 1984 act, including of course the introduction of `one vote, one value. Even though the introduction of public funding was strongly opposed by the opposition, they now accept that it has many merits and means that all sides get a fair go to put their political view without having to worry about where the money comes from or being beholden to sectional interests.I, like others, would also pay compliment to Mick in his work in the community, particularly in Port Adelaide. From the day he got preselection to Port Adelaide unopposed by the party—which was no mean feat, as it is one of the safest seats in Australia—he put his stamp on that area and was identified as `Mr Port Adelaide even though his family had spent three generations living there. In 1974 he pulled off, I would have to say, one of the greatest publicity coups any backbench member could do, by getting Gough to speak to the Port Adelaide Football Club. On the front page of the Adelaide Advertiser was Gough Whitlam, Prime Minister of Australia, wearing a Port Adelaide football jumper and the banner headline read, `Mick Youngs trainer. That did much to cement the image of Micks being Mr Port Adelaide. But it was not just a matter of glib publicity; there was also what he did in the electorate, hearing what the people were speaking about, delivering services and arguing for those in areas that were in great need.An aspect about Mick that I personally found rather daunting was his extraordinary breadth of interest in all sorts of issues. Others have commented about his love of literature, art, films, music and theatre. In all of those areas, Mick was a participant, a consumer. Others have mentioned as well, and I can confirm it, that Mick was a great bar room singer. He could sing with great passion the Irish songs of independence, but one he used to sing very well indeed was the great organising song, Joe Hill . I remember that one night in the time of the Whitlam government, at a party in somebodys room, someone asked him to sing it; and a very rowdy party ended up being dead silent as Mick sang with much passion that great union organising song, Joe Hill , without a note of music to assist him.In my view, Mick Youngs passion and commitment were summed up in the way he could sing Joe Hill . To my great envy, I cannot sing a note to save myself, but Mick Young could. Mick Young could also quote poetry. He could quote script from books and he could advise you on what books to read. Those are great personal memories that I have of Mick.Mick was always capable of having a quick one&hyphen;liner in politics that got to the nub of an issue. I remember the time of the Russian invasion of Afghanistan when the Liberal Prime Minister of the day announced sanc tions against the Russian government because of their invasion. Mick Young pointed out that Malcolm Frasers wool was still being sold to the Russians. He had this phrase which summed it up and was a great political phrase: Malcolms wool keeps the Russians warm. It was a great political example of a one&hyphen;liner that could capture the essence, whether you agreed with the phrase or not.He could often use one&hyphen;liners against himself. I remember that so&hyphen;called big issue of the Paddington Bear affair, when he stood up in the parliament and said, `Well, if I have to go to gaol, I hope I can share a cell with Michael MacKellar because at least he will have a colour television set. I think that just killed half the argument. He was able to use those one&hyphen;liners—of which I have great envy; I think most of us do—and was able to pull them off the cuff at the flick of a finger and devastate a political opponent. That is why he was one of the great performers, not only in the parliament, but in politics in Australia.The last time I spoke to Mick was just after the last federal election. I had a long conversation with him during the campaign when I visited him in his home in Sydney. We talked overwhelmingly about the election campaign. Mick, with his usual savvy, was able to predict the result pretty accurately, unfortunately for us. He was talking about how, if we lost the election, we would need to rebuild and get on and how the party would need to keep its morale and spirit together. That is what Micks whole life was about. The Labor Party—the Labor movement—was the one organisation in this country that he was absolutely dedicated to.I conclude by saying I realise that I stand here today, representing the people of South Australia, because Mick Young gave me the right advice and the right start in politics in South Australia. He has given a whole generation of people in South Australia that start to enable us to participate constructively in politics. Mary, Michael, Janine, Duane and Isabella have the full sympathy of me, my wife Robyn and my own family. Mick Young died far too young. He deserved to live a lot longer, not only because he deserved a long life, but because we all deserved to be in his company for many more years to come. I pass on full sympathy to his family.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[28]/debate.sub1/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I want to support all those things that have already been said and therefore not trawl across the same ground—not that what has been said does not bear repeating: indeed it does. The weight of condolence motions, the state funeral and the memorial service in Port Adelaide are all examples of marks recognised by any number of people of the singular nature of this man and his contribution not only to the Labor Party but also to the great Australian society.There are a few comments that I want to add. First of all, I recognise Mick as a very astute politician. He did not know how to be other than very good at politics. He had a great nose for things political. He could smell a problem a mile off and he could see the right solution very quickly. As others have spelt out in a variety of different ways, he had the capacity to see that solution implemented, not just because he could see what had to be done but because he could draw on that extraordinary network he had of friends, political contacts, union and branch members and so on. He could speak to all of them, as all colleagues have said. He could ring at any time. You knew if Mick Young was calling it was a conversation to take seriously and you could also trust his judgment. Because of that network of friends, he was able to regularly call on people and then trust them to respond. His political instinct was based on a huge network of friends, genuine contact, inclusive involvement and that warmth and affection he had built up.Politics, for Mick Young, was almost a style of living. It was not just something you did when you went to work. It was not just something that happened around the Labor Party. Mick Young was a political person through and through in all his doings. He was a genuine, committed and passionate man.One of the other things I remember about Mick Young is that whenever he spoke in any debate or argument he left you with two or three punchy lines, the pithy summation of the arguments that you could then use your self to make the case, to make the same point over and over. He had a very rare capacity. Perhaps it was, as Senator Schacht has said, that he left you with those grab lines that were not just clever comments but also were about capturing the kernel of the argument. None of us could remember them as well as Mick could say them, even if we wrote them down and rehearsed them, and of course we did not have his judgment about exactly how and when to introduce them.Perhaps people will enjoy a trawl through Hansard . I am not sure whether Hansard has a key for humour. There would be a lot of mileage in reading through Mick Youngs contributions in Hansard just for the clear evidence of his timing and the devastating way in which he knew exactly when to say exactly what.Perhaps the best example I can think of of Mick Youngs timing and getting it politically right follows from another of his great skills, that of acting as chairman. There were very few people to match Mick in the chair of any meeting at all. As chair of the Labor Partys national conference, he had the challenge of trying to read that pretty fraught and complex body of people. In one particular conference, when the centre and the Left combined on an issue to defeat the Right, Graham Richardson was at pains—","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[28]/debate.sub1/speech[8]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator CROWLEY","ZF4","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","—Yes, it was a red&hyphen;letter day. Graham Richardson was at pains to explain, in his scarifying contribution to the debate, just how rotten everybody was, how pathetic in particular the Centre Left was and how continuingly evil and bad the Left was. Everything you could expect would be said about the bad sides of the Labor Party—in other words, those that might ever entertain defeating Graham Richardson—was all spelt out by Graham in an extraordinary and splendid speech. All of a sudden, Mr Chairman had to say, `Your times up, Graham. There was not an extension of time, but Mick said, `Yes, your times up Graham, but youre doing so well and its so entertaining, keep going. With that great line, Mick managed to make everybody burst out laughing, and the venom of the attack was completely lost.That is probably the best example I can find, in trawling through my memory, of something that might capture the essence of Mick Young. On hearing that description of what happened at that national conference, perhaps a whole lot of people will want to see me outside. That is my recollection of it. A powerful point was made by Micks exactly right comment; he had the capacity again and again to defuse the venom.Mick Young is not to be marked as a malicious man; indeed, he was anything but. He was devastating, exacting, precise, but not malicious. He always had a great sense of humour. We have heard that said again and again. His humour was not just about being right in his timing or witty with his comment; he loved to tell a great joke and he told them particularly well. As has been said, he managed to tell stories about people without in any way making them feel pained or too hurt.He told a lovely story which picked up on his passion for things to do with art. He was a great supporter of the establishment of the National Gallery, and perhaps a lot of people were surprised at Mick Youngs passion for and commitment to that. He enjoyed the company and the personal friendship of painters like Fred Williams. On one occasion when Mick and his wife Mary were having a meal with Fred Williams at the kitchen table, Clyde Cameron came calling. Mick said, `Let me introduce the painter, Fred Williams. It is said that Clyde Cameron said, `I need some help with my house. Can you give me any clues as to what sort of paint I should use to stop salt damage?I do not suppose a lot of people expected to find that Mick was in the company of painters, gallery promoters, musicians and artists of all sorts, but he was. In some funny way, I suppose he was a renaissance man in the 20th century. He loved most of us and he had a love of all that he did. That is why, in coming to a close, I say that I would count Mick Young as a friend.I also particularly want to acknowledge the contribution made by Mary to Micks full life. So much of his life was lived around the kitchen table, with Mary providing cups of tea and endless meals and making sure that people participated in them. My principal reason for speaking on this motion is to say that all of these things are true of Mick, as is much more which we will not be saying.Way back in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Mick Young knew the importance of having a significant presence of women in the Labor Party. I stand here because Mick Young was one of the people who promoted me and Barbara Wiese and a number of others. He did that well before we were able to win an affirmative action rule within the Labor Party. Micks political sense knew that if you were serious about including a variety of people in the parliamentary and political process, you included women. The battle to see that some of us had an opportunity and to shepherd us into the political arena was fought by Mick just as strongly and he argued with just as much passion as he did for any of the other issues that he took up.Senator Schacht made the point that he stands here today because of Mick Young and that he owes a lot of his success to Mick Young. That is very true for me. It is very important to acknowledge that Mick was far ahead of his time in this regard, as he was in so many other things. I regret that I shall never be able to speak to or see Mick Young again and I join with all other honourable senators in passing on condolences to Mary and his family.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[28]/debate.sub1/speech[8]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator FORSHAW","656","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","—It is a privilege to, and with sadness that, I rise to contribute to this condolence motion with respect to the late Michael Young. It is a privilege because I, like so many thousands of other people, have known Mick Young and enjoyed his company for many, many years. It is sad because, as Senator Schacht and others have noted, Mick died at a relatively young age. He still had much to contribute, to both the Australian Labor Party and the community. Others have spoken and covered adequately Micks contribution to the Australian Labor Party and to the parliament, although we could probably go on for much longer. To ALP members of my generation, Mick Young stands beside Gough Whitlam as the prime mover in re-establishing the ALP in the national political arena after 23 years in the wilderness. Mick Young made the Australian Labor Party a party that young people in the late 1960s and early 1970s would support and would join. I recall how thousands of young people around Australia, whether on university campuses or at the large rallies, were stirred by the `Its Time theme of the 1972 election campaign. As has been noted, Mick was the architect of that campaign, which will always be remembered in Australian political history as the pinnacle of election campaigns.Mick, along with Gough, had some years earlier commenced the process of rebuilding the ALP as a modern, forward thinking and outward looking social democratic party. One significant element of that process, amongst so many, was Micks role in the establishment of dialogue and, later, diplomatic relations with China, which showed at that time political courage and an ability to move beyond the status quo.Whilst others have spoken and referred to Micks contributions within the party, in the parliament and in the community, I just wish to dwell on Micks role in the union movement, particularly the Australian Workers Union. I first met Mick Young in my capacity as an official of the AWU. I cannot recall exactly when it was but it was quite a number of years ago. Mick was a person whom, when you met him for the first time, you actually felt you had known for years. He had that rare quality, so often associated with the Irish, of being instantly friendly, of being instantly likeable—a person you wanted to continue to know and whose company you wanted to be in.Mick first joined the Australian Workers Union in 1952 when he commenced shearing at the age of 15. He went to shear in western New South Wales, an area where shearing is hard, is tough, is backbreaking work. As we all know, shearing, until recent times, was work that often required men to spend long periods away from home, away from the comforts of the cities and towns, and that was particularly true of western New South Wales and other far outback areas of Australia. It was an industry in which unionism and the Labor movement were at their strongest. Mick played a leading role in the great campaigns in the shearing industry in the 1950s, particularly in 1956, when the union and the members fought and won the battle to retain the rates of pay in the shearing industry, the rates of pay which the employers at that time sought to reduce.Mick quickly demonstrated his great organising skills and within six years had been recruited by the union as an organiser. He worked in the Port Pirie region and whilst Micks career in the AWU as an official was relatively short—he then went on to work for the ALP—he nevertheless gained a reputation as a great advocate for the working class, for the union, for the battlers.Mick remained a member of the AWU for the rest of his life. He was, and still is, regarded as one of its finest and most popular sons. Wherever he went, he was held in the highest regard by the officials and by the membership of the AWU. I can tell you that is not easily achieved in the Australian Workers Union but Mick was one of the very few who was liked, indeed loved, by all within the union. He was awarded life membership of the AWU in 1993.I recall the AWUs centenary celebrations in Ballarat in 1986. Mick was the master of ceremonies and in the main street of Ballarat he gave a shearing demonstration to a crowd of about 2,000 people. It was obvious that Mick was a person that ordinary people loved to be around. They were not there just because it was a demonstration of shearing; they were there because it was Mick Young who hopped up on the back of a truck and demonstrated the skills he had acquired and still retained.Mick always seemed to be the MC or the guest of honour at any AWU or ALP function. I do not think I recall ever going to a function where Mick did not get asked to speak, to chair the meeting or to be the MC. It was obvious why that was the case. Mick had all the necessary qualities: he was a great speaker, he was a tremendous raconteur, he had wit, he had charm and he had the ability to make an audience listen to his every word be it serious or humorous. As Senator Schacht has informed us, he even had the ability to make people listen to him when he sang.Just as people loved to be around Mick, so did he delight in the company of other people. It did not matter who you were, the highest office holder or a mere average person in the community, Mick always treated you with equal friendliness. As Brian Johns so appropriately noted when he gave the eulogy at the service in St Marys cathedral: `To know Mick was to be welcome to a place at his table and no&hyphen;one was more important than anyone else.Mick had great humility. He could keep you entertained and enthralled as he spoke or related stories, but he never talked about himself. He was never one to boast or to push his own barrow, notwithstanding his many great achievements. I will always remember with fondness the occasions that I spent in Micks company in recent years after he had moved to Sydney, both as a member of parliament and also in my previous role as the General Secretary of the Australian Workers Union. Whether it was at Harpoon Harrys, Machiavellis or any number of other restaurants, you not only enjoyed Micks company but you also appreciated his advice and friendship. If you could not make lunch with Mick, and unfortunately we will not be able to any longer, you could always try to get a table beneath his photo at Machiavellis Restaurant in Sydney.As I said, I particularly appreciated his advice. It was always constructive and it was always worth while, and other speakers have noted that when you got a phone call from Mick you knew that it was going to be an opportunity to listen and to learn. The ALP and the union movement will certainly miss that advice and assistance as we commence the task of regaining government. I was told by his son, Michael, who works for the Australian Workers Union and whom I had the privilege of working with in the union, that in the weeks after the recent election, when Mick knew he was dying, he was still on the telephone giving advice to people in the party. That demonstrates real commitment.I particularly recall, with great fondness, the gatherings each year at the rugby league grand final in Sydney. We would first meet at the Bellevue Hotel in Paddington and would then move on to the football. They were great days. Mick was great company, with his always outwardly friendly nature. It never changed—even when last year his beloved Manly-Warringah lost the game.In public life people like Mick Young are rare indeed. It is particularly sad that he passed away at a relatively young age, when he still had so much more to contribute and so much more delight to bring to his many, many friends and to Australians generally.In the AWU head office in Sydney a plaque on the wall which commemorates one of the AWUs founders says:He has mounted his horse and smiled farewellAnd rides where the shadows fallHonour him, men of the Western ShedsHonour him, honour him allThere will be many in the AWU, in the ALP, in politics and many people generally throughout the community who will honour Mick and remember him for his contribution.To Mrs Mary Young, to my good friend and colleague from the AWU Michael Young, to Janine, to Duane, to Isabella and to all the other members of the Young family, I extend my sympathies. I also extend my thanks for giving me and so many others the opportunity to have known Mick—a terrific person, and a great mate, in the truest sense of that word.Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable senators standing in their places.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[28]/debate.sub1/speech[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The most recent report from the IMB, which does not distinguish between the two types of attacks both of which are now commonly referred to as piracy, shows an increase in attacks in these areas from 87 reported attacks in 1994 to 100 reported attacks for the first nine months of 1995.A recent trend, noted in the IMBs latest report is an increase in the ferocity of pirate attacks. This trend, combined with the reported increase in the tendency of pirates to be more heavily armed, means that the risk to seafarers lives is increasing.(2) (a) The most popular vessels attacked are bulk carriers (23), general cargo (20) and tankers (15) with a range of other individual vessels being attacked.(b) There have been very few reported deaths in the past years although there were reports of vessels being fired upon and crew being set adrift in open life rafts. The most recent deaths of which the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) is aware were the killings by pirates of the Master and Chief Officer of Baltimar Zephyr about 100 nautical miles north of Jakarta in December 1992.(c) The value of the goods stolen has not always been reported and varies from small quantities of ships stores and equipment, or crews personal effects, to entire ships and their cargoes. The largest theft was a ship carrying sugar which was hijacked, the crew set adrift in a makeshift raft, the ship repainted and issued with false Honduras registration papers. The value of the cargo was estimated at US$4 million. A passenger ferry from Macau was recently hijacked, the passengers robbed and casino takings exceeding US$1 million, were stolen.(3) No.(4) Between 1986 and 1992, 4 Australian flagged ships underway in South East Asian waters, particularly in the Malacca/Singapore Straits area, have been attacked and boarded by pirates. One Australian crewed, British flagged ship was similarly attacked. Some attacks were successful, resulting in the loss of money and valuables. Since 1992 there have been no further attacks on Australian flagged vessels.(5) The Australian Maritime Safety Authority has advised that it is not aware of any successful prosecutions so far although it is believed that Indonesian and Philippine authorities have arrested a number of alleged pirates. In September 1995 Chinese authorities in Beihai recovered the hi&hyphen;jacked MV Anna Sierra and, although the pirates were detained, no information is available on whether they have been prosecuted.The Australian Government looks to the coastal States to ensure the safety and freedom from attack of ships exercising the right of innocent passage in the territorial sea of the coastal State and in their ports. The Government also looks to the coastal State to pursue, prosecute and punish pirates or armed robbers who may operate, reside or have their base of operations in its territory.(6) The Australian Federal Police (AFP) has not been involved, to date, in the institution of proceedings for piracy against shipping because there have been no incidents in Australian waters. The AFP does, however, have an ongoing interest in activities which may constitute a breach of the piracy provisions (Part IV) of the Crimes Act 1914. The AFP also maintains an intelligence interest in piracy, in the context of organised criminal activity, through its international network.(7) No.N/A","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[9]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Austrade gives a high priority to facilitating the AAT process.(5) The resolution of appeals to the AAT is scheduled by the AAT itself, and varies considerably. On average, appeals are resolved within a period of 12 months after the lodgement of the appeal with the AAT.(6) There have been 28 such instances between July 1 1992 and December 30 1995.(7) Austrades records of AAT cases do not record all details of compliance with AAT deadlines. However, Austrade gives a high priority to facilitating the progress of AAT appeals and to meeting AAT deadlines, and meets these deadlines in nearly all cases.In one particularly difficult case heard recently in West Australia there were a number of instances where both parties missed deadlines, but this did not significantly alter the resolution process.(8) No. Monies appropriated by the Parliament can only be used for the purpose for which they were appropriated. Where the entire appropriation is not going to be paid out as grants, the remaining funds would be returned to the Department of Finance or carried forward for payment of grants in the following year.N/A","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[10]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Five Torres Strait Islanders have received recognition as a result of the decision.(2) Payments were not made on the basis of applications by individuals. In 1989, an Inter&hyphen;Departmental Working Party examined the claims by Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders for recognition of their World War II service to Australian military forces. The Working Party identified four groups of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders who had served full time alongside the forces, in the defence of northern Australia and who would have been expected to fight had the occasion arisen. Following the Governments decision to recognise the services of these groups, Defence took action to locate the surviving members or their dependants and to make payments and to issue the appropriate campaign medals.(3) All known members of the groups or their dependants have been paid.(4) $1.496 million has been paid.
