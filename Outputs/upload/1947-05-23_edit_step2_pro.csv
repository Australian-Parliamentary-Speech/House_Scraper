4,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"POLLARD, Reginald","KYC","N/A","ALP","N/A",2846,"- On the 8th May, the honorable member for Wentworth asked for information regarding public servants who, returning to Australia from America, had brought with them luggage exceeding 1 ton in weight. On the 13th May, the Minister for Trade and Customs replied that if the honorable member could furnish a reference to the case or cases which . he had in mind, he would obtain . and supply to bin the details sought. Speaking on the motion for the ad journment of the House on the evening of the 13th May, the honorable member for Wentworth supplied some particulars of three instances in which public servants returning from .\me.rica had brought with them personal luggage exceeding 1 ton in weight. The Minister for Trade and Customs has had inquiries made. With the aid of the information given by the honorable member for Wentworth, on that evening, he has been able to ascertain the circumstances in each case, and has asked mc to inform the House accordinglyThe first case mentioned apparently refers to Mr. L. C. Scarborough, who was appointed to the Australian War Supplies Procurement staff in March, 1941, by the then Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies). The conditions of his appointment provided that both he and his wife would be sent to New York and returned to Melbourne at public expense. Having been resident in America for about four years, they returned to Australia in Mirrabooka, which arrived at Sydney on. the 3rd June, 1945. Their personal luggage, consisting of ten cases and six barrels, was returned on Trevanian. These packages were entered at the Melbourne Customs House on Import Entry No. 1650, dated the 23rd August, 1945*. A statutory declaration waa furnished at the same time by Mr. Scarborough to the effect that- the luggage consisted of personal effects and second-hand household effects. The luggage was inspected by a customs officer, and found to be in accordance with the declaration.The second case to which the honorable member apparently refers is that of Mr.F. J. Marcusson, who, in June, 1945, was transferred to America. Before leaving Australia, Mr. Marcusson sold all his furniture, and as it was intended that he should stay for three or four years in America, he and his wife and daughter set up home there. Due to the reduction in staff of Australian War Supplies Procurement in America, following the termination of the war, it later became necessary to transfer Mr. Marcusson to Australia. The luggage for himself, his wife and daughter was sent to Australia on Whistler, and was landed at Sydney. It consisted of seven cases of household and personal effects, which were entered at the Customs House, Sydney, and a statutory declaration made regarding those goods which were entered as household effects.The third case seems to refer to Mr. P. J. Winspur, who was appointed to the staff of Australian War Supplies Procurement in America. The then Minister for Trade and Customs, Senator Keane, and the Public Service Board approved of the removal to Australia, at public expense, of Mr. Winspur, his wife and child when his services were no longer required in America. The luggage for the three of them was despatched to Australia on City of Capetown, and consigned to Melbourne. As the ship is not due in Melbourne until the 25th May, 1947, details regarding the luggage will not be available until that time. However, Mr. Winspur has been living in America for six or seven years and, therefore, sixteen cases of household and personal effects do not, in the circumstances, appear to he an undue amount of luggage. It is regrettable that the honorable member for Wentworth, when asking these questions, should have, by innuendo-","CUSTOMS CHARGES ON PUBLIC SERVANTS LUGGAGE","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[1]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Honorable members from either side of the House have the right to ask questions on notice, or without notice. The practice has been that if a Minister could not immediately reply to a question, the reply was tabled in the House at some subsequent time. Now, instead of tabling the reply, the Minister gets another honorable member to ask him a question relating to the same matter. Such a practice is entirely out of order, and should not be allowed.","CUSTOMS CHARGES ON PUBLIC SERVANTS LUGGAGE","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[1]/answer/interjection[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I pointed out yesterday when a similar instance occurred and an honorable member had asked directly on that day for information, that the Standing Orders do not prevent the Minister from giving an answer.

At present, our silver coinage contains 92£ per cent, fine silver. The- balance of 7i per cent, consists of alloy, a mixture of copper, zinc and tin This, bill provides, in lieu of the present provisions of the Coinage Act, for the issue of silver coinage of 50 per cent, fine silver, the- balance being, alloy. The reason fon the alteration is the increase of the price of silver.The Australian price of silver is based on the London price. Before the war, the London price was 2s. 1 1/2 d. sterling per fine oz., the equivalent Australian price being 2s: 7£d. In September, 1945, a rise of price in the United States of America forced the London price to 3s. 8d. sterling per fine oz., which was. equal to 4s. 7£d. per fine oz. in Australian currency. A further increase of price in the United States of America in August, 1946:, sent: the London price to 4s. 7£d. sterling, or 5s. 9£d. Australian currency, and we were paying this price for our silver bullion until early in February, when the price fell to 4s: 7d. Australian. Towards the end of February, the Australian price rose again to 4s. 9£d. Since then, the price has fluctuated, and the present Australian price is- about 4s.. aid.The increase was due to action taken to raise- the price of silver in the United States of America. This action was influenced no doubt by the  silver bloc  States, which desired to lift the priceeventually to over a dollar per oz. But the increased price brought repercussions, notably from the United Kingdom and India, which caused a halt, followed by a decrease of the price. The Government, of the United Kingdom began to use cupro-nicol instead of silver for making coins.Some action is now necessary to adjust the silver content of our coinage and the Government has decided to adopt 50 per cent, silver as the basis of the new silver coinage. This basis is the same as that currently adopted in New Zealand, and is the same as that which was adopted in the United Kingdom for many years.I believe that coinage with a silver content of 50 per cent, should give ns adequate protection, particularly as the price of silver has steadied somewhat. Moreover, a reduction of the silver content of our coinage will assist us to build up the stock 6f 11,000,000 oz. which we obtained from the United States for coinage purposes during the war. This quantity must be returned within a period of five years from the date when the President of the United States declares the war emergency to have ended.We are buying- practically the whole of our local production which is available after allowing- for demands of industry. This is roughly 6,000,000 oz. per annum, and any amount not required for coinage will be used to build up a reserve to meet our obligation to the United States. For a time, of course, the new silver coins will circulate with the old ones, but the latter will gradually be withdrawn- and melted down to provide bullion for the new issue-. Sample coins of the new minting- show that their appearance; is little different from that of the existing coinage, and technical advice is that they will wear well.During the war, there was not enough silver in Australia to meet the demand for silver coinage. Even our minting capacity was not sufficient to produce enough coins. Before the war, the value of silver coins in circulation in Australia was £9,500,000; now it is £26,500,000. It was found necessary to arrange with the Government of the United States of America to obtain silver from that country, and to have it minted there into our coinage.Debate (on motion by Mr. Abbott) adjourned.","N/A","COINAGE BILL 1947","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Under section 27(t) of the National University Act, provision was made for a scheme of superannuation. The interim council of the University has found from its early experience that more than one arrangement for superannuation will, however, be required. The council finds that most, if not all, of its academic and scientific staff will be covered by what is known as the F.S.S.U. Federated Superannuation Scheme for Universities a British and Australian scheme evolved by the universities, and a group of insurance bodies to which most scholars and scientists coming to the National University will already belong, and will want to continue to belong.However, the office and administrative staff, and some of the technical staff, cannot be provided for under that scheme. It is proposed that they should come under the Commonwealth superannuation scheme. Provision will be made under the existing Commonwealth Superannuation Act 1922-47 for the National University to be proclaimed an approved authority for the purpose of that, act, and members of the staff of the university to come under that act will be gazetted from to time. This, incidentally, will enable members of the Commonwealth Public Service who join the office or other staff of the National University to continue unbroken their membership of the Commonwealth superannuation scheme. Moreover, an amending superannuation bill shortly to be brought down will include provision for similar continuity of superannuation rights in the case of a State public servant joining the university staff in much the same way as did State taxation officers on transferring to the Commonwealth Service after the uniform tax scheme was adopted. The sole purpose of the present amending bill is to permit a dual superannuation arrangement to be made by the National University so that all members of its staff can he covered.Debate (on motion by Mr. Menzies) adjourned.That the bill be now read a second time.Thatthe bill be now read a second time.That the bill be now read a second time.","Second Reading","AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY BILL 1947","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The taking over of the military hospitals, being a transition from war to a state of peace, is a most interesting stage of the Commonwealths responsibilities. It is also a difficult stage. .Nevertheless, the arrange-, ments are proceeding satisfactorily and, with the formal taking over last Monday of Concord Hospital, New South Wales, and Heidelberg Hospital, Victoria, the task is, in effect, completed, although many matters of detail will require attention for some time to .come by the departments concerned. By the transition, 3,5S0 .beds additional to .those in other institutions controlled by the commission have become available. As to these other institutions, to cope with the additional numbers of members requiring treatment after discharge during the war years, some new institutions, and extension and rebuilding of existing institutions were necessary, and in this way the maximum bed strength was increased from 1890 to 2914.New sanatoriums for the treatment of patients were provided at Kenmore, Queensland, and Belair, South Australia. Additions were made to repatriation sanatoriums at Turramurra, New South Wales, and MacLeod, Victoria, and still further accommodation is being planned. Additional segregated accommodation .for patients suffering from mental disorders, whose condition is such as to necessitate their being kept under restraint, has been provided in New South Wales, Victoria,, ,and South Australia, and segregated accommodation for such patients is nearing completion at Wacol in Queensland and similar accommodation is being planned in Tasmania. [Quorum formed].Additions, alterations and improvements have also been made to repatriation artificial limb factories to meet the increased demands on such facilities. These include the entire re-building of the factory in South Melbourne, Victoria. Additional accommodation, both for patients and staff, also the remodelling of the other services, has been carried out at the Repatriation General Hospital, Hobart. The increased accommodation for patients of repatriation medical institutions has, of course, necessitated in many cases additional accommodation for staffs and the provision of greater ancillary services.Honorable members will know at least one, and .some may know all, of the excellent hospitals that have been taken over from the Army. These institutions are familiar to the servicemen and to the community generally under their popular names of Greenslopes, Queensland; Concord, New South Wales; Heidelberg, Victoria; Springbank, South Australia; and Hollywood, Western Australia. The commission is now more advantageously placed than ever before fox the purpose of providing high-degree medical treatment. In the course of time, certain existing institutions will be dispensed with, but the present position is as follows The older repatriation general hospitals in Queensland, Victoria, New South Wales and South- Australia cannot yet be entirely dispensed with. In Queensland and South Australia,- for instance, out-patients facilities are being retained at Rosemount and Keswick respectively, whilst at -the Prince of Wales Hospital, Randwick, New South Wales, it has been found necessary to retain accommodation for in-patients and also the out-patients department. Caulfield Repatriation General Hospital, Melbourne - and this will interest the honorable member for Balaclava - will be utilized for some time to come for the accommodation of cases of pulmonary tuberculosis and for X-ray and pathological facilities required in -connexion with the out-patients department at St. Kilda-road.","N/A","WAR PENSIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In Queensland, an additional chalet is being erected to provide 32 additional beds for sufferers from pulmonary tuberculosis; and recently a chalet was opened at the Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital, Thirlmere, near Sydney, for the treatment of women .sufferers from tuberculosis.The X-ray and laboratory equipment and facilities at the military hospitals taken over arc being supplemented and extended. The commission has always provided visiting specialists at its institutions, but the expansion of its responsibilities in connexion with the newly acquired hospitals will render it necessary to increase their number, so that -there will be .215 specialists visiting the commissions institutions throughout the Commonwealth. In this figure are included specialist physicians, surgeons, psychiatrists, anaesthetists, allergists, thoracic surgeons, neuro-surgeons, plastic surgeons and dentists, dermatologists, orthopaedists, gynaecologists, and specialists in ear, nose, throat and eye diseases. A well-qualified and experienced specialist in psychological medicine has been appointed to the full-time staff to advise on any additional treatment measures that may be required in this branch of medicine. He is at present proceeding by air to- Melbourne from Britain, where he has been engaged in further post-graduate study following his demobilization from the Australian Imperial Force. A well-known ear, nose and throat specialist of Melbourne, who hai teen one of the visiting staff of repatriation institutions in that city for some years, was sent by the .commission to the United States of America to study the methods used in various clinics in the treatment and rehabilitation of the deaf, with particular reference to the fenestration operation of otosclerosis. Already a number of army and repatriation patients -requiring this latter operation have undergone the necessary surgical treatment. A survey relating to the efficiency of paludrin to the suppression of recurrences of malaria has been in train since August, 1946, with encouraging results.To sum up, it will be seen that from this account of the activities added as a result of this war, the Repatriation Department has an appreciable task. I have not mentioned some of the general benefits which apply to pensioners and beneficiaries of both wars, although earlier 1 asked honorable members to keep in mind the fact that this work has proceeded steadily. Some idea of the overall task, however, will be realized when I say that the total annual liability on war pensions is at present £15,000,000. The enlarged services referred to in the bill, to which we are now giving attention, will increase the liability by about £460,500.

67,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"DEDMAN, John","KCF","Corio","ALP","Minister for Defence, Minister for Post-war Reconstruction and Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research",2861,". - I move -That the bill be now read a second .time.The Seamens Compensation Act, as honorable members are no doubt aware, deals with a. shipowners liability for accident to a seaman in the course of his employment. While employed on the high seas a seaman is outside the scope of any of the various State workers compensation acts, unless he is employed on a ship engaged only in intranstate trade. This explains the necessity for Commonwealth legislation in this field. A Commonwealth Seamens Compensation Act was passed by this Parliament in 1909, but it was challenged in the High Court, which held that one section was invalid because it purported to cover seamen employed ou all Australian ships - intrastate as well as interstate. The section in question referred to  ships engaged in the coasting trade  ; but, as is now well known, the Commonwealth power as to trade and commerce, including navigation and shipping, is limited. It does not extend to intra-state trade and commerce. As the court decided that the particular section could not be severed from the rest of the act, the whole measure was held to be invalid. The case, Owners of SS.Kalibia v. Wilson , was heard in 1910, and is reported in 11 C.L.R., page 689. The 1909 act was, therefore, replaced by another in 1911. It was supported by all parties, and I hope that the present bill will receive the same general acceptance.It was 27 years before any amendment was made to the 1911 act. By 1938 it was agreed that the act had become out of date in a number of respects, chiefly in regard to the amounts of compensation payable, and an amending bill was then passed. Now, after another nine years, the Government has decided that further amendments should be made.The Commonwealth Government, of course, has workers compensation legislation in regard to its own employees, and it has a number of ordinances fixing employers liability in its territories. The Commonwealth Employees Compensation Act was substantially amended in 1944, and the intention of the present bill is to prescribe for seamen the principles then introduced. The more important provisions prescribed in 1944 were (1) Greater benefits to dependants in case of death ; (2) greater benefits for the family of an injured employee; (3) increase in maximum aggregate total of weekly payments; (4) compensation for injury sustained while travelling to or from employment; (5) widening of the scope covered by industrial diseases; (6) greater benefits for specified injuries. When the 1944 act was passed, seamen legarded the new provisions as representing the Commonwealth view of what was equitable compensation for injuries. The Government considers that a reasonable point of view, and by the bill it is proposed to amend the Seamens Compensation Act on very much the same lines.For instance, the maximum amount payable to dependants when the injury sustained by a seaman results in his death is being increased from £750 to £S00, plus a payment of £25 for each dependent child under sixteen years of age. This follows the Commonwealth Employees Compensation Act. Weekly payments during incapacity will be two-thirds of the seamens weekly pay, with a maximum of £3. In addition, £1 will be payable for a wife or a housekeeper dependent on the seaman, and Ss. Gd. for each dependent child under sixteen years of age. The total payment, of course, will not exceed the seamans pay at the time of the accident-Consequent upon the increase of the weekly benefits, it is necessary that an increase shall be made in the maximum which a seaman who is not totally and permanently incapacitated may receive in weekly payments. This maximum i* therefore being increased from £750 to £1,000. Otherwise, weekly payments in some instances could not continue for so long a period as under the existing act.Again, following the 1944 Commonwealth Employees Compensation Act, cover will be provided against injury by accident while the seaman is travelling to or from his place of employment. This feature of workers compensation is also embodied in some State acts.The list of specified injuries in the Third Schedule, in respect of which lump sums are payable, is to be expanded, and the appropriate sums increased. They are based on a maximum of £800 in case of death, instead of £750 as previously.The list of industrial diseases in the Fourth Schedule is to be added to, by providing that compensation shall be payable in respect of any infectious disease contracted as the result of employment involving contact with the infections sources of the disease.There are two provisions in the bill which have not been based on the Commonwealth Employees Compensation Act. The first is a provision taken from the English and New South Wales acts that where a dependant dies before a claim under the act has been made, or, if a claim has been made, before an agreement has been arrived, at, or award made, the legal personal representative of the deceased dependant shall have no right to payment of compensation, and the amount of compensation shall be calculated and apportioned as if that dependant had died before the seaman. The second provision relates to the procedure for recording whether a seaman is righthanded or left-handed. This is because higher compensation can be claimed for the limb, the loss of which causes the greater injury.There are necessarily some provisions in the Commonwealth Employees Compensation Act which are not applicable to seamen and have not been included in the bill. For example, there is a great variety of occupations under the Commonwealth, and this results in a longer list of industrial diseases than is necessary in the case of seamen; and, of course, the machinery clauses vary. In the main, however, the present amendments will bring the Seamens Compensation Act into harmony with the Commonwealth Employees Compensation Act. I shall be glad to explain all of these amendments in detail during the committee stage of the bill.I am sure that the bill will have general acceptance in the House. It will give to seamen a compensation law not inferior to that covering Commonwealth employees, and generally in line with State acts on the same subject. The Government has not attempted to take the highest rates of compensation payable in Australia, and incorporate them in the bill. Workers compensation legislation throughout the States, the Commonwealth and the territories, is very irregular. This is receiving consideration, however, and already there have been discussions with a view to achieving uniformity. It may, therefore, be necessary later to submit further legislation.Debate (on motion by Mr. Menzies) adjourned.","Second Reading","SEAMENS COMPENSATION BILL 1947","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

As a consolidating measure, it repeals the whole of 43 acts, and portions of seven others. The 50 acts affected are listed in the schedule. The bill consolidates the law in relation to social service benefits under five well-known headings : - Invalid and old-age pensions, widows pensions, maternity allowances, child endowment, unemployment and sickness benefits.With the passage of time, certain portions of the existing legislation have become obsolete, making their repeal desirable whilst differing provisions in sections of a somewhat similar character in the acts relating to the various benefits have produced confusion and anomalies. Even departmental officers find them complicated, whilst to members of the public and overseas administrations they are highly perplexing. Without detailed explanations, they might easily be misunderstood and misinterpreted. The main objectives in the consolidation are to eliminate obsolete sections, remove anomalies, simplify drafting, amalgamate certain sections of the administration, modernize the legislation, and present it as a part of a well-defined pattern of social security. At the samo time, the Government is providing for substantial increases of the rates of invalid and old-age pensions, wives allowances and widows pensions, and is improving many of the existing provisions. In all except very few cases, the substantive alterations of the present law constitute improvements to and extensions of the various services that arp embraced in the scope of the bill.In recent years, there has been developed in the peoples of enlightened countries a recognition of the fact that care of the aged, the infirm, the widowed, the unemployed and the sick is a matter that cannot properly be left to individuals and to organizations that are set up for charitable purposes. It is now ari accepted principle that the matter is one of community responsibility and that it must be implemented and administered at the governmental level.When the Constitution of the. Commonwealth of Australia became operative ou the 1st January, 1901, it contained only one direct power in relation to the provision of social services, namely, the power to make laws with respect to the provision of invalid and old-age pensions. However, section 96 of the Constitution, which authorized the making of grants to the States, either with or without conditions, enabled the Commonwealth to provide indirectly through the instrumentality of the several States, various benefits of a social service nature. The power that is contained in section 81 of the Constitution, permitting the Australian Parliament to appropriate moneys from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the purposes of the Commonwealth, has also been used from time to time to achieve the same result in a more direct and comprehensive way. Doubts as to the validity of the legislation implementing several of these benefits were raised by the decision of the High Court of Au3<tralia towards the end of 1945, in what is now commonly known as the Pharmaceutical Benefits case. This decision threw grave doubt on the validity of child endowment, funeral benefits, wives allowances, child allowance and widows pensions, as well as other aspects of social service legislation. Following a referendum which was conducted by the Commonwealth on the 28th September last, there became embedded in the Constitution as from the 19th December, 1946, the date upon which the Royal Assent was given to the Constitution Alteration (Social Services) Bill, a new and direct power in relation to social services. This new power conferred upon the Australian Parliament the power to make laws with respect to  the provision of maternity allowances, widows pensions, child endowment, unemployment, pharmaceutical, sickness and hospital benefits, medical and dental services - but not so as to authorize any form of civil conscription - and benefits to students and family allowances .This alteration of the1 Constitution not only confirmed the Commonwealth power to provide social service benefits of a type already in existence, but also has given to it almost unlimited power in new and important fields of social service.When war broke out in September, 1939, the Commonwealth provided only two forms of social benefits, namely, invalid and old-age pensions and maternity allowances. At that time, the maximum rate of the invalid and old-age pension wa3 21s. 6d. a week, whilst the maternity allowance had a range- of from £5 to- £7 10s., the amount varying according to the number of other children in a family unit. The total cost to the Commonwealth of providing these two services during the twelve months ended the 30th June, 1939, was £16,428,396.Child endowment was introduced in 1941, and was provided at the rate of 5s. a week. The cost to the Commonwealth of this benefit for the twelve months ended the 30th June, 1942, was £11,302,863. That was the position when Labour assumed office in October, 1941, on the eve of the outbreak of war with Japan. Since that date there has been a truly remarkable development of social services by the Commonwealth. The rate of invalid and old-age pensions has been increased by successive alterations from 21s. 6d. a week to the present-day maximum rate of 32s. 6d. a week. The bill proposes that there shall be a further increase of 5s. a week, to operate from the 3rd July next, thus bringing the rate of invalid and old-age pensions to 37s. 6d. a week, representing an increase of more than 70 per cent, since October, 1941.In 1942, widows pensions were introduced by the Commonwealth for the first time. These pensions were available to three classes of widows : - A pension at the rate of £1 10s. a week for a widow of any age who had one or more dependent children; a pension at the rate of £1 5s. a week for a widow without dependent children, but of at least 50 years of age; and an allowance at the rate of £1 5s. a week for a period not exceeding 26 weeks for a widow in necessitous circumstances who is less than 50 years of age and has not the custody, care and control of a child. Several increases have already been made. The present pension rates are 37s. Gd. a week and 27s. a week respectively, whilst the allowance payable in respect of a widow in necessitous circum-stances is 32s. 6d. a week. These rates will each be increased by 5s. a week by the bill now before the House, the increases being operative from the Sth July, 1947.The bill also proposes to provide a benefit for a new class, namely, the wives of men undergoing sentences of imprisonment. . Pension in this case will be at the rate of 32s. a week.In 1943, allowances at the rate of 15s. a week were provided for the wives of invalid pensioners. The bill proposes that the rate shall be increased to £1 a week as from the 3rd July next. In the same year, also, child allowance at the rate of 5s. a week was instituted for the child of an invalid pensioner. A funeral benefit not exceeding £10 was also introduced to provide for the burial of an invalid or old-age pensioner. Maternity allowances, which then had a range of £5 to £7 10s., were increased to a range of £15 to £17 10s. In 1945, the rate of child endowment was increased from 5s. a week to 7s. 6d. a week.In 1945 a major advance towards social security was made when unemployment and sickness benefits were, for the first time, provided. In August, 1946, important steps were taken in relation to invalid and old-age pensions - by raising the permissible income to £1, by lifting the property bar from £400 to £650, and by the introduction of a graduated scale between the sums of £400 and £650.The total annual cost of social services in recent years is indicative of the extensive growth that has taken place. The figures are as follow: -N/AIt is expected that the total expenditure by the Commonwealth on social services during the coming year, 1947-48, will amount to £72,060,000.HOO]In July, 1941, when Sir Frederick Stewart was Minister for Health and Social Services, the Government of which he was a member appointed a social security committee. This committee has presented a series of valuable reports on this subject. During the course of its investigations, the committee commented upon the intermittent and unrelated development  of social services in the Commonwealth, stressed the value of a truly national scheme, and suggested that the method of combining planned social security in codified legislation of the type adopted in some other countries could, with considerable, advantage, be followed in Australia. The Government acknowledged the advantages of the principle, and announced that it would be given effect as soon as practicable.Since then, the Government has, from time to time, introduced many major social reforms recommended by the committee, such as pensions for widows, unemployment and sickness benefits, and prepared a national scheme of social security in its widest sense. The bill now before the House represents the latest important instalment of the Governments plan. The acceptance of so many recommendations must be pleasing to those who devoted much time, thought and energy to the committees work.Turning now to the bill, I have circulated for the information of honorable members a list of the main alterations proposed to the existing Jaw. This will, I trust, facilitate the examination of the measure. With the concurrence of the House I shall incorporate the memorandum, in Hansard at the end of my speech.The bill does not cover other social service benefits such as hospital benefits, allowances for sufferers from tuberculosis and their dependants, and matters such as national fitness grants. When the Governments plans for pharmaceutical benefits and a national medical service have been developed, these, and other aspects of a purely medical or health nature, will be brought together in convenient legislative form. Ultimately, one measure covering all the social service activities of the Commonwealth in a scheme of national welfare may eventuate. The Government recognizes that all the social service benefits are merely aspects of health administration which, in its widest sense, makes for the mental, physical and social well-being of our people.The total cost of the increased pension rates, and the other improvements effected to the existing legislation, is estimated at £6,185,000 per annum, made up as under : -N/AFor very many years, the old-age pension was regarded by some as being somewhat in the nature of a charitable grant. However, with increased rates and a higher permissible income, the age pension is now generally and properly regarded as a retiring allowance, based upon age, to persons who have made contributions over a long period to the economic life of Australia.Increases of the pension rate, and modification of the means test, have created many anomalies, and have induced many representations from superannuated persons and from others with independent incomes. The Government recognizes the strength of many of these representations, and intends further to ease the means test with a view to its ultimate abolition. The Government is also exploring the possibility of setting up a national superannuation scheme.A brief statistical statement will convey to honorable members an idea of the vast growth of social services in recent years. During the financial year ended the 30th June, 1939, the department dealt with only two kinds of benefits, invalid and old-age pensions, and maternity allowances. In 1939j there were 327,000 pensioners, the cost of their pensions being approximately £16,160,000; during the same period, 81,000 maternity allowances were paid, totalling £437,000. At the present time there are approximately 358,000 pensioners, the annual cost of whose pensions amount to £29,500,000. This year, it is expected that there will be more than 197,000 maternity allowances, costing very nearly £3,000,000. Child endowment is paid in respect of nearly 1,000,000 children, and the cost is approximately £20,000,000 per anum. There are about 43,500 widows drawing pensions at a yearly cost of £3,300,000. There are fewer than 10,000 people receiving unemployment benefit, and about 9,000 receiving sickness benefit, the two benefits costing, at present rates, approximately £1,750,000 per annum. This year, it is estimated there will be more than 22,500 funeral benefits, involving the expenditure of about £220,000.Honorable members will notice that a new part has been included in the Consolidation, namely, Part VIII.,  Training and Physical Rehabilitation of Pensioners and Beneficiaries . The provisions contained under that part are not new, but appear in the existing Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, and in the Unemployment and Sickness Benefits Act. These provisions were inserted originally on the recommendation of the Social Security Committee.The training, rehabilitation and reconditioning of those who suffer some incapacity is of considerable consequence both to the individual and to the nation. In spite of the limited facilities available during recent years, since the 1st July, 1944, about 500 invalid pensioners have been trained and placed in employment, while 364 are in course of training. The rehabilitation of the 500 invalid pensioners cost the Commonwealth about £6,000, and resulted in a saving in invalid pensions of approximately £40,000 per annum. Perhaps an even more important feature i3 the fact that former pensioners are now earning their own living. They are important units in the economic structure. They are putting into the Commonwealth revenue, and not taking out of it. They have a new psychological approach to life, and are a complete justification of the scheme.As honorable members know, reciprocity has been established between Australia and New Zealand in the matter of invalid and old-age pensions. Agreement has been reached with New Zealand for reciprocal arrangements regarding widows pensions, unemployment and sickness benefits and child endowmentWe are now awaiting acceptance of draft acts and agreements which have been submitted to the dominion. At the moment, a conference of officers from ali parts of the British Empire, including Australia, is meeting in London to explore the possibility of providing reciprocal benefits in social services throughout the British Empire.I propose now to deal with the more important new clauses of the bill. In the committee stage, there will be ample opportunity for detailed discussion. Perhaps the most important effect of the bill to individual beneficiaries is that the maximum rate of invalid and old-age pensions is to be increased by 5s. a week to £1 17s. 6d. a week. The first payment at the increased rate will be effected on the 3rd July next.Pensioner inmates of benevolent institutions will receive an extra ls. 6d. a week, and an extra 33. 6d. weekly will be paid to the management of the institution towards the cost of maintenance. The additional cost of the increased rates of invalid and old-age pensions is estimated to be £5,200,000 per annum.The conditions under which absences from Australia shall count as residence have been relaxed considerably.The permissible income has been increased by 10s. a week in respect of each dependent child under sixteen years of age - less any amount received by, or in respect of, the child.For the purpose of the act, it will in future be permissible to regard a claimant for invalid pension as having become permanently incapacitated or permanently blind if the incapacity or blindness occurred during temporary absence from the Commonwealth.In this connexion, too, the provision accepting permanent incapacity or permanent blindness occurring outside of Australia as the result of a congenital defect, if the claimant arrived in Australia under the age of three years, or has resided here for at least twenty years, has been extended to cover similar cases where the disability was not of a congenital nature.At present, the childs allowance is payable only to the wife of an invalid pensioner or to a male invalid pensioner who is married, or to a widower. It is now provided that a female invalid pensioner who has the custody, care and control of a child under sixteen years of age will get this benefit. Similarly, a childs allowance may be granted to an unmarried man who has the custody, care and control of a child.The time limitation of six months for lodging claims for funeral benefit may, under the bill, be extended where there are reasonable grounds for failing to lodge the claim within that period. It is intended also that the funeral benefit may be paid in respect of a deceased person who was a claimant for invalid or old age pension, and who, but for his death, would have been granted a pension.An increase of 5s. a week will be paid to widows of all classes. The. first instalments at the new rates will be paid on the 8th July next. The total cost involved in this increase is estimated to be £570,000 per annum.An important new provision in the bill is that which qualifies a woman for a class A widows pension subject, of course, to the means test, if she has the custody, care and control of one or more children under sixteen years of age. The act at present requires that she must be maintaining one or more such children. The Government has taken the view that from a practical point of view the person who has the actual care of the child, and who is responsible for its food, clothing, education and general attention, is usually the proper person to whom payment should be made. An innovation of importance is that the permissible income has been increased by 5s. a week in respect of the widows first child and by 10s. a week in respect of each additional child, less in each case any payments received on account of that child. The bill provides that from July next widows pensions will be paid fortnightly instead of each four weeks as at present. This will be a great convenience to the tens of thousands of widows who are to-day in receipt of pensions. The bill also confers a discretionary power upon the administration to continue the pension of a widow for a period not exceeding two years beyond the date on which her youngest or only child attains the age of sixteen years, provided Abe -child is undergoing full-time education, and is dependent on the mother.It is provided that when the bill becomes operative pensions will be payable to the wives of men imprisoned for six months or more.I now turn to a consideration of the new provisions relating to maternity allowances. Discretionary power has been given to extend the period of six weeks during which payment should be collected ; payment of the higher amounts of maternity allowances will, in future, depend on the number of children under sixteen years of whom the claimant has the custody, care and control. At present it is possible for the same child to be reckoned twice in different families, and the Government considers that this should be altered. In future it is intended to grant the maternity allowance to an alien mother provided either she or her husband has resided in Australia for at least a year, and payment in respect of a birth which occurs within twelve months after the mothers arrival here may be made on the expiration of a year from the date of her arrival. The times for payment of maternity allowance have also Deen altered so that £5 may be paid at any time within a period of four weeks prior to the expected date of the childs birth, and the balance of the total benefit, namely, £15, £16 or £17 10s., or more, as the case may be, will be payable immediately after the birth upon lodgment of a claim. This will operate in lieu of the present provision which stipulates deferment of the sum of £5 until the expiration of four weeks after the birth of the child. The provision under which payment of a maternity allowance in respect of the birth of a still-born child or a child which lives for less than twelve hours may be made only on satisfactory evidence that the child was viable has been altered to provide that the amount may be paid where the period of intra-uterine life of the child was at least five and a half calendar months.In reviewing the act as a whole, the Government decided to make certain changes in the child endowment system. Those of major importance are that here too, custody, care and control, instead of the maintaining of children, has been adopted as the criterion of entitlement. A new provision is that the requirement of twelve months residence in Australia may be waived where there is satisfactory evidence that the claimant and the children concerned are likely to remain permanently in the Commonwealth. The restriction on the payment of endowment in respect of the children of alien parents has been removed where it is established that the children are likely to be permanent residents in Australia.The review of the legislation directed the Governments attention to certain anomalies in the present Unemployment and Sickness Benefits Act, and some amendments are being effected by the bill. An important one is that the requirement of twelve months residence may be disregarded if the claimant is remaining permanently in Australia. The provisions governing the period during which a sickness benefit may be paid have been liberalized considerably. In future, payment will be made from the seventh day after the date of the incapacity, if a claim is made within six weeks after that date, or in special circumstances, within such further time as the Director-General of Social Services permits. It has been decided to vary the present procedure in applying the means test for unemployment benefit where the claimants spouse is in receipt of a pension. This will correct an anomaly which has given rise to some dissatisfaction, because at present the spouses pension of 32s. 6d. a week, not only prevents any additional benefit from being granted in respect of the spouse, but also causes a reduction of 12s. 6d. a week in the benefit of 25s. which would otherwise be payable to the claimant. In effect, £1 of the pension has been used twice in restricting the amount of benefit payable. Provision is also being made for additional benefit in respect of a housekeeper where no such additional benefit is payable in respect of a wife, and provided there are one or more children under sixteen years of age, and the housekeeper is substantially dependent on the claimant but is not regarded as his employee. In future, the only payments in respect of the incapacity for which sickness benefit is claimed which will be deducted from the amount of benefit otherwise payable, will be amounts in the nature of compensation, damages or other amounts payable by law, but not including any such payments for which the claimant has made contributions.Other substantial alterations of the law are noted in the memorandum which has been circulated to honorable members. In addition, there has been considerable rearrangement and re-drafting of the present acts to simplify both interpretation and implementation. The operation of the bill has been postponed to the 1st July, 1947, to allow time for necessary departmental arrangements to be made and topermit of the issue of fresh instructions. I suggest that the bill constitutes an instalment of social justice, and is a further step towards the goal of social security which our people deserve and require. I feel sure that the broader approach to the question of social services, which is the basis of this measure, will have the general approval of the House.Following is the memorandum to which I referred earlier in my speech : -BRIEF STATEMENT OF THE MAIN ALTERATIONS TO EXISTING SOCIAL LEGISLATION EFFECTED BY THE SOCIAL SERVICES CONSOLIDATION BILL 1947.Part 1. - Preliminary.Title.

(Clauses 102 and 103.)In lieu of the present position, under which a new grant of endowment is paid from the beginning of the four-weekly endowment period during which the endowment becomes payable and an endowment ceases from the beginning of the endowment period during which a child dies or reaches sixteen years of age. a new grant of endowment will commence from the beginning of the first endowment period after the birth of the child, and an endowment terminating on a childs death or sixteenth birthday will cease from the end of the endowment period in which the death or birthday occurs.Payment of endowment during temporary absence from Australia. (Clause 104.)Payment is to be made to qualified Australians temporarily abroad who fulfil particular requirements.Part VII. - Unemployment and Sickness Benefits.Friendly societies. (Clause 106.)The definition of  friendly society  has been amended to include any body or society which is similar in character and provides benefits similar in nature to a friendly society. Existing approvals will not be affected.Definition of income. (Clause 106.)Benefits provided under the Hospital Benefits Act 1945, or Pharmaceutical Benefits Act 1944-45 or the Tuberculosis Act 1945-46, are excluded as income.Residential qualification. (Clauses 107, 108 and 109.)The requirement of twelve months residence can be waived if the claimant intends to remain permanently in Australia.Provisions relating to absences have been deleted but any period of absence due to a war will be treated as residence.Persons qualified for  pension . (Clauses 107 and 108.)Under the present act a person  in receipt of, or qualified to receive  an invalid or age pension, a widows pension or a service pension is disqualified for unemployment, sickness or special benefit. The words  qualified to receive  have been omitted to permit the payment of benefit to an eligible person who,though possessing the qualifications for a pension, is not a claimant.Loss of income. (Clauses 108 (2.).)The provisions under which payments made to certain specified relatives who act as a claimants substitute during sickness were excluded in determining loss of income have been broadened. Bona fide payments to any substitute may now be accepted as a loss of income if made during a period of sickness.Married women. (Clause 110.)Provision has been made for payment of benefit at such rate (within the maximum) as is deemed reasonable where a womans husband is only able to maintain her partially. A married woman legally separated from her husband or living apart from him in circumstances which amount to a permanent separation is eligible for benefit.Additional benefit in respect of partially dependent spouse. (Clause 112 (2.).)The provision under which additional benefit of £1 per week may be paid to a claimant in respect of a dependent spouse has been amended-to enable additional benefit to be paid at such rate (not exceeding £1 per week) as is deemed reasonable where the spouse is partially dependent on the claimant;to restrict the amount of additional benefit to the amount of the claimants contributions where the parties are living apart and to permit payment of the additional benefit direct to the spouse.A dditional benefit in respect of housekeeper. (Clause 112 (3.).)Provision has been made for the payment of additional benefit (not exceeding £1 per week) in respect of a claimants housekeeper, where no such additional benefit is payable in respect of his wife, provided there are one or more children under sixteen years of age and the woman is substantially dependent on the claimant but is not an employee.Means test where claimant and spouse are separated. (Clause 112 (3.) and 114 (3.).)In the case of a claimant and spouse per manently separated any income received by the claimants spouse will be disregarded. If the question of payment of additional benefit in respect of the spouse has to be decided, however, regard may be had to the amount of the spouses income.Spouse in receipt of a pension.. (Clause 114 (4.).)Where the claimants spouse is in receipt of a pension, £1 per week of the pension is to be excluded from income. This has been necessary to correct an anomaly. At present the spouses pension of 32s. 6d. per week not only prevents any additional benefit from being granted in respect of the spouse but it also causes a reduction of 12s. 6d. in the benefit of 25s. which would otherwise be payable to the claimant.Compensation, damages, do. (Clause 115.)Under the present act the rate of sickness benefit which would otherwise be payable must be reduced by the amount of any other payment received by the claimant whether by way of compensation, damages  or otherwise  in respect of the incapacity for which he is qualified for sickness benefit. The range of such payments which must be deducted from the rate of sickness benefit has been limited to compensation or damages or any payment under any Commonwealth or State act or other law, received in respect of the incapacity for which sickness benefit is payable, but not a payment for which the claimant has contributed.The provisions under which sickness benefit may become a charge upon any compensation or damages awarded have been broadened to include any payment under this clause.Date of commencement of sickness benefit. (Clause 119.)The period within which a claim for sickness benefit must be lodged has been extended to six weeks after the commencement of the incapacity. If the claim is lodged after the expiration of six weeks payment will commence from the date of lodgment unless the claimant demonstrates that the delay was due to some sufficient cause.Part VIII. - Training and Physical Rehabilitation of Pensioners and Beneficiaries.Vocational training. (Clause 134.)The provisions relating to the vocational training and physical rehabilitation of invalid pensioners and unemployment and sickness beneficiaries have been combined in this part.Pabt IX. - Miscellaneous.Claims for inappropriate pensions. (Clause 145.)An application to any Commonwealth department or authority for assistance is to be regarded as a claim for a benefit under the Social Services Consolidation Act, provided a claim on the appropriate form is subsequently lodged and investigation shows the applicant to be eligible.Payments after death. (Clause 146.)Any pension or benefit under the SocialServices Consolidation Act accrued and unpaid at the death of a recipient or a claimant is to be paid, at the discretion of the administration, to the person best entitled to receive the money, provided application is made within six months from the date of death or within such further period as may be allowed.Debate (on motion by Mr. Menzies) adjourned.","Second Reading","SOCIAL SERVICES CONSOLIDATION BILL 1947","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

72,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CAMERON, Archie","JTY","Barker","ALP","N/A",2873,".- The bill before the House is one which, in my opinion, is most peculiarly worded, and which has a history that has not been disclosed by the Treasurer (Mr. Chifley) who presented it to the House. If I am any judge of the political weather in international affairs, this bill arises out of certain discussions which have taken place between the Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of the United States of America in relation to financial matters. I believe it is fair to assume that those in authority in Washington have intimated to the Government of the United Kingdom that, in their opinion, it is high time that the dominions shouldered some responsibility in respect of financial commitments arising out of the war, and, in particular, certain theatres of war. There are two clauses in the bill, clause 2, which is the vital one, reading as follows : -There shall be payable out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is hereby appropriated accordingly, for the purpose of a grant to His Majestys Government in the United Kingdom, the sum of £25,000,000 as a contribution towards war expenditure of that Government incurred by it in respect of operations and in and around the Pacific.We are entitled to very much more information than was given by the Treasurer as to the reasons for the inclusion of that restriction in the bill. The Australian Commonwealth was engaged in war in theatres other than the Pacific. We were engaged in the Middle East, our air and naval forces were engaged in the United Kingdom and in the Atlantic, and we were engaged in a training capacity in Rhodesia, and in Canada, where we were fairly heavily committed. The full effects of the benefits that Australia has received from other dominions have not been stated to the Parliament by the Treasurer. Only a few days ago, the Sydney Morning Herald published the following statement under the heading,  Canadas aid to Britain  : -The Canadian Government, under an agreement made with Britain last year, cancelled a debt of £A130.7 million owing by Britain for the British Commonwealth air training plan.This was mentioned in the British House of Commons by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Dr. Dalton, in reply to a question about monetary gifts from the Dominions to Britain between August 1, 1045, and April 1, 1947.Dr. Dalton said that mutual aid from Canada continued to September 1, 1945. The total from April 1 to September 1, 1945, was £A206.1 million. Britain for the most part, he added, received munitions and military supplies, foodstuffs and farm products.Australia had made a gift <A £A25 million to Britain this year and New Zealand has given £A12.5 million.I am sure that the opinion of Dr. Dalton, a good Labour man, will be accepted by the Government and its supporters. That is an interesting statement. According to it, the aid granted by Canada to the United Kingdom, for a period of only five months, was valued at no less than £206,100,000. However, Canada has not stopped at that. I refer honorable members to the Auditor-Generals report for 1945-46, paragraph 125 of which is as follows : -Reference was made in previous reports to the financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and Canadian Governments regarding the training of Royal Australian Air Force air crews in Canada. In paragraph 113 of last years report the total liability of Australia to Canada under the two-year agreement which expired on 31st March, 1945, was shown as $30,247,000 (£A8,560,311 ) , which amount, less certain credits to Australia, it was stated, was being met by the Canadian Mutual Aid Board. The amount actually paid by the board to the Canadian Department of National Defence, Air Force Services, was the dollar equivalent of £7.909,754, the reduction of £050,557 in Australias liability representing payments by the Commonwealth in Australia under the Air Training Scheme. It is anticipated that this expenditure by Australia will be slightly increased when certain intransit vouchers have been received and analysed.I presume that the Auditor-Generals statements will not be challenged or qualified by the Government. According to him, the Commonwealth has received in one item from the Canadian Government almost £8,000,000 in respect of moneys which were due by it to the Canadian Government under the Empire Air Training Scheme. I have examined the Auditor-Generals report closely, but I have not found reference to any liabilities that we may have contracted, or any benefits that we may have received, from the air training depots in Rhodesia, where many Australians were sent. The £8,000,000 that Canada has given to us is almost one-third of the amount which we propose to give to the United Kingdom. After the suspension of the sitting, I intend to cite certain other figures from Government documents, every one of which has been laid on the table of this House.Sitting suspended from 12.^5 to 2.S5 p.m.","Second Reading","UNITED KINGDOM GRANT BILL 1947","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
73,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CAMERON, Archie","JTY","N/A","N/A","N/A",2874,"- Coming, to the section of the Auditor-Generals report headed, Department of the Navy , I take naval shipbuilding. According to the Auditor-General -Although final financial adjustment has not been effected with the Governments of the United Kingdom and India in respect of minesweeping vessels built on their behalf during the war, a further progress payment of £274,999 was made by the British Government in March, 1940. Total progress payments received by the Commonwealth to 30th June, 1940, were -N/AIn addition, a sum of £80,000 was received from the British Government in respect of technical supervision and other services performed by the Department of the Navy in connexion with Royal Navy construction. This amount has been credited to Division 190o - Credits arising from War Expenditure.That is a nice little item. Then we get the Allocation of Hospital Ships Expenses Paragraph 114 of the report states -As reported in paragraph 105 of last years report, agreement between Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa was reached on the division of costs of hospital ships operated by those countries and employed in the Middle East Hospital Ship Pool. Since the date of agreement, the use of hospital ships has been extended beyond the scheme then envisaged and the British Ministry of War Transport has suggested a revision of the original agreement, and proposes that liability be assessed on the basis of a capitation rate for personnel carried. Negotiations are proceeding.No sums are mentioned ; but what I read into that is that the agreement under which we operated the hospital ship pool was unduly favorable to the Commonwealth of Australia and that the British Ministry of War Transport has therefore asked for a revision. Until we get a statement from the British Ministry about the hospital ship position we shall not know what our income may be - if I may use that term - from that source. I come now to -  Fleet bases and works for the British Pacific fleet.The vital paragraph is -To 30th June, 1940, expenditure on fleet bases and other works amounted to £16,2(10,0:39, of which £10,695,000 has been reimbursed by the United Kingdom Government. Additional expenditure subsequent to this date is dependent on government policy in respect of incomplete projects, but is not expected to exceed the estimate of £17,559,050.It appears from the Auditor-Generals report that in connexion with the operation of the British Fleet in the Pacific, the area that the Treasurer himself has named in clause 2 of this bill, commitments have been entered into totalling £33,819,000. Of that the United Kingdom Government has already paid us £10,695,000. It looks to me from the wording of the Auditor-Generals report that we are now presenting the United Kingdom with a bill for the balance. In other words, we want cash out of the Old Country and will keep the bases as well.","Second Reading","UNITED KINGDOM GRANT BILL 1947","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The next paragraph deals with the naval stores section -Several Royal Australian Navy store depots were extended and additional depots constructed to provide for the handling of both Royal Navy and Royal Australian Navy stocks. Running expenses, charged originally to Royal Australian Navy appropriations, are shared with the United Kingdom Government in the estimated proportion of the supplies handled in respect of each administration. Tentative adjustment involving a contribution by the United Kingdom Government to 31st March, 1946, of £2,085,000, has been effected, the amount being credited to Division 190c.Here again we find that the United Kingdom Government i3 contributing to the naval expenses of the conduct of the war in the Pacific. If it had not been for the Royal Navy in the North Sea, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the Pacific Ocean and every lane in the  seven seas , we should not be meeting here to-day. Yet, we find that in respect of the miserable administration of a naval store the Commonwealth Government has the effrontery, to put it mildly, to collect £2,085,000 from the United Kingdom. I should like the Treasurer to submit to the House a statement showing the financial position in regard to our troop, Air Force and Navy arrangements in the United Kingdom. Did the British Government charge us fees for the use of its bases when our cruisers were working in the Atlantic and adjacent waters? Did it charge us for the occupation of camps in the United Kingdom when our 18th Brigade was there for a time? Did that Government charge us rent for the use of air bases in the United Kingdom? I say the thing is preposterous, and the only occasion in military history when such a thing has ever been done before was in World War I., when the British armies had to pay rent for the trenches in which they fought in France.","Second Reading","UNITED KINGDOM GRANT BILL 1947","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Turning now to the Department of the Army, the report of the Auditor-General under the heading  Internment camps for overseas internees and prisoners of war , states - 120. Expenditure during the year in connexion with overseas civilian internees and prisoners of war, recoverable from other administrations, was £1,941,736, making the total expenditure £9,463,770 to the 30th June, 1946. Of this sum £7.529,004 has been reimbursed to the Commonwealth, leaving £1,934,766 to be recovered.In addition to the abovementioned expenditure, an amount of £568,128 has been charged to reciprocal lend-lease in respect of prisoners of war detained on behalf of the United States of America. Since the termination of the Reciprocal Lend-Lease Agreement, further expenditure totalling £241,554 has been incurred in respect of these prisoners. This sum, which is included in the amount of £0,463,770 quoted above, is held in suspense pending the result of negotiations with the United States Government.I want the House to realize the difference in treatment we are extending to Great Britain and that which we are according to the United States of America. Under the terms of the lend-lease agreement we were financially responsible for any commitments entered into on our own soil, so that costs incurred in connexion with prisoners of war interned on behalf of the United States of America were charged against reciprocal lend-lease; in other words, we bore those costs. When it was a matter of interning prisoners of war sent here from the Middle East, most of whom had been captured by the 6th And 7th Australian Divisions, we housed, fed and guarded them, and then sent in the bill to the United Kingdom Government. This is one of the most amazing transactions in the history of warfare. Wo take part in military operations, capture large numbers of enemy troops - of which the whole nation is so proud - and then we send in an account to the British Government, whose country has been so badly battered and smashed. I have never heard of such a thing before ! Turning now to the cost of British naval operations in the Pacific, every honorable member opposite knows the value to this country of those operations, and no one will suggest that the naval protection was ineffective in saffeguarding this country. It was well worth paying for, but in respect of that naval defence we have collected from the United Kingdom Government the sum of only £10,695,000, and we are billing the United Kingdom for another £17,500,000.","Second Reading","UNITED KINGDOM GRANT BILL 1947","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In regard to the internment of prisoners of war - many of whom were, doubtless, taken prisoner by our own troops - we have been paid £7,529,000. For the cost of construction of mine-sweeping flotillas in Pacific waters we have been paid £4,172,000. In addition, the Commonwealth is to receive a sum, not yet determined, in respect of hospital ships. Another matter which has not been mentioned in the Auditor-Generals report is the fact that when the Australian cruiser Canberra was sunk the Royal Navy gave us the cruiser Shropshire to replace it. That gift was worth approximately £3,000,000. If we had to build a similar vessel to-day it would cost us double that figure. However, leaving out of consideration that generous gift of the United Kingdom, we find that we have already received from that Government in respect of war credits the sum of approximately £24,000,000. We have received from the Dominion of Canada by a very generous gift, about which nothing has been said in this Parliament, a sum of £7,909,000. Now, out of the depths of our generosity, we propose to give to the United Kingdom the sum of £25,000,000 - an amount which we have already collected in advance. I say that this is one of the most amazing bills ever introduced, even compared with other remarkable pieces of legislation introduced by this Government. I say that this gift should be looked at merely from the viewpoint of clause 2 of the bill. That clause states -There shall be payable out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is hereby appropriated accordingly, for the purpose of a grant to His Majestys Government in the United Kingdom, the sum of Twenty-five million pounds as a contribution towards war expenditure of that Government incurred by it in respect of operations in and around the Pacific.What does the term  operations in and around the Pacific connote? Does it include the expenditure sustained by Great Britain in Burma ? The campaigns in Burma, including the one which we lost in 1942 and the victorious campaign of 1945, were as essential to the safety of Australia as any campaign conducted in the Pacific. Does Trincomalee come within the definition of operations in and around the Pacific  ? A considerable naval base was established there after the fall of Singapore, and that base was just as vital to the defence of this country as the base established in Sydney. But there is no suggestion that we should bear any of that expenditure. We have received no account in respect of the huge cost of maintenance of our forces in the Middle East.","Second Reading","UNITED KINGDOM GRANT BILL 1947","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We cannot pass over those obligations by saying that we confined ourselves to the war in and around the Pacific.

It is regrettable that the Commonwealth Government is not prepared, for once in its life, to imitate, if not emulate, the example set by the Canadian Government, and supply the food to which reference was made in the Sydney Morning Herald last Tuesday. That is the point at which the Government baulks. The Government tries to convince the Australian taxpayer, and the world at large, that its obligations will be met in full as soon as the bill making a gift of £25,000,000 to the United Kingdom is passed. If the accounts are produced, they will show that Australia has received from the United Kingdom more than £25,000,000 in cash, which it is now proposing to write off.

109,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"LANG, John","KZJ","Reid","N/A","N/A",2879,".- The measure before the House is a piecemeal measure. It is trifling with a problem that should be tackled in a realistic way, and on a realistic basis. The very title of the bill introduced a wrong note into the relationship which should exist between Australia and the United Kingdom. The approach has been that the United Kingdom is in sore financial difficulties, and that the only way in which we can help is to make a grant of eA.25,000,000. That is reducing the United Kingdom to the status of a mendicant. How is the £25,000,000 to be paid to Britain ? Had the Australian Government decided to send to Britain food valued at £25,000,000 there might have been some merit in the proposal, but all that is proposed is that a bookkeeping entry shall be made. Our balances in London are to be reduced by £20,000,000 sterling. How much better off will the people of Britain be for that bookkeeping entry? Britains external liabilities were increased by £3,500,000,000 during the war. Compared with that sum £20,000,000 sterling is almost an infinitesimal amount; it represents about 2 per cent, of the recent loan to Britain from the United States of America, and it will not provide any real substance to Britain. According to the Government, Australia is already sending to Britain the maximum quantity of food that can be sent, and so this measure will not assist the people there by so much as one mouthful of food a day. Thus, the measure fails to satisfy the only test that would justify the use of the word  grant  in the title of the bill. The real problem, therefore, is one affecting the financial relations between Australia and Great Britain. The Prime Minister (Mr. Chifley) told the Parliament that Australia has in London balances amounting to £170,000,000 sterling, but he did not tell us that Australias public debt to Britain is £487,27.1,000 sterling. When on a former occasion a partial scaling down of Britains debt in favour of Australia was proposed, there was an immediate howl of  repudiation  throughout the length and breadth of the land.The Prime Minister did not tell us that the British Chancellor of the Exchequer had requested this action, and therefore we are entitled to ask what is the background of the proposal. Let us examine the true position. It is suggested that because American servicemen spent a lot of. money in Australia during the war, and as we made those dollars available to the sterling bloc, we now have large credits in London. But even if we agree to wipe out £25,000,000 Australian of Britains indebtedness, we shall still not improve Britains position in relation to the dollar pool. Britains need to-day is dollar currency, .not Australian currency. Britain would prefer to sell to Australia goods to the value of £25,000,000 than have Australia wipe that amount off the slate, because in that way Britain would be helping to re-establish its own overseas markets, which is that countrys most urgent need if it is to survive as a major industrial power.The next argument that has been advanced is that Britain expended a lot of money in fighting the war in the Pacific. That statement places a very sordid interpretation on the responsibilities of partners in a total war. It would be just as logical to suggest that Britain should recoup this country for the total expenditure in connexion with Australian forces which participated in the Battle for Britain or in the North African campaign. That argument, is not fair to Great Britain, and it should never have been allowed to intrude itself in this discussion. The Prime Minister said that it is proposed to make this contribution towards the war costs . incurred by the British Government in and around the Pacific. That is as much as to say that the Pacific campaign was. of no real concern to the British Government. By raising this argument the Government reduces Australias war effort to a materialistic basis. Surely, it is possible to approach, this problem on a practical basis. Instead of thinking in terms of £25,000,000 Australian, it should be possible to review the entire incidence of the financial relationships between the two countries. Although we have a temporary liquid balance in London to-day, experience shows that such balances can vanish as quickly as they are created. A fall in wool prices, an increase of imports from Britain, or a drought, would wipe out the whole of our London balances. But there should be nothing to prevent an overall adjustment of the debt structure. At the present time Australia owes £487,000,000 in London and £40,000,000 in New York. On the other hand, we have £170,000,000 available in London, in balances that are held as liquid assets.The average rate of interest we are paying in London is £3 12s. Id. per cent., whilst the average rate in Australia is only £2 15s. 8d. per cent. At the present time we have to find over £16,000,000 sterling each year for our interest payments to London and New York on government debts. Is not the practical approach to this problem, then, a two-way funding of the two debts ? Instead of Australia retaining the whole of its £170,000,000 in the form of liquid balances in London, why not use the major portion of it to reduce the long term debt? That would reduce our interest payments abroad, and would also lessen the drain on the sterling balance each year. That means that the London debt would, perhaps, have to be replaced by loans raised in Australia. Instead of the interest having to be paid in London, it would have to be found in Australia. That some such arrangement could be made was demonstrated by the Funding Arrangements Act of 1921, under which the total Australian war debt to Britain arising out of World War I. was funded. Again, during the depression a moratorium was granted in respect of the payment of interest on war debts. Britain stopped paying to the United States of America, and we stopped paying to Britain. Even so, we are still paying interest on the* war debts in connexion with World War I. which were funded with the British public. So there is both precedent and sound common sense in favour of tackling the entire problem, not in this piecemeal way, but on a nation to nation basis. Let us forget all this most unfortunate talk about making a grant to Britain. It sounds too much like a hand-out, or charity. It cannot help Britain with its major financial problem.Can the Treasurer tell us how much interest Britain must find if we main* tain the whole of our £170,000,000 sterling intact ? Let us tackle something more than this, which is an empty book-: keeping entry. Let us survey the financial and economic relations between our two countries on a long-term basis. I said in this building many years ago, and I now say it again to this Parliament because I sincerely believe it, that the only real basis is an exchange of goods between the United Kingdom and Australia. We must buy more of each others products. If our credits in London are too large, or our debt is too great, those positions are barriers to trade. I ask honorable members to consider that. Every £1 that we have to divert for interest means £1 less spent on British goods. Every £1 held in London is £1 that we could have spent. That, to my mind, is the crux of the problem. This bill, at its best, is an empty gesture. Let us make a substantial contribution towards the establishment of a sound basis for trade between our two countries. Let us overhaul the debt structure. Let us - I put this seriously to the Treasurer, who is also the Prime Minister - repatriate as much as possible of our overseas loans. That would be in accordance with Labours financial policy. It would be in the best interests of Australias future, as well as a fillip to that which is most desired and wanted by the United King. dom. namely, trade.Debate (on motion by Mr. Turnbull) adjourned.That the House do now adjourn.","Second Reading","UNITED KINGDOM GRANT BILL 1947","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I asked the Prime Minister (Mr, Chifley) whether he would ensure adequate supplies of black coal to Victoria, and whether he had had conversations on this subject with the Premier of that State. He said that he had had such conversations, and later supplied the following answer: -Further to my reply to the honorable members question ... I desire to inform him that the Minister for Supply and Shipping has nd vised me that the Joint Coal Board regularly reviews the whole question of distribution, and has decided that, in present circumstances, a fair quota for Victoria would be 30,000 tons a week, by sea and rail. This target has now definitely been set by the board and arrangements have now been made by the Australian Shipping Board for the appropriate tonnage.Since I received that reply another state of emergency has arisen in Victoria. In Melbourne, gas is to be rationed for at least the next ten days, when householders will be allowed to use gas for only four hours daily. This is a recurring trouble due to production and distribution factors in New South Wales. However, when the Prime Minister makes a promise that something will be done one should be able to give credence to it. But what do we find ? Yesterday the Australian Shipping Board, in spite of what the Prime Minister said, announced that it had allotted tonnage to take 22,000 tons of coal weekly to Victoria. Thus, even should coal be available the Shipping Board has arranged to move only 22,000 tons a week. How many tons will be carried by rail I do not know. It is time that the Prime Minister followed up his promise to ensure that Victoria shall receive its proper quota.","Coal : Victorian Supplies - Taxation : Refunds - Rabbit Skins - Royal Australian Air Force: Medical Personnel","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Some time ago when I asked a question relating to the distribution of tons of steel held at Newcastle, and stated that ships only half loaded were leaving Newcastle for Victoria, I was assured that full freight would be loaded by all available vessels. Therefore, the Government has some control over shipping. I do not raise this matter in any party political spirit, but as a representative of a Victorian electorate, and because I am fully aware of the disadvantage suffered by Victorians in this respect. Years ago, when the late Sir John Monash undertook the brown coal project at Yallourn, he said that when that project was in full operation Victoria would be no longer be the industrial vassal of New South Wales. To-day, although that great engineering work has been brought to fruition, and from it the people of Victoria are supplied with electric power when Mr. Brown, or other notorious Communist leaders do not cause a strike, Victoria is still dependent upon New South Wales for black coal of a quality required for making gas and on the railways.

117,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CAMERON, Archie","JTY","Barker","ALP","N/A",2881,". - A few days ago I had occasion to complain of the very slow method of repaying refunds of tax to taxpayers who had overpaid tax. Later, I received from the Treasurer (Mr. Chifley), an answer to a question which I ashed upon notice, in which he stated that there were about 350,000 taxpayers awaiting refunds, and that refunds would be paid within a few days after personal, or written, application had been made. I have since received from one taxpayer a volume of correspondence dealing with his claim for a refund of tax. He paid his tax on the 3rd June, 1946, and the amount overpaid was £4 3s. Since that date nothing has been done. The latest letter he received is dated the 17th May, in which he was informed that the department was still dealing with his claim. If departmental officers can sit down and write letters over a period of twelve months, it might be easier for them to write out a cheque for the amount which is clearly owing. This is the kind of treatment which exasperates taxpayers. It is all very well for the Treasurer to say they can make personal application for refunds ; but any one who visits a taxation office in any of the capital cities and sees the queues of claimants will get a fairly correct idea of their chance of having their claims dealt with. I assure the Treasurer that these cases are serious. As I said earlier, whilst a few pounds may not seem much to the department which handles hundreds of millions, it may represent an important consideration to a taxpayer who is overcharged that amount.Some time ago I asked the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) if he would table the papers in connexion with the prosecution of a man named Rudkin in Western Australia in 1940. I again ask the Attorney-General to attend to this matter. Possibly he will tell me next Tuesday whether he will comply with my request.","Coal : Victorian Supplies - Taxation : Refunds - Rabbit Skins - Royal Australian Air Force: Medical Personnel","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
118,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"TURNBULL, Winton","KWP","Wimmera","N/A","N/A",2882,", - I take this opportunity to protest against the reimposition of the levy on rabbit skins which was reimposed last Saturday at the rate of ls. 6d. per lb. The Governments policy with regard to this matter is short-sighted. According to press reports, the United States of America, which in 1945-46 imported 13,000,000 lb. of Australian rabbit skins, worth approximately £5,000,000, is hoping to c»- operate with Australia in a cam paign for the promotion of an increased demand for rabbit skin coats, in which case America would double its present imports of rabbit skins. The point I emphasized is that the rabbit is the most serious menace to primary production, because it destroys grass, which is the most valuable of all crops. In addition, it destroys young crops. The rabbit is also responsible for much of our soil erosion, because its burrows give a start to wind and water to set up erosion. Ten million pounds sounds a lot of money, but no one can estimate the number of millions of pounds lost to Australia through the damage caused by rabbits. It may be argued that the price of rabbit skins is -high, and that it will not affect the matter much if a levy of ls. 6d. per lb. is imposed. I can imagine hearing the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr. Pollard) saying that. I maintain, however, that we should encourage the price nf skins to remain as high as possible so as to induce persons who ordinarily do not bother about rabbits at all to go out trapping them, especially now when labour is short and rabbit-proof fencing is scarce and dear. This pest must be eradicated of at least restricted if we are to obtain the full benefits of our fertile soil, and to derive benefit from irrigation projects. The effect of neglecting the control of rabbits will be felt not to-day or to-morrow but in ten or twenty years time. It is argued that by re-imposing the levy it will be possible to reduce the price of hats by 10s; each, but those hats are worn chiefly by people in the cities. The policy of the Government will have the effect of preventing the destruction of rabbits in the country so that people in the cities may have cheaper hats. If we weigh the benefits and disadvantages of this proposal it will be seen that no sound grounds exist for re-imposing the levy.","Coal : Victorian Supplies - Taxation : Refunds - Rabbit Skins - Royal Australian Air Force: Medical Personnel","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
119,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"HUTCHINSON, William","KIX","Deakin","N/A","N/A",2882,". - I bring to the notice of the Acting Minister for Air (Mr. Barnard) the position of medical officers in the Royal Australian Air Force. They enlisted for the duration of the war and twelve months thereafter, hut they are finding it practically impossible to obtain their discharges. I understand that contemporary medical officers in the Australian Military . Forces have been released, and those in the Royal Australian Air Force wish to be released also. I recognize that there are certain commitments which have to be honoured. There must be some medical officers with members of the Royal Australian Air Force in the occupation forces, and doctors are needed to staff hospitals and permanent establishments. However, I have been informed that permanent establishments controlled by the Army are staffed largely by civilian doctors. There are about ten Royal Australian Air Force stations on the mainland where flying takes place, and I recognize that medical officers must be attached to those stations. At the present time it is very rare for any medical man to apply for a permanent commission in the Royal Australian Air Force, and it is not difficult to believe this when one knows the circumstances of the service. The pay is very poor - about £500 a year, which is the same as is earned by many skilled and semi-skilled tradesmen. There is no inducement for married medical men to join the service, because suitable living quarters are not provided. Medical officers transferred from one State to another find it very difficult to obtain accommodation for their wives and families. This discourages the recruitment of medical officers, and, in turn, prevents the release of those officers who are already serving. The Repatriation Department pays £862 a year to medical officers, whilst the Commonwealth Medical Service pays about £1,000 a year. This is in marked contrast to the £500 a year paid in the air force.A possible solution of the difficulty would be to get young medical graduates to serve in the air force for a period of, say, six months after graduation, so that there would be a constant succession of them entering and leaving the service. This would relieve those men who have been in the service for years, and who are anxious to return to civil practice. The position of a medical officer attached to a flying station in peace-time, where all the men are young and healthy, does not provide many opportunities for becoming proficient in his profession, with the result that he tends to become stale pro fessionally. I trust that the Minister will give favorable consideration to my suggestions.","Coal : Victorian Supplies - Taxation : Refunds - Rabbit Skins - Royal Australian Air Force: Medical Personnel","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
120,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"POLLARD, Reginald","KYC","Ballaarat","ALP","Minister for Commerce and Agriculture",2883,". - The honorable member for Wimmera (Mr. Turnbull) has voiced some objections to the imposition of a levy on rabbit skins exported from Australia. I think I should tell the honorable member the history of that levy. It was imposed in 1941 by the Menzies Government, and was supported by the party to which the honorable member for Wimmera belongs. Its purpose was to ensure the stabilization of the price of hats for the Australian civil community, and for members of the defence forces. There is some logic and common sense in this levy. If Australia were to submit to the imposition- upon its population of prices ruling in other parts of the world, our own internal economy, as it affects both city and country dwellers, would crash. In these circumstances, the Government has decided to continue the levy to which it is committed under legislation introduced by the Menzies Government. The levy operates in this manner: Babbit skins are sold by auction, and the sales are attended by both export buyers and local hat manufacturers who compete for the skins which are available. After a sale, the skins purchased for export at prices related to the internal economy of the countries represented by the buyers, are subjected to a levy which is determined by the Commonwealth Government from time to time. At present it is ls. 6d. per lb. There is then a readjustment between the price of the export skins and the price of skins bought by Australian hat manufacturers, who are subsidized by the amount by which the price that he bid at auction exceeded the price fixed by the Australian Prices Commissioner.","Coal : Victorian Supplies - Taxation : Refunds - Rabbit Skins - Royal Australian Air Force: Medical Personnel","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

122,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"POLLARD, Reginald","KYC","N/A","N/A","N/A",2883,"- What the honorable member overlooks is the fact that the Australian hat manufacturer competes with the export buyer at the auction sale. If that were not so, the Australian hat manufacturer could have his parcel of skins set aside for him and there would not be any benefit to the trapper. The view expressed by the honorable member for Wimmera is stupid. If we were to allow the prices of all other products to go to the extreme limits ruling in the United States of America, Great Britain or France, the Australian economy would be ruined, and our own stabilization schemes would go  haywire . The first sufferers would be the Australian primary producers and other members of the community dependent upon primary production. In these circumstances, there is no legitimate case for the removal of the levy. The honorable members argument, in effect, is that the imposition of this tax of ls. 6d. per lb. on exported skins makes trapping unattractive. The fact is, however, that at the rabbit skin sales recently held in Sydney, a price of 9Sd. per lb. was realized. At eight skins to the lb.. that is ls. a skin. When I was a youth, the price of rabbit skins was 6d. per lb. If the honorable member for Wimmera maintains that the imposition of a levy of ls. 6d. per lb. will discourage the trapper and the farmer from chasing  brer rabbit , he does not know his subject. It is true that some Australian primary producers and others are submitting a case that the imposition of this levy will result in a great increase of rabbit numbers in rural areas, but that is not so. Last year, Australia exported rabbit skins to the value of £9,000,000. The average pre-war figure was £600,000. In these circumstances, the honorable members case is entirely fallacious.Question resolved in the affirmative.","Coal : Victorian Supplies - Taxation : Refunds - Rabbit Skins - Royal Australian Air Force: Medical Personnel","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Our tinned plate supply position is very short and difficulty will be experienced in providing sufficient to pack those more important foodstuffs which require its use. Furthermore I understand that the British Ministry of Food desires that honey sent to the United Kingdom should be shipped in bulk containers not less than 4-gallon capacity. I appreciate that the distribution .proposed by the Queensland Womens Association is possibly something apart from the activities of the Ministry of Food, but at the same time in the light of our present shortage of tinned plate, the Queensland organization might perhaps review its proposed distribution with a view to utilizing the 4-gallon size container with a capacity of some 60 lb. and consigning them to an appropriate body in the United Kingdom which could possibly repack into smaller jars for local distribution.","Honey","ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS","/hansard/answers.to.questions/debate/subdebate.1[1]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Minister for Trade and Customs has supplied the following information : -Although the launch was shipped from Sydney in December, 1940, the agent for the mission at that port did not apply for refund of the deposit until the 14th Millen, 1947, that is, three months after the launch had been shipped. This was the principal cause of the delay in the refunding of the deposit; but a further delay resulted because the claim, through pressure of work in the department, had not been dealt with by the end of March and the deposit was automatically transferred to -revenue, thus involving a complication in dealing with the refund. The claim was ultimately forwarded, duly certified, to the SubTreasury, Sydney, on the 12th May and was paid to the mission on the 16th May.","Banking","ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS","/hansard/answers.to.questions/debate/subdebate.1[4]/answer[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
