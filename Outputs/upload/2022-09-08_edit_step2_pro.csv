4,0,0,0,1,1,"King, Catherine Fiona MP","00AMR","Ballarat","ALP","N/A",1199," I move:That this bill be now read a second time.I rise to introduce this bill to establish a High-Speed Rail Authority as an independent body to advise on, plan and develop the high-speed rail system in Australia. There has been very little action to progress high-speed rail in Australia until now.This government is absolutely committed to establishing this authority to oversee the construction and operation of a high-speed rail network along Australias eastern seaboard. The High-Speed Rail Authority will reinvigorate work on this very important nation-building project, and Australians will no longer miss out on high-speed rail.The benefits identified in the former Labor governments comprehensive two-stage rail study were significant, not just in substantially reducing travel times; but also in unlocking regional economies, providing significant employment opportunities, and supplying a remarkable economic boost in the medium and long term. The study found that, for every dollar of costs, there would be a return of $2.30 in benefits to society.The evidence has shown that without high-speed rail, Australia is missing out on significant opportunities, which is why the authority is being established. The authority will provide expert independent advice and work with the Victorian, New South Wales (NSW), Australian Capital Territory, and Queensland governments, local government and the private sector to drive this change.A high-speed rail network will revolutionise interstate travel in Australia, significantly reducing travel time to move between capital cities compared to other modes of travel. Imagine a high-speed train connecting capital cities from Melbourne, to Canberra, to Sydney, to Brisbane, all across our regional centres, through our semi-urban populations, straight to our international hubs with trips taking as little as three hours.We will no longer be behind the rest of the developed world when it comes to land infrastructure and technology. Japan introduced its first bullet train in 1964, France in 1981, and China introduced in 2003. These countries have since grown their high-speed networks, increased their top train speeds, and now celebrate annual patronage in the hundreds of millions on their high-speed rail networks. Lets get on board and give the Australian public a modern efficient, and high-speed rail network.A well-patronised high-speed rail service will assist us to meet our net zero commitment by providing lower ongoing energy and greenhouse gas emissions than interstate travel by air, and has an added benefit of reducing road traffic. Settlement patterns across Australias east coast will be transformed, alleviating pressure on outer suburban areas and growth corridors in major cities.The construction of high-speed rail will secure significant jobs for the economy, impacting all Australians. Through Labors National Rail Manufacturing Plan, administered by the minister for industry, here in the chamber today, the Australian government will ensure that more trains are built here in Australia by local manufacturing, local workers, and that every dollar of federal funding spent on rail projects will go towards creating local jobs and providing a sustainable industry, and a sustainable manufacturing industry in particular.This bill will ensure that high-speed rail is progressed in Australia, with the immediate priority of updated analysis and commencing work on an initial connection between Sydney and Newcastle. Once established well begin work on planning and overseeing the construction of a reliable, safe, efficient and cost-effective high-speed rail network.As a statutory agency, the authority will provide independent and impartial advice on the policy and standards, develop business cases and secure corridors. Specific measures will be taken to prevent and reduce the environmental impact on surrounding land and the authority will coordinate and consult with state and territory governments, industry, business and communities to enhance Australias long-term trail investment.Faster rail will continue under the authority. Whilst the National Faster Rail Agency will be ceased, its functions will be absorbed into the authority and the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts to retain the existing capability and expertise and ensure that both faster rail and high-speed rail are delivered.High-speed rail and faster rail will help all Australians to secure jobs, and to build a better future for our regions, and to reinvigorate manufacturing in Australia.We know there is a very strong interest internationally and from the private sector with experience in high-speed rail. The authority will work with consortiums collaboratively and with transparency to investigate alternate funding and financing opportunities including value uplift. The authority will also commence work to secure corridors now and not waste any opportunity.We have already as a government committed $500 million to commence early works and secure corridors for the rail connection between Sydney, the Central Coast and Newcastle. The government will continue negotiations with the New South Wales government on the allocation and other investment options to be identified between the Australian government and New South Wales government further down the line.As a government, its expected that we serve the Australian community and that we improve the lives of Australian people. Establishing the High-Speed Rail Authority and investing in high-speed rail will improve the lives of all Australians and transform this country. The time is now. We need to stop procrastinating and start taking action to actually deliver high-speed rail. This is a long-term project with significant benefits and its not just about a political cycle but rather a focus on Australias future, and particularly the focus on our regions. A high-speed rail network along the east coast of Australia will truly be a transformational project that has the ability to touch the lives of all Australians. Its a project that has the support of the regions and cities, of businesses and industries. Now is the time to complete transformational infrastructure projects that not only sets Australia up for the future but also provides jobs and opportunities immediately.High-speed rail will be an economic game changer for the country and will improve growth, access and sustainability. It will provide countless social benefits long into the future and create broad economic benefits for our regional centres.The bill Im introducing today will allow all of these things to finally happen in this parliament. We must not delay the Australian public any longer. Lets give our fellow Australians the bipartisan support to pass this bill to let the authority commence its work to make high-speed rail a reality and invest in our countrys future.Debate adjourned.","High Speed Rail Authority Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms CATHERINE KING (Ballarat—Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government) ","(09:01):"
5,0,0,0,1,1,"Dreyfus, Mark MP","HWG","Isaacs","ALP","N/A",1200," I move:That this bill be now read a second time.Terrorism remains a real and enduring challenge for Australia—for our social cohesion and for the safety of individuals. We must protect Australia against immediate and developing threats and continue to build a more resilient and cohesive nation. To this end, this bill provides for the continuation of key counterterrorism powers that ensure the safety and security of all Australians: the emergency stop, search and seizure powers in the Crimes Act, the control order regime, and the preventative detention order regime. The powers are currently due to sunset on 7 December 2022.The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security conducted a statutory review of these powers during the term of the last parliament and presented its report in October 2021. The committee unanimously supported the extension of the powers subject to certain amendments, including the introduction of additional safeguards.Due to the complexity of a number of the committees proposed amendments, and the need to consult with states and territories in relation to any proposed amendments to part 5.3 of the Criminal Code Act 1995, there is not enough time before the end of the year to:finalise the governments response to the committees report and each of its detailed recommendations;draft legislation to implement the governments response;consult with, and obtain the agreement of, state and territory governments to draft legislation; andintroduce and secure passage of the legislation through the parliament.This bill would extend the relevant sunset dates by 12 months so that there is sufficient time to consult on, and then implement, the governments response to the committees bipartisan recommendations over the coming months.Such an approach strikes an appropriate balance between ensuring that agencies continue to have access to powers that are a critical part of Australias existing counterterrorism framework, on the one hand, and responding in a considered and appropriate fashion to unanimous and bipartisan recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security for more robust safeguards, on the other.The government is committed to protecting the safety and security of all Australians by ensuring that law enforcement and security agencies have the powers they need to carry out their essential work. At the same time, the government is also committed to ensuring that all coercive and intrusive powers are subject to appropriate safeguards and oversight—as befits a country committed to upholding and promoting the rule of law.Stop, search and seizure powersThe emergency stop, search and seizure powers in the Crimes Act ensure that people are able to respond consistently and effectively to a terrorist incident or threat. The powers allow police to request a persons name, address and other details; they allow police to conduct a search for a terrorism related item and to seize such an item; and they allow police to enter premises without a warrant to prevent a serious and imminent threat to a persons life, health or safety.Control ordersControl orders under division 104 of the Criminal Code allow federal courts to impose an order that places certain obligations, prohibitions and restrictions on an individual reasonably suspected of involvement in terrorism activity. The conditions must be reasonably necessary and reasonably appropriate and adapted to protect the public from a terrorist act.Preventative det ention ordersPreventative detention orders under division 105 of the Criminal Code allow a person to be detained without charge. These extraordinary powers can only be used where the AFP reasonably suspects an attack could occur within 14 days, or in the aftermath of a terrorist attack to preserve vital evidence.Collectively, these AFP powers have been used sparingly since they were enacted. As of 25 August 2022, 23 control orders have been made since September 2014, when the national terrorism threat level was raised, including only one control order against a person under 18 years of age. No preventive detention orders have been made, and no incidents have required the use of the emergency stop, search and seizure powers. Although these powers have not been used to date, this demonstrates that the AFP have been appropriately judicious in exercising these exceptional powers.Concluding remarksI acknowledge and appreciate the ongoing and valuable role of the PJCIS in reviewing intelligence and security powers. The government looks forward to providing a comprehensive response to all 19 recommendations of the AFP powers review in due course.I also value the continuing partnership with states and territories in our shared efforts to protect the Australian community. The amendments to part 5.3 of the Criminal Code have been approved by a majority of states and territories, as required by the Intergovernmental Agreement on Counter-Terrorism Laws.This bill provides for the continuation of important counterterrorism powers that ensure the safety and security of all Australians.They ensure that Australias law enforcement agencies continue to be able to manage the evolving national security and threat environment, while protecting individual rights through strong and effective oversight and safeguards.Debate adjourned.","Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (AFP Powers and Other Matters) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr DREYFUS (Isaacs—Attorney-General and Cabinet Secretary) ","(09:10):"
6,0,0,0,1,1,"King, Madeleine MP",102376,"Brand","ALP","N/A",1202," I move:That this bill be now read a second time.It is a longstanding legislative requirement that the Ranger Uranium Mine must be restored to a condition similar to the surrounding Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory. For such an environmentally, culturally and historically important region, only the highest standard of rehabilitation will do.Today, I introduce the Atomic Energy Amendment (Mine Rehabilitation and Closure) Bill 2022. This bill is the first step towards ensuring the unique environmental requirements prescribed at Ranger remain legal obligations until Rangers rehabilitation is complete.When Ranger was established 40 years ago, it was envisaged that rehabilitation would take five years and be completed by January 2026, when current regulatory arrangements lapse. However, based on the best environmental science of today, it is apparent that Rangers rehabilitation will take longer.Accordingly, the government is acting to extend Rangers regulatory framework until the job is complete. The bill enacts a number of measures for securing Rangers full rehabilitation and eventual closure.Firstly, the bill allows the mines operator, Energy Resources of Australia, ERA, to transition to a new authority that permits its rehabilitation to be continued at Ranger beyond January 2026. This in no way reflects ERAs performance at Ranger. ERA has long been progressively rehabilitating Ranger, and it is well advanced with the task—for instance, one of the mined-out pits is now fully backfilled, with Mirarr traditional owners participating in the first revegetation planting.The reason for allowing a new authority is simply that more time is needed to complete rehabilitation. ERA acknowledges this. Mirarr traditional owners acknowledge this. Environment groups acknowledge this. But the current Atomic Energy Act simply does not allow the government to extend ERAs authority.The bill will also enable progressive closing out of the site. This means that discrete parcels of land at the Ranger mine—some of which are relatively undisturbed—can transition back to underlying Aboriginal land tenure when ERA is deemed to have rehabilitated those areas. The Northern Land Council have asked that Ranger be progressively closed out so that Rangers Mirarr traditional owners can get on country as soon as it is safe to do so.Recognising that the Ranger mine was established under controversial circumstances, it is equally important parliament is clear about what this bill does not do.The bill does not permit the re-commencement of mining at Ranger. It is entirely focussed on rehabilitation and closure.The bill does not allow the standard or quality of rehabilitation that ERA must achieve at Ranger to be increased or decreased. The longstanding environmental requirements will remain in place.The bill does not reduce the longstanding liability that the Australian government has accepted for Rangers rehabilitation.The bill does not reduce or diminish the role of the Northern Land Council or the Supervising Scientist, both of which will continue to play critical roles in Rangers rehabilitation, monitoring and closure.The bill does not pose regulatory implications for the broader uranium industry. The bill concerns only the Ranger site, since it is the only mine subject to an authority under the Atomic Energy Act.Many people today who were not around in the 1970s will not remember the history of the Ranger uranium mine. To say that Ranger was opposed by the Mirarr traditional owners is an understatement. Ranger became a flashpoint in the struggle of land rights, attracting national media attention and protests.And many people today may not appreciate that Rangers history is also intrinsically linked to the Kakadu National Park which, like the uranium mine at Ranger, was established without the agreement of traditional owners.Fast forward almost half a century later to March this year; in opposition we supported the long-awaited return of the remaining half of Kakadu National Park back to the 13 clan groups. This was a milestone in the unfinished business of Aboriginal culture and history in Australia.Now, in government, we are putting forward amendments through this bill that will take the next step toward the eventual return of Ranger to its Aboriginal traditional owners. This too will form part of the story of this countrys unfinished business.In concluding, I wish to thank ERA, the Northern Land Council and the Gundjeihmi Aboriginal Corporation representing the Mirarr people for their close engagement on this bill. Rangers rehabilitation is a priority for all parties and we all look forward to seeing Ranger being a world-class example of mine rehabilitation.I commend this bill to the chamber.Debate adjourned.","Atomic Energy Amendment (Mine Rehabilitation and Closure) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms MADELEINE KING (Brand—Minister for Resources and Minister for Northern Australia) ","(09:17):"
7,0,0,0,1,1,"Jones, Stephen MP","A9B","Whitlam","ALP","N/A",1203," I move:That this bill be now read a second time.This Financial Accountability Regime Bill 2022 establishes the Financial Accountability Regime, or FAR, which replaces and extends the Banking Executive Accountability Regime following a number of recommendations from the Hayne royal commission.The bill underscores the governments commitment to finalise the action necessary to fully address the recommendations of the Hayne banking royal commission and implement measures that compel the financial services industry to act in the publics interest.Financial services executives make decisions that impact upon the lives of ordinary Australians, who have no choice other than to engage with the system that they operate. As a result, the community reasonably expects high standards of accountability and integrity of financial services directors and executives.The banking royal commission revealed too many instances of misconduct across the sector and highlighted that industry practices often did not meet community expectations. These issues were frequently found to be systemic and part of corporate cultures that can only be improved and remedied from the top down.The bill would establish the FAR, with the same design specifications proposed by legislation introduced by the former government in October 2021, which lapsed when parliament was dissolved. The requests made by the former Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and the Senate Economics Legislation Committee were considered and have been addressed in the explanatory memorandum accompanying this bill.The FAR would extend the existing responsibility and accountability framework to the insurance and superannuation sectors to ensure that heightened accountability obligations are in place across the wider financial industry.The FAR ensures that, where these community expectations are not met, appropriate consequences will follow.Id now like to turn to the provisions of the bill.The FAR imposes heightened accountability obligations for prudentially regulated financial institutions, meaning banks, insurers and superannuation entities. These institutions are referred to as accountable entities within the regime. The FAR regulates directors and the most senior and influential executives of accountable entities. These individuals are referred to as accountable persons within the regime.The FAR imposes four core sets of obligations. First, accountable entities and accountable persons must conduct their business in a proper manner, which includes acting with honesty and integrity and with due skill, care and diligence; dealing with the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) in an open, constructive and cooperative way; preventing adverse impact on the accountable entities prudential standing; and, finally, preventing breaches of certain specified financial services laws by their accountable entity.Further, accountable entities must ensure clear identification of accountabilities for accountable persons in the organisation across key areas of operation and defer at least 40 per cent of the variable remuneration of accountable persons for a minimum of four years. Variable remuneration will be reduced where accountability obligations are breached. Ensuring there are financial consequences for accountable persons who do not meet their obligations will increase their focus on the long-term outcomes of their decisions.The FAR will be supported by the imposition of notification obligations which require accountable entities to provide APRA and ASIC with certain information, such as information relating to the responsibilities of their accountable persons or breaches of certain obligations by accountable entities or their accountable persons.Both APRA and ASIC will jointly administer the regime.They will have the power to disqualify accountable persons, investigate suspected breaches of the regime and direct entities to take remedial action and to apply to the Federal Court to impose a civil penalty on accountable entities.The FAR will apply to the banking industry six months after royal assent and to the insurance and superannuation industries 18 months after royal assent.Through this bill, the government is finalising the necessary action to ensure that financial institutions are meeting the communitys expectations and shifting their focus from profit at all costs to outcomes for all Australians.Full details of the measures are contained in the explanatory memorandum.Debate adjourned.","Financial Accountability Regime Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr JONES (Whitlam—Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services) ","(09:24):"

It also delivers on the governments commitment to ensure safe and well-regulated consumer markets for credit products, such as small amount credit contracts—also known as payday loans—and consumer leases.It is disappointing that I have to introduce these measures here today. These measures all should have been implemented and introduced by the previous government.In February 2019, the former Treasurer promised to deliver his response to the banking royal commission within two years. Even with Labors full support, the coalition chose not to prioritise the measures contained within this bill that implement the response to the banking royal commission.The measures relating to small amount credit contracts date back even further—back to a 2016 report that laid out a clear path for the government to act on payday lending. For nearly six years, the Turnbull-Morrison government failed to act on this report.These failures reflect the coalitions continued unwillingness to stand with Australians against misconduct in the financial services sector. This is a coalition that voted against the banking royal commission 26 times before finally acceding to it.Nevertheless, I hope that we are able to secure the parliaments and the oppositions support to make the sensible measures that I am introducing today. Schedules 1 and 2 to the bill make minor and consequential amendments to various Commonwealth laws to support the Financial Accountability Regime and to provide transitional arrangements relating to the repeal of the Banking Executive Accountability Regime (BEAR).Schedule 3 to the bill establishes a financial services Compensation Scheme of Last Resort, the CSLR. The government has committed to introducing a CSLR and today we deliver on this commitment. This bill is part of a package of bills that establish and fund the CSLR.In 2019, the banking royal commission endorsed the three principal recommendations of the 2017 supplementary final report of the review of the financial system external dispute resolution and complaints framework, the Ramsay review, regarding the establishment of a CSLR. The Ramsay review noted the inadequacy of existing redress measures in ensuring all consumers are compensated for losses and recommended the establishment of an industry-funded and forward-looking CSLR that targets the areas of the financial sector with the greatest evidence of need.The CSLR is designed to provide compensation to consumers who have received a relevant determination in their favour by the Australian Financial Complaints Authority—hereafter AFCA—where that determination remains unpaid.Claimants may receive compensation of up to $150,000 where they have an unpaid AFCA determination in their favour for the following financial services or products: personal advice on relevant financial products to retail clients, credit intermediation, securities dealing and credit provision. The cap on claims helps maintain the ongoing financial sustainability of the scheme, at the same time as balancing the interests of consumers.The operator of the CSLR will be a subsidiary of AFCA, limited by guarantee and operates on a not-for-profit basis. The operator must act in line with the primary legislation and regulations, with compliance ensured by ASIC. The operator will be managed by a board consisting of an independent chair appointed by the minister, a person who is a member of the board of AFCA, and an actuary who has at least five years of actuarial experience.The CSLR is designed to act as a last resort mechanism. After the claimant has notified AFCA that their determination remains unpaid, AFCA will be required, where appropriate, to take steps to ensure the relevant entity pays the compensation owed. The CSLR operator will also need to confirm that no other scheme is available to pay all or part of the compensation owed, including any state or territory arrangements.Measures have been added to reduce the inclination of financial firms from relying on the CSLR and to facilitate better compliance with AFCA determinations. For example, ASIC must cancel an AFCA members Australian financial service licence and/or Australian credit licence if the CSLR provides compensation to a claimant.The government notes the recommendations made by the former Senate Economics Legislation Committee, which were tabled on 15 February 2022, on the CSLR bills introduced by the previous government, including the recommendation to include managed investment schemes in the scope of the CSLR. There have been no changes to the scope of the CSLR and the provisions being introduced today are substantively the same as those considered by that committee. The CSLR provisions have only been subject to minor and targeted amendments to reflect the passage of time and further stakeholder feedback. The scope of the CSLR reflects financial products that have a history of unpaid determinations and have been subject to significant regulatory reform which have reduced the risk of misconduct. This is an important point. The government will continue to consider potential enhancements to the regulatory framework of managed investment schemes.Schedule 4 to the bill amends the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009(hereafter the credit act) to strengthen the consumer protection framework for consumers of small amount credit contracts and consumer leases through the introduction of new obligations for providers of these credit products.SACCs are loans of up to $2,000 where the term of the contract is between 16 days and 12 months while a consumer lease is typically a contract longer for household goods longer than four months where the consumer does not have the right or obligation to purchase the goods.These measures give effect to the governments response to the 2016 review of small amount credit contract laws which identified a number of predatory lending practices that lead to some consumers experiencing financial hardship.Key reforms include strengthened caps on the amount of income a consumer can spend on repayments before they are ineligible to enter into certain credit products; caps on the cost of consumer leases; equal repayment intervals for small amount credit contracts; and prohibitions on certain types of unsolicited communications and referrals. Combined with anti-avoidance provisions, these reforms will enhance the existing consumer protections, including responsible lending obligations, while making sure that these credit products are more affordable and less harmful.The government acknowledges that most of these reforms will require some time for industry to implement, so the bulk of the proposed changes will commence six months following royal assent.The Legislative and Governance Forum for Corporations was notified of this bill, as required under the Corporations Agreement 2002 and the National Credit Law Agreement 2009.Full details of all of the measures are contained in the explanatory memorandum.Debate adjourned.","Financial Sector Reform Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[5]/subdebate.2[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr JONES (Whitlam—Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services) ","(09:31):"
9,0,0,0,1,1,"Jones, Stephen MP","A9B","Whitlam","ALP","N/A",1205," I move:That this bill be now read a second time.This bill is one of two bills which form the levy framework for the financial services Compensation Scheme of Last Resort, hereafter the CSLR.The CSLR levy framework is designed to establish an ongoing annual levy for entities that fall under a subsector in the scope of the scheme. The framework will issue levies in advance of a financial year, based on expected claims in that upcoming financial year. The first ongoing levy is expected to be issued from January 2024 for the 2024-25 financial year.The first year of operation (2023-24) will be partly funded by a one-off levy issued in the 2023-24 financial year. It will be imposed on the 10 largest financial sector entities (excluding private health insurers and superannuation trustees). This will fund the payment of compensation and associated costs relating to complaints lodged with AFCA, up to the date the bills were introduced into the House of Representatives.The ongoing levy amount in the subsequent financial years for a member of an in-scope subsector will be determined in line with the regulations. The regulations will impose levies on members consistent with the approach applied under the Australian Securities and Investments Commission industry funding model. The levy will factor in compensation amounts payable, associated Australian Financial Complaints Authority complaint-handling fees, and administrative costs of the CSLR operator and ASIC.The CSLR is designed to be financially sustainable and provide assurance to relevant financial market sectors about the maximum amount expected to be levied. The scheme applies subsector caps of $20 million and an overall scheme cap of $250 million. This limits the amount leviable within a single levy period, whilst maintaining the ability to accommodate any unexpected large-scale events or failures. The levy framework provides the minister with the ability to issue special levies to in-scope and out-of-scope firms, in response to any higher than expected outlays such as a black swan event.Full details of all of the measures are contained in the explanatory memorandum.Debate adjourned.","Financial Services Compensation Scheme of Last Resort Levy Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[6]/subdebate.2[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr JONES (Whitlam—Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services) ","(09:41):"

These estimates will then determine the total levy amount for each subsector to meet expected outlays in the upcoming financial year.Levy notices will be issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.

It will expire at the end of 2022. The effect of this measure will be to continue the operation of these provisions until the end of 31 December 2023. Any determination made under the mechanism will cease to operate after 31 December 2023.Schedule 4 to the bill makes amendments to set out tax arrangements of foreign resident workers participating in the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility, also known as the PALM scheme.The PALM scheme will help meet workforce shortages in Australia as well as support the economic development of Pacific nations and Timor-Leste.Under the new PALM scheme, eligible businesses can recruit workers to help fill unskilled, low and semi skilled workforce shortages in any sector, including the agriculture, meat processing, hospitality and tourism sectors, mostly in rural and regional areas.Schedule 4 specifies that foreign resident workers participating in the PALM scheme will pay a final withholding tax of 15 per cent for each dollar of income earned under the scheme from the 2022-23 income year. PALM scheme workers who are Australian residents for tax purposes will, of course, pay ordinary resident tax rates.This ensures that such workers pay tax at an appropriate rate on program income, consistent with similar migration programs.Schedule 5 to the bill will require the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority to take account of religious obligations when conducting the performance test on superannuation products.Trustees will now be able to apply to have their faith based products face a supplementary test that considers their faith based investment strategy if they fail the original test. A faith based product that passes this supplementary test will not be subject to the consequences of failure.Faith based products will not escape scrutiny under this amendment. Products will be assessed to ensure that their investment is in accordance with their faith based investment strategy. Faith based products that fail both the original and supplementary test will face the same consequences as any other product.This measure was a 2022 election commitment, reflecting Labors commitment to working with communities of faith.In developing this measure, I met and spoke with faith leaders around Australia.

One of those key standards goes to us trying to make the place as family friendly as possible.One of the issues that the pandemic took us to was, for the first time, starting to acknowledge that there can be quite legitimate reasons that members are not able to physically bring themselves to the chamber, and how do you make sure that youre properly representing your electorate during that time. While the various lockdown reasons that brought TV screens into the chamber have passed, and hopefully dont return, that has raised the question: can we do better when a member is, in particular, on parental leave? Can we do better when a member of parliament is formally given leave for a long period of time, and that leave is because they cant get to Canberra, but there are other ways in which they continue working during that time and the circumstances mean coming this far is not possible? Is there a way for them still being able to formally represent their electorates?In consultation with members, there has been a suggestion that often the best place to make speeches about your electorate is not, in fact, here but in the Federation Chamber and that thats where those opportunities often arise. I think its also fair to say that, while we did our best during the lockdown period to find ways for people to make speeches in here, through the screens, it doesnt work as well as ordinary debate in the chamber.So whats being proposed here is that we have a go, now, of presuming, on a permanent basis, that the screens will remain in the Federation Chamber but they will only be available to members where the House has voted that the people have leave. This is for two reasons. One is that when we vote that someone has leave its usually for parental leave purposes but sometimes its because someones really not well and they just cant travel here but they would be able to travel to their electorate office to advance a speech about their electorate. They will be able to do that in the Federation Chamber.The concept here is: if someone wants to take a period of time off—and the parliament used to only grant very limited time for people to take time off from sittings, if there was a newborn in the family. Were now being more reasonable than we used to be in making sure its now a reasonable length of time. The flipside is: during that time, if someone can make a speech about their electorate, advancing the cause of their electorate from their electorate office, using the Federation Chamber, shouldnt we allow it?This is the next step in parliament opening itself up in a family friendly way. Theres been good consultation as Ive tested this idea basically since the election both with the opposition and with the crossbench. I want to thank all members, including the Manager of Opposition Business, for their cooperation in this. It may require further tweaking; well see how it goes. Effectively, the reason weve limited it to where people formally have leave—I dont want to create a situation where someone really could have made it here but starts to use this as a proxy for not making the trip to Canberra. But, clearly, when the House has voted that someone has leave, we have all voted together—Ive never seen a division on one of those votes—saying, This is a legitimate reason. If, within that context, someone now will have an avenue for the first time, even though they are caring for a newborn, to make the trip to their electorate office and make a speech about their electorate to the parliament and get it recorded in Hansard, and their electors get properly represented in that way, I think thats a really good step forward. Its not a huge step but it means that, if someone is taking significant time off to care for a newborn, that time off will still allow them to have speeches recorded in Hansard, representing their electorate. I commend the resolution to the House.","Federation Chamber","MOTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BURKE (Watson—Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Minister for the Arts and Leader of the House) ","(09:57):"

I want to thank him for his collaborative approach on this issue. As the pandemic showed us, working from home is not necessarily an obstacle to productivity. Workplaces around our nation—indeed, around the world—have adapted to this paradigm shift, and the parliament should be prepared to, too.Remote participation via video facility in the workings of the parliament is an innovation that began under the previous parliament, under the Morrison government, as we collectively responded to restrictions imposed by COVID-19. Before the August sittings of the parliament in 2020, the then Leader of the House developed the Agreement for Members to Contribute Remotely to Parliamentary Proceedings in close consultation with the then Manager of Opposition Business, now the Leader of the House. Im pleased to see this bipartisan approach continuing in this parliament with respect to remote participation.I think this change will allow parliamentarians in the narrow and defined circumstances the Leader of the House has outlined to more effectively represent their electorates, even in circumstances where theyre unable to come to Canberra. I think the limitation to members who have formally received leave is an effective mechanism so that this targets members in an appropriate category to use this practice, to give effect to their responsibilities, to represent their electorate at a time when they may be dealing with other responsibilities such as family responsibilities or may have other reasons why they have needed to obtain leave from the parliament.The coalition supports sensible efforts to make this parliament more family friendly.

20,0,0,0,1,1,"Landry, Michelle MP",249764,"Capricornia","LNP","N/A",1211," All Australians want and expect our older Australians to be well supported and catered for in our community, including in residential aged-care homes. That is why in government the coalition called the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety: to ensure our oldest and most vulnerable Australians receive care that supports and respects their dignity and recognises the important contribution they make to society. The final report of the royal commission makes 148 recommendations following 23 public hearings over 99 days, 641 witnesses and over 10,000 public submissions. They are the product of wise and compassionate scrutiny of Australias aged-care system.In response to the royal commission, the coalition committed $19.1 billion to a five-year plan to improve aged care, with new home-care packages, respite services, training places, retention bonuses and infrastructure upgrades. The opposition remains committed to supporting the health, safety and wellbeing of older Australians and understands the important role that aged-care providers, care workers and nurses play in ensuring this support is provided in residential aged-care settings.Speaking to this bill hits very close to home for me. My father, who is 86 years old, is in the aged-care system at the moment, and I understand what the families are going through when it comes to aged care. I want to thank all the aged-care staff that are looking after him for their tireless work in making him comfortable. While Im visiting him, families of other residents and patients grab me in the hallways to share their experiences, telling me about their own dire situations. They ask me for help to find doctors for their parents or elderly loved ones. Tragically, some are telling me about their mums and dads dying in agony waiting for a visit from a doctor. In some cases they are given Panadol for pain theyre experiencing while they wait, and then they pass away.I recently met with the CEO of Benevolent Living aged care, Alison Moss, about the issues they are facing delivering aged-care services in Rockhampton. They are struggling to provide quality care due to a lack of staff. They have 22 beds available in their newly built and state-of-the-art facility, but, due to struggles with staff and shortages of doctors and nurses, these beds are unable to be filled. I have also recently been notified that Access Aged Care, a provider offering clinical services to residents in residential aged-care facilities, will soon be withdrawing its services from Rockhampton. Despite intense recruitment efforts, Access Aged Care has been unable to secure the services of GPs in Rockhampton to support its care model and, as a result, will no longer be providing services. This has the potential to impact emergency departments as residents can no longer be treated on site at their facility and will be taken to the emergency department for treatment. This will affect approximately 170 residents in the local area.A&E at Rockhampton Hospital faces constant ambulance ramping at a rate of 45 per cent, one of the worst ambulance ramping rates in Queensland. Shortages of doctors and nursing homes mean the elderly are being sent to A&E for scripts or check-ups, which could be done by a GP in a nursing home. This is clogging up the system.We were told this government was going to listen, they were going to consult and they were going to care. I heard the slogans constantly during the election. They recited over and over again Medicare, aged care, we care. Unfortunately, on multiple occasions I have sent correspondence to the Minister for Aged Care, Anika Wells, about the terrible state of aged care in Capricornia, about Access Aged Care pulling out of the PHN and to make her aware of a bipartisan aged-care forum I hope to host in Rockhampton and that she would be more than welcome to attend. To date I have not received a single response. This is shameful behaviour of the minister, and I implore her to stop playing politics with this important issue. The minister would be well served to remember that aged care is too important for politics.The Aged Care Amendment (Implementing Care Reform) Bill 2022 contains three schedules amending the Aged Care Act 1997. Schedule 1 establishes a new responsibility for providers of residential aged care to ensure that a registered nurse is on site 24 hours a day, seven days a week, by July 2023. Schedule 2 of the bill introduces a new power to enable the government to cap fees that approved home-care providers may charge care recipients and removes the home-care providers ability to charge exit amounts. Schedule 3 of the bill introduces a new requirement for the Secretary of the Department of Health and Aged Care to publish additional information in relation to aged-care providers and their costs, with the aim of allowing older Australians and their families to make more informed care decisions.The opposition urges the Labor government to continue generational reform of the aged-care system for the benefit of all Australians, and to stop playing political games with older Australians and their families. Our nurses have worked tirelessly on the front line through the COVID-19 pandemic, protecting lives and keeping Australians safe. We especially recognise the amazing support that nurses provide our older Australians, particularly their critical work in aged-care homes since the outbreak of the pandemic. We know these were not easy times, yet our nurses stood up when it mattered most to protect so many older Australians, and we are grateful for their work.The opposition have grave concerns regarding the extreme use of unreleased subordinate legislation by the government. Instead of containing adequate complexity and information, this bill does not actually outline the necessary details on how it will impact aged-care providers in practice. The opposition considers this bill more of a legislative framework than detailed legislation. The lack of detail within the legislation and the lack of ability for parliamentary scrutiny of its subordinate legislation are serious concerns for the parliament and for the aged-care sector. These concerns were echoed by many stakeholders and witnesses who appeared at the Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into the bill. The government must listen to the concerns raised by the witnesses at the inquiry and the stakeholders who will affected by this legislation.Schedule 1 of this bill allows the government to implement the employment of registered nurses in residential aged-care facilities on a 24-hour basis by July 2023; however, this time line is not consistent with the royal commissions final report, which recommended making it mandatory to have a registered nurse on site 24 hours a day from July 2024, with an accompanying minimum care minutes requirement. The opposition notes the unique challenges faced by aged-care providers in rural and regional Australia, particularly regarding access to the registered nurse workforce. The royal commission considered a range of factors when recommending that time line, recognising the current workforce shortages and the time required to train or access the necessary additional workforce.Given the government have brought the start date of this recommendation forward by a year, they must specifically outline what support will be provided to regional and rural providers and other providers already struggling with viability and workforce challenges. The government must outline how they plan to get the additional nurses into aged-care homes in regional and rural aged-care facilities, following their jobs summit. The opposition supports the royal commissions recommendation on 24/7 RNs in aged-care facilities where it is possible by 2024 and in line with the royal commission recommendation.The opposition also calls on the government to provide oversight of the delegated legislation that puts in place the mechanism and details of possible exemptions. The government has not been transparent with any of the details of this exemption clause. This lack of transparency creates uncertainty for providers, who are already under stress from the COVID-19 pandemic. This information is particularly critical for rural and regional providers, who are likely to be subject to significant difficulties in finding the additional workforce to meet the requirement within the time frame set by this bill.Ill now speak to schedule 2. The former Minister for Health and Aged Care, Greg Hunt, and the former Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care Services, Senator Colbeck, required, for the first time, that information be published relating to the median prices charged for home-care services, increasing the transparency on home-care prices. This bill now enables the government to cap charges that approved home-care providers can charge care recipients and removes home-care providers ability to charge exit amounts. The opposition supports these reforms, as they are sensible amendments broadly supported by the sector. We remain committed to ensuring downward pressure on home-care prices and older Australians being able to make informed decisions about aged-care services.Speaking on schedule 3, the opposition agrees that we need more transparency in the aged-care sector to ensure older Australians and their families are able to make informed care decisions. That is why in government we introduced substantial reforms to increase transparency, including from 1 July 2019 requiring all home-care providers to publish their pricing information in a standardised schedule published on the My Aged Care website, providing greater visibility of median prices, and investing in the My Aged Care website to ensure that older Australians and their families are able to easily access and compare information about aged-care providers. The publication of additional information to increase sector transparency and to increase consumer understanding of this sector is supported by the opposition. I believe that more information assists in making more-informed choices.The coalition has a proud and constructive history of delivering for the aged-care sector. The coalitions 2022-23 budget delivered funding for aged-care reform of $522 million, which built on the funding contained in the previous budget. This brought our total investment in response to the final report of the royal commission to more than $19.1 billion. Our 2022-23 budget responded to 10 recommendations of the royal commission and built on our existing five pillars of aged-care reform. We delivered record investment across the aged-care system over the forward estimates—from $13.3 billion in 2012-13 under Labor to $30.1 billion in 2022-23 under the coalition. By 2025-26, funding in aged care was estimated to grow to $34.7 billion per year under the coalition.We also remain committed to providing our older Australians support to live in their own homes for longer. That is why we increased new home-care packages from 60,308 under Labor in 2012-13 to 275,597 in 2024-25, an increase of 357 per cent. We are currently in the second year of the five-year plan and it is imperative that the government now continue our work to support the aged-care sector. I also implore the Labor government again not to play politics with aged care. People like my father and the families I meet deserve better.","Aged Care Amendment (Implementing Care Reform) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms LANDRY (Capricornia) ","(10:10):"
21,0,0,0,1,1,"Khalil, Peter MP",101351,"Wills","ALP","N/A",1213," Like others in this place, Ive reflected a number of times on the importance of respecting Australians in their senior years. Its not just about good manners, although thats a big part of it; its about recognition of their hard work and the contribution that they have made to their communities, to broader society and to their country. Older Australians really deserve dignity as they age and they deserve a government that will actually look out for them. Our value as a society is found in how we actually treat each other, but there is little pride to be found in the treatment of people in aged care and the hardworking staff as well in that industry.Neglect is probably the best single word that can be used to describe how they have been treated, or not treated. That is a simple yet poignant way this issue has been described by others. That is why the Albanese government have committed to putting the care back into aged care. We want to rewrite that, reverse that neglect and actually care. Its what we promised at the last election and it is what we are delivering with the Aged Care Amendment (Implementing Care Reform) Bill 2022, which will implement three of our urgent reforms to aged care.It will require approved providers of residential aged care to have a registered nurse on duty 24 hours a day seven days a week from 1 July 2023. This will extend to specified kinds of flexible care. This is something we will work closely with state and territory governments to implement. For aged-care residents and their families in my electorate of Wills, in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, this is incredibly important. It will mean fewer unnecessary trips to the hospital simply because a nurse is unavailable. That will take pressure off our health system. These trips, usually at all hours of the night, cause a great deal of stress to residents and their families, and add to the already significant workload of the people who care for them.Fewer unnecessary trips to the hospital will also reduce exposure to illnesses—a risk of which we have been acutely aware, of course, during the pandemic. We are also particularly conscious of this in my electorate of Wills, where significant outbreaks have occurred across aged-care homes. For the families whose relatives contracted COVID-19 in aged care, I know how important this reform is. Its critical. Ive spoken to dozens of them—family members and people in aged care—including those who lost loved ones, tragically. They have all told me about the greater investment in care hours required to improve the living conditions in these aged-care facilities. It was a constant theme, a constant refrain.Affordability is another challenge that the Albanese Labor government is committed to addressing. This bill will cap the amount recipients can be charged for the administration and management of home-care packages and remove exit amounts entirely. More than 210,000 Australians currently receive home-care packages, and I know, from the dozens of stories that have been shared with my electorate office, just how much cost remains—an ongoing stress for recipients and their carers. By capping these fees, we will make it more affordable for people receiving home-care packages and we will make it clearer, providing a better picture of expected costs—which can be exceptionally difficult to fully grasp when navigating what is a very complicated system.So improving transparency in the sector is a priority for the Albanese Labor government. Australians across the country have been rightly shocked about the secrecy of and scandals arising in this sector. It has been shocking—shocking to ordinary Australians, to people who have family members in aged-care facilities. There have been all the front-page reports of the lavish lifestyles of aged-care home executives and the owners of those facilities—just shocking! I think its been a direct hit to that sense of fairness that Australians hold so dear. All this was happening while residents were slapped with increasing fees and aged-care workers remained some of the lowest-paid workers in our economy.So the final part of this bill will give Australians a greater picture of the operations of aged-care providers, including where they are directing their money. It will shine a light and give transparency. Its very important. It will require the secretary of the department of health to publicly provide information about the expenditure of aged-care providers. This will include information on the expenditure directed towards staffing and care hours, food and nutrition, cleaning, administration and maintenance, as well as the profit and loss—the bottom line. This information will be made easily available to the Australian public, to those family members, providing them with the information they need to make decisions about the care for themselves or for their family members.Now, this is what real action looks like, from a government that is actually committed to respecting older Australians and to putting their care back into aged care. Its not rhetoric. Its not grandstanding. Its not talking about it. Its actually doing something about it.As a government, we will also continue to seek further reforms, including working with the sector to implement mandatory nutrition standards, to ensure that all people in care receive high-quality, nutritious food. We will mandate an average of 215 minutes of care per day, as recommended by the royal commission into the sector. Just like providing more nursing hours, this will reduce the workload of staff and provide more time for the provision of basic standards of care—which, frankly, we should all expect as a baseline, a minimum.Now, I know how important this is for the hardworking staff who care for our older Australians. Its a tough job—probably one of the toughest jobs out there. The care, the commitment that they make, is really incredible. It is really giving of yourself; its highly stressful but its also very, very difficult work, and it requires a lot of skill and a lot of compassion. A lot of hard work goes into caring for our older Australians. It has to be acknowledged how difficult that job is.And its often a thankless job. Thats something that were trying to redress here by acknowledging the hard work of age-care sector workers. We know how insufficient their pay is for the level of work they do, for that type of commitment. Thats why its so important that we address these issues and put the care back into aged care—acknowledge and reward, through their better pay, the aged-care workers who do that thankless job to look after older Australians. We can make a real difference to the lives of older Australians and give them the dignity that they deserve, given the commitment and contribution that they have made to this nation over their working lives.","Aged Care Amendment (Implementing Care Reform) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr KHALIL (Wills) ","(10:22):"
22,0,0,0,1,1,"Ramsey, Rowan Eric MP","HWS","Grey","LP","N/A",1214," I rise to support the amendments to the Aged Care Amendment (Implementing Care Reform) Bill 2022. Aged care, of course, is a very important issue within all of our communities. As I often say in this place, I come from one of the most rural and regional electorates in Australia. It is a great concern to me how these individual units are affected by any changes we make in this place. We are all very aware that staffing issues are a problem right across the industry, but theyre more acute in rural and regional Australia than they are in the cities.Weve had some difficulties in the recent past. Ive had a major—for us, lets say a major—sized unit of around 80 beds having some real difficulty meeting standards. Its fair to say that we absolutely need our facilities to meet those standards but, given the degree of difficulty thats evolving at the moment, sometimes I think it needs a little bit of a soft touch to make sure we dont run the risk of closing these beds. In another case, in the City of Whyalla, weve had a community owned service which operates all of the residential care spaces in Whyalla under extreme pressure and forced to close one of their three facilities.In that space, Im very pleased that the former government stepped into the breach and assisted Helping Hand to come to Whyalla and provided around $3 million worth of assistance to actually keep the facility going—to get their management systems in place and to make sure that we have a seamless change in managing and ownership in Whyalla. Helping Hand have been there for most of this year—a little more than that—and they need to make a decision in the very near future about whether they are going to go past the 12-month point and actually purchase the facility and stay in Whyalla permanently.In the lead-up to the election, I secured an electoral commitment from the coalition to advance $10 million for capital works in Whyalla. I dont make any bones about this, and Ive spoken to the health minister, Mark Butler about this: it was not matched by Labor, but it was a very welcome offer from the coalition. Ive spoken to the minister since, just saying how important it is that we secure this support, even though I understand it wasnt a Labor commitment. I believe there is a funding round coming up in November. Ive also spoken to the local state member there, Eddie Hughes, who is a Labor member, and we are as one on this issue. We just simply need to get capital investment into Whyalla to secure the long-term management of a larger organisation which has the efficiencies which actually come with being able to run that type of organisation.One of the problems we had, of course, was with Kindred Living at the facility that was closing; we just could not get enough registered nurses. In fact—it is one of those paradoxes, I suppose—the hospital, too, was struggling for registered nurses and so it set up a modus operandi, if you like, which led to the raiding of registered nurses out of Kindred Living, which only exacerbated the problem. People have asked me, Why couldnt we stop the hospital raiding that staff? But you are going to have a shortage of nurses somewhere. The problem is that we have a shortage of nurses, whether thats in the hospitals or in the aged-care sector. So we know that we have to address that as a matter of urgency.I am confident the Minister for Health and Aged Care is listening and that we will reach a position where we can secure that long ongoing service from Helping Hand. I know it would be difficult for him to sign off on some kind of grant in front of the process. I think that is right, and he is holding his ground in the right manner. But as long as the government, the Labor Party, are committed to making sure that we have long-term, classy operators in Whyalla and that we achieve some reinvestment to get rid of the shared rooms and shared bathrooms, Ill be pleased. If we know anything after COVID its that we dont want shared bathrooms in aged-care facilities. So we will move the dial forward, and I give my assurance to the people of Whyalla that I will not rest until we have nailed down that long-term commitment from Helping Hand and that we have a commitment to build new facilities and upgraded and expanded facilities at Whyalla.","Aged Care Amendment (Implementing Care Reform) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr RAMSEY (Grey—Opposition Whip) ","(10:31):"
23,0,0,0,1,1,"Chesters, Lisa MP",249710,"Bendigo","ALP","N/A",1215," It gives me great pleasure to rise to speak in favour of the legislation that is before us, the Aged Care Amendment (Implementing Care Reform) Bill 2022. These reforms to aged care are long overdue, and one of the key commitments of the Labor government is to rebuild the aged-care sector to restore dignity, quality and humanity back into aged care.The royal commission broke many hearts. It exposed the true crisis there is in aged care. But, for many of us, many of the residents living in aged care and many of the families of residents, they were stories that we had heard before. For far too long, the sector had been let fall into the crisis that it is in today. The bill before us introduces a number of key reforms that will help get the sector back on track.Just by way of example, I want to share with the House some of the conversations that my team and I have been having with people in the Bendigo electorate. So serious were the challenges in our electorate when it came to aged care that we actually ran our own survey and our own consultation work around the same time as the royal commission to share the experiences of local people. We also organised our own rally to give family members and workers an opportunity to speak out and to try and get the former governments attention about what was happening in our region.I can remember being at the rally and inviting some family members to speak up. I had to do the mental health check and say: What were talking about is quite confronting. If this is a trigger for you, please reach out. There were lots of tears. There were lots of stories being shared that triggered some really traumatic memories for many of the people that were there because they had lost loved ones in aged care who hadnt received the appropriate support that was needed because the sector is in crisis.One example of that was Bernadette, who was a primary carer for a friend. Her friend Leonie was in aged care. She contacted us to say that there wasnt enough qualified staff. Leonie had reported that staff did not know what medication she had to take and they were often trying to give her the wrong medication. She said she was unable to walk and reliant upon stuff for toileting but felt really embarrassed and was concerned about pressing the call button for them because she knew how overworked they were. The food was inadequate. Recently Leonie had just been given a party pie and a sausage roll. Her GP recommended that multivitamins be provided to Leonie to compensate for the poor quality of food. This is Leonies experience. Leonie is one of the people in my electorate that really welcomed Labors commitment and the reforms that are before us. The 24/7 registered nurse, for example, would ensure that Leonie wouldnt be in that situation going forward; she would actually have a nurse on site to help ensure that she was receiving the right medication and not trying to be given the wrong medication.Another example: Kylie contacted my office. She is a nurse in residential aged care, and she said that she was heartbroken to be leaving the sector but that shes burnt out. She worked extremely hard. She worked overtime every week and weekends, double shifts when they asked, because she didnt want to leave the residence in the situation that Leonie is in. Years of doing this had taken its toll, and she was burnt out. When asked if she supports the reform for a 24/7 registered nurse to be a requirement, she said yes because it would mean that her employer would have to have a replacement nurse for when someone called in sick. Quite often that isnt the case; it is left up to the facility, and, if they cant get somebody, they are left short staffed.We acknowledge that theres a lot of training we need to do and a lot of work we need to do to encourage nurses back into the sector, but, if we are able to improve and support registered nurses, like Kylie, then Kylie may come back; she may come back into the sector. Theyre the kinds of people we need to encourage back in.I also wanted to share the example of Robert. Robert is a 97-year-old World War II veteran, one of the last remaining World War II veterans that we have in our country. Hes living in Bendigo and he does not miss an Anzac Day. Hes in the home-care support system. He fears going into aged care because of the examples that Ive shared and that others have shared. So he still lives at home with his 90-year-old wife. Theyve been together for a while. Shes now in a wheelchair on a level 4 package. Robert is on a level 3 package. My Aged Care home care is the only support they receive—theres no family—but its complex to navigate.They have a private provider who helps to manage their package, very limited in detail. Robert thought he had been doing the right thing by saving funds for OT work and assisted equipment needed for his wife, but it wasnt right to be doing it that way. He was unaware that his funds could be used to help his wife, which, in turn, then denied him being eligible for a level 4 package and therefore more support for himself. Because he wasnt quite aware of the complexity of managing the case and because he had a private administrator based in Melbourne, he couldnt get the information that he needed. He was going without the extra support to help his wife toilet. Here he is, a 97-year-old World War II veteran, living at home, trying to live longer and live better at home, supporting his wife to toilet because he wasnt aware of how his package worked properly. He ended up coming to my office, asking if we could move him from a level 3 to a level 4 package. We contacted My Aged Care to find out that he couldnt move to a level 4 because he hadnt spent all of the level 3. We had to unpack the miscommunication.Also, so much of their packages had been lost in administration fee, and that speaks to one of the other reforms before the parliament today: capping home-care charges. This bill reflects our commitment to cap the amount that can be charged by administration and management for people receiving home-care packages, and it removes exit amounts altogether. That has definitely been the experience of Robert, and thats part of the problem we have with this sector. Private managers, private providers and private organisations are also not very good at sharing with their clients or customers how best to use their packages. So a year and a half down the track, this very kind, very gentle and very strong World War II veteran is calling my office to find out what can be done to support his wife. It shouldnt be this hard. A veteran should not have to come to their MPs office to get support to help toilet his wife. That is why the capping of home-care charges is important. It will encourage more not-for-profits to be in the sector and it will probably see the exiting of many that are in the sector to make a profit and not to deliver a service. These proposed changes provide pricing transparency for people like Robert and for providers, and creates greater clarity about direction and direct and indirect costs. All of these changes are necessary.Robert isnt the only one who has raised home-care changes with me. Theres a group in Castlemaine, and this is one of the key issues that they spoke to me about in the lead-up to the election: the frustration that theyre looking at, with their money dwindling and not actually going on support for them but going in administration fees. Then theres the cost of exiting, so they feel trapped with a dodgy provider and they cant move to the next without paying an exit fee. So they welcome these changes that are before us today.The other key change that is really being welcomed by people in my electorate is transparency of information. In this bill we are committing to improving integrity and accountability in aged care, providing greater transparency about what aged-care providers are spending money on. That goes to the food example that I used in the case of Leonie. Part of the frustration that Leonie and her friends spoke to my office about was that it is expensive for a lot of our older residents to be living in aged care. Theyve had to sell their homes or the money has gone into a bond. They are paying a lot to be in these facilities and yet all they get served is a sausage roll and a party pie. Its not good enough, when they feel theyre paying a lot from their income. Having transparency of information will hold the sector accountable and will keep it honest. It allows residents and family members to know exactly where the money is spent. It also allows our parliament and our government to really understand where the money is going in aged care. If all the money is being spent on staff and we need more, then we can look at that. But if the money is going into mega profits for non-for-profits or for individuals then we need to know that.These things are why these changes that are before us are so necessary. The legislation that we have is a part; together with the other legislation that was moved through in the first sitting fortnight, this is our demonstration as a government that were getting on with the reform that the sector requires. We do not want to be here in three to four years time and still have family members coming into our electorate offices crying because their loved one has passed away in pain or was in a position where they didnt get the help that they needed. We want everybody to live their best life and, when they exit this life, to go with peace and dignity and in humanity. We want to see that return to our age-care sector.In the few moments I have left, I do want to thank everybody who continues to work in aged care—who has just hung on. The last few years have been really tough: the short-staffing and the pressure on the sector. But its been particularly tough in states like my state of Victoria, where weve had the longer lockdowns and longer exclusions not allowing family members and friends in because of the risk of COVID in aged care. It was done for health reasons—aged care is quite susceptible to COVID, and weve lost a lot of older Australians to COVID—and a lot of the residents understand that, but it has taken its toll, not just on the residents but also on the staff. They are burnt out. To those whove hung on and are still there: all I can say is that it will get better. These reforms that Labor is moving on in government will improve the aged-care sector. We are committed to seeing wages lifted for these aged-care workers, these angels who have hung on to make sure that residents have the support they need. I say to them: we understand things have happened that have broken your hearts, but thank you for sticking it out, because it will get better.These reforms are a step in the right direction, but we acknowledge theres a lot more to do. I look forward to being able to go back out to these facilities when they do have a 24/7 nurse on and there is a replacement if that person is not able to be there. I look forward to activities officers being genuine activities officers and not having to drop activities to double up as a PSA because someone has called in sick.The transparency—making sure we know where the money goes, whether its taxpayers money or whether its individuals money—is critical.Finally, on home-care packages: theres a lot of work we need to do to clean up this sector, and the capping of home-care charges is just the beginning.Older people deserve our respect and support, and Im proud to be part of a government that is moving on implementing many of the recommendations of the royal commission.","Aged Care Amendment (Implementing Care Reform) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms CHESTERS (Bendigo) ","(10:36):"
24,0,0,0,1,1,"Stevens, James MP",176304,"Sturt","LP","N/A",1217," It has been very interesting to listen to the contributions from other members on this because there are obviously some clear commonalities that we, as members of parliament, experience in our interactions with the aged-care sector in dealing directly with constituents. I can tell from the previous contributions that we all have very similar issues that are brought to us as local members of parliament. Theyre not all bad experiences, by the way. Naturally, a disproportionate number of people who reach out to their MP do so because theyve got an issue that they need support in overcoming—I accept that—but I want to make a few comments about the inherently fantastic people who work in our aged-care system and the fantastic work that they do, and Ill do that in a moment.The second thing to say, following on from that, is that I dont think any of us as human beings, not just members of parliament—I dont think thered be any Australian—has not had a direct personal experience or interaction with the aged-care system in this country either at the moment or in the past. Of course, all of us will in the future. My last surviving grandparent is now in a residential aged-care facility, two of my three deceased grandparents came to the end of their lives in aged-care facilities, and many other members of my family have need of, or will in the future have need of, the aged-care system, hopefully for a brief period and not for a very long time. Its very important to all of us that we have an excellent aged-care system that provides the highest standard of care and support in the most flexible way to people needing that care in the last moments of their life.My grandmother not only spent the last period of her life in an aged-care facility but spent most of her career working in the aged-care sector. She was an aged-care nurse for many decades. She had become a nurse during the Second World War and served in the Army, as a nurse at the Heidelberg hospital in Melbourne, nursing returned soldiers. Many of them were POWs whod had traumatic experiences and had challenges insofar as the care they needed. Then she came back home to Adelaide and worked at the repatriation hospital for a reasonable amount of time doing similar work caring for veterans, and then became an aged-care nurse for the remainder of her career as a nurse. She was someone who absolutely loved that work. She loved caring for vulnerable people. At times it was very difficult because the sorts of care, with the circumstances people are in, are very challenging and emotionally draining. But she absolutely loved it and found doing that work so fulfilling. I think she is the same as almost everyone that works in the aged-care sector.We all, as members of parliament, have the opportunity, Im sure, if youre anything like me, to regularly visit our facilities and talk to management and staff as well as the residents about what their issues are and the challenges theyve got. My observation is that, inherently, the people working in the sector—whilst we need to do better in the support theyve got—very much get an enormous amount of fulfilment from doing the work they do. They are great heroes in our society, and Id like to pay tribute to everyone that works in the aged-care sector. We are very lucky to have your dedication.The royal commission brought to light some, in some cases, quite shocking examples of unacceptable circumstances in our aged-care sector. Ive got no dispute with any commentary of the royal commission around that. But I think weve got to remember that, whilst there are some bad circumstances, there will always unfortunately be bad operators with bad faith. My personal experience, and I think its the case across the sector, is that most operators are inherently doing excellent work with the resources theyve got. The aged-care facilities I visit in my electorate are doing fantastic things, and the aged-care facilities Ive experienced when members of my family have been cared for by them are doing fantastic things. There are people that need to lift their game but it is important that we dont let the zeitgeist become some sort of sense that weve got an aged-care sector—particularly a residential aged-care sector—that is on the whole providing very low-quality, poor care; thats not the case, certainly in my experience. I want to be a constructive participant in this place in doing more wherever weve got the opportunity to improve things.The reality is that the demand on aged-care services will only grow exponentially into the future. A large part of that is for inherently good reasons. People are living longer. Modern medicine is changing our life expectancy and is allowing people to have longer lives and a lot more options around treatment for things that would have ended their lives much sooner. My own grandfathers circumstance, which is very common—he is very lucky to be alive at almost 93 years old—is of significant mental deterioration through having dementia. He is physically fit as a fiddle, which is great, but he is in a circumstance where, because of his dementia, he needs very significant care in a residential circumstance. Prior to him going into that circumstance, he had, I have to say, really good community care support. My grandma was in the same situation before she passed away. They had good support and access to community care packages that allowed them to stay at home for much longer than they otherwise would have been able to.Thats another thing thats really important as we look at addressing aged-care reform and how the system will change into the future—that we make sure we are helping people to stay in their homes for as long as they can, provided they want to and its safe to do so. Thats a difficult circumstance to confront for any family. In my familys case, my grandparents had to go into residential aged care. Of course they didnt want to, and we did the best we could as a family to support them to stay out of residential care for as long as it was safe to do so. But it will always get to a point where thats not tenable.It is important that we have a good, flexible system that can, for as long as possible, have people in a circumstance where they are able to stay in a home-care situation where supports can be funded, as we do through community aged-care packages. Theyve changed a lot over the years, but the principle of helping people to age in place, in their home, is one thats very important for them. And of course it is important that we make sure that, particularly if they want to, we can keep them out of the residential system for longer, in a safe way. It takes the burden off the explosive growth we would have in residential care if we werent doing as much as we could to further support people in that circumstance to stay in home care.This bill, the Aged Care Amendment (Implementing Care Reform) Bill 2022, has been well commented on through a very long list of speeches and contributions in the second reading debate, and I do note, in particular, my colleagues who have talked about being in other electorates. Im in a metropolitan electorate and I understand the issues that are acute in the sector in my electorate. But it has been quite valuable to hear contributions from members whose constituents, particularly on the residential aged-care side of things, have very different circumstances and challenges because of those circumstances. Smaller communities have much smaller facilities that are more commonly community developed and run, and they have very difficult challenges around viability. I dont have that challenge in my electorate, but I have to say that I recognise and back to the hilt people who represent electorates where they do have those facilities and how vital it is that we support those facilities to stay operating and open.It is very traumatic for people to go into residential aged care. Some have lived their entire lives in a particular community, compounding the trauma which happens at times when people are taken from their home into a residential facility because its not tenable for them to stay in their home anymore. To then also remove them from their community—adding that additional burden of having many people that are part of their family and their social circle at a long distance from them and, therefore, clearly not able to provide that nourishment they need of regular visitations et cetera—would be a very distressing and disappointing outcome.So I commend the comments of the many members who have talked about some of the challenges that are associated with mandating certain requirements on operators which will be near impossible for some existing operating residential facilities to meet. I hope the government is very much attuned to and concerned by this, and that they make sure they think through how they structure exemptions for facilities that could have their viability dramatically impacted if were not careful. I think that point has been made comprehensively by a lot of my colleagues, and I add my weight to those comments to make sure that it is really reinforced to the minister and the government. I hope that in good faith they are able to structure exemptions that ensure those facilities can be viable.Ive talked about community care, and, in concluding, I make the point that I want to see the community care side of this sector very much focused on, and being about people accessing care and support and not about becoming some huge profit-centre industry. The aged-care sector is not there to make people extremely wealthy; its there to support that greatest generation of people who have served our nation and built this nation, and who need us, as a government and as a society, to give them the highest standard of support and care.When it comes to community care, a lot of my constituents experiences have been very disappointing. I wont go into the specifics of those details publicly in this debate, but I think that every member of parliament would have similar experiences of certain providers of community care clearly making a lot of money rather than necessarily delivering an excellent outcome for the people that the system is there to support. I am certainly a happy participant and supporter in this place wherever I get the opportunity to support further change if its necessary to make sure thats the outcome were getting around community-care provision.With that, Id like to reiterate my thanks to everyone in this sector. Its been a very difficult few years with the compounding challenges of COVID and the workforce in aged care. We know that what they have had to struggle through, in some states in particular, was extremely taxing, brutal and draining, so thank you very much to the people that work in the sector. I hope that we as a parliament will continue to deliver change for you that improves the quality of care to people that need it and also ensures that the great heroes of the workforce of our aged-care system are properly valued for the work they do. I thank the House for the opportunity to contribute on the second reading.","Aged Care Amendment (Implementing Care Reform) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr STEVENS (Sturt) ","(10:51):"
25,0,0,0,1,1,"Steggall, Zali MP",175696,"Warringah","IND","N/A",1219," I rise to speak on the introduction of the Aged Care Amendment (Implementing Care Reform) Bill 2022. This is a bill I welcome following the dire revelations of the royal commission in aged care. I would like first to thank the many who work incredibly hard in this sector. They do their job well, and the revelations of the royal commission would have been incredibly distressing for those in the sector who are endeavouring to give the best of care to loved ones and to our older Australians as they go into residential care.Its vitally important that this parliament work to improve the standards of our aged-care system. The recommendations of the royal commission were clear—that much-needed improvements to the way we care for our older loved ones must be implemented as a matter of urgency—so I urge the minister to accelerate implementing all the recommendations of the royal commission.Locally in Warringah, some 15 per cent of residents are now over the age of 65. As Australias population continues to age, the systems we currently have in place will need to be ready to cope with increasing demand. We must approach the issue with an unwavering compassion and acknowledgement that there are some systemic flaws in the past that werent acceptable and that need to be changed. Under-resourcing and lack of preparedness have rendered many aged-care facilities ill-equipped to adequately care for their patients and residents, and I think that was made all the harder during COVID, obviously, where additional requirements were imposed upon aged-care centres. We have to remember they are not hospitals; they dont have the level of care that is available in emergency departments, so the balance between the resourcing and where the best care can be provided always needs to be front of mind.I have spoken with many local residents, nurses and aged-care workers, and they all believe strongly that having registered nurses on duty will absolutely improve the quality of care and reduce the burden on the health system generally. Registered nurses have the skills and training to treat many more incidents and prevent them from happening in the first place. This will reduce the number of residents being taken to hospital, with care able to be provided at the facility, reducing strain on our stretched ambulance and hospital services. The implementing care bill clearly seeks to improve the system, and I urge the government to ensure these measures succeed.Costings of the bill are not insignificant. We know this is an issue. An accumulated $460 million over the forward estimates is substantial; however, its an investment absolutely worth applying to appease this shocking crisis. As many have highlighted in this debate so far, it may still not be enough to truly cover the implementation of the measure.The three schedules in the bill will improve safety and access to care rights as outlined in the Australian Charter of Healthcare Rights. The implementation of a mandated posting of a registered nurse 24/7 in aged-care facilities is a welcome improvement. Its an improvement I strongly advocated during the last parliament, and I spoke in support of the member for Indis motion in 2021.I have done some extensive consultation with stakeholders and residents in Warringah. I seek assurance on their behalf that any exemption criteria for schedule 1 will be reasonable and that it will be consistent with the royal commissions recommendations. I echo the concerns of the member for Mayo and in the coalitions second reading amendments about the lack of detail in the primary legislation and the extensive use of delegated legislation. Its critical that the exemption criteria be made known so that we can be assured that reasonable provisions will be in place to protect providers who are unable to obtain a registered nurse. In that sense, I have listened to the contributions of other members of this place in relation to the difficulties in regional and more remote areas. Nevertheless, we also need to ensure that this exemption process is not used by providers to avoid providing better care and having registered nurses.The department estimates that there is a shortfall of some 850 nurses at present to meet the needs of this bill. We cannot penalise the ratings of these centres for not obtaining staff if they simply doesnt exist. We need to ensure there are exemptions where reasonable steps have been taken to recruit staff but have been prevented by lack of availability amidst the skills shortage crisis. Gaps in individual shifts due to sudden illness or injury of staff and difficulties for employers in abruptly sourcing casual staff should also qualify for a reasonable exemption. The onus should be on the federal government to appease the skills shortage that we are facing and help ensure these exemptions are minimised.The bill also seeks to cap home-care costs specifically pertaining to service providers no longer charging for cessation of care. I support this in principle as we need to target and prevent unreasonable outlier prices in home care. Some stakeholders in my electorate hold concerns that this schedule will grant the government an unlimited power to regulate all home-care prices. So I call on the government to always be transparent and consultative if they are to implement discretionary regulatory powers.There are still some issues relating to the crossover between aged care and NDIS. That does not pertain to this bill, but an issue that I would urge the government to address is the gap and the age discrimination that exists in the NDIS system as people then transfer to the aged-care system.The third schedule seeks to mandate public disclosure pertaining to aged-care services. I support this in principle because we need transparency. But I find it to be broadly written. A general power to disclose information without parliamentary scrutiny could be problematic. So I trust the government will consider reasonable privacy with regard to important information if its published.When the royal commissions report was released last year, Australians were collectively horrified to learn of the extent of the real human tragedy in a deeply fractured system. The malpractice and underresourcing were a clear violation of the right to access adequate health care. Im pleased to see this bill introduced so early on the governments parliamentary agenda. The bill will aim to rectify the three serious gaps in the aged-care industry that were outlined by the royal commission. These are important to fix, but we must remember the commission produced 140 recommendations to fix the system. So we must ensure progress is continual. There is significant pressure to reform the sector ahead of the impending jump in demand. To remain ill prepared for this would be catastrophic. We cant allow this sector to underdeliver quality care.In consultation with the aged-care workers in my community in Warringah, further fractures have been identified. One aged-care worker I met with identified that there is a significant gap between some aged-care participants receiving access to great support and others who are not. One aged-care worker has alerted me to instances whereby she witnessed dangerously poor hygiene in facilities and in homes and long wait times for support and assistance, even if an emergency button had been pressed. Alarmingly, she had seen staff administering medication to control behaviour and believes that it may have been unethical and unnecessary sedation. We know these were the types of issues that were raised during the royal commission.Reporting these serious issues through the appropriate channels can prove challenging for some aged-care workers. I note that these complaints are not always acknowledged. So we need to ensure enough streamlined reporting systems are in place so that quality care can be monitored and applied consistently across Australia.In my community, there are also concerns that some providers have too many people on their books and so they are not resourced enough to provide substantial care for all of them, with fears that a profit-over-people mentality still exists within the sector following the revelations of the royal commission. In particular the concern is for older people without family or close relations or those under public guardianship. Theyre often left behind with inadequate support. The disparity in quality of care needs to be addressed in those circumstances.It has to be acknowledged that navigating the aged-care system can be daunting for families and for older Australians. The sector can be quite complex, and many older people rely on family and friends to help guide them through the processes of application, assessment and engagement with service providers. Sadly, people who struggle to navigate the system find themselves being left behind.As we age, our circumstances can change rapidly. This heightens my concern that underinvestment in My Aged Care has seen waiting lists explode. It can take upwards of 12 months on a waiting list to access home-care packages. In that time one injury, a fall or sudden cognitive decline can see an older Australian completely without access to the level of care they need to stay in their home. I urge the government to eliminate the home-care waitlist, as per the royal commission recommendations, and reform the system to make sure it is sustainable and fit for the ageing population were dealing with.Keeping people in their own home longer should be a core goal of the aged-care sector. This is again where we do see age discrimination between the interaction of the NDIS, which finishes at 65, and aged care, which does not provide the same level of support. Again, those without family or community assistance find themselves dangerously undersupported as their needs grow. Without ease of access to adequate supports, older people may be forced into aged-care facilities. This is not of benefit to the government, the economy or the community. For those who live in residential aged-care facilities, care needs to be equitable and consistent. The best way to ensure this is to ensure that we have well-trained, well-resourced staff.There are profound opportunities to stimulate the economic benefits of a well-functioning aged-care sector. We know this is where the megatrends in employment opportunities are. We know this is where the skill shortages are. The reforms recommended by the royal commission could create around 30,000 additional full-time jobs in aged care by 2030. This excludes the additional 50,000 extra full-time workers that will be needed because of population trends. So now is the time to capitalise on the opportunities afforded by reforming this sector. Of course, we also need to make sure they are properly valued. We cannot expect people to work in these sectors, which we know are so incredibly essential to the ongoing standards we expect in our community, without them being properly remunerated and valued in our society.This bill brings forward good measures to address three key gaps that were revealed by the royal commission into aged care. Its vital the implementation of these schedules is done thoughtfully and carefully so that meaningful changes can succeed. I again wish to thank those who work so hard to provide quality care within this sector. Their contributions are vital to our older Australians in our communities. Its time we ensure that the unacceptable standards of the past are amended. I look forward to continued action from the government and the minister and to seeing this happen.","Aged Care Amendment (Implementing Care Reform) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms STEGGALL (Warringah) ","(11:06):"
26,0,0,0,1,1,"Le, Dai MP",295676,"Fowler","IND","N/A",1221," Like all Australians, I want to see care for our elderly improved where possible and considered deeply. After all, it is something that affects us all. Yesterday in the House I had the privilege of seconding the amendment moved by the member for Mayo, Rebekha Sharkie. Shes a strong advocate for regional Australia, and I trust that her amendment will ensure senior Australians receive better quality care for what they pay, and it will make it more difficult for vultures who wish to take advantage of our most vulnerable.My contention is not with the governments proposal to cap fees, making aged care more affordable for Australian families, or to improve the availability of information for senior Australians to make informed decisions. However, I do take issue with schedule 1 of the Aged Care Amendment (Implementing Care Reform) Bill 2022, which proposes to establish a responsibility for providers of residential aged care to ensure that a registered nurse is on site 24 hours a day seven days a week by July 2023.Our nurses have worked tirelessly on the front line through the COVID-19 pandemic, protecting lives and keeping Australians safe. I would especially like to recognise the incredible care given by our nurses in Fowler in supporting a particularly vulnerable elderly population. Some of the people they cared for did not speak English as a first language and others did not speak English at all, adding to the complexity and stress already being experienced during the pandemic. We will never be able to thank these nurses enough.Despite nurses having been immensely overworked during the last few years, the government proposes to have skilled nurses on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week. I do not harbour concerns over the validity of this proposal. Rather, Im worried that not enough consideration has been put into how we will support these nurses and how we will expand the number of nurses available for this demanding job. This government needs to be careful not to simply throw money at situations. Detailed planning needs to be put in place as to how new nurses will be brought into the industry, how they will be trained and how these skilled workers will be retained.Currently, the proposed staffing standards are pitched well above what can be provided by aged-care facilities. The government has stated that nearly 900 new registered nurses will be required to meet the new standards. However, the Aged and Community Care Providers Association has estimated that the sector will instead need 1,440 registered nurses to meet the new staffing requirements. The governments proposal, therefore, considers the minimum requirements and does not take into account the COVID fatigue of a large portion of our nursing workforce.My constituents, like many around the country, struggle to find and afford care, either for themselves or their parents. Recently I had a constituent write to me, outlining the struggles she had in finding a home-care nurse for her father, Anthony Best. Anthony is 90 years old and suffers from macular degeneration. He was assessed for the Commonwealth Home Support Program through the My Aged Care framework; however, he received no further assistance. His daughter Louise managed to find an at-home nurse; however, the standard of care was not what was expected. Due to shortages of quality nurses, the care provider was sometimes unable to provide a nurse at all, and at other times the level of care was not what was required. In Louises words, The system is broken. While the government proposes to increase the workload of nurses in our communities, they have failed to outline how these nurses will be supported so that stories like Anthonys can be avoided.Additionally, regional electorates have already raised concerns around staffing and the lack thereof. My community of Fowler is similar in that sense. We will see a skills shortage, as we need aged-care providers who are not only qualified but also can cater to our non-English-speaking residents. There is a cultural and language barrier that needs to be overcome. Knowledge is often disseminated by community groups, friends and family, as opposed to formal channels. This was evident during the COVID-testing challenges, in which misinformation was rife among non-English-speaking communities. Our healthcare system can and should do better for CALD communities.Our community of Fowler is a very diverse electorate with a growing population in the south-west corridor and a low expectation of the aged-care system. The widening of capacity constraints in the aged-care system is being compounded in Fowler. Many view aged care as having only one option—choosing to place their elderly family members in aged-care facilities—without understanding that there are other options to support the elderly and keep them at home as long as possible.The CALD community have strong family ties, evident through family compositions that are of multiple generations—for example, having grandparents, parents and children in the same household. They are also generally reluctant to move their elderly away from the home. Services such as shopping trips or GP visits would go a long way towards supporting these families, without the need to relocate their elderly fully. Matching these offerings would alleviate demand on full-time aged-care facilities.I also point to another of my constituents, Mr Thang from St Johns Park. Mr Thang currently lives with his wife and daughter. He came to our office recently, inquiring after nursing-home places for when he is unwell and immobile. He is worried he will not have the funds to secure a place in the nursing home that speaks his language. He says it will cost him $200,000 to move into an aged-care home and fears this could cripple his family. Therefore, I support the home-care package program, which supports older people with complex care needs at home so they can be closer to their families.Providing alternative aged-care options will alleviate pressures on aged-care homes and ensure families can stay together as a unit. But families that have tried to care for their elderly at home do not have enough access to resources or financial support available in our electorate. Fowler constituents face challenges in the understanding of certain aged-care services offered and how to access them.Beds available in aged-care facilities that cater to the CALD community are very limited, such as those that cater for cultural dietary requirements and multilingual staff. Recognition of overseas qualifications could alleviate this pressure on our aged-care facilities that will now have to provide 24/7 care.Refugees and migrants are more than just their harrowing stories of escaping war-torn countries. There are skilled professionals. There are also qualified nurses and doctors. While the government looks to bringing in a further 35,000 skilled migrants to our country to tackle the skills shortage, I ask: why not look in our own backyard first? In my electorate of Fowler we have many migrants and refugees who have skilled qualifications from their homelands. Unfortunately, many do not have the paperwork or evidence to back up their qualifications. Speaking from experience, when you are fleeing persecution, violence or war you are not thinking about the university degree paperwork or your qualification documents; you are thinking about how to save your life and the lives of your loved ones.According to the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, current recognition of the prior-learning process is complex and lengthy, which can be difficult for someone who has no knowledge of how our government works. They recommend a new skills assessment system, for people without evidence of qualifications, against an established benchmark, which should be combined with tailored courses and employment placements to identify their gaps in knowledge.We are wasting the potential of a huge group of people who are ready and willing to work. I commend upskilling our community, and offering more government funded courses at TAFE would be a good alternative to just university courses. I point to countries like Canada, which fast-tracked visas for refugee nurses in the pandemic. They hope to expand their Foreign Credential Recognition Program, with the aim of employing an extra 11,000 overseas-trained healthcare workers a year.Furthermore, those who are seeking asylum can wait up to five years for their applications to be processed. During this time they are kept on punitive bridging visas, which leave them in purgatory, unable to work or study. I appreciate that the Labor government has committed to reducing this delay in visa processing; however, more action is needed to tackle the crisis at our doorstep. Over 100,000 people are currently seeking asylum. While they wait for their visas to be processed, many cannot access social services, do not have the right to work or do not have the right to study. There is no access to higher education, and all are excluded from subsidised funding for apprenticeships, training and certifications. If we are to look at reforming TAFE as part of Jobs and Skills Australia, we must also acknowledge that shorter and more practical technical courses could open opportunities to a wider cohort of staff and accelerate the supply to industry.Age pensioners who are alone and take care of themselves are reluctant to seek medical treatment, due to financial constraints. The recent increase in GPs not bulk-billing is accelerating this, which leads to their health deteriorating and adds to the demands on aged-care services. With cost-of-living pressures, we cannot expect our elderly and vulnerable to break the budget just to get simple healthcare services.We have also received many phone calls from age pensioners who have had concerns regarding having to pay out of pocket to see their local GPs. While I commend the government for acting on aged care and continuing the reform by the previous government, this cannot become a tokenistic gesture to stop the cries for help from senior Australians, nurses and the families that just want affordable and quality care for their loved ones.For too long in this House, grand spectacles have been the way of government after government to ease the pressure on them from the Australian people. Now is the time to act. Now is the time to create long-lasting and meaningful change in a sector that has been neglected and forgotten for far too long. I will continue to hold the government to account beyond the implementation of this bill, and I will continue to fight for senior Australians and the frontline workers who wake up every day and put on their scrubs to look after our most vulnerable.When I came to Australia I was told of the Australian dream. I was told you could achieve the dream to own a home and raise a family if you contributed to your country and worked hard. Part of that dream is that when you get older you will be cared for. I will not let Australians who have spent the entirety of their lives working to be robbed of that dream.","Aged Care Amendment (Implementing Care Reform) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms LE (Fowler) ","(11:18):"
27,0,0,0,1,1,"Wells, Anika MP",264121,"Lilley","ALP","N/A",1223," The Albanese Labor government is taking a different approach to governing to the previous government. We are not afraid to tackle the big challenges facing our country and we are not afraid to do it at the earliest possible opportunity. And were not afraid to consult or to reach across the aisle and work with our parliamentary colleagues, regardless of political stripe, to face those challenges. Even if sometimes we disagree on how to do it or how fast to do it, I think its fair to say that everybody in this parliament wants to see a better future for older Australians and for the aged-care sector.I want to thank all members for their contributions to the debate on the Aged Care Amendment (Implementing Care Reform) Bill 2022, all of which have been thoughtful and many of which have been based on their or their loved ones lived experience with aged care. Id also like to acknowledge and thank everybody who has contributed either to the Senate inquiry or to the ongoing consultation around the delegated legislation. I want to reassure those who have taken the time to participate in these processes so far: we have heard you and the issues you have raised, and we are moving government amendments to this bill today as a result of your contributions to this consultation.The royal commission told us that we need to do better, and this bill is our earliest opportunity to take steps on that journey. The bill makes important practical changes to the delivery of aged-care services and it provides greater oversight of what funds are being used for. Importantly, this bill also introduces limits on amounts that can be spent on administration costs as opposed to direct care. These measures put the safety of older Australians and the quality of their care first.The bill introduces a new responsibility for approved providers of residential aged care and of specified kinds of flexible care to have a registered nurse on site and on duty at every residential facility 24 hours a day, seven days a week, from 1 July 2023. This will save thousands of unnecessary trips to hospital emergency departments and will ensure that older Australians living in residential aged care have access to the nursing care that they deserve. From 1 January 2023, the bill also introduces powers to enable the government to cap administration and management charges for older Australians receiving a home-care package and removes the ability to charge care recipients for ceasing care. This will maximise funding that is available to address care needs.There is currently little transparency in how providers set their prices for care and package management, and there is no cap on how much they can charge. The royal commission heard that some providers were charging up to 50 per cent of home-care package funding for administration and management. I know I have heard that in my electorate and I know that the member for Mayo has heard that in her electorate, and its something that we seek to address as soon as possible. This bill will provide the means to ensure that high levels of administration and management charges are reduced and that money instead goes directly to meeting care needs.Lastly, this bill will include amendments relating to the transparency of providers financial information and other valuable information about providers operations to empower older Australians to make more informed choices about their care and to shine a light on providers not doing the right thing.Id like to take a moment to acknowledge and respond to some of the feedback that we have received regarding this bill. During the Senate inquiry process, some concerns have been raised regarding regional and rural aged-care homes and the impact that the new nursing requirement will have on their ability to operate. We are aware of the issues facing these facilities, and this is exactly the reason why there will be sensible and limited exemptions available while we move to this new 24/7 nursing standard. These exemptions will be designed in consultation with these providers and other stakeholders to ensure that we get them right. It is also why, under the new AN-ACC funding model, which will start on 1 October, remote and very remote facilities are forecast to receive, on average, approximately $290 per bed per day, which is $83 more than the average funding for the current ACFI system.Some people have also raised the question of how the 24/7 nurse standard will be enforced and whether there will be consequences for those without an exemption. As with any situation where an aged-care provider fails to meet their responsibilities around care standards, the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission can undertake regulatory responses that include education, monitoring provider performance, directing a provider to take specific action and enforcement action such as sanctions. Ensuring best practice and the safety of older Australians is a priority for the Albanese Labor government.We also acknowledge comments raised during the Senate inquiry process around ensuring appropriate levels of consultation for the delegated legislation. We agree there should be consultation around the detail, and there will be. On top of hours and hours of royal commission hearings that formed the basis of its important recommendations that this bill will help address, consultation on the delegated legislation is continuing and will be undertaken to determine policy parameters and, where timing permits, on exposure drafts of the proposed delegated legislation. Specifically, the delegated legislation for the exemptions to 24/7 nurses will go through an exposure draft process. Id also note that all amendments to delegated legislation will be subjected to disallowance and therefore continue to be subject to parliamentary scrutiny.Before I finish I want to acknowledge the proposed amendment by the member for Mayo. We do not support the amendment to the bill. We are concerned that there is a real lack of certainty about what a schedule of reasonable charges would look like and the responsibility that such a schedule would place on approved providers. Ill hop into that in a moment. However, I really do appreciate the intent of the amendment.The government will not tolerate providers cost-shifting when we can cut administration and management fees. The bill already allows us to manage charges if unscrupulous providers try to get around the new caps. We will be watching this closely and we will respond and identify those providers who are doing the wrong thing.Setting reasonable fees for aged-care services is not straightforward. If we set the fees too high, providers that can deliver effectively at lower prices will get a benefit at a cost to taxpayers. If we set them too low, providers who cannot deliver for the national price—for example, a small provider delivering personal care in a rural area—might just stop offering that service altogether. The cost of providing services isnt the same across the country or for all providers, and the last thing that we want for providers in rural and remote areas already struggling is to stop offering critical personal-care services to people in the community because we have legislated a charge that does not meet the real cost of providing that service.However, I thank the member for Mayo for her engagement on the bill and for her longstanding dedication to better aged-care policy and real outcomes for older Australians in need of care. I look forward to working with her and all my colleagues to deliver better outcomes for older Australians in sessions to come. I thank all members for their contribution to the debate on this bill, and I commend the bill to the House.","Aged Care Amendment (Implementing Care Reform) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms WELLS (Lilley—Minister for Aged Care and Minister for Sport) ","(11:30):"

It aims to supplement measures provided in schedule 2 of the bill. It does not limit matters which may be provided for in the User Rights Principles under the Aged Care Act. It does, however, specify that those principles should include a reasonable schedule of charges associated with the provision to care recipients of administration and management of care, services, and equipment.The purpose of this amendment is this: as sure as night follows day, if we put a cap on administration and management fees on this side, we are going to see people who receive a home-care package no longer being charged perhaps $90 an hour or $150 an hour on the weekend. That is the usual fee that I see, and Ive surveyed more than 1,200 residents in my community and asked them to go into detail for me. Ive seen their invoices. As sure as night follows day, those fees will go up. I understand that the minister is saying, Were going to keep a watchful eye on this. Thats going to be after the damage, after people are charged $200 or $300, because providers will share and shift the cost on this. Theres no reason why a reasonable schedule of fees couldnt have a metropolitan layer and a regional, rural and remote layer. Theres no reason why you couldnt have a range of fees.I have constituents in my electorate who are being charged $700 for an occupational therapist to spend 10 minutes in their home to tell them that they need to get a shower chair or get a little hanging basket instead of putting their shampoo on the ground—Just get a little hanging basket from Kmart; thats $700—or put a rail in their wardrobe. This is extraordinary. Theyre being charged $700 for an occupational therapist to visit them and tell them that they need that, and then its $440 for a company to come out to a home to provide a quote and $1,000 to install the rail. And its all taken from the funds. Then what happens when its taken from the funds? Older people are told, Were going to have to cut back your hours this month, and when we get the next lump of money for you at the end of the month you can go back to your normal hours of care. It is outrageous that we would not fix this problem properly, right now in this parliament, and not say, Oh, the departments going to look at this in the future, or, Were going to be really keeping a watchful eye on this one.I will be talking with my constituents as soon as this is implemented, saying: Tell me, how much are your hourly rates now? What are you being charged for an hour of home care, or 20 minutes of home care, now? And how much are all those quotes for occupational therapists who come out and spend 15 minutes with you, and how much are you being charged? As I said, they are going to profit-shift from where theyre currently making obscene amounts of profit on administration and management fees, where providers are not changing month to month the actual care plan for a person but still taking 50 per cent, and move those profits over to the other side, where were not putting caps in.Minister, this is an area I have cared deeply about for six years. Its one of the few areas in this parliament in which I would say I actually have a very reasonable amount of knowledge. We are going to make older people even more vulnerable to some of the unscrupulous practices by many home-care providers. I have a regional electorate. I understand what youre saying with respect to, We dont want to make sure it is not profitable and that people move out of delivering regional services. I can tell you right now that on Kangaroo Island it is incredibly difficult. You get given a home-care package by the government—but try and find anyone willing to do it. Thats already an issue. Were going to see, in areas where theyre still willing to deliver, that theyre just going to profit-shift from one side of the equation over to the other. We in this place want to see people get more hours for their home care, and that will not happen with this legislation as it currently is.","Aged Care Amendment (Implementing Care Reform) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms SHARKIE (Mayo) ","(11:52):"

One thing that has been extremely clear to me throughout this process is that we all have a very clear shared goal—to see older Australians get the care that they deserve from the aged-care sector. There is clear support for the intent of this bill.The government is progressing amendments to the bill because of feedback received during the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry and their subsequent report. I would like to specifically thank Senator David Pocock and his office for their productive and early engagement on these changes, as well as all of the members and senators that have engaged with me and my team on this. Im open to working with anyone who wants to see improved outcomes for our aged-care sector.The amendments will clarify points in schedule 1 of the bill. They specifically relate to exemptions that may be granted to approved providers in relation to the 24/7 registered nurse requirements. The amendments provide that the secretary will be the decision-maker in respect of any exemption and that the secretary must be satisfied that the provider has taken reasonable steps to ensure that the clinical care needs of the care recipients in the facility will be met if that exemption is granted. This will ensure that the needs of the care recipients are central to any decision to grant an exemption. The amendments also provide that an exemption cannot be granted for longer than 12 months, ensuring that exemptions are regularly being reviewed. Finally, the amendments provide that the secretary must publish details in relation to any exemptions that are granted. These decisions should be public, as this will incentivise providers to meet that requirement rather than seeking an exemption. It will also increase transparency, providing older people and their families with information so that they can make more informed decisions about their care.We are committed to getting aged-care reforms right to deliver the care that older Australians deserve, and we will continue to work through the details with the sector, with unions, with older Australians and with our colleagues in this place. We continue to be very open to having discussions and working with other members of this parliament to work towards better outcomes for older Australians.

But why is it, in Australian politics, that the tough choices are always made by everyday people?

Nothing illustrates that better than Labors stage 3 tax cuts.

It certainly wont be the Prime Minister, who earns $549,250 a year—more than half a million dollars, or 13-times the minimum wage. The Prime Minister will receive an extra $9,000 a year from his governments own tax cuts. It wont be the Treasurer, who earns a measly $396,000—only nine times the minimum wage! The Treasurer, too, will receive an extra $9,000 a year from his partys own tax cuts. It certainly wont be a lowly backbencher or crossbencher like me, who earns an outrageous $217,000 a year. In fact, the last thing anyone in this place needs is an extra $9,000 a year. What we all really need is a pay cut. It absolutely wont be Alan Joyce, CEO of Qantas, making any tough choices, as he received $1.98 million last year while Qantas laid off 8½ thousand workers. The government has decided that he too needs an extra $9,000 a year. Indeed, the only tough choice any of them have to make is how to spend that extra $9,000 a year. Who knows? Maybe itll be on an extra investment property.Ill tell you what real tough choices look like. A tough choice is a teacher having to use their own money to feed kids in their school who would otherwise go without. A tough choice is a pensioner having to choose between paying the rent or buying groceries. A tough choice is a single mum working out where to park the car for the night after she and her kids were evicted from their home because they couldnt afford to pay the rent. A tough choice is working out how long you can ignore that toothache, because you cant afford to go to the dentist. A tough choice is a family having to cancel their first holiday in years, because the mortgage repayments just went up by $200 a month and they dont know how theyre going to make ends meet. A tough choice is a childcare worker wondering how much longer they can survive on low wages and long hours. A tough choice is a young man struggling to find the hundreds of dollars a week it costs to pay for the mental health support that he so desperately needs. These are the tough choices that Australians make every day, and they are tough choices imposed on them by the decisions of federal and state governments.So, when the Prime Minister talks about tough choices, lets remember that by repealing the stage 3 tax cuts we could invest $244 billion to ensure everybody in this country has what they need to live a good life. We could fund a universal free breakfast and lunch program in every school so that that teacher doesnt have to worry about which of their kids are eating today. We could raise the pension above the poverty line so that that pensioner can retire in comfort and doesnt have to decide whether they pay the rent or pay for groceries. We could build enough public housing so that that single mum can move straight into a well-designed, rent-subsidised public home. We could bring dental into Medicare so that no-one has to put off going to the dentist because they cant afford the thousand dollars its going to cost. We could improve pay and conditions so that childcare workers are able to stay in a profession that they love, knowing that their work is valued and that they can afford to buy a house of their own and put down roots. And, while were at it, we could make child care free so no parent has to make the tough choice to give up opportunities in their lives because they cant afford child care. We could bring mental health into Medicare so that that young man would be able to afford to get the support he needs straightaway, without having to stress about how hes going to pay the $200 a week it costs to get therapy.But, instead of choosing to help out that teacher, that pensioner or that single mum, Labor are choosing, with their stage 3 tax cuts, to double-down on a political and economic system that always makes the lives of everyday people tougher while handing out billions of dollars to the super-rich billionaires in big corporations.The amendment Ive moved today is about this place signalling to the government that the last thing we need is more of the same—the last thing we need is more Liberal Party election promises; the last thing we need is the status quo. Its time this government scrapped the stage 3 tax cuts and, instead, spent $244 billion funding the services everyday Australians need to live a good life. You could vote on behalf of everyone in your electorate struggling to pay for housing, groceries, health care and child care, rather than on behalf of the top one per cent. You could vote to ensure that none of us sitting here on at least $217,000 a year get an extra $9,000 a year while there are people sleeping in cars.","Treasury Laws Amendment (2022 Measures No. 2) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr CHANDLER-MATHER (Griffith) ","(12:18):"

43,0,0,0,1,1,"Bates, Stephen MP",300246,"Brisbane","AG","N/A",1231," I second the amendment. I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (2022 Measures No. 2) Bill 2022. Four months ago, I was working in a retail job in the suburbs of north Brisbane. I was making about $55,000 a year, just above the median wage in Australia. At times, I and many of my colleagues lived pay cheque to pay cheque. I have countless memories of us sitting around the break room talking about our financial stresses, such as making rent or finding a doctor that would bulk-bill, and complaining about toothaches and being unable to afford a dentist. Frequently, single parents would be forced to choose between working a shift or utilising child care. Not working a shift lost them income, but utilising child care was the more expensive option.These conversations were not unique to my former workplace. They happen in break rooms and at worksites around the country. All of us know that things shouldnt be this hard and that something is very wrong. No-one should be putting off visiting the dentist because of the cost or living in constant fear of not being able to afford rent. And yet, for millions of Australians, this is the reality. To combat these issues—rising inflation, spiralling healthcare costs, rent stress and interest rate hikes—what is the governments response to my former colleagues? The stage 3 tax cuts: a $269 tax cut for my former colleagues and a $9,000 tax cut each year for CEOs and politicians.The Labor government tells us that tough decisions will have to be made in this years budget. But when it comes to supporting tax cuts for the very, very wealthy—these are not hard decisions. The now government voted for these cuts at their introduction. They made the decision to support bad legislation then and they have doubled down on it now. When I asked a question in question time, the Treasurer could not give me a single reason why these tax cuts were good for the economy. I dont even think the government wants to keep them. They are now in a wedge of their own making.Every day I am contacted by constituents who cannot fathom the governments decision to not repeal these cuts, and I cant give them a good answer. They didnt make sense when the government voted for them, they dont make sense today and they wont make sense in 2024. We need courage. We need the government to show everyday Australians that it is really on their side. The government wants to pretend that it is powerless to stop terrible coalition policy, but it is not. It has the majority in this House, and it would have the support of the Greens both here and in the Senate to repeal these tax cuts.The government often talks about its legacy—Medicare, the PBS and so on—but this will be Labors new legacy. It will be known as a government of tax cuts to the rich at the expense of meaningfully raising income support, JobSeeker, the pension and the DSP. It will be known as a government that legislates people into poverty. It will be known as a government that looks at the cost-of-living crisis and thinks, Politicians need a tax cut.It is that simple. Our essential public services are funded by taxation. If the government wants to rip out over $200 billion of revenue, cuts to public services will have to be made. There are no two ways about it. The government has the nerve to claim these tax cuts will mean more in peoples hip pockets, but how will it reconcile this with the fact that these cuts will have to be paired with essential services becoming harder to access and more expensive? Right now, it is getting more and more difficult to find a bulk-billing GP, our healthcare system is at crisis point, higher education is becoming out of reach, and students are saddled with over $60 billion in debt. How can the government possibly plan to address this with a $200 billion plus gap in the budget?This is a natural consequence of the governments commitment to neoliberalism and the hollowing out of public services. This is the government suggesting that the very richest people in Australia will solve the cost-of-living crisis out of the goodness of their hearts, despite all of history pointing to the contrary. This did not happen during the Great Depression, and it did not happen during the global financial crisis. It is said that history repeats itself, first as tragedy and second as farce. The coalitions policies consign them to irrelevance in this parliament; why does the government want to follow in their footsteps?It seems Im expected to go back and tell my former co-workers that, despite their financial stress and despite the universal acceptance that our economic system is broken, we cant afford to fix their problems. Its a lie. We can. We have solutions ready to go. They are solutions that have precedent. They already exist in countries around the world. They can be done. Why should Australians be left behind?In the past we have been bold and courageous enough to transform our country for the better. I am here because of the communitys hope for a better future and to put a stop to politics as usual. We can get dental and mental health into Medicare. We can make child care free. We can wipe student debt. We can freeze rents for two years. Its just that the Labor government would rather give themselves a tax cut.","Treasury Laws Amendment (2022 Measures No. 2) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BATES (Brisbane) ","(12:24):"

This second reading amendment and what the Greens are talking about here is total rubbish. The reality is that the Greens do not love this country. The Greens want to change everything that is successful about Australia. The reality is that their own leader wont even stand in front of the Australian national flag. He cant do that, yet hes an elected member of this House.The reality is that the member for Griffith and the member for Brisbane probably got 35 per cent of the vote when you count in LNP preferences, because LNPs voted 1 and they put Labor next above the Greens. So those two members are here with probably 35 to 40 per cent of the vote. The way the system works delivered the seats to the Greens rather than the Labor Party, which is a real shame. It shows that our democratic process is not working when these two members can get elected with 40 per cent of the vote and when 60 per cent of people in their own seats voted for Labor before they voted for the Greens.The Greens here wont stand in front of the Australian flag. The Greens want to cut the Defence Force budget in half. As a father with a son in the Defence Force I say that is shameful. And that is before the previous coalition government committed to increasing the budget, which the Labor Party will, hopefully, support. They want to cut it in half. The Greens here want to ban private schools. They dont want a Catholic school in the country. They dont want a Lutheran school in the country. They want only state schools. Their policies are absolute rubbish. They dont deserve to be taken notice of by the Australian people.When it comes to stage 3 tax cuts the reality is that the former government and the current government supported stage 1 and stage 2 tax cuts, which gave tax cuts to the poorest people in our community. They ensured that $18,200 earned by every person, including students, is tax free. They ensured that earnings from $18,200 to $45,000 are taxed at 19c in the dollar. Stage 3 ensures that everyone earning from $45,000 to $120,000 receives a tax cut from 32.5c to 30c. The Greens talk about politicians, wealthy people and Clive Palmer, but the reality is that most people in Australia will get a tax cut under stage 3.Rather than talking the country down, start talking about whats good in this country, like the government and the opposition often do. Thats all I have to say on this issue.","Treasury Laws Amendment (2022 Measures No. 2) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr HOWARTH (Petrie) ","(12:30):"
45,0,0,0,1,1,"Stevens, James MP",176304,"Sturt","LP","N/A",1233," I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (2022 Measures No. 2) Bill 2022, and to support this excellent implementation of the former Morrison governments suite of important policies, including in particular the adjustment to the eligibility for the downsizer contribution to superannuation. I note that there is an amendment from the Greens condemning this and anything else that puts money back into the pockets of hardworking Australians. I appreciate this opportunity to prosecute their position on these things for my electorate of Sturt. It would horrify them to think that its the position of a party like the Greens to reverse and take away Australians hard-earned savings in the case of super or hard-earned money from the point of view of an appropriate regime of income tax rates that dont punish unfairly people who are damned hard workers and deserve as much of their money in their own pockets as they can have.On downsizing: dropping the eligibility age to 55 is a really significant reform. I was thrilled when this was announced during the election campaign by former Prime Minister Morrison. Im happy enough, obviously, that—as with many other things that they said—a few minutes later Labor said theyd do the same thing and me too-ed the policy. So now were here implementing it. It will be transformative for the retirement planning for so many of my constituents in the seat of Sturt and, frankly, for so many Australians nationwide.It allows people to plan with so much more certainty for their financial security in retirement. Its a very big decision to make, and a lot of people plan many years in advance as to how they are going to make sure they have provisioned enough to support themselves in what should be a very relaxing and non-financially stressful retirement. I also wish anyone going into retirement many, many years of it. Self-funded retirees are the great economic heroes of this nation. Again, as I always do on legislation relating to self-funded retirees, I want to thank them so very much for what they do to make provision for their retirement and the costs of that retirement. By doing that, they take an enormous burden off the Commonwealth government—all government, frankly—because they fund the cost of their own retirement. If they didnt, of course we would do so through the age pension and the other supports that are put in place for all Australians, who absolutely deserve it if theyre not in a position to make provision for their own financial requirements in retirement. But those who are self-funded retirees do so much to take the burden off the taxpayer and allow us to invest more money in so many other services that are good for all Australians. So thank you to them.Reducing the age to 55 allows a lot more people to start to make provision—potentially, to sell a large family home—much sooner than they would have if they were waiting for eligibility for this important tax concession. We can think of a couple who own a family home which isnt necessarily the home they need once their children have moved out. It probably has a large amount of value in it. From the age of 55 that couple can sell the home and put $300,000 each into their superannuation without it being taxed on the way in. Theres an enormous incentive there to do that, of course. It puts people in a position to do that from the age of 55, well in advance of when they might ultimately retire and start to call upon their superannuation.Theres an enormous peace of mind in undertaking that transaction, getting it done and putting the money into super, and, equally, in being able to move into a different home thats more appropriate for the stage of life that youre moving into and to meet the costs of doing so. Everyone has moved home and we all know theres a lot of cost in moving from one home to another. Even if youre downsizing, theres a lot to get organised and arranged, and there are always unforeseen or unexpected costs in doing that. A lot of people would feel much more comfortable doing that while theyre still in the workforce and while theyre still earning a salary or wage. Now, through this measure, they can effectively undertake that process from the age of 55. They can square away those arrangements, put money into their superannuation and, therefore, reassess their superannuation and the amount that they have in it. They can have a new home that theyll probably spend the balance of their retirement in. They can settle all that down and meet all the costs of that transaction—of that relocation and purchase of a new property—and provision themselves by putting those funds into superannuation. They can settle their affairs while in the comfort of still being well and truly in the workforce and earning an income, not while staring down the barrel of a very imminent retirement and the uncertainty of whether or not theyll get the value theyre hoping to get for the property they sell and of whether the new property they want to move into will cost what they thought it would, with the various taxes and charges that state governments, in particular, put on those selling one home and moving into another.The other benefit of this, of course, is that it will encourage people to sell dwellings that were appropriate for a family—a family they might no longer have, if their kids have grown up and moved on, though there is another whole problem around that that isnt worth getting into in this debate—but will be less appropriate for the next stage of their life as they approach retirement. This will, I hope—as Im sure everyone hopes, which is why the government said, Me too, to the policy that we announced—increase the supply of family homes in the marketplace. That should help young families—who are at a very different stage in their life and in the economic cycle, with having and raising children, et cetera—by making it easier for them to purchase an appropriate family home. That is because more of the people who have a family home but dont need it anymore will be making the choice to sell that family home, having been encouraged to do so by this measure, this tax concession. I hope, as Im sure we all hope, this will increase the supply of family homes in the marketplace.Another enormous challenge weve got at the moment is housing affordability. There is a particular challenge for people looking to transition from what may have been the first home they purchased—that is, if they have been lucky enough even to get into the property market, which is an ever-increasing challenge—and recent increases in interest rates have made that challenge harder still. So I hope this measure helps those people who, having bought their first home, now find that that home, which was appropriate for them at a certain stage of life, is no longer appropriate. If they partnered up and bought their first home together as a couple but were not then at the stage of having children, by now they may be looking to have children or may already have young children and find that that home is not perfectly suited to the needs of a young and growing family.People whove reached the age of 55 will, in many cases, have exactly that type of home. They probably will have spent the last couple of decades raising their own family in that home but now may be in a position where they dont need that particular type of property anymore. These very sensible tax incentives will encourage them to downsize from that property and have the benefits of doing so and of putting a significant contribution into super. They may do this individually or as a couple—both, of course, will get the opportunity. I think we could then have the good outcome of helping younger people to get into family homes.This is obviously completely voluntary. My parents, funnily enough, are in this circumstance themselves. They certainly are not downsizing their property! Theyre very happy staying in a larger family home. It is, of course, absolutely their right to do so. All we are doing here is providing the opportunity and an enhanced incentive to downsize, for those who choose to, through avoiding taxation on the proceeds of selling that property, up to the amount of $300,000, by contributing it to super. That obviously means theyre downsizing, because they will have sold their property and, if they take advantage of this, they will have less money left over—having contributed up to $300,000 into their superannuation—to go towards the property that theyre buying to replace the one that theyve sold. I think the outcome is self-evident there. Its going to be an excellent opportunity for people to plan and provision for their retirement.There are a couple of other measures that emanate from the previous government in this TLAB No. 2 bill—others have probably commented on that—in particular around being a lot more flexible with small businesses around honest mistakes they might make in the way in which they manage their business accounts, which might lead to them inadvertently misrecording and therefore misreporting certain things to the ATO. I am absolutely pleased this new government is continuing with the position of the previous government, not to be too heavy-handed with people when they have probably made some genuine and honest mistakes. Its a bit like community service instead of being sent straight to jail where, frankly, the circumstance most probably is that they havent meant to make a bookkeeping error. Its not something we will condone into the future, but one option is they undertake appropriate training to understand why they have made certain mistakes in the accounts of the business. And they wont get a second chance if, having done that, they make the same mistakes again in the future. I think thats eminently sensible.Im particularly pleased, as Ive made clear, that were here to give an opportunity for much greater security for people planning their retirement. I thank the millions of Australians, a growing cohort, who are provisioning for their own retirement. Ive made the point as to how much of a significant economic contribution that is and how much of a significant budgetary contribution it is, particularly to the Commonwealth budget. This is one thing we can do to help them feel more secure in their retirement. I think itll also lead to more people being self-funded retirees and taking a further financial burden off the Commonwealth payments that are made. That is in no way any criticism of people who do need and should always have the support of us to have the aged pension and other government supports in retirement, but, clearly, where people can afford to support their own retirement that is of significant help to the Commonwealth. This is one very good opportunity we have to help those people who help us in that way. I commend the bill to the House.","Treasury Laws Amendment (2022 Measures No. 2) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr STEVENS (Sturt) ","(12:34):"
46,0,0,0,1,1,"Watson-Brown, Elizabeth MP",300127,"Ryan","AG","N/A",1235," We have in front of parliament right now the Treasury Laws Amendment (2022 Measures No. 2) Bill 2022, which simply does not address the biggest budgetary issue in this country: Labors stage 3 tax cuts. I want to take this time to ask: who does this government govern for? Its not clear to me that its for everyday people. The rhetoric is there but you have to look at the actions.At the moment Labor are about to rip $244 billion out of the budget over the next decade and hand the bulk of it to the ultra-wealthy—a quarter of a trillion dollars. Labor will say they inherited these handouts for the mega-rich from the previous government. That is not true. They in fact voted for them along with the Liberals. This was a bipartisan commitment to put money that was meant for health, education and social support into the hands of people who dont need it. But Labor can reverse it. Its okay. Be mature. Admit you made a mistake and repeal these tax cuts—and do it now.Labors stage 3 tax cuts arent just some numbers on paper; they will affect millions of peoples real lives. People in this chamber may be sheltered from this on these, frankly, absurdly large salaries we have, but many everyday people out there are going through hell right now, with a cost-of-living crisis unlike any in recent memory. If you were just getting by a year ago, you are in a state of absolute stress and anxiety now. If you were just making rent or mortgage repayments before and just managing your electricity bills, you are really stressing out now about where to find that money. Inflation is running at 6.1 per cent, and real wages have fallen by 3.5 per cent. It is tough out there. Rents have spiked 16.9 per cent in Brisbane in the last 12 months. Mortgages are about to significantly increase with the RBAs recent interest rate hikes. Were hearing of more and more people finding themselves without a roof over their heads. We have families sleeping in cars. But, instead of taking that $244 billion and spending it on the things that will help everyday people get by, like building public housing, doubling JobSeeker, funding Medicare properly, Labor have decided to hand it over as tax cuts, the bulk of which will go to the megarich of this country.These tax cuts are actually quite obscene. Of this $244 billion, the richest one per cent in Australia will receive as much as the poorest 65 per cent of Australia combined. The top 20 per cent of income earners will receive 77 per cent of this $244 billion. For the rest, crumbs. Members of this chamber will receive $9,000 in tax cuts a year. Alan Joyce will receive that too. Billionaires like Gina Rinehart will get $9,000 in tax cuts a year, and two-thirds of these tax cuts will flow to men, while only one-third will come to women, only furthering that gender pay gap. Im sorry if it offends people in this chamber, but someone on over $200,000 a year doesnt need another business class flight every year.My Greens colleague Max Chandler-Mather has just moved an amendment to this Treasury laws bill to call on this government to stop these unjustifiable stage 3 tax cuts. Theres no reason to proceed with them. Lets use this opportunity to drop them now. While Labor are handing out $9,000 to the Alan Joyces of the world, our public services are eroded. But imagine what we could do with $244 billion. Since Labor seem to be lacking in imagination at the moment, heres a quick list of some of the things we could do with that quarter of a trillion dollars. Medicare hasnt kept up with inflation, so its increasingly impossible to see a bulk-billing doctor. We could fix that, giving everyone access to genuinely free and comprehensive health care. People cant access dental under Medicare. We could make seeing the dentist something everyone can do for free. Our nurses, teachers, early childcare workers are underpaid; our hospitals are understaffed; and our schools are underfunded. We could make sure our health and education sectors are fully funded, world class, and our essential workers are looked after. JobSeeker is well below the poverty line. With $244 billion, we could double it and ensure everyone has something to fall back on when times are tough. The pension is also below the poverty line. We could let everyone have comfortable, happy retirements regardless of whether they were fortunate enough to accrue a lot of super. Child care is prohibitively expensive for so many families. We could make it free. We have hundreds and thousands of people currently on the waiting list for social housing. With $244 billion, we could build enough beautifully designed public housing to give every single one of them a decent home and have plenty left over for people who just want a secure place to live for low rent. One of these things alone could be transformative, but with $244 billion we could go a long way to making all of these a reality in Australia.We have a Treasury laws amendment bill in front of us that doesnt mention Labors stage 3 tax cuts. It doesnt repeal them, although it could. It doesnt free up that $244 billion to fund the things that everyday people need. Whenever we in the Greens suggest that the government could deliver something that would genuinely help everyday Australians, like bringing dental into Medicare, like raising the pension, like lowering the age of retirement, they cry poor and say, Were in too much debt. Too much debt when we could give billions upon billions in handouts to the megarich? Well, you cant use public debt as an excuse to not fund social programs while ripping a quarter of a trillion dollars out of the budget. Its an insult to the intelligence of everyday Australians.Why does this government not govern for the real people? If they go ahead with these tax cuts, it will be sadly all too clear that theyre not governing for the person who cant afford to see the dentist, the person whos lost work, the person who cant afford to pay the rent or mortgage. Theyll be governing for the megarich.","Treasury Laws Amendment (2022 Measures No. 2) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms WATSON-BROWN (Ryan) ","(12:47):"
47,0,0,0,1,1,"van Manen, Bert MP",188315,"Forde","LNP","N/A",1236," Im always pleased to rise and speak on a treasury laws amendment bill, and its good to see the Assistant Treasurer in the House for the contribution. Im sure hell appreciate it, as he always does.The Treasury Laws Amendment (2022 Measures No. 2) Bill 2022 implements a number of sensible measures from the previous coalition government. Im pleased to say that its good to see the government looking to pursue and implement those measures, which are part of a long line of many sensible measures that we implemented over the last nine years in government. The implementation of a number of these measures was delayed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, but this bill provides effective changes to support small business in handling their affairs with the ATO and provides them with additional support in the event of inadvertent breaches, as opposed to penalties.Ill say at the outset that it would be fair to characterise the ATOs relationship with small business as certainly not a love-love relationship. Its probably more a love-hate relationship. We need to do anything that we can in this place to make that relationship better. We need to ensure that small businesses are treated by the ATO with the respect and dignity they deserve and that, when they do make inadvertent errors, theyre not inappropriately penalised for those oversights. Small businesses dont have accounting departments, chief financial officers and all of the things that our large corporates do. Many of them are mum-and-dad businesses where people are not just the financial managers; theyre also seeking to run the business each and every day and generate sales and revenue. More often than not they have a mortgage on that small business that is secured by their home, so theyve got the pressure of keeping a roof over their head, and that is entirely dependent on how the business goes. Theyre also employing people in our local communities and supporting our local sporting clubs and community organisations. And they certainly dont have HR departments; the business owners are the HR department.This bill provides small business with additional support in dealing with the ATO appeals process and removes tax barriers to sole traders and individuals looking to upskill. It also, importantly, supports gig economy contractors and companies to manage their tax obligations. In this place, we all know of the growing prevalence of the gig economy in a whole range of areas.The measures in this bill also put in place the coalitions election commitment to support Australians over 55 to downsize their properties and contribute to their superannuation. The bill builds on the coalitions strong record of supporting small business, supporting retirees, making sensible reforms to superannuation and supporting the housing market.Schedule 1 of the bill amends the Tax Administration Act 1953 to empower the commissioner, where the commissioner reasonably believes an entity has failed to comply with its tax related record-keeping obligations, to direct the entity to complete an approved record-keeping course as an alternative to existing financial penalties. I think thats an excellent move. One of the benefits of the increase in technology that we see all around us is the ability for small business to have access to good technology to keep much better records. I know, because I see the work my brother does as a ceramic tiler in the building industry, that this is particularly important for tradespeople and self-employed people, who dont necessarily keep the records that they should keep. If they can do a record-keeping course and get access to appropriate software and other training to better manage their financial and tax affairs, without being penalised, I think thats a particularly good initiative.The bill also introduces, in schedule 2, a third-party reporting regime, which will require sharing-economy online platforms to report identification and income information, regarding participating sellers, to the ATO for data-matching purposes. Weve already seen that in other areas, particularly in the building sector, where there are reporting requirements for data-matching purposes. This measure will apply to ride-sourcing, short-term accommodation platforms, asset sharing, food delivery, task based platforms and other platforms in the economy. Once these platforms begin these measures, its expected to result in increased self-reporting of currently unreported or underreported income by sellers.Schedule 3 of the bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act to make consequential amendments to the fringe benefits tax, to remove the exclusions as a deductible expense for the first $250 of expenses for prescribed courses of education. This is another measure that I think adds to providing incentive to undertake additional education, to build the skills of small-business owners and tradespeople. It delivers on the coalitions 2021-22 budget commitment to backing small business with a simple, fast and cheap way to pause or modify—sorry, thats a separate matter; schedule 4 does this—in relation to orders with the AAT, and to stay those orders or otherwise affect ATO debt recovery actions. This is an area where I have had many discussions with small-business operators across my electorate and the conduct of the ATO in these particular matters.Ill congratulate the government on taking this coalition budget measure of backing small business with a simple, fast and cheap way to pause or modify the ATO debt recovery action in relation to debt that is currently under review by the AAT. I would go a step further and look to see wholesale reform of this area and ensure that the ATO is much more forthcoming in its reasons and explaining why it comes up with these assessments in the first place. But this is a good step, in the right direction, by enabling small business to pause any ATO debt recovery action while their case is being decided by the independent umpire.Schedule 5 of the bill partially implements helping homeowners who want to downsize, a commitment announced by the former government on 15 May 2022. This was ultimately matched as an election commitment by Labor.These measures, Im pleased to say, build on the tremendous track record of the coalition government over the last nine years of providing support to small and medium business, across the economy, in recognition of the tremendous effort that they provide to innovation, employment and generating wealth for our country. We often hear about our big corporates but, more often than not, where a lot of our innovation occurs is in our small to medium business sector.The measures we took during our time in government were because we understand the importance of small and family business across our economy. One of the great measures that we undertook, when we were in government, was the establishment of the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman in 2016, to ensure that small business had an advocate within government and in the community. As theyre part of the role, the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman assists small business to resolve disputes through case management and alternative dispute resolution processes. The coalition also bolstered the mediation services within the Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman and established the Small Business Taxation Division within the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I think, again, that was a tremendous step in assisting small business with what sometimes can be very difficult matters with the ATO. I know that in my time on the Standing Committee on Tax and Revenue we had many discussions about the ATO and the way they conducted their process of dispute resolution and management. We strengthened protections for small and family businesses through including them in the unfair contract provisions and providing greater access, again, to alternative dispute resolution processes through various industry codes.All of these measures and many more are the track record that the previous coalition government has left for this country and for our small business sector, and Im very proud to have been part of the government that delivered those key and important measures. As we keep working towards supporting small and medium businesses across our economy, Im happy to see the government take up some of those measures which we would have implemented if wed had the privilege of being re-elected to government at the last election. Im pleased to see that the government has decided to take these on and they are reflected in this bill.","Treasury Laws Amendment (2022 Measures No. 2) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr VAN MANEN (Forde—Chief Opposition Whip) ","(12:54):"
48,0,0,0,1,1,"Marino, Nola Bethwyn MP","HWP","Forrest","LP","N/A",1237," As has been said here, the coalition will be supporting the Treasury Laws Amendment (2022 Measures No. 2) Bill 2022 because it implements a number of very sensible measures of the previous coalition government. It is all about small business, as weve heard previously—the small businesses that employ the majority of Australians and do so very well in all of our small communities in particular.We see in this bill a common-sense approach to the practical way that our small businesses work and the fact that theyre often just a mum-and-dad business, two partners or an individual. Thats why a practical approach to the Australian Taxation Office, as we see in the measures here, is so important. As we know, many of our small business owners dont have a massive HR department to work with them. They are everything. They often work all day in their business and sometimes at night as well. Theyre often in the role 24 hours a day, seven days a week, but they do an amazing job. I want to recognise those small businesses in our support of this bill, particularly those in small rural and regional communities.Small businesses do a fantastic job of keeping those local economies ticking over, but what they also do, which is often unseen, is support every community service organisation, every one of our volunteer emergency service organisations, and our sporting and other organisations. Whenever local people need a donation, the first place they go to is a local small business. So anything we can do in this House to provide that additional support and to assist small businesses to manage their issues through the Australian Taxation Office is a very good, practical move because it reduces the amount of time that they need to spend on those matters and allows them to get on with what theyre there to do, which is to run their business and work in that business and employ other Australians—such an important part of the role that they play. I see that in my own part of the world.The bill deals with matters around the Australian Taxation Office, providing small businesses with additional support in dealing with the ATO appeals process and removing tax barriers to support sole traders and individuals looking to upskill—practical matters for small businesses. The bill supports gig-economy contractors and companies to manage their tax obligations and ensures that the ATO has the data it needs for accurate reporting. It puts in place important reforms to support the coalitions election commitment to support Australians over 55 to downsize their property and contribute to their super. The real key issue for me is the strong support for small business, though supporting retirees is absolutely very sensible, as are the reforms to super and the housing market.I can recall in my time as an MP—which I think a number of members in this parliament would have done in their time as local members—an individual who got in touch with me two days before Christmas. He said, The ATO wants to take my house and my business, and Ill be out of business. We had to work overtime to make sure that he connected with the right people in the ATO and was able to work through the issues that were on the table. It was about 18 months or two years later that I happened to run into him at a local service station. He bolted across to say, I am still in business and I still have my home. I think thats one of the things that we get to do as local members: facilitating very sound discussions that enable people to stay in business and to work out their issues with the ATO, if theyre able to connect with the right people and get a fair hearing about what theyre dealing with. Much in this bill is related to that.It is quite tough for a lot of small businesses to deal with the complexity that goes with dealing with the Australian Taxation Office, so there are a lot of benefits in this bill—even the one to seek orders from the AAT that stay or otherwise affect ATO debt-recovery actions while the small business is disputing the underlying tax assessment in the Small Business Taxation Division of the AAT. This reflects what I was talking about earlier, the issues facing a small business and the sense of panic they get if, particularly, theyve inadvertently made an error or just need the right person to talk to in order to work through their issues.Im really proud of what weve done. This really helps resolve disputes in a timely and cost-effective way. Access to justice is a simple thing for small business. The previous speaker, the opposition whip, spoke about the coalition establishing the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman. I think that is a particularly important office. This advocate that small business now has with government and in the community is such an important role. I would encourage as many small businesses as possible—and it really doesnt matter what issue youre dealing with—to, when they need assistance, get in touch with the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman. There are a lot of other areas that they can assist you with, not just in this space.For many small businesses, resolving disputes through case management and referral to alternative dispute resolution are things that they get to deal with. Hopefully, that isnt very often, but when they do, they are time-poor and often dont know where to start. How about starting with the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman as a first point of call if theyre not sure where to go? I imagine most of them work with their accountants and others but, in this instance, why not talk to the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman? If youre aware of a small business in this space, please tell them to get in touch for that purpose.We bolstered mediation services within the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman and established the Small Business Taxation Dispute Division within the AAT. Theres that importance of strengthening protections for small and family businesses from unfair contract terms, which happen on a regular basis. Weve seen some move in that, particularly with small businesses in the agricultural sector, and changes for those who find themselves at the bottom end of supply and value chains. The work in the unfair contract terms space is very important. Being a dairy farmer myself, over the years Ive understood some of the challenges of having a perishable product and being in that position. Its a huge challenge for small business, particularly in the rural and agricultural sector. So Im very proud of our ongoing support for small business.There was also the instant asset write-off which we introduced and the number of small businesses which were able to take advantage of that. Im very proud of our ongoing support for small business and the number of small businesses that were able to take advantage of the instant asset write-off that we introduced, whether it was a local small business such as a cafe or even a pizza shop. The local guys who are livestock transporters were able to use the instant asset write-off to buy themselves the new gear that they were desperately needing. If you consider the number of small businesses that really took advantage of this during COVID, they were the ones who were still open, and they were mostly, in many instances, small businesses that did everything they could to keep their communities ticking over.In a little place called Nannup, in my electorate, the local supermarket of course had real struggles. You were allocated certain numbers of items and they had limited access to the one thing we saw so much hoarding of, which was toilet paper. Here was this little business in a tiny community, and one of the local people came and saw Joyce at the store and said, What are you short of? She said, This is something were struggling to get hold of because were limited to what we can have. So this gentleman drove a couple of hours to where there were supplies. He bought the supplies back to Nannup and said to Joyce, Tell me whos been in who desperately needs some of these. He went around and dropped them off on the front doorstep, safely, of these premises for the people who couldnt access them. Thats the strength, thats what happens with small business and thats what happens with good people in local communities.During COVID, people come from major populated areas into small communities looking for certain products. My own local supermarket said: Nola, stop panicking. Weve got some supplies out the back. For all of our regular, particularly mature-age, customers, were making sure that that one packet of flour or sugar or the things that they buy every week are kept available—for the people who need them most, the people in our small communities. Thats the value of small community business. Thats why Im very proud of all the measures that we took in our time in government to support small business, and I know that well be continuing to work in every way we can to support small business.","Treasury Laws Amendment (2022 Measures No. 2) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs MARINO (Forrest) ","(13:06):"
49,0,0,0,1,1,"Wallace, Andrew MP",265967,"Fisher","LNP","N/A",1239," I want to thank the previous speaker, the previous Chief Government Whip, for her outstanding contribution in this debate. The opposition will be supporting the Treasury Laws Amendment (2022 Measures No. 2) Bill 2022 because the bill implements a number of sensible measures that the coalition government examined—and pushed for—in its previous life. The bill provides effective changes to support small businesses in handling their affairs with the ATO, providing them with additional supports in the event of inadvertent breachers. Thats very important. Before coming into this place, I was a builder by trade, a carpenter by trade. I then owned a building business, and then I became a barrister. So I spent 30 years in a small business before coming to this place, and Ive always said, Wouldnt it be great, wouldnt this place look a bit different, if everyone had to spend time working in small business; if everyone had to understand the trials and tribulations of actually employing people and working their way around how to pay people on awards and, quite frankly, sweating blood on a Wednesday night trying to figure out how theyre going to make payroll tomorrow. Ive often told people who have spoken to me about their desire to come into this place, In my view, you will be a lesser parliamentarian if you come into this place without having endured those trials and tribulations.This bill does a number of things, and Ill touch on them in due course, but one of them is that, in schedule 1, if the commissioner is of the view that an entity has failed to comply with their tax obligations, specifically in relation to recordkeeping, then, rather than ping them, the commissioner can require that person to undertake a course. Schedule 1 actually reminds me of when I was a young fellow sitting for my builders licence and I had to go and do all these various courses.

I was sitting in the HIA office in Brisbane with 30 or 40 other people and met a fellow by the name of Frank ONeill. Franks the kind of guy who will probably be listening to this right now as we speak. So if you are, Frank: Cheers, mate. You did a good job with me and many of my colleagues. You actually ignited my love of learning. So thank you for what you gave to me. But I digress.It is very important to know that people, particularly in small business, come from various backgrounds and various levels of education. Sometimes in my industry, the building industry, particularly amongst the trades—its certainly not exclusive to the trades—for many people school was not their greatest forte. Lunchtime was my favourite subject when I was at school, as you can tell! The opportunity to go and do these courses to become better bookkeepers and to become better managers of your business—like the one that I did when I was studying to become a builder—was very much welcome. It stood me in good stead, as it has done for hundreds of thousands of other contractors in Queensland, unlike in some other jurisdictions in this fine country, I hasten to add, which do not require you to complete these sorts of educational courses to become a builder. I think Queensland had it right when I was going through some 30 or 35-odd years ago.I really do acknowledge and congratulate the drafting of schedule 1, which enables these sorts of education courses. Rather than fine someone, it says, Lets work with this individual and try and upskill them. Thats surely better than just pinging them with a fine.Schedule 2 of the bill is also an important provision which provides for data matching for the ATO. It specifically does that in relation to ride sharing, ride sourcing and short-term accommodation platforms. This is really important. Its really just bringing those data-matching abilities into line with, once again, my old stomping ground—thats the building industry. Its interesting because last week, or it may have been the week before that, I called upon a local business called Advance Kitchens, in Caloundra in my electorate, and I spoke with Carol Langton. Carol rang me up and she was frothing at the mouth. She is very upset about how she has to be doing all this unpaid public service, as I ultimately called it. Small businesses have all these reporting requirements, particularly for subcontractors. After I had the opportunity to sit down with Carol and explain to her the importance of these anti-black-economy provisions that enable the ATO to data-match information with their own material and the reporting of their own subcontractors, Carol, to her credit, could see the benefits of those requirements.Whilst I was at the warehouse factory I had a good tour and saw the great work that Advance Kitchens in Caloundra are doing. I met some of the staff. I met an older gentleman who had been working there for decades. He was in his 70s. His granddaughter was working at the factory and was keeping it in the family. It is a terrific local business.I come back to the point. Schedule 2 essentially just brings into parity the reporting requirements for rideshare and gig economy platforms and much more traditional business, such as those in the building industry. Those data-matching requirements have been in place for a very long time. Its very important that we ensure that we have these provisions that are very tight in relation to the black economy. We want to make sure that businesses are paying their fair share of tax. I dont think anybody would quibble too much with that point.Schedule 3 is a little less interesting, but it does amend the Income Tax Assessment Act and makes consequential amendments to the FBT act to remove the exclusion as deductible expenses of the first $250 of expenses for prescribed courses of education. Having said that, I note that once again it creates an added incentive for small businesses to provide educational courses to their staff. That is always a good thing. It doesnt matter whether it is a course in relation to IR, first aid or whatever it might be. There are FBT benefits for the first $250 of expenses for prescribed courses. Its a very good thing to provide those opportunities for additional learning for staff and to provide that economic incentive as well.Schedule 4 of the bill is something that is relatively close to my heart. Ive talked in this place often enough about being a builder and becoming a barrister. Schedule 4 allows small businesses to seek orders from the AAT that stay, or otherwise affect, ATO debt recovery actions whilst the small business is disputing the underlying tax assessment in the Small Business Taxation Division of the AAT. This is very much a commonsense provision. If a businessperson feels aggrieved by a decision of the ATO then that businessperson has every right to challenge the decision of the ATO in the AAT. If that person doesnt get a successful outcome there, they go onwards from there to the Federal Court et cetera. This provision stays the decision of the ATO until they get an outcome through the legal process. This shouldnt be seen as anything controversial. Simply, while someone is exercising their legal rights to have the decision challenged in the AAT, that decision should be stayed. It reminds me that a constituent of mine, whos been vociferous in his opposition—","Treasury Laws Amendment (2022 Measures No. 2) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[4]","N/A","N/A"

A combination of conflict, COVID-19 and climate change has created a humanitarian emergency, with an estimated 10,000 children dying of hunger every day. Countless more will inevitably be left with lifelong health problems and disabilities. These are children who, through no fault of their own, are fighting for their lives, as are other members of their families. Micah reports that 50 million people in 45 countries are on the verge of famine.A global response is urgently needed, and Australia must be a part of that response. Micah is calling on Australia to provide $150 million to the global hunger crisis. The Australian people have always shown a willingness to give generously at times of crisis. Even acknowledging our own budgetary pressures, there is no greater priority than saving lives. I urge the government to consider the Micah request and how else Australia may be able to provide assistance in the global response to the hunger crisis.","Global Hunger","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[8]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ZAPPIA (Makin) ","(13:40):"

Boat turnbacks, the policy of both major parties, violate international law and risk sending people back to death, torture and persecution.People seeking refuge in Australia have a right to live with dignity, security and safety in our community. We, the people signed on this petition, and the Greens, once again demand: an immediate end to offshore detention and boat turnbacks; that all temporary visa types be converted to permanent visas; that all refugees who have been rejected be allowed to have access to appeals; that medevac refugees be allowed to stay in Australia permanently; delivery of an additional 20,000 Afghan refugee places; and that the ban on accepting refugees coming in from Indonesia be lifted, and refugees stranded in PNG be allowed to come to Australia.We have a terrible legacy in this country on this issue. We have treated a large number of people incredibly poorly. Labor, in opposition, said they would treat people more humanely, but in government the problem is that Labor has continued many of the reprehensible policies of the Liberal-National coalition. These policies are brutal, unfair, cruel and ultimately must end. They are a huge stain on our collective hands.

Individuals are falling through the cracks and need assistance to turn their lives around after waiting unacceptable times for medical procedures and for beds in aged care. Two aged-care facilities in Rockhampton have invited me to meetings in the past two weeks to discuss the crisis they are facing due to the lack of doctors and nurses servicing them. Benevolent Living, a newly refurbished, state-of-the-art aged-care facility, has 22 beds available right now that, due to the inability to clinically manage more residents, cannot be filled. These facilities have been relying on a fly-in fly-out GPs to treat their elderly residents and do not have enough nursing staff to care for the needs of existing residents. Aged-care residents are being sent to Rockhampton Hospital, where they wait for an unacceptable length of time. They are then sent back to Benevolent or other nursing homes, where they are then reassessed and then sent back to the hospital.One solution to this issue is to connect clinics run by nurse practitioners to hospitals to relieve some of the minor cases. This situation is unacceptable and is placing enormous stress on the families having to care for elderly members while they await a bed in a facility.The pressure on staff working within the aged-care sector is enormous. I will be holding an aged-care forum in Rockhampton to, hopefully, find a solution to this crisis.","Aged Care","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[11]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms LANDRY (Capricornia) ","(13:44):"

Many pensioners had been calling for this change for some time, and it makes good sense. It will certainly benefit a large percentage of pensioners who live in my electorate and have retired to the Bellarine or Surf Coast. Although theyve retired, lots of pensioners want to continue to contribute to the workforce and their community, but the impact on their pension has prohibited this.But no longer. The Albanese government will now provide a one-off income credit designed to give older Australians the option to work and keep more of their money. Following the successful Jobs and Skills Summit, an immediate $4,000 income credit will be added from December to the income banks of age pensioners, to be used this financial year. This means pensioners can increase their earnings from $7,800 to $11,800 this year before their pension is reduced. Its a win-win not just for pensioners but also for our labour market. Pensioners can work more, earn more, use their skills and stay connected while we boost the supply of labour to help address worker shortages. This is a great reform which pensioners in my electorate will embrace thanks to the Albanese government.","Pensions and Benefits","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[12]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms COKER (Corangamite) ","(13:46):"

Currently there is an enterprise bargaining agreement in Victoria that requires schools to fund 100 per cent of time on duty and 50 per cent of time on call for their staff. No-one denies that teachers deserve fair compensation, but this award potentially disproportionately affects students because the principals dont have that extra finance or funding to deal with camps.Overstretched budgets are forcing schools to think twice about camps, and that includes this building and also camps throughout Victoria. Indeed, there is even talk of charging parents separately for this privilege, and that does create a disparity between private and public schools in Victoria. No-one would want it to be that you must go to a private school to come to this place for a visit. All students, whether they are public or private, should be given the chance to come to this place.I urge the Victorian Labor government, as soon as possible, to look at the consequences of this agreement and to provide funding and certainty for schools so that all students in Victoria get to go to camps.","Victoria: Education","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[13]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr WOLAHAN (Menzies) ","(13:47):"

Racerunning, or frame running, is a game-changer for people with a disability. The specially designed three-wheeled frame supports participants to run on their feet independently. Developed in Denmark, the running frames were developed for people with cerebral palsy to help them run and keep active. It took a determined father to bring the frames to Australia. Richard Keith discovered frame running in 2018 at a triathlon competition for children with cerebral palsy. His eight-year-old son, Arran, was participating in the competition and was relying on a cumbersome walking frame for the run leg. It was here that Richard discovered running frames. Richard talks about the first moment he saw his son using the running frame—seeing his freedom of movement and speed and the joy he showed in being able to run for the first time. It was a moment that brought him to tears.Frame running has taken hold here, and there are now nine running groups across Australia, giving people with a disability exercise, self-confidence and access to a wonderful community. The story of frame running demonstrates how adjustments and technology can ensure that all people have access to sports and exercise.","RaceRunning Australia","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[14]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms SITOU (Reid) ","(13:49):"

He would try to spend six months of the year overseas volunteering and when he was home he volunteered locally, serving the South Burnett branch of the Rural Fire Service.Tragically, this year Jed was providing medical assistance to Ukrainian forces while on the front line in eastern Ukraine. Jed was a medic, and he was saving lives in the town of Izyum, on the Donets River, which has been under Russian military occupation since 3 May. Earlier this week, DFAT advised that Jed had lost his life while driving a medical vehicle on 24 August.Jed gave his life providing care to his fellow man, and this serves as an inspiration to us all.

The fact is that my entire ministerial team have been entirely transparent, which is why you are able to ask the questions and go down the rabbit holes that you have tried to go down. But, unfortunately, for the Leader of the Oppositions objectives, they are cul-de-sacs, because the code has been dealt with and my ministers are fully aware of it. Let me just say this: if the Leader of the Opposition applied a similar code to those opposite, then one, two, three and four would all not have been able to sit in the ministry for nine long years.I tell you what: if you want to talk about integrity, you are going to have a big chance. Your big chance is next week when there is a national anticorruption commission bill presented to this parliament. That is your big chance to put up your hand and say, We have heard the message and we will support a national anticorruption commission, because we will be putting forward the legislation next week.You of course said that you would deliver a national anticorruption commission in the last term of parliament. It was a commitment that you made prior to the 2019 election. We waited until the end of 2018 for the bill to be tabled, and then we waited in 2019 and then in 2020 and then in 2021 and then in 2022—and it didnt happen. Well, guess what?

95,0,1,0,0,1,"Butler, Mark Christopher MP","HWK","Hindmarsh","ALP","N/A",1248," I thank my electoral neighbour, the member for Boothby, for her question, because the PBS is one of Labors proudest legacies, along with Medicare, one of the twin pillars of Australias universal health care—hard fought for at the time, fought and contested tooth and nail by the Liberal Party, but now a deeply entrenched part of Australias social fabric. And in just the first 100 days of this government we have already approved 23 new or amended listings on the PBS.Last week Zejula was listed, for the first time, for the treatment of ovarian cancer. We all know too well in this place that ovarian cancer survival rates, tragically, remain stubbornly low, at only about 50 per cent over five years, and this listing will provide new hope to about 300 patients every year. Each course of treatment of Zejula costs a whopping $130,000, but the good news is that this PBS listing will bring that price down to just $42.50.The even better news is that from January next year that cost will come down, even further, to just $30. A course of Zejula involves 20 prescriptions, so that saving will amount to $250 for each of those 300 Australian women. Those 300 women dealing with the enormous challenge of ovarian cancer will be among the 3.6 million Australians who benefit from the biggest cut to the price of medicines in this countrys history. At a time of huge pressure on household budgets, this will be a huge relief.Single mum Carrie yesterday sent me a picture of the two medications that shes supposed to take every single day. She wrote, Here are two things I take that are over $42, and because of the cost I dont take them every day as I should. Are they actually reducing to that much? That would be amazing. Almost a million other Australians defer taking medicines prescribed by their doctor because of cost, just like Carrie. Under our plan, that will change.For households with multiple scripts, the savings are going to run to hundreds and hundreds of dollars every year. Jeannie wrote to me. She said, Thanks, Albo. Thats how this government runs. We get written to and people thank the Prime Minister, as is completely appropriate. She said, My family spends a few hundred dollars on scripts, and this will definitely make a huge difference. And Andrea wrote, Brilliant news. Hubby has four scripts a month for his heart condition and this will help our budget enormously.Our plan for cheaper medicines provides millions of Australians with vital cost-of-living relief and helps ensure that theyre not going to go without medicines they need for their good health.","Health Care","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1[4]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BUTLER (Hindmarsh—Minister for Health and Aged Care and Deputy Leader of the House) ","(14:09):"

It is well on its way to becoming the law of the land. In relation to the leadership we have to show and the damage that we have to repair, the House knows the impacts of 10 years of delay, denial and dysfunction, What weve seen is 10 years of underinvestment in renewable energy and in electricity generation. Thats what the act is all about: sending the message to investors that Australia is open for business.The House will recall the four unfun facts of the previous governments record: the fact that four gigawatts of energy generation left the system and only one gigawatt came on; the fact that the previous minister promised almost $1 billion of investment and didnt deliver one watt of energy; the fact that their signature policy, Snowy 2.0, is running 18 months late; and the fact that the then minister, the now shadow Treasurer, intervened to change the law so that an electricity price rise would be hidden from the Australian people. As morally unacceptable as that is, I understand why he did it. The implications were very significant. What the previous minister hid from the Australian people was, for example, for New South Wales an average rise of $227 for a New South Wales household or up to $1,130 for a small business. Thats what the now shadow Treasurer hid from the Australian people.Thats bad enough, but I saw the other day the shadow Treasurer interviewed on Sky News, and he was asked about this. He was asked about why he intervened to change the law to hide the electricity rise, and he said: No, this is a report from the AER, not from the government. Lets be very clear about that. It wasnt me. The trouble is that, when you change the law, theres a record. They keep records of these things. At the front it says, Angus Taylor, Minister for Industry, Energy and Emissions Reduction. I know there was more than one of them, but this was actually you! On the back, the regulation change about the date of the report says, Omit 1 May, substitute the first business day after 25 May. It didnt occur to the now shadow Treasurer that that was after the election. I table the regulation. This guy wants to be the Treasurer of Australia now. Hes not fit to be the Treasurer of the local P&C, with what hes hidden from the Australian people. I apologise to the P&C treasurers around Australia; theyre all fine people.

153,0,1,0,0,1,"Marles, Richard Donald MP","HWQ","Corio","ALP","N/A",1251," I thank the member for her question and acknowledge her service to our nations Defence Force. On 3 August, the government announced the Defence Strategic Review, which has been asked to consider the complex strategic circumstances which we face, what it means that we are within the 10-year threat window—which we know the former government rightly observed exists for our country—and what that means in terms of the kind of Defence Force that we need to build for the future to keep us safe. To that end, Sir Angus Houston and Stephen Smith are casting a critical eye over the Integrated Investment Plan, the 10-year procurement schedule for our Defence Force, because a prudent management of that schedule is fundamentally important to building a powerful Defence Force.But that task has been made so much more difficult by the legacy which has been left to us by those opposite. When it came to hoopla, the Liberals were the gold standard. When it came to defence, there were press releases by the hour, bells and whistles, streamers and balloons. They literally had Top Gun music when they were doing defence announcements. They truly were the PT Barnum of defence procurement, but when it came to delivery, well, that was actually a completely different question: frigates running late, offshore patrol vessels running late and a lost decade when it comes to our future submarines, as they chopped and changed from one country to the next.As we came to office, we inherited 30 major projects running over time and 17 major projects running over budget to an accumulated total of more than $4 billion. The Leader of the Opposition used to love to come to this dispatch box and talk about how much money the Liberals spent on defence. Well, can I tell the House, it doesnt count as defence spending if you spend the money on absolutely nothing. It doesnt count as defence spending if you flush that money down the toilet. Its not as though we can go onto the battlefield and overwhelm our adversary by running up to them and waving a copy of the budget papers in their face. This was the single most inept, incompetent, negligent government when it came to the management of Australias defence budget.Let me say, the age of vaudeville is over. There are not going to be any Top Gun announcements from the Albanese government. What you will get is serious, prudent management of the defence budget because we understand that that is the way that well get the submarines in the water quicker, and well get the OPVs and the frigates back on track. In doing that, we are going to build a potent and capable Defence Force which will keep our country safe in the future.","Defence Procurement","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1[10]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr MARLES (Corio—Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence) ","(14:30):"

Part 3.12 wasnt referred to today, of course, but its worth reading it into the record:If a Minister becomes aware that a fund or trust has invested in a company that might give rise to a perception of a conflict of interest, the Minister should inform the Prime Minister immediately and liquidate the investment in the fund or trust if required to do so.None of that has happened.Weve got a situation where earlier this week a minister claimed to this House that some sort of self-assessment process had been undertaken by her, during which—surprisingly!—she cleared herself of any wrongdoing. She later claimed that, in fact, she had breached the Code of Conduct for Ministers, for which she knows, as we now do, there is no consequence. How is it that this Prime Minister is pretending to uphold some different code or some different standard when there is absolutely no consequence for a breach of the code? Could it be any clearer? Have a look at the Assistant Minister for Health in terms of those shareholdings. Could they be shareholdings in the education sector? Could they be shareholdings in a building company? No. As it turns out, the assistant minister has an interest in shares relating specifically to her own portfolio: health and private health insurance funds. You could ask, Is there a consequence for such conduct? Under this Prime Minister there is no consequence. Again, that minister has conducted her own assessment and, would you believe it, shes cleared herself of any wrongdoing. What a robust process of a higher standard being maintained by this government!Then we come to the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General, as we have seen over the years through his own statements—I mean, lets rely on his own words and conduct here—without doubt, by his own admission, would be the smartest person in the world! Theres no question about that. He would be the smartest person not just in this parliament and not just across the country—listen to him: he is the most learned person in this place and, in fact, across the world! When you go through his listings, theyve been very successful. Congratulations! Thats a wonderful thing and to be celebrated. And he has properly disclosed them, as he points out. It is inconceivable, given the Attorney-Generals background; given his knowledge of the industry; given his connections, particularly to companies that are involved in the litigation process and that fund litigations; and given his network across Melbourne, across members of the bar, across the legal fraternity in New South Wales and across the country. Hes been Attorney-General; hes occupied that office before.Despite his significant investment in a company that he knows a great deal of detail about, hes telling this House that, somehow, hes surprised by the revelations which we have laid out. The connection cant be any clearer. I havent got before me the exact figures of the shareholding that the Attorney-General has declared, but let me put it in simple terms: the shareholding owned by the Attorney-General has effectively doubled in value since the Labor Party came to power. Is that directed to decisions being made by the Attorney-General? Well, Ill let people draw their own conclusions. But what I do know is that, when the Attorney-General made a decision, and when that decision was announced, made in his capacity as Attorney-General with a direct impact on the company involved, the company listed and provided advice to the Australian Stock Exchange, as is their obligation. They were very, very happy with the decision made. As it turns out, so too were the shareholders.Does this result in any consequence under the Prime Minister, who is saying to the Australian public that he is leading a new way, that hes coming in here for a kinder, gentler, friendlier parliament, where transparency will reign? Is there any consequence for the Attorney-General? With all the knowledge he possesses, with his superior intellect, with his capacity above any other human being, has this detail escaped him up until this very moment? Is that a credible account of his position? Is it a credible account of his own interest, his own investments? Ill let people draw their own conclusions. There are many on the other side of this chamber who I know hold a very similar view to ours in relation to this Attorney-General.It doesnt pass the pub test. It doesnt pass any test whatsoever, and its incumbent on this Prime Minister to uphold his standards. If he were to do that, he would demand that this Attorney-General dispose of his interests, exhaust the conflict of interest which is clear to all to see and uphold the high standard that he has claimed to the Australian public he adheres to. So far, not only has the Attorney-General failed this test; two other ministers, that we know of, have equally failed the test, and there may be more.We havent come to our favourite friend, the member for Maribyrnong. We may do. I think the Prime Minister will probably deal with him in the next reshuffle. Lets see what the Prime Minister has in store for him. You are his favourite, Bill, I know that much.

190,0,0,0,1,1,"Leeser, Julian MP",109556,"Berowra","LP","N/A",1254," I second the motion. Labor has no integrity on integrity. Ministers have breached the ministerial code left, right and centre. Three ministers are selling shares at a rate that would make Gordon Gekko proud! This is from a government that spent nine years on this side of the House lecturing us on integrity. Every question time they lectured us on integrity.The new Prime Minister promised that there would be a new era of government, a new era of integrity, a new era of transparency, and what did he show us? He produced a ministerial code that, in just over 100 days, has been breached by three ministers, whove had to sell their shares. The Minister for Regional Development, Local Government and Territories has admitted to breaching the code. The Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care has invested in shares in areas that are regulated by her portfolio. And today we have revelations that the Attorney-Generals superannuation fund invests in funds that invest in a prominent litigation fund that is benefiting from a decision of this government, a Friday afternoon special decision of this government, made to appease and support one of the Labor Partys big donors.The Labor Party have three big donors: big unions, big super and big class-action funders. They have made their first priorities in government to do things to benefit these three organisations, whether it be the nobbling of the ABCC, whether it be the changes to make superannuation funds less transparent or whether it be to make litigation funds less transparent and less of benefit to those people who are the victims, who brought these actions forward in the first place. Labor has no integrity on integrity.Lets hear what the Prime Minister has been saying about the importance of his code. He said:As Prime Minister, I expect my Ministers to demonstrate that they are complying with these high standards of conduct, and in doing so, living up to the expectations of the Australian public.On the day his code was released, the Prime Minister told Sunrise: I want politics to be cleaned up. Weve got strict adherence to the code of conduct. But whats the Prime Minister actually done? What have we seen? Weve seen three ministers breach this code of conduct in just over 100 days. This is the transparent Labor Party! This is the new politics that the Labor Party promised they would deliver when they came to government. That was only two months ago, and what have we seen? You can breach the code with impunity. There is absolutely no consequence for breaching this code. And what happens when you get caught? The Prime Minister will look after you. The Labor Party will look after you. Theres no real standard that any minister is being held to at all. With the Minister for Regional Development, Local Government and Territories, we found out they dont even have to read the code. The code is there and it can be breached with absolute impunity again and again.Thats why the motion that the Leader of the Opposition has moved is so important. Its why it deserves to be debated properly in this House. It deserves to be debated because you cannot have the situation where a ministerial code has been put forward by a new Prime Minister who has promised new transparency in government and who, instead, has demonstrated that there isnt any real transparency because there is no consequence for breaching his ministerial code, a code that is designed to lift transparency.Mr Speaker, you have the Attorney-General here talking about the code and the fact there were several elements to the code that were worth looking at. Its worth looking at paragraph 3.11 again, and it says:In recognition of the collective responsibility that Ministers bear in relation to Cabinet decisions, this Code requires that Ministers divest themselves of investments and other interests in any public or private company or business, other than public superannuation funds or publicly listed managed funds or trust arrangements where:(i) the investments are broadly diversified and the Minister has no influence over investment decisions of the fund or trust; and—and this is the important bit—(ii) the fund or trust does not invest to any significant extent in a business sector that could give rise to a conflict of interest with the Ministers public duty.What did we see here? We saw a minister with a serious conflict of interest investing in a fund that benefited from a decision that had been made by this new government. Mr Speaker, this motion deserves to be supported, and we should have the full motion brought forward.

What they are going for here is on the concept: Well, the big thing we need to have happen is to seek advice from the Secretary to PM&C. Remember the Gaetjens reports? Remember how many times we were told by those opposite, the answer to every question: Phil Gaetjens is looking into it. I remember hearing about the Gaetjens reports. I dont remember seeing the Gaetjens reports. I dont remember a single one of those reports ever seeing the light of day.But it wasnt only on shares that those opposite had issues of integrity. Remember when respected Speaker Tony Smith was in that chair and was asked about a former Leader of the House who had set up a trust fund, and the impact of that trust fund to pay for his personal expenses, his personal bills, was being used on the declaration. All the questions they have asked this week have been based on going through the declaration, where ministers have been transparent. Thats where all of this information has come from—because ministers have been transparent.What did the former Leader of the Houses declaration tell you? There was a trust fund and you werent allowed to know where the money was coming from. That was referred to the privileges committee in a reference that was made, and then the Speaker had to consider whether or not it would be given precedence to even be looked at. For as long as I have been here and for as long as the Prime Minister has been here, when precedence is given the House then votes in favour of it. But, breaking that precedent, in a complete cover-up to forever conceal the financial interests of one of their own, they came in here to vote that reference down.And who do you think was the Leader of the House who called the division? Who do you think was the Leader of the House who said, We should never have a right to know where the money is coming from? Who might be that person who stood right here and argued that the government would not be supporting the reference—not just that the culture of secrecy continue but that every single one of them would vote against the recommendation of the Speaker and make sure that the information was forever suppressed? Any ideas on who? I know you are all looking at your phones, but it was the now Leader of the Opposition who came in here and led the charge to make sure that the Register of Members Interests was effectively rendered meaningless by one of his own receiving money that we will never know the origin of.Compare that with an incoming government where the Prime Minister has come forward with a code of conduct that those opposite never would have dared do. If any Prime Minister from their side had dared bring in a code of conduct where you were expected to get rid of your shares, they would have knocked off the Prime Minister in seconds. Thats what they would have done, because it goes completely against the grain of how they operate. It goes completely against the grain of born to rule, born to invest, born to entitlement—","Ministerial Conduct","MOTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[9]","N/A","N/A"

They made sure that none of these principles around protecting the public interest and avoiding conflicts of interest were applied to them at all. On the occasion when one of their own was so openly flouting it that the Speaker recommended it be given precedence for the privileges committee, each and every one of them voted to shut the inquiry down. And now that the government has re-established proper standards of integrity—proper standards to avoid conflicts of interest, proper standards that make sure ministers are not caught in the sort of behaviour that those opposite were involved with—what do they do? They decide that thats their big issue.I have laughed this week when thinking about the conversations that they must have had as to who should ask about a breach of the ministerial code.

Do we have the question relevant to the motion we now have in front of us asked by the person who somehow magically uploaded fraudulent documents about the Lord Mayor of Sydney?

As Australians are aware, robodebt is probably one of the most shameful chapters in public administration in the nations history. That isnt just the view of the current government; its the view of the Federal Court and the view of hundreds of thousands of people.Just to remind those opposite, robodebt occurred on their watch. Between July of 2015 and November of 2019, over 400,000 of our fellow Australian citizens who rely on the safety net were targeted by an unlawful scheme. The scheme was called out to be unlawful almost from when the first debt notices started going out, but unfortunately the current opposition, then in government, for 4½ years ignored the pleas of those who were unlawfully targeted; ignored the decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal; ignored the advice from the Australian Taxation Office; ignored whistleblowers; ignored the current government—then the opposition—when it was raising and advocating on this issue; and ignored the legal aid commissions around Australia.It was only a class action—which Labor helped push for—that forced the government to admit the scheme was unlawful, and they only did so at the door of the court, because then the ministers and senior public servants overseeing this unlawful freight train of misery against hundreds of thousands of citizens might have had to give evidence in the class action. When faced with giving evidence, miraculously the government folded its tents, settled the claim for $1.7 billion and paid interest of $112 million. But the government has never, ever satisfactorily explained matters.So it is left to a royal commission, to be chaired by Justice Catherine Holmes. Itll report on 18 April next year, and itll get to the bottom of questions which, unfortunately, the previous government never answered—questions like: who was responsible for its design, development and establishment? What were the advice and the processes that informed its design and implementation? Were any concerns at any stage ever raised about the legality of the scheme? The royal commission will also look at concerns raised about robodebt once it was initiated. Were the risks ever identified? Was there advice from the Australian Taxation Office and documentary proof that the government ignored? Was there advice from affected individuals and other agencies? What did the then government do in response to adverse decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal?The old government, the current opposition, have said that this royal commission is unnecessary. Yet again theyre short-changing the vulnerable.

It was, I must say, a program that, in terms of scrutiny of the details that were there, in our view was not worthy of proceeding with, and which was also to receive $4 million in recurrent funding in perpetuity.The fact is that we have inherited a trillion dollars of Liberal Party debt, and therefore we have had to make some difficult decisions. The Governor-General was an advocate of this program. I make no criticism of the Governor-General whatsoever and I indeed informed the Governor-General of my governments position, as a matter of courtesy to him and as a matter of respect for him.But we will be going through, line by line, getting rid of the rorts and waste that dominated the budget and that were a part of the trillion dollars of Liberal Party debt.

Mr Abe was instrumental in elevating Australias relationship with Japan to a special strategic partnership and did more than anyone to advocate for a free and open Indo-Pacific. He signed the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement, creating new opportunities for Australian businesses in Japan and, of course, was a tireless champion of the Quad.I believe that the attendance at Mr Abes state funeral not just by me as the sitting Prime Minister of Australia but by three former prime ministers will send a very strong message to the government of Japan but, most importantly, to the people of Japan about how respected Mr Abe was by Australia and about the friendship that is there.

The consequences, we know, will be more violence in remote communities, more drunkenness in remote communities, more drugs in remote communities and more neglected children in remote communities. We know that will be the outcome of this decision, and this minister and Prime Minister have completely botched this process. The only decent thing to do now is walk away from this shameful decision—a decision that will, in the words of Noel Pearson, see more children neglected.The cashless debit card operates in a number of communities—Ceduna, East Kimberley, the Goldfields in WA, Bundaberg, Hervey Bay and Cape York.

On 30 August, the so-called CDC engagement team sent to the Goldfields a raft of documents to commence the process of consultation. There was a draft engagement plan, an engagement summary, a participation checklist, a CDC fact sheet, all very bureaucratic. That was the consultation that started on the 30 August, and they were given until midday on 2 September to come back, from 30 August to 2 September. This hapless minister, whos engaging in meaningful consultation, has given these communities less than three days to come back on an issue that is going to see devastation hitting their communities.The minister opposite might not like the quotes that are about to come up, but these are quotes from the communities that will have the CDC ripped out of them. Ian Trust from the Wunan Foundation said:It reduced the alcohol violence and the harassment of the elderly and vulnerable for cash when they used to go to the ATM … The government says if we want to go down that path of keeping income management that it has to be a community decision, but theres no information about how they want us to arrive at that decision or what the replacement could be.Tammy Williams from the Family Responsibilities Commission said:We are looking at going back to a card that doesnt match the technology of the CDC, and people will have limited access to their money, wont be able to utilise online shopping or travel outside their communities.But its even worse; the government is not even proposing anything viable in the place of the CDC, hence why there are so many fears about what is going to come.Mayor Perry Will from the District Council of Ceduna said: The first we heard of it was in the PMs election promises that he was going to do it.

276,0,0,0,1,1,"Rishworth, Amanda Louise MP","HWA","Kingston","ALP","N/A",1262," We have heard a lot of rhetoric from this minister. There is so much rhetoric from this minister, but no evidence whatsoever—sorry, shadow minister; I shouldnt have promoted him. Weve heard so much rhetoric about crime, so much rhetoric, but with no evidence whatsoever.One of the things that the shadow minister talks about a lot is crime and the crime statistics—he hasnt been able to provide any of them. But Ill give them to you. In fact, domestic violence offences as a subset of assault offences increased by 57 per cent between 2014 and 2019 in Ceduna and surrounds. In Alice Springs, between 2012 and 2020, we saw assaults involving DV increase as well. What weve seen, for participants in areas where the CDC has been, is no change whatsoever or, in fact, things getting worse when it comes to crime.This shadow minister has constantly ignored the evidence—and weve listened to him a lot. He talked about Noel Pearson. I met with Noel Pearson and I had a very productive conversation with Noel Pearson. But the shadow minister misrepresents Noel Pearson, because one of the things that the shadow minister suggests is that the blanket application of the CDC to anyone on an income support payment is supported by Noel Pearson. But, in fact, Noel Pearson has said he doesnt agree with the blanket imposition of the card. He doesnt actually agree with the blanket imposition of the card. Ian Trust from the Wunan Foundation, who the shadow minister mentioned earlier, said about the card:It lost its effectiveness as people worked out ways of getting around it: doing other peoples shopping, buying people fuel and so on. That was always probably going to be the case.So you have Ian Trust saying that the card is not really effective anymore. Ms PC Clarke from the Central Australian Aboriginal Family Legal Unit said:CAAFLU supports the repeal of the cashless debit card. This bill is a step in the right direction …Christine Donaldson said she was forced onto the CDC just because of where she lived. She said:I am an elder … in the Goldfields region of Western Australia and I fully support the amendment bill and agree that the card needs to be abolished.Then there was Antoinette Braybrook from Far North Queensland, the co-chair of Change the Record. She said:We agree with the governments conclusion that the cashless debit card is not evidence based, is ineffective and is discriminatory.Beverly Walley from East Kimberley said:… the cashless debit card has deteriorated quite a lot of life … There had always been parents drinking, drugs and gambling prior to the cashless card being enforced in 2015-16. Having said that, there is no change. Everything is still the same.These are some of the people living in these communities. I would challenge the shadow minister: has he actually visited any of these communities; has he actually travelled to any of these communities? Because I have been up to the East Kimberley and met with organisations. I have been into Far North Queensland, as has the assistant minister. Ive been to Ceduna and spoken to these communities. I have travelled through the Northern Territory, speaking to the women in the town camps, speaking to the women in the refuges in Kununurra. I would challenge the shadow minister to go out there, because he actually might learn a couple of lessons. He might actually go and speak to the people who have been affected.When I heard from the people who had been affected, I heard that it had been shameful for them and it had ruined their lives. Many have said—these are the lived experiences of people—that they are embarrassed because they dont have enough cash to go to the school fete or they dont have enough cash to go and watch their country football. People are embarrassed, frustrated and shamed by this. One of the absolute furphies that those on the other side propagate is that everyone on the card has a drug and alcohol problem and, therefore, the government has to tell them how to live their lives. I met so many people, including carers and people on a disability support pension, who said they had never touched a drop of alcohol in their lives and they didnt understand why they were being punished.I do want to get to the evidence, because the opposition has been full of rhetoric and no evidence whatsoever. And the evidence speaks for itself. Not only did we have two ANAO reports that said that this card was not delivering on the outcomes it had promised; we also had the University of Adelaide report in January 2021, which found that the evidence to support the CDC was inconclusive. The study found that any reduction of alcohol and drug use could not be attributed to the effect of the card. Also in that report—this is evidence that the opposition always ignores—it was reported:… the CDC was reported to introduce widely felt and costly hurdles to many participants in relation to financial planning and money management …… … …A large proportion of CDC participant survey respondents reported that their quality of life had been affected …Another study, by the University of South Australia and Monash University, found that the CDC in Ceduna had no substantive impact on gambling and drug and alcohol abuse and no substantive impact on crime or emergency department presentations. And in June 2022, as I said, the ANAO released its latest audit, which was damning.I would, finally, go to the point when the shadow minister was banging on his chest and talking about a lack of preparation from this side of the House. Let me remind the House of a couple of things. First, the cashless debit card legislation is due to expire on 31 December, and there have been no moves by the former government to put together any legislation to actually extend it. Second, there needed to be a tender process, because the contract was running out for the supply of the cashless debit card. Do you think the former government made any moves to ensure that there would be a smooth tender arrangement? Of course they did not. They made no moves to actually recognise that the tender was ending on the 31st.In addition to that, we hear a lot about the support services. Ive been very, very interested in the support services, because I know a lot of communities really value the support services and have recognised that, while the card hasnt done a lot, the support services have made a difference. Do you think that the former government put any money in the March budget for services past 1 July 2023? Do you think they gave any certainty to these communities that they could continue to rely on these support services? No. How much money was in the budget after 1 July 2023? Zero. So to have the opposition come and talk about abandoning communities, about leaving them behind and about not supporting them is absolutely appalling, because they did not put the provisions in to support those who actually needed those services. They can come in here and cry their crocodile tears, but there was no action and no preparation by the former government in terms of what would happen come 31 December.I have been consulting with communities, Ive been speaking with communities and I will continue to work with communities on the future of voluntary income management. I will continue to work with the Family Responsibilities Commission, recognising the important work they do and working to make sure that their work is not impeded. But we will not stand for communities, sometimes picked by the local member, having an imposition of a blanket card for anyone on a working-age payment. That leads to stigmatisation and significant problems when it comes to practical life decisions.This government will work with communities. We will continue to listen to them, work with them and deliver for them, unlike those opposite.","Pensions and Benefits","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms RISHWORTH (Kingston—Minister for Social Services) ","(15:35):"
277,0,0,0,1,1,"Hogan, Kevin MP",218019,"Page","NATS","N/A",1264," The bottom line of this legislation going through parliament, both in this House and in the Senate if it does next week, is that this government did it in a rush. It was one of the first pieces of legislation they put through this parliament. In fact, they moved an urgency motion to rush it through. This legislation passing will mean that this Labor government are going to place women and children in dangerous situations. Theyre going to place women and children, who currently are in a safer position, in a very dangerous, vulnerable situation.The communities where the cashless debit card is were chosen very purposely. It wasnt done randomly. They were in remote communities and predominantly in remote communities that had a higher level of domestic violence and other forms of views than the rest of the communities around the country. Now, that is sad. That is a very sad and very dangerous situation. Were talking about communities where children have sexually transmitted diseases. We are talking about communities where the presentation to hospital of domestic violence, school absenteeism and the worst type of abuse you could inflict on women and children were higher than the average around the country. They were chosen very purposefully. This wasnt picking on people. This was going to communities where statistics said that women and children were in trouble, that it was dangerous to be in those communities, especially on certain nights, when the welfare money arrived. It was dangerous. These communities—and I have been to them. I grew up not that far from Ceduna. I know Ceduna very well, amongst some of the other communities. And what would happen on those nights when it was particularly dangerous, when a large part of the population was drunk, was that children would roam the streets at night because that was the safest place for them to be. It wasnt safe to be in their homes. It wasnt safe to be inside. They would roam with friends because that was the safest place for them to be.What is this outrageous stigmatisation that the government go on about? They get a card and they can spend 80 per cent of it on essentials. They spend it on food, they spend it on clothing, they spend it on the essentials of life and they have 20 per cent left over to spend on things that you would need to spend cash on. In an ideal world, of course you wouldnt want to do that, but it was done not to pick out victims but to protect victims. It was done to protect children who were getting sexually transmitted diseases. It was done to protect women and children from going to hospital. Thats why it was done.So, when this is done, when this legislation goes through and the violence goes back into those communities, shame on all of you! This ideological thing—Oh, were stigmatising people. What a stigmatisation it is to give someone a card! How terrible that they had a card that they went to a supermarket and bought food and essential items with. What a stigmatisation that is! I dont understand the fact that in the first two weeks of the parliament they had to rush this through. When the violence starts increasing, when the hospital presentations start to pick up again, when the children are starting to get sexually transmitted diseases again, shame on all of you! Shame on all of you because of this ideological obsession that you cant give them a card and the terrible things that that was doing to them.The minister said, Well, talk to people. I have, and Ive also spoken to my Senate colleague Jacinta Price, who lives in Alice Springs. So shes not qualified to comment? Is that what youre saying, Assistant Minister—that shes not qualified to comment? She has said the same thing. We can talk about a lot of virtue signalling and we can talk about a lot of symbolism, but what this government has done—if we want to talk about closing the gap, which is a very important thing to do—in passing this legislation means that the gap isnt going to get smaller. Youve just widened the gap, and youve widened the gap especially in the communities where this is going to be lifted. So thank you for nothing there.Again, when the shadow minister got up—and I wont go through some of the quotes that I have here—he said that a lot of the elders in these communities are very disappointed about this and a lot of the leaders in these communities are very disappointed about this, because it had made a positive difference. I know that it made Ceduna a safer place to be during the daytime. It meant that tourism was back and it was significantly different; you could feel the difference.

284,0,0,0,1,1,"MemberContinuation","DZW","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Mrs ELLIOT: Thats why theyre in here today! The fact is that the cashless debit card is privatised welfare, and there is something deeply, deeply wrong when private for-profit companies control peoples income support payments and determine where they can actually spend their money. It wasnt a government department; a private company did it. What happened when people contacted them and said: I cant access a lot of goods. Theres no money in my account and asked what was going on? They got no help and they got no support, because its a private company. If you had any problems with the card, nobody was interested, nobody would listen to you.We know that the former government spent more than $170 million on the cashless debit card program, money that would have been better used for support services in those vulnerable communities. We also have a lot of evidence that it just didnt work. We know that. In fact, the Australian National Audit Office just recently released its latest audit on the performance of the card, highlighting once more the lack of evidence. But we also know because of the extensive consultation weve done with communities. Both the social services minister and I have consulted widely with the impacted communities. I have been in Bundaberg and Hervey Bay and spoken with many people there about how theyve been impacted. That includes community members, participants and service providers. I was in Cape York as well and listened firsthand to their community and what they want to see moving forward in terms of income management. We went to Western Australia, speaking with many participants and local councils, particularly many individuals whose lives have been devastated by being on this card.But, as I said, the reason those opposite were so angry before is that they did want to roll it out right across the country. We know that was their agenda: to put more recipients on the card. The fact is that it has devastated so many lives. So many people Ive spoken to have had their lives impacted: the card was very restrictive, it was often declined and people couldnt buy basic food or groceries. People couldnt pay their rent, they couldnt make car repayments and they couldnt buy second-hand clothes. Its had a devastating impact on individuals because it stripped away their dignity and they have felt so stigmatised by it. In fact, I was handed a number of notes at the many consultations that weve had, with people saying, I cant pay my rent because my landlord takes cash, and its really embarrassing. They cant pay their rent. They cant pay for things that require a BSB payment and theyre judged everywhere they go. Also, they cant speak to anyone when they have a problem.But we are approaching abolishing the cashless debit card in a responsible way, to ensure that communities and individuals are in a properly supported transition off the card. We will keep consulting with them, particularly in relation to the issue of voluntary income management as well. We have listened to people, we have listened to First Nations community leaders, we have listened to service providers and, really importantly, we have listened to participants.The fact is that privatised welfare does not work. No matter how much those opposite keep pushing it, it does not work at all. Nothing highlights that more than the absolute disaster of the cashless debit card. It brought lots of very vulnerable people a huge amount of shame. They were stigmatised everywhere, and they couldnt access the basic services they needed. They felt like they were being punished and demonised. But these people opposite are still pushing the benefits of it, despite the thousands of lives that they ruined because of it. Do you know why? Its because they are so obsessed with privatised welfare and they are so annoyed that we stopped them rolling it out across the country so they could stigmatise and ruin more lives of vulnerable people. We are abolishing it.","Pensions and Benefits","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[9]","N/A","N/A"

288,0,0,0,1,1,"Ramsey, Rowan Eric MP","HWS","Grey","LP","N/A",1266," The first community that adopted the cashless debit card was in my electorate, in Ceduna, and I refute many of the allegations that the assistant minister just made, including that the community was not consulted. It is absurd. It was the community of Ceduna that set the 80-20 split. We have a far west Indigenous leaders group there. They met every two weeks during the implementation and rollout of this program. Allegations were made by the minister that people say they cant go to the football and use their card. That is incorrect. It can be used for school lunches. It can be used at the football gate. It can be used inside the club rooms at the football. It cant be used to buy alcohol while youre at the football, though, Im afraid. That is what it is designed for.Its worth reflecting that this card was brought in in the aftermath of the state coroners report in South Australia following six deaths in Ceduna over less than a decade related to alcohol abuse. There was another one while the commissioner was inquiring. We have not had any such deaths—touch wood—in the period since the card was introduced.I absolutely refute the allegation that the people of Ceduna do not support the card. They know full well that I am in favour of the card, and they keep supporting me. People can check the ballot figures in Ceduna if they wish. So it is with a heavy heart I see the fact that the government is intent on taking this ideological step. I am absolutely convinced we will see a lift in violence, a lift in antisocial behaviour such as drunkenness and quite likely some untimely deaths. I have told the minister quietly—and I thank her for coming out to Ceduna, but she came with the decision already made—that, however you cut this up, she and the government will be held responsible for the outcomes.I noted a couple of the submissions to the Senate inquiry as it went around, and Ill refer particularly to Allan Suters contribution. He went through that period in which the Ceduna community set the 80-20 split. Not only did they set the 80-20 split; they embedded in the design of the card that people could be reduced to a 60-40 split if they liked and met certain criteria. He is of this opinion: It was a clear demonstration of how the removal of the cashless debit card in Ceduna will damage our community. I would encourage some to do some homework about the time during the pandemic when support payments were made outside the cashless debit card system. Our community experienced severe disruptions, including drunken rioting, family violence and major social disruption due to substance abuse. When these extra payments stopped, so did the trouble. He went on to say: Unfortunately, most Ceduna residents fear that removal of the cashless debit card will turn back the clock to where we were prior to 2008. When this happens, the opponents of the cashless debit card and the Australian government will be totally responsible for the resulting increases in family violence, public intoxication and, potentially, more deaths such as those covered by the 2008 coronial inquiry. I thought perhaps the Senate committee, when they were inquiring into this, may have listened to Noel Pearson when he told the meeting: Labors decision to outlaw the cashless debit card nationwide would ruin two decades of progress and reforms in Cape York.Thats because the card there has replaced the BasicsCard, and the BasicsCard was a very clunky type of system; whereas the cashless debit card is pretty seamless. I dont carry one in my pocket, but the member for OConnor does, and you cannot check it visibly, from any kind of distance, to see that it is anything but a normal card.So I am very concerned about what is happening in my community of Ceduna. Its a community that has come so far in the last decade that its barely recognisable from what it was. And when you compare it to similar communities around Australia— (Time expired)","Pensions and Benefits","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr RAMSEY (Grey—Opposition Whip) ","(15:55):"

They took this policy to the Australian people, a policy that included not one but two key targets. The first target was a 43 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030. The second target was a reduction in household power bills of $275. It was based on this climate policy that the new government came to power, looking the Australian people in the eye and promising them that they would not only reduce emissions more than the former coalition government but also reduce power prices more than the coalition government—the coalition government, by the way, that achieved an extraordinary performance on both counts; a coalition government that saw emissions reduce by over 20 per cent on 2005 levels and a coalition that ensured that power prices came down by 10 per cent over the last term of government, with power prices coming down for both households and businesses. But the Labor Party went to the Australian people and they said to them, We can do better. Not only did they promise to get emissions down further; they also promised that prices would come down further.But, as we are here today, with the Labor Party celebrating the Greens-Labor legislation, the Albanese-Bandt governments legislation, we have households throughout this country who are opening up their power bills, and what do they see? Higher prices—prices that are going through the roof. There are probably business owners, people who have invested their own money into their businesses, listening to this very debate and hearing the celebrations of the Labor Party, despite having been told that their power prices would be reduced—but their power prices are going up. We are talking to businesses today that might have to close their doors because of the power prices. And this Labor government have no solutions—none whatsoever. The only thing they bring into the House by way of this legislation today is the claim of 43 per cent—something they had already advised the United Nations on. We had the minister himself standing up—he had gone public before showing this bill to the House—and saying that the bill was not necessary, and yet in it comes.We saw over the last month, through the Senate inquiry, the very concerns that we had raised in this House being confirmed. The department, under the minister, had done no work on modelling the impact of this bill, especially on rural and regional communities.

Well, they had nine years to get this right—nine years to do some modelling. They had nine years, therefore, for the department to have something.They claim theyve done modelling. Guess what modelling they have done? Its modelling that says power prices will come down by $275. Why is it that over the last couple of months neither the Prime Minister nor the minister have been able to stand at this dispatch box and confirm that $275 is coming off household bills? Why? Because they did not look the Australian people in the eye and tell them the truth of what their plan was. So, as power bills go up, it is on them. As businesses close, it is on them. We know the truth. This 43 per cent legislation was unnecessary. Theyre the words of the minister, and he will live by that.

This is an important step, and its very important for the Australian people not to be caught up in the political games and the rhetoric that exists in this place.The reason why we have an energy crisis and rising energy costs is that for too long we have denied what needs to happen. We have failed—the coalition failed for too long—to implement policies to ensure that we are at the forefront of the energy transition. Lets be really clear: the cost-of-living pressures are directly impacted by global warming and climate change. Insurance premiums are escalating and rising rapidly. We need to address that. That has a direct impact on households and their cost of living. Food supplies are all directly impacted by climate change and global warming events. The only way we will have domestic fuel security is if we electrify transport as rapidly as possible, and that requires electrification and transitioning to renewable energy as fast as possible.I welcome the message from the Senate and the bill as amended. I want to thank the Australian communities that have asked both sides of politics since 2019 to legislate Australias commitment to net zero by 2050. They got behind the climate bill that I presented in the last parliament, and they support this bill, because we need that certainty of legislating net zero by 2050.The Minister for Climate Change and Energy is well aware of my position—that I want to see greater ambition—but I recognise that this is a start. It is a good start, but we need to make sure we increase that ambition and accelerate that emissions reduction as soon as possible. We are on track to exceed two degrees of warming. This reduction is not enough. If were going to be consistent with the Paris Agreement, we need to ensure we reduce emissions at a greater rate. We have the technology. The Australian people want to see it happen. You need to be brave and embrace the opportunity. That does mean not approving more fossil fuel projects, and that is something that I look forward to having more discussions about, but, for today, this is an important day. Lets be really clear: this does provide policy certainty for businesses and for investment—to know that Australia is committed to reducing emissions, being in step with the rest of the world and embracing a net zero world.","Climate Change Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms STEGGALL (Warringah) ","(16:11):"

302,0,0,0,1,1,"Byrnes, Alison MP",299145,"Cunningham","ALP","N/A",1271," This afternoon Im going to talk about a wonderful little girl and her family who I had the great pleasure of meeting last week and again today in the parliament. Last Wednesday had been a relatively quiet day in my office—I had been working on my first speech and I had met with a few constituents—and then in came Harper Rollinson in her pink tulle skirt, black-and-gold shiny top and pink sandshoes, and my afternoon changed completely. What a whirlwind personality! I didnt even get the chance to introduce myself to her mum, Katie; her dad, Luke; her brother, Eli; and Sara from the Shepherd Centre.Harper, at seven years old, came in to see me to get some tips for her speech to the Power of Speech Breakfast, which she gave here today at Parliament House. It was a week of first speeches in Parliament House for both of us. I gave her some tips on continuing your speech even if your brother is being a little bit annoying, and Harper told me that speeches in the parliament need more love hearts and butterflies. My followers on Facebook agree with Harper—this place does need more love hearts and butterflies.Im going to outline some of Harpers speech to you here today. When Harpers mum, Katie, was pregnant doctors discovered that she had the same eye cancer as her dad, Luke, and her brother, Eli. Harper was born early and when she was just 12 days old she had chemotherapy to save her eyesight. As a consequence she lost her hair and she lost her hearing. Her hair grew back but her hearing didnt.She got hearing aids when she was nearly two and cochlear implants—or her super ears, as she calls them—when she was three. Kate from the Shepherd Centre started speech therapy with Harper and also visited her school, St Josephs at Bulli, to show Harpers teachers how to use her devices so that she can still hear the teacher when the classroom gets noisy.The Shepherd Centre do some amazing work, helping children with hearing loss and their families. They provide early intervention services for children and toddlers, speech pathology services, social skills and resilience training for young children to develop confidence, as well as preschools that help educate children with and without hearing loss—one of which is in my electorate. They provide many other services too. I am really grateful for the work that they do.Harper dances. She swims. She does gymnastics. Im a little bit jealous that she is able to listen to music while she is swimming, because thats pretty cool. Harper showed me some of her gymnastics—the splits and a backward walkover—but her mum and I had to be the fun police and talk her down from handstands and cartwheels in my very small meeting room.Today Harper delivered her speech in front of the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for the NDIS. She spoke with confidence and bravery. Having recently delivered my own first speech, I understand all too well the pressure that comes with big speeches, particularly in this house. But Harper rose to the occasion and she did herself and our community proud. The event was First Voice and Cochlears Power of Speech Breakfast. It was aimed at challenging common ideas around what deaf children can and cannot achieve. It was an honour to attend and to be able to listen to the lovely speakers tell their stories. As the Minister for the NDIS, the Hon. Bill Shorten, shared at todays event, seeing a baby have their cochlear implant switched on for the very first time is nothing short of a scientific miracle. These devices change lives.Harper was one of seven children from Australia and New Zealand with cochlear implants who were invited to speak. Harper was a ball of energy and an absolute inspiration. I know how proud Katie, Luke and Eli must be after seeing Harper speak today.Harper also has a friend, Alana, who lives in England near the Queen. They chat on Zoom about their super ears. Harper loves being able to talk to someone on the other side of the world who also has super ears. Apparently Alana is a little bit scared of coming to Australia, though, because of our spiders.Im very pleased to be able to stand here today and share Harpers story. She is a young girl who has faced so many challenges but who has risen to face them again and again. She runs headfirst into her experiences with an optimism and enthusiasm that is absolutely contagious. Harper has a bright future ahead of her and I thank her so much for bringing more love hearts and butterflies to my office—all the way from Wollongong to Parliament House. I also thank the Shepherd Centre for the work that they do to help children like Harper. Im so pleased that Harper and I were able to do our very first speeches in Parliament House in the same week.","Rollinson, Harper","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1[1]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms BYRNES (Cunningham) ","(16:29):"
303,0,0,0,1,1,"Pearce, Gavin MP",282306,"Braddon","LP","N/A",1272," Suicide Prevention Australias report State of the nation in suicide prevention was released on Tuesday. The report revealed that an unprecedented 70 per cent of Australians are experiencing elevated stress beyond their normal levels compared to this time last year. A conclusion was that two of the greatest stressors were the cost-of-living challenges and personal debt. This is alarming, and so was the report.We all know that in the last few years it has been incredibly tough right across the nation. We have been challenged like never before. The toll has been great; there is no denying that. Its important to note also that these challenges arent new. Theyve been at the forefront of governments thinking since the pandemic hit back in 2020. Its something the former coalition government managed day in, day out for 2½ long years. In that time, our government was able to respond quickly to every challenge thrown at us. We found a way to provide support when it was needed and where it was needed. We targeted the cost-of-living measures that helped ease pressures on household budgets at the time they needed it most. We reduced taxes so that hardworking Australians kept more of their hard-earned money. We cut the fuel excise, which instantly reduced cost-of-living pressures. We looked after our most vulnerable by delivering a $250 cost-of-living payment to nearly six million pensioners, welfare recipients, veterans and eligible concession card holders. This was at the top of our landmark JobKeeper, JobSeeker and other pandemic measures that were universally applauded right across the nation. People still stop me in the street today and thank me for being a part of the government who saved their business and kept a roof over their head.In May this year the nation put their trust in the Labor government, whose promise was to tackle, as they put it, spiralling costs of living and a crisis. Australians are still waiting for the Albanese government to keep that promise. On Tuesday, on the back of Suicide Prevention Australias State of the nation report, a reporter asked the Prime Minister what the Albanese government was doing in the immediate term to help people get through this cost-of-living crisis. For those who missed it, I can update the House that the Prime Minister made four claims. One claim was that his government was responsible for the recent increase in the pension. This is not the truth. The truth is the Department of Social Services regularly reviews the rate of the pension and other welfare payments. This increase was simply a result of that twice-yearly review, and had nothing to do with the Albanese government.The next claim was that the Albanese government was responsible for the recent increase in the minimum wage. Again, this isnt the truth. The truth is the minimum wage is determined by the Fair Work Commission, an independent and separate-from-government organisation. Their submission was one of many, and I would say they have no more right to claim ownership of the rise in the minimum wage than any other stakeholder.Finally, the Prime Minister claimed their commitment to cut the costs of medicine and child care will reduce the current cost-of-living pressures ordinary Australians are facing right now. This cant be true. The legislation has not even been introduced into the parliament. If both pieces of legislation pass, the Albanese government has said cheaper medicines will not be available until January next year and cheaper child care until July next year. Therefore, on behalf of the journalist whose question was left unanswered, on behalf of everyone living across the North West, the West Coast and King Island in the great state of Tasmania, and on behalf of all Australians, I ask the Prime Minister: what is your government doing right now to help those struggling through this cost-of-living crisis?","Cost of Living","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr PEARCE (Braddon) ","(16:34):"
304,0,0,0,1,1,"Lim, Sam MP",300130,"Tangney","ALP","N/A",1273," Australias future is built upon shared values and the colourful diversity of its many citizens and guests, and their many stories. But I may suggest that the very cornerstone of Australian democracy and the greatest test of other democracies is the provision, accessibility and use of social infrastructure. Its not difficult to find things that divide us: the way we walk, the way we talk, where we came from and where we live, whether we store our Vegemite in the pantry or our shoes at the front door. If we look past our noses, we will find many differences between us, so where in our society do we find places that can bring everyone together? There is social infrastructure, our shared space—our parks and their barbecues, green spaces, schools and childcare centres, places of worship, markets, countless beautiful beaches and wonderful rivers—but none of these are more glorious than our libraries.I love the library. What other place can people leaving prison go to access a computer to find a job? When a new family arrives in Australia and cant speak English, where else do they know to go to learn? When you are studying for an exam to build a better future for yourself or print your CV for a job application—or maybe you are looking for an opportunity to find out about activity in your community and how to be involved—you have the library. Libraries provide so many functions, and they are tailored to fit the needs of their own communities. Whether people want to start a business, wish to research or are a new mother who feels isolated and wishes to meet other mums to share their many difficulties and also their many joys and triumphs, the library is there to support the community.The library is the intersection of communities and a meeting place for people looking for a better life. It is a joy to know that the people in the community in Tangney are so well serviced by so many libraries, staffed with very wonderful librarians. Be it in Willagee or Willetton, Bull Creek or Riverton, there is a library for you. My constituents can also visit AH Bracks, Civic Square, Geoffrey Bolton and Canning Bridge Express libraries. My community is only made stronger through their contribution and assistance. I must thank them for the work they do and the role they play in our community.Libraries provide a vital service. By design, libraries are dynamic and create resilient communities, because libraries are not about books; they are about people. Libraries do not discriminate between old or young, rich or poor, citizen or guest, black or white, purple or pink; all are made welcome. Our libraries are best when they are supported to do their jobs. The last government did not support librarians well enough to retain their jobs and keep food on the table when libraries were closed, particularly when our libraries across Australia contributed resources for public health awareness and support activities. The libraries in my electorate had support activities in response to the pandemic. I look forward to having a library membership with all the libraries in my electorate. Of course, I must thank the Parliamentary Library here in Canberra for assisting even with this speech and with the work of my office.Where else can the public get these institutions, sometimes with high ceilings and beautiful windows and other times small and close to home, places where the public is welcomed warmly and given opportunity to leave with so much more than they entered with? Andrew Carnegie had a phrase he used to describe libraries. They are palaces for the people. Palaces for the People is also the title of a fantastic book, which you will be pleased to know you can borrow for free from your local library.","Libraries","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1[3]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr LIM (Tangney) ","(16:39):"
305,0,0,0,1,1,"Price, Melissa Lee MP",249308,"Durack","LP","N/A",1274," In 2022 it is inexplicable that any town in our nation could be likened to that of a war zone, yet early last month reports from the beautiful town of Carnarvon in my electorate of Durack said otherwise. In a letter addressed to Premier Mark McGowan, shire president Eddie Smith said some parts of the town looked like a war zone and at times were exactly that. It is a harrowing tale, all too familiar to those living in regional Western Australia, with stories of ongoing domestic violence, child abuse, alcohol and drug abuse, youth crime—the list goes on. You can help alleviate these problems by providing access to better services for at-risk youth and for struggling families, but community leaders in Carnarvon are saying that too many state government services are being managed from Geraldton, some 500 kilometres away.Durack is the largest electorate in Australia, spread over some 1.4 million kilometres, with over 300 towns and communities. Access to services is a constant challenge. You cannot simply travel from one suburb to the next in 10 minutes by simply jumping on a bus. This problem is not unique just to social services providers or just to Carnarvon. Councils are struggling to find chippies and other tradies. The local cafes are struggling to hire coffee-makers and chefs. Childcare centres can only staff a quarter of what the demand requires from them. If Labor, state and federal, actually took a moment to consult with the community leaders on the ground and take into consideration the unique challenges of remote and regional Australia, they would know that a lack of housing lies at the core of these workforce issues. Put simply, if you cannot house your workforce locally then what chance do regional communities in Western Australia have of attracting workers? How can they possibly grow? How can they develop?Western Australias resources sector alone—a majority of which is based in my electorate of Durack—is going to need another 40,000 workers by mid next year, according to the Chamber of Minerals and Energy of WA. When I visited the beautiful town of Tom Price, only last week, I was told that the senior high school has 12 teacher vacancies. The feedback that I got on the ground was that this was due to a lack of housing. Now, thats on the McGowan government—its their responsibility to get the teachers and to house them.In WA, there are close to 19,000 people currently on a waiting list for social housing, and, of those 19,000, over 3,400 call Durack home. These are not just people struggling with homelessness but also other very vulnerable people in our community, like victims of domestic violence.Im sure that Premier Mark McGowan and the housing and lands minister, John Carey, are aware of the housing crisis thats hurting communities in my electorate. But they are not behaving like it is a crisis. Local families and businesses are suffering. So I ask: Where is the outrage? Where is the sense of urgency? Where is the action?I understand that close to 2,000 social houses across the state of Western Australia are empty and are in need of repairs. This is shameful, while Labor are trying to build new houses in an incredibly over-inflated market with blowing-out building costs. We know the story about how hard it is to get a house built. They need to focus on fixing up the stock of houses that they currently have in their control.Of course the state government is not the only provider of houses. We know that businesses, especially the mining industry in Durack, are owners of housing stock, as are private individuals and local councils. But, for such a wealthy state, you would think that putting a roof over the heads of vulnerable Western Australians and of our key service providers in regional WA, like our nurses and our police, would be a priority for the McGowan government. But it doesnt appear to be.Yalgoo in my electorate has over 200 residents. The residents of that town need and deserve services, just as you and I do. They are struggling to find professionals to deliver these services, because they have nowhere to house them. When I visited Yalgoo recently—and my word, the wildflowers were wild!—I learnt of a contracted nurse who had been forced to live in housing provided by the local council because the health department housing provided to her was unsafe. We need action. This is shameful. McGowan needs to act.","Durack Electorate: Government Services","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1[4]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms PRICE (Durack—Opposition Whip) ","(16:44):"
306,0,0,0,1,1,"Garland, Carina MP",295588,"Chisholm","ALP","N/A",1274," Yesterday, on 7 September, I had the great pleasure of meeting with members from the Micah Women Leaders delegation. I met with Edwina, Rachel, Sylvia and Tracy, who were part of a much larger delegation of senior women leaders from Australian Christian churches who were meeting with over 45 MPs—I was just one—from all sides of politics to discuss their Help Fight Famine campaign. It was a really enlightening meeting. I found out that currently we have 828 million people in the world experiencing hunger, and that is a shocking figure. In the work the Micah Women Leaders delegation have done theyve been able to advocate for the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world. This is the fourth annual delegation that the leadership group has undertaken, and it included 40 women leaders representing over 12 different denominations advocating together, which I think is a wonderful example of collaboration.Micah Australia is a coalition of Christian international development agencies and churches, under the leadership of Reverend Tim Costello. It empowers Australian Christians to advocate on the most urgent global justice issues affecting our world today: extreme poverty and hunger, rising conflict and climate change. I think its significant that climate change legislation has gone through both Houses in this place today, because it is not just an issue that affects us here in Australia; it is a global problem. Im so glad that Australia is finally—at last—contributing to meaningful solutions for our planet.We are experiencing a combination of crises in the world at the moment. The global hunger crisis has been exacerbated due to the pandemic, climate change and the war in Ukraine. Its a perfect storm for an unprecedented hunger crisis. The number of people facing acute food insecurity in the world has soared from 135 million to 345 million. I know that this is an issue that people in my electorate of Chisholm care very strongly about. Taking action to address extreme hunger in the world is one of the top issues that I receive correspondence from my constituents about. That doesnt surprise me, because my constituents are very caring people who believe very strongly in social justice issues and the need to advocate to representatives like me to take action. Im really grateful for the fact that the community is so outspoken about these issues, because that means I can effectively represent them in this place, advocate for solutions and be accountable to the people who voted for me.The UN declared on Monday this week that in Somalia famine is at the door and will strike at any time. A significant threshold has to be crossed to have a famine declared, and it is really alarming that we are seeing that in the world at the moment, in Somalia. We know that we cant, as one nation, solve these issues in the world by ourselves, but we do need to be part of the global effort, just as weve been part of the global effort to address the crisis in Sri Lanka and to address climate change issues. I know that Australia is looked to as a leader across the world for our capacity to respond compassionately to crises like this.There are several growing hunger hotspots in 2022—in Ethiopia, Somalia, Yemen, South Sudan and Afghanistan. Of course, all of our communities here in Australia have people who have come from those countries and who have families in those countries still. It is desperately worrying for those people to see what is going on overseas, and they desperately want Australia to be a part of the solution.I was really honoured to be one of the MPs approached by the Micah Women Leaders delegation. I made a commitment that I would speak on this issue in this chamber, and I am really pleased that Ive been able to do so so soon after meeting with them. I look forward to working with the relevant ministers in our government, with the Micah Women Leaders Network and of course with my community in Chisholm to continue to advocate for solutions and to see what Australias role will be in addressing these wicked global problems that my community cares very, very deeply about—as do I.","Micah Women Leaders Network, Global Hunger","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1[5]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr GARLAND (Chisholm) ","(16:49):"

I thank them for being here and for putting aside their valuable time to travel to Canberra. They could see how we elected politicians can get caught up in this bubble. The last few days have been a bit tumultuous in parliament. Debate has been blocked and procedure has been unfair. The Australian people have made it clear that theyre moving towards a more diverse and inclusive parliament, one that represents the true essence of who we are as a nation.I have also taken small steps as there are more opportunities presented to me in this House to raise the impact of the high cost of living on my community. While commending the government on some of its legislation, I also advocated for the community by asking the government to take notice of the families in Fowler and how much we need resources and investment—especially for a settlement city so that our people can grow and thrive.We do need to move away from the two-party system. Moving forward, I urge the government to work more collaboratively and more transparently with the crossbench, and to work towards evolving Australias parliament to work for the Australian people.

312,0,0,0,1,2,"Chaney, Kate MP",300006,"Curtin","IND","N/A",1277," A few weeks ago I met with Rod, a schoolteacher who lives in my electorate, and he told me about his son Ollie. Ollie is 19 years old. His dad says hes a good kid and sports obsessed. He loves watching footy. Hes at uni studying to be a PE teacher because he wants to share his love of sport with kids. Rod talked about how he and Ollie had always watched football on TV together. Rod said hed noticed the increased number of ads before, during and after the games, but the most pervasive and persuasive of these ads were about online sports betting. This year, Sportsbet is one of the AFLs major sponsors. Rod and Ollie always discussed how gambling was terrible, how it sucked you in and gave you nothing, and how it always made you lose. Rod told me, I couldnt have done much more.Last month, Ollie came to Rod with tears in his eyes and admitted he had lost $25,000 in the last six months. Thats a house deposit or a car, or Ollies uni degree paid. One of the things that really bothered me about this story is that this monumental loss happened despite Ollie having support, stability and every opportunity to avoid getting sucked into gambling. What about kids who dont have Rod sitting on the couch with them every Saturday?Ollie is embarrassed about what happened to him and hes not going to go and tell his friends about it. Rod pointed out that Ollie and his mates tell each other when they win but not when they lose. This sense of shame adds to the problem. Young people are not getting complete information about the experience of gambling—they hear only the good stories—and its everywhere they look. Nielsen data shows a gambling ad is shown every two minutes on free-to-air TV in Australia. The gambling industry spent $287 million on advertising in Australia last year, which is three times what it was a decade ago. Three-quarters of Australian children aged eight to 16 who watch sport think betting on sport is normal and can also name one or more sports betting companies. In fact, a quarter can name four or more.My kids arent that into sport, but they tell me that they frequently, when playing online games, get popup ads for slot-machine-style games that require you to spin the wheel in order to close the ad, resulting in a message that youve won free coins and enticing you to keep playing. Almost three-quarters of Australian parents reported being bothered by their children being exposed to gambling ads, and 86 per cent of Australians agree that gambling advertising should not be shown to children while online.Australians spend more on gambling than any other country in the world, and recent estimates suggest that 1.3 million people are at some risk of or already experiencing gambling problems or harm. We are conditioning our kids to think that gambling is cool and fun from an early age through the advertising they see.

313,0,0,0,1,2,"Phillips, Fiona MP",147140,"Gilmore","ALP","N/A",1277," In the lead up to last weeks Jobs and Skills Summit, I held the Gilmore Jobs and Skills Summit survey to canvass the views across our community, because I believe everyone deserves to have their say. I was impressed with the hundreds and hundreds of responses I received, and I thank everyone who participated. My electorate of Gilmore has a traditionally high unemployment and underemployment rate. We have a higher than average age demographic and lower than average wages, so we have a unique set of jobs and skills challenges that do not necessarily follow the national trends.While there are a significant number of local infrastructure projects that I believe could help to create jobs, without action to fix structural issues facing our health, housing, childcare and education sectors, I fear these projects will not do enough to support the wellbeing of our community. I am excited that many of the suggestions made in our Gilmore submission were considered and listed as priority outcomes from the summit. The two most common themes were about apprentices and training in skill shortage areas, and support for older workers. Thats why, as part of the outcomes of the summit, we will deliver an additional $1 billion in joint federal and state funding for fee-free TAFE for 180,000 people in skills shortage areas. That is just fantastic.On top of this, we have also provided a one-off income credit so that age pensioners who want to work can earn an additional $4,000 over the financial year without losing their pension. Many people who responded to my survey raised this concern, and this again is fantastic news.Local people raised concerns with the visa system and the need to support the agricultural sector, so we have committed to this as well, with an historic agricultural workforce tripartite agreement to ensure farmers can get the workers they need and to make sure agricultural workers are protected and respected. Speeding up visas, increasing the migrant cap and supporting industries with skills shortages are all things local people said they wanted and are all things we will now deliver. Across all the themes raised, wages were raised as an issue that needs addressing in health, education, child care, hospitality and more. We are taking this seriously, and the jobs summit outcomes show the government has listened to the voices of local people on the South Coast. Weve also announced progress to address the housing crisis and improve jobs and training pathways for women and First Nations people, more themes raised by local people.I received many interesting comments and suggestions about how we can address the local jobs and skills crisis. Thank you so much for sharing them with me. I will continue working hard to deliver these commitments for our community.","Employment","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs PHILLIPS (Gilmore) ","(09:33):"
314,0,0,0,1,2,"OBrien, Ted MP",138932,"Fairfax","LNP","N/A",1278," Enough talk—time for action. Im referring, of course, to the $3.2 billion new rail line that will run from Beerwah to Maroochydore. This rail line has been well studied and long wanted. Indeed, we saw this year that, in the federal budget, the single largest transport infrastructure project across the nation was for this Beerwah to Maroochydore rail line, with $1.6 billion committed by the federal government: fully costed and fully budgeted for.This rail line, of course, is needed for several reasons. Firstly, we know that South-East Queensland—in particular between Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast—is the fastest-growing region in the country. Population growth is going through the roof. Indeed, when the studies were done on this very project, it was before COVID. What we have seen post COVID is, again, the movement of people to the south-east corner—in particular between Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast. Population growth alone justifies this infrastructure project.But what we also see is a much-strained Bruce Highway, despite record funding from the former coalition government. We need to have fewer cars and more people in trains. Again, this is why we need this rail connection, which will take, for the first time in history, a rail line off the existing track, across the coastal strip, from Caloundra through to Kawana and up to the Maroochydore CBD. It is vitally needed.We also recognise the environmental benefits of ensuring that we have more people on public transport, such as rail, rather than just in cars. We have the need for population planning. We need a population plan that has density around new railway stations—again, a reason for this program. We also have the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games, where the world will be coming to the Sunny Coast. We need this rail line.The moment of truth, though, is coming. The moment of truth will be at the federal budget. We will see whether or not the new government will honour its word. The minister herself, before becoming a minister, said about this very project, There is no time to waste. Labor candidates on the Sunshine Coast, before the federal election, also said they supported this project. What have we seen since the election, though? Nothing. There have been no commitments made. All there is is weaselly words about having to work with the state government—also a Labor government—which has previously said it was a fully viable project but has not committed the funding. The moment of truth will be on budget night, and I tell you what: the Sunshine Coast and Brisbane will be watching. We are demanding that $1.6 billion be in that budget.","Sunshine Coast: Rail Infrastructure","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[3]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr TED OBRIEN (Fairfax) ","(09:36):"
315,0,0,0,1,2,"Kearney, Ged MP","LTU","Cooper","ALP","N/A",1278," I rise to address the chamber about Womens Health Week, which is taking place this week. Like many girls, I learned at an early age that women and girls would face additional challenges in life. We were told to just put up with period paid. Sexual health wasnt talked about. Many women suffered a miscarriage in virtual silence, and my own mother had a stillbirth that was simply never discussed.My sisters, friends and classmates all knew our paths in life would be harder in many ways because of our gender. We knew we wouldnt get the same pay at work. We knew that, if we had families, wed have to do the bulk of the child rearing. We knew that wed have fewer choices about our own bodies and about if, when and how we wanted to have children. As a woman, a mother, a nurse, a union leader, a member of parliament and now, luckily, the Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care, I have fought my whole life to change this expectation.While many things have changed for the better, many may not have. Every woman has a story about how their chronic pain was ignored or played down by the GP, only to receive a diagnosis of endometriosis a decade later; or about a woman who lives in a small town, who had to pay $1,000 to access a termination when she was actually broke; or about a woman whod experienced sexual abuse as a child, who cried silently while she had a gynaecological examination with a cold speculum. Womens health issues play out every single day, in all communities, all postcodes and all cultural backgrounds.On Tuesday, I attended the launch of the Jean Hailes National Womens Health Survey, which showed that almost half of all women are reporting that their health has declined as a result of the pandemic. Its even worse for women in the disability, CALD, First Nations and LGBTIQ+ communities. However, the picture is not just bleak. I want to give a huge shout-out to some of the women who are working hard to be part of the solution to this enduring challenge. In my electorate of Cooper, we have the wonderful Womens Health In the North, who have staff like Emily, who has dedicated her career to helping women and girls. She is motivated by the recognition that gender inequality drives bad outcomes for women, from health inequity to family violence. What I grew up with isnt what I want other young women to grow up with, she said, and that is the sentiment that I want to leave with you.Weve all grown up steeped in some version of gender inequality, whether its taking on the lions share of housework and child rearing or not being paid the same as males in your workplace. I call on all people of all genders to work to fashion a better world for our next generation, so that everyone can get the care they deserve.","Womens Health Week","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[4]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms KEARNEY (Cooper—Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care) ","(09:39):"

Back in 2016, we got $5.4 million from the Commonwealth as part of a $12 million package to do up the Merriwa to Willow Tree road. The reason this road is important is that its an alternative route across the Liverpool Range—as opposed to the New England Highway. If the New England Highway gets shut down, this is the road you go along. We did what looked like a marvellous job. The road was sealed. It was a beautiful road that went up over the range. But then it rained and the road fell into the creek. Since that time, we havent had a second range crossing, and the people who live either side of that range have to go about a further 60 kilometres to get round.I know the government, at this stage, are talking about their wage summit, and I appreciate the sentiment of what theyre trying to do there. If people want to get to work—and there are some massive feedlots on one side and grain and cattle on the other side—its really important that we allow them to actually get to work. This is something that has been forced on us, but weve got to fix it. Its going to cost around $40 million to fix. I want to thank the minister, Catherine King, for the meeting we had yesterday with both the mayor, Maurice Collison, and also the shires general manager, Greg McDonald. Minister King gave us a fair hearing, and I want to thank her for that. Its important that people understand that weve heard this morning about billions of dollars for a rail line, but were talking about $40 million for people to get to work.I think its incredibly important that, being a government for all, vital infrastructure such as this is fixed, because it speaks to all the things we want to do. We know that, Cities dont build roads; roads build cities, and economies are built on the capacity for product to move from one area to another. This is vital infrastructure not only for New England but also for the Hunter Valley. Its well known that its the alternate route to get to one of the major federal highways to go north and south in our nation.I hope that its within the governments remit that, as we go to the budget, we have the capacity for this piece of infrastructure. In the whole scheme of things, its not large, but, in the realm of the Upper Hunter and southern New England, its absolutely vital that it is restored. We need to get away from this perverseness of a brand new road that comes to an absolute dead end when there are people on either side who cant go from one town to the other.","Merriwa to Willow Tree Road","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[5]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr JOYCE (New England) ","(09:42):"

Through this process, I have met with some exceptional people and some exceptional groups doing some amazing work. Recently, I met with a group of passionate members of the Avoca Beach community to discuss their vision to establish a community garden in the beachside suburb. Representatives of this group, who speak on behalf of over 300 members, told me about all the amazing benefits the community gardens can provide, including for your physical and mental health and for your social wellbeing.Weve seen, through the COVID-19 pandemic, how important community spaces like parklands and recreation areas are to maintaining residents mental health and wellbeing. Community gardens can also make more coherent and cohesive communities by coming together to work collectively and collaboratively on a shared objective like a garden. This vision is one that I certainly do encourage and will support to make it a reality.My thanks and appreciation go to Lisa, Beth, Bruce and Sandra for sharing this vision with me and showing me the beautiful proposed site at Avoca Beach. I very much look forward to working closely with you over the coming weeks and months. Keep up the excellent work.Another story from my electorate that I wish to share is about the Wiseberry Peninsula winter appeal 2022. The Wiseberry Peninsula winter appeal 2022 has been a huge success. The Robertson community, especially the Peninsula, were very supportive of this years campaign for winter donations. Each year the Wiseberry winter appeal collects much-needed winter essentials to donate to fellow Central Coast residents who might be experiencing homelessness or going through a difficult period. This year they supported Coast Shelter, a homelessness and outreach organisation based in Gosford that does some amazing work for people who are vulnerable and homeless.Im pleased to report that the Wiseberry Peninsula collected a whopping 54 bags of donations full of winter items and essentials. This equated to a massive 265 kilograms of donations that went straight to Coast Shelter to distribute to people on the Central Coast doing it tough over winter.From the bottom of my heart, I thank the community-minded staff at Wiseberry Peninsula. In particular, I thank Tammy Jackett, who contacted my office; director Rod Dillon; and administrative officer Kiara Kelly. You should all be extremely proud of the results that youve been able to achieve this year. To the exceptional Robertson community and all the small businesses that got behind the campaign and donated: thank you.

318,0,0,0,1,2,"Pasin, Tony MP",240756,"Barker","LP","N/A",1280," I rise to pay tribute to a true gentleman and pillar of the Limestone Coast community, Mr Brian Page. Brian was Mount Gambier through and through. His breadth of knowledge of all things south-east is probably unmatched. Brian was a forestry professional and founding member of the Mount Gambier Hoo-Hoo branch, the Fraternal Order of the Forest Products Industry, serving as president in 1978; a member of the Mount Gambier Club; a member of the Limestone Coast Area Consultative Committee since its inception in 1995; and a member of the Australian Institute of Wood Science. He worked tirelessly for the local tourism industry, including serving on the Riddoch Art Gallery Foundation as one of the original trustees, chairman of the Limestone Coast Tourism Board and the committee chairman of the Lady Nelson establishment body.But Brian was probably perhaps best known for his philanthropy. Brian was a member of the Stand Like Stone Foundation board of directors since its inception in 2004 and was the inaugural chair of the interim steering committee for the community foundation project. Brian and his wife Sue were also founding donors and, through Stand Like Stone, established scholarships for students at Mount Gambier High School, Kingston Community School and Keith Area School.Brians belief of community-based philanthropy has served our community in the Limestone Coast well. Brian joined myself and many others in pushing for the federal government to reform tax deductible gift recipient rules, as Brian believed strongly, as I do, in the community foundation model and the premise that locally collected charitable donations were best spent on the local communities and that a long-term sustainable approach to giving was the only way to combat long-term entrenched community problems. Brian worked tirelessly for a more generous and inclusive community. He did it quietly, without seeking personal accolade. Brians generosity, his kindness, his knowledge and his love for the south-east are what he will be fondly remembered for by many.Mt Gambier and, indeed, the wider south-east have lost a great man but have benefited immensely from his lifelong commitment and dedication to community throughout his life. As we reflect on Brians life, let us be inspired to be more like him, if only in part, and give back to the community that supports so many. My sincerest condolences to Brians wife Sue, his extended family and his many friends.

319,0,0,0,1,2,"Mitchell, Rob MP","M3E","McEwen","ALP","N/A",1280," I have risen in this chamber many times to speak on the issue of healthcare access in our electorate of McEwen. Under the previous government, access to healthcare services and particularly GPs was abysmal. Families across our electorate struggled to access even the most basic medical care. Every Australian deserves to be able to access health care. The simple act of taking a child to a GP when they are sick is not something that we can do without.Under the previous government, much of my time as a local member was spent with the many people in our community who were scared and frustrated by the lack of access to healthcare services that they were experiencing. With not enough doctors in our towns to look after the needs of our communities, people were desperate. Our GPs were doing the best they could, but they were overworked, tired and struggling to keep up. My constituents wanted to know what the coalition was doing to address healthcare services and the immense shortage of GPs which regional Australia is facing. Its not a level of medical care that we should accept in this country. I wrote time and time again to the former Liberal Minister for Health asking for urgent assistance for our region but got crickets in response. Meanwhile, every day people were being turned away from GP clinics simply because there were not enough doctors to care for them.So I am proud to be part of a government that has finally taken action on the issue of healthcare access in regional areas. Its not simple and it is not something that will be fixed overnight, but we finally have a government that is actually caring and committed to doing something.Prior to the election, I made a promise to our community, and Labor made a promise to the country, that if elected the government would increase the support for communities across the country where there is a GP shortfall. This initiative, coupled with Labors plan to increase the number of urgent care clinics across our country, intends to particularly support those in rural and regional areas in their access to much-needed healthcare services.Local practices, including those in our electorate, like in Wallan and Whittlesea, will now be able to recruit from a much bigger pool of doctors, because updating the distribution priority access areas will see more than 700 areas with either full or partial DPA classification. Because international medical graduates and overseas trained doctors are only able to access Medicare if they work in a DPA area, a DPA classification means that practices in DPA areas have access to more doctors who can work for our local communities. I was also pleased to learn that the minister is also looking at the way the Monash model is working and how things might be improved.Im proud to be standing in this chamber today as part of an Albanese Labor government that is delivering on its promises to our communities seriously and delivering on them now. It is so important for our rural and regional areas to have access to doctors and to have better health care because it means that we have better outcomes in the regions.","Health Care","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[8]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ROB MITCHELL (McEwen) ","(09:51):"

The value of our exports is forecast to hit a record $70.3 billion in 2022-23, driven by a favourable growing-condition year and international demand.Like the remainder of the nation, our agricultural sector on the north-west coast of Tasmania has had a good year. Its been a good growing season. We have had good rain and temperatures are starting to rise. Favourable international commodity prices have allowed farmers to build and to reinvest back into their business model and their enterprises. Our farmers are at the cutting edge when it comes to the application of science and technology and the application of worlds best agricultural practice. The introduction of this technology into the agricultural sector in Tasmania is second to none. With the current challenges around the dramatic rise in the cost of, particularly, diesel fuel, labour and fertiliser and agricultural chemicals, our farmers need to be smarter, more than ever before, if they are to grow their business to a viable future. Our farmers lead the way, not just in the state, but nationally, and they are increasingly internationally renowned for producing some of the best produce anywhere in the world.Its spring, and that means its time for farmers and agribusiness to show off everything that is great about living on the land and the agricultural sector. The agricultural show and field day season kicked off a few weeks ago with Rural Youths four-day Agfest in Tasmania. For those who didnt get a chance to go to Tasmania and experience Australias top agricultural field day, let me tell you, it was a cracker, with more than 50,000 visitors to the site. After a couple of years of challenges, the crowds were back in droves, and the city and the bush were brought together to celebrate and appreciate everything that our farmers do. They get an understanding of the contribution farmers make to their lives and to making it better every day. Over the coming months it will be great to see more agricultural shows, like the Burnie show, the Circular Head show, the King Island show and the Wynyard show, back in action.I want to close with a shout-out to our great volunteers, who work tirelessly in order to bring these agricultural shows to our communities. It wouldnt have been an easy few years. You could have thrown the towel in quite easily over the last couple of years, particularly as COVID implications pinched on your great shows. But you did what every good farmer does. When confronted with a problem, you just ploughed around it and kept going.

So one of the great pleasures and privileges of being the member for Dunkley is being able to assist young people with Local Sporting Champions grants. Last week I hosted a group of young sporting champions from across the electorate—different sports, different schools—to celebrate their sporting success. They did themselves, their parents and their schools proud with the way they conducted themselves.There was one young woman who wasnt able to come, Isabella Lowe-King, because she was competing. She sent me an email after the events to tell me this:Ive just returned from the AWF Youth & U23 Weightlifting Nationals in Perth and so happy to let you know that I came 1st in my weight division, broke 4 Victorian records and also a Personal best in the Snatch & Total categories, so it was a very successful event for me.Clearly! She went on to say:I just wanted to thank you so much for the grant of $700 under the Local Sporting Champion Program. The grant assisted with the costs in many ways and was very much appreciated. It was so great to have my family there to support me as well.Isabella sent me some photographs of her competing, and I find it extraordinary that such a small, compact young woman can lift such a huge weight. I wanted to thank her for keeping me updated about her success.I also thank her for mentioning how great it was to have her family there, because the other thing we know about young people in sport is that it is made so much easier for them if they do have family and friends to support them. We also know the sacrifices that are made by parents and grandparents and carers to help the young people in their lives to be able to participate in their sport; to give them those opportunities to learn about community, responsibility, teamwork; to learn that they can be strong and tough and brave and graceful; to learn that they can play baseball, do gymnastics, play football, play hockey or do equestrian, whether theyre a boy or a girl; and that they will have some great successes and they will have some not-so-great competitions. But what they will take out of their time in sport is lifelong friends, lifelong memories and, for many of them, opportunities to work professionally in an area that they love.So congratulations to all of the young people who, over my time as your federal member, have got awards, and I look forward to many more presentation ceremonies in the future.","Dunkley Electorate: Local Sporting Champions Program","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[10]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms MURPHY (Dunkley) ","(09:57):"

324,0,0,0,1,2,"Le, Dai MP",295676,"Fowler","IND","N/A",1283," Ill continue on from where I left off yesterday on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Electric Car Discount) Bill 2022. If we are to convince normal, everyday Australian consumers to start making the switch, we also need to ensure HEVs are included in any subsidies. The government has clearly not considered how working-class Australians will benefit from their proposal. As with all things, major changes take time. I therefore propose that, alongside the other vehicles included in this proposal, the chamber support my amendment to include hybrid electric vehicles, HEVs. These vehicles are not perfect; however, they emit, on average, 64 grams of CO2 emissions per kilometre less than petrol vehicles and 76 grams less than diesel vehicles. More importantly, they are affordable. It is therefore key that these vehicles be included in this legislation.As it currently stands, vehicles expected to be exempted this year will equate to between 0.16 per cent and 0.4 per cent of new vehicle sales in the next 12 months. By 2024-25, this percentage of new sales is anticipated to rise to the range of 0.71 per cent to 1.8 per cent. This low level of sales demonstrates how small the impact of this bill will be in its current form. It is certainly not in line with the governments Driving the Nation program. Consequently, it is indefensible to not include HEVs on the basis that they will emit carbon. With these vehicles included, we will see a much smoother transition towards the uptake of EVs, and they will be participating in an eventual move to solely battery electric vehicles, BEVs, on the roads.Furthermore, has the government considered the grid infrastructure required to support an increase in the uptake of electric vehicles? It seems that the government is proposing to walk before it can run. It is currently estimated that it will be at least a decade before the electricity grid can accommodate an electric fleet. And, in the short term, how is the government proposing to build the required number of charging stations? For those who travel long distances, do not have charging stations at their homes or are not charging their car at home every night, publicly available charging stations are a necessity. Currently, there is a confusing and convoluted structure of investment that covers local, state and federal spending. Whilst the government proposes to invest $39.3 million for 117 fast-charging stations, there is a lack of detail around the time line of this rollout and, more importantly, whether it will match or, preferably, precede a greater uptake in EVs. The solution to this in the short run is therefore hybrid vehicles, which have the capacity to drastically reduce emissions, compared to the current levels, and will not burden the grid or require charging stations. We need a transition period, and these amendments Im putting forward will assist the transition period as well as making it available to many Australians.Additionally, if we are to ensure that no-one is left behind in transitioning to a greener future, the Australian domestic industry, particularly manufacturing, must be the springboard. It must be Australian business and Australian workers that facilitate the building of infrastructure and the implementation of a renewable future. The government has committed to 604,000 jobs by 2030 as a result of transitioning to renewables. Only 54 per cent of these jobs are meant to come directly from renewable industries. Consequently, the bulk of jobs will come from those workers who support our renewable capacity: tradesmen, factory workers and manufacturers. In Fowler, for example, there are nearly 1,400 workers in the automotive industry. However, there is currently a real shortage of capacity and expertise in electrical component manufacturing. In its own Powering Australia plan, the government asserts that thousands of jobs will be created for construction workers. With investment, surely the same could be true for our manufacturing industry, as people upskill to meet the increased demand for production of electric vehicles and other renewable products, especially in an electorate like Fowler, where unemployment is nearly three times the national average.Furthermore, due to global supply chain shortages, the current wait time for an EV is roughly 12 months but could extend to up to two years. While it is good in principle to implement what the government has put forward, consumers wont reap the benefits of their EV for a long time to come. While it may be cheaper to fuel these cars once they have been purchased, this approach still requires the initial capital to purchase the vehicle and the charging capacity for electric cars to ensure they run efficiently for business needs. I commend state governments that have committed to rolling out fast-charging stations, with NSW planning to have 700 fast-charging stations rolled out by 2027. However, this does not help small businesses now, particularly those from low-socioeconomic communities. Australia exports about 60 per cent of the worlds lithium. Surely there is capacity to reboot our local manufacturing industry to build EV batteries. With a local manufacturing sector—in particular, one based in south-west Sydney in my electorate of Fowler—we will no longer have to rely on a global car market that is already struggling to keep up with demand, which could see wait times dramatically reduce.Additionally, we are presented with a unique opportunity to invest in our renewable manufacturing industry. Countries such as China with major automotive manufacturing industries are having to use mandate based systems that see the production of EVs incentivised, as it will take time for manufacturers to adjust. In Australia, we do not have this issue. If the government is serious about the uptake of EVs, investing in Australias industry is an obvious and important policy. If the government seeks a truly sustainable future, thinking must extend beyond the top end—beyond the consumers of the final product. For real and effective affordability and sustainability, we need Australian manufacturing by Australian majority owned companies. Initially this may be focused on car manufacturing, but it can eventually be extended to buses and heavy vehicles as we build the capacity to manufacture them and their components onshore. I therefore ask the government to consider requiring that all government purchased vehicles at local, state and federal level be zero- or low-emissions vehicles manufactured in Australia, using Australian made components and parts, by 2035.Further to this point, the government must also facilitate the purchase of all new commercial and government buses in metropolitan areas to be electric buses manufactured in Australia, as proposed by my colleague the member for Kennedy. What we see in the governments proposal is the minimum. We see the absolute minimum from this government in incentivising the uptake of electric vehicles. If theyre truly planning to increase the number of EVs on the road, they have certainly not proposed how they plan to support such an uptake. Such a plan should include consideration of investing in our domestic manufacturing. I therefore implore the chamber to hold this government accountable for considering all Australians in their transition to renewables—not just those who can afford it—and support my amendment to the bill to include hybrid electric vehicles.","Treasury Laws Amendment (Electric Car Discount) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[1]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms LE (Fowler) ","(10:01):"
325,0,0,0,1,2,"Claydon, Sharon MP",248181,"Newcastle","ALP","N/A",1284," I certainly did not want to allow this historic opportunity to go by without making a contribution to the debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Electric Car Discount) Bill 2022.It is an exciting time for the Australian people and, certainly, for this parliament. I was here in the 46th Parliament when you could barely utter the words electric vehicle, and I am overjoyed that we now have a government in place that is taking new technology seriously and has vowed to act on climate change, for which we have a very clear mandate from the Australian people. When the Minister for Climate Change and Energy introduced those bills, he filled my heart with joy—and not only mine. The people of Newcastle have long called for measures like these to be introduced because it is an unmistakable signal to Australian industry and also to the Australian people that weve got a government in charge that understands not just the human and social imperative to act on climate change but also the economic imperative to do so. We understand the economics of clean, cheap, reliable energy, and we recognise that generational imperative to act now. So it is incredibly important that this parliament gets to work.This bill was introduced back in July—one of the first bills from the new Labor government—which indicates the seriousness with which we take this issue. The communities that I represent and, indeed, the communities represented by all Labor members understand clearly. Our communities have rejected the fear campaigns of the past now. I live in a city where all of our industries are very carbon intensive. I am home to the worlds largest port that exports coal. My community knows full well the economics of energy. Weve been doing it for more than a hundred years. We intend to be doing it for the next hundred years. They will be different forms of energy, however, and we will play a lead role in transitioning this country and in meeting our international obligations. Its communities like mine that have a lot of skin in the game that are going to lead this discussion in Australia, and its governments like the Albanese Labor government that are going to provide the leadership to make these social and economic changes that are good for the planet, good for our people and good for the future.We know that Australian businesses and industry are now desperate for some very clear indications and guidance about the risks of inaction on climate change. Theyre acutely aware of the risks. What they want is strong leadership and guidance about the pathways ahead, so everyone can get on with it. Indeed, I would argue that communities like mine have been way ahead of this parliament. Now they feel like theyve got a government thats finally pulled its head out of the sand and is going to provide the kind of leadership that is required to ensure that people living in Newcastle and the Hunter arent left behind.We are about grabbing every opportunity available and leaving no-one behind, and thats what legislation like the bill before us now is going to present: new opportunities. This is one of those new opportunities that we can grab with both hands. Alternatively, you can do what so many members of the opposition do—turn their back, dont enter the debate, ignore, dont show up. Were not about to do that. We understand the imperative to be a responsible government in 2022. This bill is implementing an Albanese government election commitment to provide an electric vehicle discount by means of a fringe benefit tax exemption for eligible, employer provided electric cars. That, in a nutshell, is what this bill seeks to do.The government is absolutely committed to reducing transport emissions. Its one of the big emission components that we do absolutely have to reduce, and we are making electric vehicles more affordable so that families and businesses who want them can get them. So many people are coming to my electoral office and saying: When is this going to happen? When can we start buying our electric vehicles? Theyre desperate to get in on this game, and good on them. Those who are in a position to do so want to do their part. They need some help to make these electric cars more affordable. This bill, these measures, will deliver on that. As I said, its a bill that will not only make electric vehicles more affordable for families but will also contribute to our climate change targets.The bill will amend the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 to exempt from fringe benefits tax the use of eligible electric cars made available by employers to employees. This fringe benefit tax exemption will apply to battery electric cars, hydrogen fuel cell electric cars and plug-in hybrid electric cars. Eligible electric cars will be limited to those first made available for use on or after 1 July 2022 and with a first retail price that is below the luxury car tax threshold for fuel-efficient cars. That is $84,916 for the 2022-23 component.I expect there to be a big uptake on this. My community is absolutely ready. We are home to an electric vehicle festival. We have been doing this festival for more than a decade now. Just last week, I was at the University of Newcastle, farewelling a Tesla electric vehicle that is starting its journey in Newcastle. It will circumnavigate Australia in a project called Charge Around Australia. I was there to farewell, and send my good wishes to, Stuart McBain, the project director and driving project lead. He will be the person behind the wheel. It is an amazing opportunity for the university to incorporate all the smart things that it is doing in this area and take that car out to kids in remote and rural regions, who probably dont get to have a close-up experience of electric vehicles very often, so they can have access to the people who are building those technologies and talk to them about the science.We know that children in Australia are anxious about their futures and what climate change means. I know members opposite also have concerns about the anxiety of children about their futures. One way of dealing with that anxiety is making sure that we provide great educational opportunities for those kids. I want to make sure that a kid at Yuendumu has got just as much chance as a kid sitting in Newcastle city of understanding this technology, of aspiring to be a scientist contributing to the technological solutions, of thinking about those problems that are ahead and being part of those solutions.The University of Newcastle is very fortunate to have Professor Paul Dastoor, who has led the globe in producing incredibly cheap solar energy, where you no longer need sophisticated cells popped onto your roof or cars. He can literally paint the solar panel onto a plastic film, which is lightweight, incredibly cheap to produce and is printed on a 2D printer. That is what is going to help charge this electric vehicle as it travels around Australia.We know there is range anxiety out there, and I heard the member before me speak to that issue. That is why Labor is committed to rolling out the 117 fast-charging stations that we are investing in along highways across Australia.But there are other people playing a role in this as well. I congratulate the City of Newcastle Council, which is already rolling out charge stations in our city and region. I have community groups doing it, and the NRMA. There are a whole bunch of people who are way ahead of where the former government was at. They were already making efforts to get down this road and take opportunities with both hands, willingly and happily. The work that we will do to invest in those fast-charging stations will go in partnership with the NRMA, councils, the private sector and community groups who are also acting in this regard. That will go a long way to addressing those issues that people have around range anxiety, and I acknowledge that thats real. The project Charge Around Australia will educate and inspire some 70 schools along the way—how fantastic! They will get insights into the cutting-edge global technologies that are being produced here in Australia. They are being developed right in my city of Newcastle, and they are the sorts of technologies that will be addressing the climate crisis in Australia.We are doing the heavy lifting because we know theres a lot at stake for communities like mine. I hope that events like Charge Around Australia and the work of Professor Paul Dastoor and the University of Newcastle inspire young minds everywhere to enter STEM. I want young girls from across Australia to be totally inspired to take up those STEM subjects, do those in schools and talk to industries about future career pathways they can have. Theyre going to be part of developing those technologies in the future as well—I know that. And thats why we are deeply committed as a government to providing new energy apprenticeships and new energy skills programs so those kids have got a bright future. Thats what we want here.This electric vehicle discount is just one of many measures now that the Albanese Labor government is putting forward in this parliament to make sure that we can honour our international obligations. We will honour that commitment that we have made both to the Australian people and to the world. We are serious partners in this endeavour now, and amending the fringe benefits tax to make sure that there are more affordable electric vehicles out there for families and for eligible employees is a great first step. Its one of many, many steps that we will be taking. For members opposite, who have dealt themselves out of so many conversations and so many important opportunities to be a partner in forging a better future, I really hope that there is some thought given to a better strategy in parliament. Instead of putting your head in the sand and pretending these things arent happening, I urge you to work with government to ensure that we are offering the very, very best pathways forward.I think it has to be acknowledged that this was a very clear commitment from the Albanese Labor government during the election. We absolutely have a mandate to implement this. There would be an outcry—and justifiably so—among the Australian people if this bill were not to pass through this parliament in both houses. It is certainly the way that the rest of the comparable democracies are travelling, and it would be a crying shame for Australia not to be taking part in ensuring that we make electric vehicles a more affordable option for the Australian people. We dont wish to become the dumping ground for all the vehicles that no-one else in the world can sell. Thats not the kind of future I want for my city of Newcastle. Im pretty sure its not the future we want to see for anyone in Australia. So I encourage all members of this parliament to get behind this bill and give it your support.","Treasury Laws Amendment (Electric Car Discount) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[1]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms CLAYDON (Newcastle—Deputy Speaker) ","(10:09):"

328,0,0,0,1,2,"MemberContinuation","e5d","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Mr JOYCE: I didnt interrupt you, and you should be polite. There are a range of issues here. First of all, the market has been very aware of electric vehicles for a long period of time. In fact, a lot of the research for electric vehicles and batteries is done by 3ME in Armidale. They are then constructed from a chassis thats imported from Brazil—well, theyre not constructed, theyre just assembled, in Newcastle. The place they use those electric vehicles is down the coalmines that the Labor Party is intent on closing down. We also have electric technology in forklifts. We have electric technology, in a minor form, in scooters and in golf buggies. The market is very aware of this technology. It is not new.The reason it hasnt taken off is that its not appropriate to so many areas—thats why it hasnt. People arent dumb. If they can make money, theyll go out and make money. They dont need any inspiration to make a buck. When we talk about the dumping ground, where do you think the dumping ground for electric vehicles is going to be because we dont make them in Australia? The dumping ground for electric vehicles will be Australia.There are a range of reasons for not taking up electric vehicles, and I have to make the chamber aware of this. The first one is range. A Tesla has a range of about 470 kilometres. There is nothing wrong with that. Its just that its way beyond the price range of people who live in a weatherboard-and-iron to be able to buy. The other thing is that, when you dont have electric fast-charging stations, and even with 117 fast-charging stations—Australias a big place, the size of Western Europe. That means it takes about 27 hours to charge one from a house supply. What happens if you need to get to the hospital? What happens if your kid gets an asthma attack?And the other thing is of course that people in poor areas dont have the money to buy new cars. If I go to the areas around me and the hills around where I live—I must admit Im very humbled; at some of those booths I get over 90 per cent of the vote—I will not find a new car in that village. I will not find a new car in many of those areas. Im proud of my people. Its just that they dont have the money to buy them. They dont have $60,000 to buy an electric vehicle. They work within a budget of around $10,000 to $20,000. And, if you want to test that, go and see the second-hand car lot and see whats moving, whats selling.The other thing is theyre just unsuitable. In the last two months of wet weather, Ive had to use the winch on my Toyota three times: once for a funeral director who got bogged on the roads, once for a tray back that had slipped off onto the road—and it was the only way we could get in—and once for a small truck. Now, people say thats out of scope. Well, its not. Thats the life we live. Thats what we do. And that sort of technology is not available in electric cars. In many areas it just would not be accessible, it would not be appropriate, and itd get knocked to pieces.The other thing about electric vehicles is that, when theyre turned over, just like forklifts, theyre basically worthless. Thats the end. Its not like an HQ, a WB or an HJ Holden, which even decades later people are still using because they can fix them up. And the ideas, the technology and the nous to fix them up are seen through the local people. A lot of them have taught themselves. But the capacity to do that with electric vehicles is not there. So were forcing on poor people literally another caveat, another cost, and were saying to them—for a policy which, lets be frank, on the whole is a policy for white, urban, small upper-class areas in cities, where its an appropriate car, because theyre small distances and theres ample capacity to recharge. But that is not the case in regional areas. If you go to Yuendumu, youre not going to be using an electric vehicle. And that Tesla—and Ive been reading about it—thats going to circumnavigate Australia is not going to Cape York. Its going to areas where it can recharge. And so, what youre saying, even by that statement, is that there are certain people youre going to isolate.We, on this side, believe in choice. If you want to buy an electric vehicle, knock yourself out—buy it. And, if you dont want to buy it, then why is the government subsidising the actual people who could afford it the most? If you want to subsidise something, subsidise poor people into a vehicle, full stop. Thats what you should be subsidising people into.Weve also seen those opposite talk about technology. You have to completely rejig the whole power grid to get the capacity for people in their homes to recharge their cars. Youre going to need about six kVA per house, and they just dont have that. This is a massive cost to try and bring this into our nation. Even then, youre going to have periods of a massive peak in power at night, when theres no solar and less wind. Youre going to have a massive peak in power and the inability for it to actually work.Those opposite dont actually sit down and go through the nuts and bolts of this. When you come up with ideas, like wanting to go to zero emissions, and you need base-load power, rather than talking about how smart you are in manufacturing and industry—which I hope you are—why do you completely ignore nuclear power? You parody it. Why do you run it down? You say its a stupid idea. So lets go through all the stupid countries that are currently developing, or are a part of, the small modular reactor industry and are going to get there before us: the Czech Republic, Romania, Argentina, Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, China, Russia, Finland, South Africa, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Germany, South Korea and Qatar—all these dopey people, all these incredibly dopey countries, who are once more, in a new piece of technology—like mobile phones, like motor vehicles, like everything else—just going to leave Australia behind. And, ultimately, well end up with small modular reactors. Its just inevitable. Its like saying, Im going to ban iPhones or, Im going to ban fridges or, Were going to continue walking rather than using a motor vehicle at all. Its going to come in.Lets look at the dumb companies that are developing it: Hyundai, Hitachi, Westinghouse, General Electric, NuScale, Amec, Rolls-Royce, Skoda, Neutroelectric, KGHM. Do you think Rolls-Royce is stupid? Do you think Westinghouse is stupid? Do you think General Electric is a dumb company? Do you think theyre doing this because they think its a dumb idea? No, theyre once more just leaving us behind.Rolls-Royce is developing a 470-megawatt small modular reactor. It will power Leeds, a city of over 500,000 people—one reactor. The size of it is 16 metres by four metres—obviously the cooling capacity is there. Just think of that: 16 metres by four metres powering something the size of Leeds, and they believe theyll have it on the market by 2029. And the Labor government is saying, No, were not going do that. They giggle and make these foolish statements in the parliament, because they just havent done their homework.These are going to be factory-made; theyre modular. With anything made out of modular parts in a factory, of course, over time theyre going to get safer, cheaper and smaller. But our nation, with the Labor government talking about industry and innovation and being smart—well, theyre not smart enough, nor are they courageous enough to see the bleeding obvious right in front of their face and be part of it. No, well get left behind. Itll be yet another product we import.We had other statements—for instance, the Prime Minister said, You wouldnt bring a rock of uranium in here; please dont do that. All that does is spell out how ignorant he is of it. Uranium-235 is about 0.7 of one per cent radioactive. To make it work, you have to upscale it. It needs to go to about four or five per cent to use in small modular reactor, and if you wanted it in a nuclear weapon youd have to take it to 90 per cent, which is incredibly difficult. So, unless you intend to eat it, or break it down with nitric acid and inject it, then youve got no problems with it.","Treasury Laws Amendment (Electric Car Discount) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[1]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[2]","N/A","N/A"

The most recent application approved by the United States was for NuScales 77-megawatt small modular reactor, built in the factory. One of them would do Tamworth. People say, Where will you have them? Where you currently have power stations would be the most logical position. So you dont have to build myriad transmission lines across the area.The nuclear issue, believe you me, is vastly more palatable to regional areas than what is going on now. In the town of Walcha, 550 wind towers are going up around the town, turning it into an industrial park. It is the only thing you can find that will bring the Greens, the Nationals, Labor supporters and the Independents all into the same room, basically saying, What is the inspiration to turn our area into an industrial park? Its not what we had in mind. You need about 50 acres for one wind tower. Because its an intermittent source, they are about 33 per cent effective and they commercialise out at around two per cent. So you would need about 20 wind towers, even if they were 100 per cent reliable. But, because they are not, you are going to need in the vicinity of 60 wind towers and more—in fact, some reports talk about hundreds—to take the place of one small modular reactor.The NuScale reactor is 20 metres high and 2.7 metres wide. The Rolls Royce one is 16 metres high and 4.5 metres wide. They come in on the back of a truck and, when they are removed, they are moved out on the back of a truck.","Treasury Laws Amendment (Electric Car Discount) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[1]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[16]","N/A","N/A"

If all you want to do is be the caravan of polling, then we dont need a government; we can just do it online.This area is pertinent. If you are going to go to a zero-emission process, there will be this huge requirement that is going to come onto the grid. Look at the peak hour traffic and ask yourself this question: when all these vehicles become electric—which is apparently what you want—how on earth are we going to charge them? They all go to work during the day—and maybe they will have charging facilities or maybe not—and then they go home at night and they are going to charge them up. How is that going to work? You dont have the capacity in the grid to do it.As even AEMO is saying, we are on the edge of a collapse of the grid. We are on the edge of it not being able to deal with the issues, because our baseload is going off. You have to keep a grid at about 49 hertz for the capacity to stay up. If it goes down, it doesnt just go down for an hour; it can go down for days. If that happens—I think this is something we would both agree—politically, that would be a disaster. We have to make sure that we have the capacity to keep the grid alive.If you want zero technology, the obvious baseload, zero technology is nuclear. All these countries are not stupid. We are the stupid ones. They are developing the technology, and they will be the beneficiaries. In the United Kingdom, they are looking at this bringing about $250 billion a year into the marketplace—and they want a bite of that cherry, but we do not. We dont make electric cars. We dont make motor vehicles anymore. We dont manufacture many things, and here we have the capacity to go into an area where you have high-paying technical jobs. But, apparently, we dont want to be part of high-paying technical jobs. Weve got to import the electric cars and, in due course, we will import the small modular reactors.It will be an absurdity if you go to Fiji or to Papua New Guinea and see them. You will be able to anywhere around the world and see them. They will be made in factories from South Korea to China, the United Kingdom, Finland, the United States, Argentina—Argentina is going around us—Romania and, obviously, France, and were just going to be left behind. Were just going to be left behind, and were going to be sitting in the chamber saying how stupid Skoda, Rolls-Royce, Hyundai, Hitachi, Westinghouse, General Electric, NuScale, Atkins, Amec and the University of Manchester are.

342,0,0,0,1,2,"Hill, Julian MP",86256,"Bruce","ALP","N/A",1288," That was a treat. Im glad I arrived early. It was an interesting mix of facts and fiction. Its kind of peak irony, isnt it—having the member for New England here talking about making foolish statements in the parliament. Thats a direct quote. I was listening carefully. I think he said the electricity grid is close to collapse and were a dumb country because we dont make cars here anymore. If only youd been in government for the last 10 years, you might have been able to do something about this! What happened to the car industry? They were chased out of Australia—bye, bye, car industry. I think that was your government, Member for New England. The point of a government is to lead, apparently. This is what he told the chamber just there: the point of a government is to lead. If only hed been in government for the last 10 years and could have done anything about all of these problems! I think, Minister, you walked in just as he was explaining to the parliament that its really not such a dumb idea to bring uranium into the chamber. Its just like a lump of coal. The two are the same, and that would be fine.Just when you thought the Libs couldnt get any weirder—even putting aside that contribution from the National Party—they do this: the party of tax cuts is here to oppose a tax cut on electric vehicles. It proves, I think, the point we heard yesterday in question time. There were a few good points made yesterday in question time. They are really the party of dregs and leftovers from the previous government. Theres a pattern, isnt there? Just in the first few months since the election, they refused to turn up to the Jobs and Skills Summit. They oppose at every turn clean, green, renewable energy to put downwards pressure on power prices. They pretend that secret ministries dont really matter. If you thought that they were weird, there are the secret ministries—the strangest thing since Sir Prince Philip.This bill to cut tax on electric vehicles—the Treasury Laws Amendment (Electric Car Discount) Bill 2022—is good for motorists, its good for employers and its good for climate action. The FBT exemption will apply to battery electric cars, hydrogen fuel cells and plug-in hybrids, with savings of up to $9,000 a year. I think its $4,700 if youre buying it as an individual with salary sacrifice or novated leases.I had correspondence about this bill. It was one of the first things in the first sitting week of parliament. Booran Motors, a local business, emailed me and said: Is this election promise going to happen? When are you going to do it? I said, Well, Ive got a good answer for you: were introducing a bill into the parliament today. They said, Is it going to pass the parliament? I made a mistake. I said to them, Well, Im sure itll pass the parliament, because I couldnt imagine a world where the opposition, the party of tax cuts, would oppose a tax cut on electric vehicles. But Im going to have to contact Booran Motors. I visited them a couple of weeks ago to have a chat to understand. They got out the schedules. They explained how their novated leases work. They showed me the flow-through calculations, and actually the calculations they had were more optimistic than yours. They said its going to incentivise employers and consumers to choose electric vehicles. So I apologise publicly for misadvising them, thinking that the opposition might support a tax cut on electric vehicles.For the last decade, weve had this failing Liberal government actively working to hold Australia back and stop us embracing the future. They were running these disingenuous fear campaigns while the rest of the world raced ahead. Electric vehicles, according to the former Prime Minister, were going to end the weekend. No-one would be able to tow a trailer. I learnt something else from you in question time yesterday, Minister: the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party told Australians on radio, very firmly, that there was no firm in the world that manufactures electric utes. Well, thats not true, is it? To quote you, Minister, there are just a few small boutique firms: Mitsubishi, Ford and General Motors.A government member: Startups!","Treasury Laws Amendment (Electric Car Discount) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[1]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr HILL (Bruce) ","(10:40):"
343,0,0,0,1,2,"MemberContinuation",86256,"N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Mr HILL: Startups—thats right. Anyway, Im sure shell walk in and correct herself. But Australians understand far more than the opposition. They understand that electric vehicles are the way forward.But lets be frank, with a couple of comments. Australia is currently the dumping ground, disgracefully, for the worlds most polluting cars. As the member for New England reminded us, we dont make cars here anymore, because the former government chased them away. But the multinational car manufacturers dump their most polluting vehicles in Australia, and thats because were the only country in the OECD that has no fuel efficiency standards and none under production. Theres one developed country, I think, which is Russia, that also has no fuel efficiency standards, but it got kicked out of the OECD. So its such illustrious company that were in! We are the dumping ground.Too many Australians who are trying to buy an electric vehicle quickly at the moment cant get one quickly. Theres not enough supply. Weve been left behind because of this low intake, because theres no incentive for the manufacturers to send their cars to Australia. Why would they? They can keep selling polluting vehicles that no-one else in the developed world will buy now. Thats the reason Australians cant get a supply of electric vehicles. Frankly, were a pimple on the backside of the global car market, and there are no proper incentives for them to increase supply because were a small market, were a right-hand-drive vehicle market and, as I said, we have the worst vehicle emission standards in the developed world. So just keep sending em along! Its illustrious company, isnt it? That was possibly your finest moment in question time—nyet zero—thank you, Minister! But the hard reality is we are largely irrelevant to the major car manufacturers, especially at the moment, with the global supply chain difficulties, which affect everyone, but thats then compounded by the lack of fuel efficiency standards and our terrible policy settings.Now, the manufacturers wont say it like that; theyre very polite people. Theyll nod, theyll talk about delays in chips and theyll say, Its a very tough world out there, and were doing our best. But that is the fact. That is what the industry bodies will tell you. That is what the industry analysts will tell you. It doesnt matter how polite the manufacturers are; until we fix our policy settings and provide some proper incentives for them to change their behaviour and send more electric cars our way, were not going to get them. Australians are not going to be able to get the clean technology that will cut their fuel bills or remove their fuel bills, depending on the technology they choose. That is the cold hard truth. So were going to need a range of policy changes to embrace the future and make sure Australians can access clean technology and electric cars more rapidly.This bill is therefore one contribution. Its not the whole answer. We had a whole list of problems from the member for New England and other opposition speakers as if they hadnt been in government for the last 10 years. Well, they werent the government for the last 10 years; they were just parading around in the white cars and occupying the offices. They didnt do too much governing. But more work is needed.The electric vehicle discount in this bill is just one key part of the governments Powering Australia Plan which will help to reduce emissions targets by 43 per cent by 2030 and net zero by 2050. In addition, this government will continue to provide the infrastructure for electric vehicles. In answer to some of the legitimate queries that were raised—the thing is its all problems, no solutions. Those opposite spent 10 years talking down the future, avoiding the future, trying to pretend that that wasnt where the world was going, instead of preparing Australia for the future and bringing us there. So theres $500 million to the Driving the Nation Fund to establish 117 fast-charging stations on highways at an average interval of 150 kilometres—that should deal with range anxiety; its well within the range of all electric vehicles—and to create a national hydrogen highways refuelling network.There are also the vehicle emissions standards. The vehicle emissions standards will play an essential role in transforming Australia into a globally competitive market for electric vehicle intake. Australians are currently paying more for petrol and getting less value for the petrol theyre buying than drivers overseas because we dont have those fuel efficiency standards. Now, we do need to be careful and sensible about how this is done. Weve got no choice but to take into account those supply constraints globally and make sure that, as we bring in fuel efficiency standards, electric vehicles will be available to avoid price shocks. Thats something the industry bodies are talking about to those who are interested in these things. This can be done, though, and it can be done sensibly, and we dont need to succumb to idiotic scare campaigns like those run by the previous Prime Minister and, indeed, the now opposition—the dregs of the previous government.Overseas, there are a range of different incentives for manufacturers. I suppose the only good thing I could say about the fact were last in the developed world, the fact were the only country in the OECD not to have fuel efficiency standards—the only positive, if we want to put a positive spin on it—is we have the opportunity to look at what other countries have done, to get there in the most efficient way and make our policy settings the best in the world, informed by everyone elses experience: whos got it right and whos got it wrong.So Im glad the government is undertaking a proper, considered policy process—something alien to the former government. You just stood up and announced stuff because it felt good and it seemed like a good idea and you needed to have something to fill the daily media cycle. You announced stuff. It didnt matter whether it made sense. It didnt matter whether you delivered it. You just announced more stuff. You certainly didnt consult on it or write a discussion paper, put it out to the public and have a proper process—talk to industry, talk to government departments. You didnt do that. Well, thats what were doing. So Im delighted the minister is running a proper policy process. Adult government is back, in the style of Hawke and Keating—governments that ran proper policy processes and exposed themselves to criticism. There will be a discussion paper out within the next month or so, I think, and the policy process will continue.Finally, I just want to acknowledge the strong community support in my area and the work of the South East Councils Climate Change Alliance—councils right across south-east Melbourne who have been advocating for exactly the things the government speakers have been talking about. This bill is good for motorists, good for employers and good for climate action, and I encourage the opposition to get on board.","Treasury Laws Amendment (Electric Car Discount) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[1]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[7]","N/A","N/A"
344,0,0,0,1,2,"van Manen, Bert MP",188315,"Forde","LNP","N/A",1290," Much as I like and admire my colleague the member for Bruce, there was much in his contribution—he would be unsurprised to hear—that I disagree with. One of the things I find interesting in this whole debate is the lack of willingness to dig down into the detail of how we actually get to this point.Ill make the observation at the outset that I have no issue with electric vehicles. As the member for New England said in his contribution on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Electric Car Discount) Bill 2022: if you want to go and buy an electric vehicle, knock yourself out and go and buy one. But I have many, many people in my electorate of Forde who would not even think about buying an electric vehicle, because they cannot afford it. They work in jobs where salary sacrificing and even discussion of fringe benefits is not an option. They wouldnt know what a novated lease or a salary packaging plan is, because they just do not work in industries or in jobs where those opportunities are afforded. So how are they going to benefit from this policy? They are not going to benefit.The worst thing is that, if we continue to go down this road and we continue, over time, to increasingly restrict access to internal-combustion-engine-powered vehicles, and second-hand models of those vehicles, as a consequence, become more expensive, for people on low to moderate incomes in my electorate, their cost of living is not going to go down; it is going to go up, because they will have to pay more for the vehicles that they can afford to buy or that they will increasingly struggle to buy. And increasingly, I would argue, they are going to pay more for fuel for their vehicles. These people will not benefit from this policy. And, at the end of September, this government is not going to continue the fuel excise discount that we instituted when we were last in government. So people in my electorate who are on low to moderate incomes are going to pay double: theyre not going to benefit from this policy, and theyre going to pay higher fuel prices from the end of September. So is it any wonder that we on this side of the House stand here and debate the merits of this policy? Its our responsibility to debate the merits of this policy, when people in electorates like mine and those of my colleagues across this country are going to pay the price of this policy.I would go further and touch on some other claims that were made by the member for Bruce in relation to pollution and the impacts of internal combustion engine vehicles. Ive been around long enough to have seen the massive improvements weve made in the last 30 or 40 years in the level of pollution that comes out of our vehicle fleet, whether it is our cars or our trucks. I can remember many an occasion, driving from Beenleigh into Brisbane, when you couldnt see the skyscrapers in the city of Brisbane because of the smog, because of the pollution. I cant remember when we last had a smog day in Brisbane because of pollution from motor vehicle exhausts. For that matter, I cant remember that happening in Sydney or Melbourne. Do we still have days with smog from bushfires and fog and other things? Yes, we do, but the incidence of those events as a direct result of vehicular pollution today are extraordinarily rare, and that shows me that we as a nation over the past 30 to 40 years have done an extraordinary job in improving the air quality and emissions standards from our vehicles.The other thing that I find interesting in this debate about providing subsidies to electric vehicles is we seem to have gone into an age of subsidy for a whole range of things. As I look back through history—because history is a wonderful teacher about what we can do better or do differently—I question the need to subsidise electric vehicles, because we never subsidised the Model T Ford—","Treasury Laws Amendment (Electric Car Discount) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[1]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr VAN MANEN (Forde—Chief Opposition Whip) ","(10:50):"

I find it increasingly strange that we have to continue to provide these subsidies—or tax cuts, as the Treasurer wants to put it—for new technology when historically weve never had to do that. The market will take care of these things itself as people take the opportunity, and thats why we dont need to take this step.As I said in my earlier remarks, before the Treasurer got here—and he has many people in his electorate in the same socioeconomic situation as mine—they will not benefit from this because they do not work in jobs where they get fringe benefits tax or salary sacrifice arrangements.

The government have said theyre going to invest in the electricity network, but all of that investment comes at a cost. It is a regulated asset, which means a regulated return to those investors, which all reflects in your electricity bills. We might have a saving on one hand of $5,000 through a reduction in the fringe benefits tax, but what are we going to pay in increased electricity bills as a result of this additional investment and the regulated return that that will require on those investments?As I look at this bill and all of the actions that those opposite are taking where they are proposing to reduce the cost of living for everyday Australians, I fail to see how thats actually going to be achieved.

351,0,0,0,1,2,"Gosling, Luke MP",245392,"Solomon","ALP","N/A",1291," Ill keep my contribution short to allow the Treasurer to make some closing remarks. I want to follow up on an opinion piece I wrote in the Northern Territory News recently about fuel gouging in the Northern Territory and introducing our electric car discount, which will remove import duties on electric and low-emission cars. This is one part of our plan to reduce emissions and cut power bills by investing in renewables. The electric car discount will reduce the upfront and ownership costs of electric vehicles, addressing a significant barrier to their uptake. Our government is committed to reducing transport emissions and is making electric cars more affordable for the families and businesses that want them, including in the Northern Territory. Thats why our government is tabling the Treasury Laws Amendment (Electric Car Discount) Bill 2022, fulfilling our election commitment of providing an electric vehicle discount by means of a fringe benefit tax exemption for eligible electric cars that are provided by employers.Currently, the fringe benefits tax is payable when an employer makes available a car, including an electric car, for the private use of an employee. The amendments in this bill exempt from the fringe benefit tax the use of eligible electric cars made available to employees or those who take up a salary sacrifice arrangement. This exemption will apply to battery electric cars, hydrogen fuel cell electric cars and plug-in hybrid electric cars below the luxury car tax threshold for fuel-efficient cars of $84,916 for all vehicles made available for use after 1 July 2022. I welcome these changes, which will ensure that employers providing employees with an eligible electric car will not pay fringe benefits. This is an important measure that will help increase the uptake of electric cars in our nation.These policies are urgent, not only because they are fair to future generations, whose lives will be severely impacted by how we respond to climate change in coming years, but also because they will help Australians, who are facing such strong cost-of-living pressures at the cash register and in their bills. What we have seen in the Territory is fuel retailers gouging, and I am committed to continue putting pressure on them to be fair and honest with Territorians about the massive profits they are making, whilst our government also moves us towards a renewable energy future with this electric car discount.I thank the House for the opportunity to update my constituents. Around the country we have seen that people want to embrace electric vehicles. Not everyone will want an electric vehicle, and that is fine, but more and more people will see that this is the way of the future and that it will result in cheaper bills. I commend the bill to the House.","Treasury Laws Amendment (Electric Car Discount) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[1]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr GOSLING (Solomon) ","(10:58):"
352,0,0,0,1,2,"Chalmers, Jim MP",37998,"Rankin","ALP","N/A",1292," Thank you very much for the opportunity to sum up the debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Electric Car Discount) Bill 2022. I want to genuinely thank members from all sides of the debate for their contribution to it. As we know, the bill amends the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 to provide a fringe benefits tax exemption for eligible electric cars that are made available by employers to employees—so, in effect, a tax cut to make electric vehicles cheaper and also to boost the supply of electric vehicles in our network. The exemption applies to battery electric cars, hydrogen fuel cell electric cars and plug-in hybrid electric cars that are below the luxury car tax threshold for fuel efficient cars. The exemption will apply to fringe benefits arising from the use or availability of an electric car from 1 July this year, provided the car was first made available for use on or after that date. Employers providing employees with an eligible electric car will not have to pay fringe benefit tax on that car, and the cost to employees of entering into salary-sacrificing arrangements in order to lease the car will now be less than it previously would have been.This bill does implement an election commitment from the Albanese government. Its just one part of a much bigger plan to improve the uptake of electric vehicles in Australia, with further measures to be delivered as part of the National Electric Vehicle Strategy, which will be laid out by the Minister for Climate Change and Energy, and the minister for transport and others will have input into that strategy, as will the public, of course. The strategy can also consider matters beyond the scope of vehicle fringe benefits and beyond the remit of this legislation that were considering today—things like charging facilities and other important parts of getting the EV ecosystem right in Australia. The fringe benefits tax exemption will be an ongoing measure, but it will be reviewed after three years, just so that we can make sure that it remains effective and its doing the job that we want it to.This is a significant signal that Australia now has a government that recognises the economic and generational imperative of acting on climate change. It is disappointing but not especially surprising to hear that those opposite dont support a tax cut for electric vehicles, which would bring down the cost of living and also incentivise the types of cars we increasingly want to see on our roads so that we can take climate change seriously but also take the cost of living crisis seriously at the same time.This is a government that understands the opportunities of acting on climate change and of cleaner and cheaper energy and low emission cars. We intend to grab those opportunities for the benefit of the Australian people. This measure were talking about today is good for motorists, employers and their workers, and its good for the environment. All of that makes it good for our country as well. Thats why I commend the bill to the house.","Treasury Laws Amendment (Electric Car Discount) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[1]/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr CHALMERS (Rankin—Treasurer) ","(11:02):"

We are not interested in supporting this particular amendment for the following reasons.What weve got already, in the way that the bill is constructed, is the capacity to build a second-hand market over time by creating that cut-off for second-hand vehicles imported after 1 July this year. We have given some thought to the member for North Sydneys amendment, which would be to bring that cut-off date further back into history to allow for some older cars to come into the market. I do understand and appreciate why the member for North Sydney, who comes to this with the best possible motivations around electric vehicles, would like to do that. We feel like the most appropriate place to draw the line is at 1 July, and that will mean that over time, as time passes from that 1 July cut-off going forward, there will be more second-hand vehicles brought into the system, and that will be a good thing.The way we understand it is that most lease providers are unlikely to offer older imported second-hand vehicles to employees, and this measure is relatively narrowly cast around the leasing arrangements for employers providing these cars to employees. But, as weve indicated privately and are very happy to indicate publicly, as part of the National Electric Vehicle Strategy, which the Minister for Climate Change and Energy, in conjunction with the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, me and others, will be consulting on broadly, we would consider the kinds of suggestions made by the member for North Sydney and others as part of that broader strategy. But, for the time being, our interest is in locking down this deadline as weve proposed it in the legislation before us. And so, unfortunately, and respectfully, we wont be supporting the amendment.","Treasury Laws Amendment (Electric Car Discount) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[2]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr CHALMERS (Rankin—Treasurer) ","(11:15):"

364,0,0,0,1,2,"Claydon, Sharon MP",248181,"Newcastle","ALP","N/A",1294," It is an honour to be able to rise in this chamber today to speak to a condolence motion marking the passing of the Hon. Robert James—or Bob, as we all knew him—Brown AM.Bob was so committed to political life that he actually served in all three levels of government. He was first an alderman and mayor to Cessnock City Council—and I know my good colleague the member for Paterson, who is in this chamber, would be all too familiar with the work of Bob Brown in her part of the world, just as we were in Newcastle. As I said, he first served in the Cessnock City Council as an alderman—as we called them in those days—and then later as mayor. He became mayor in 1968, I believe, and then he served again, a second stint, there at Cessnock council from 1974 through to 1980.He then became the state member for Cessnock, where he dutifully served from 1970 to 1980, a decade, at Macquarie Street, in Sydney. He resigned as the state member in order to contest the federal seat of Hunter, which he won. He served in this House of Representatives from 1980 to 1984, and later he was elected as the federal member for the very newly formed seat of Charlton, which he held until he retired in 1998. Im sure there are some people—perhaps my good friend sitting opposite—who might recall serving in parliament with Bob in those days.During his tenure as the federal member for both the Hunter and Charlton, Bob was elevated to the position of Minister for Land and Transport under the Hawke and Keating governments from 1988 through to 1993. He was a lover of the Land and Transport portfolio and made a lot of contributions during that time—way too many to list. Perhaps some of my colleagues might go through those. In addition to his extraordinary political career, spanning all three levels of government and decades of service, Bob was also a teacher both in profession and in life. He travelled vast distances across Australia to teach. He did a placement in Deniliquin in the New South Wales Riverina area, as well as in many other local high schools. He also did a two-year stint as a deputy principal in New South Wales.Above all, Bob was such a passionate man for his community and, indeed, his family. He was involved in literally everything. I recall him being a very active member in the Lions Club and the footy club, he was a life patron of the Australian Workers Heritage Centre, he was director of the Kurri Kurri Hospital—a project I know he held very dear to his heart—and a member of the Hunter District Water Board. He even founded a local museum to preserve the rich heritage of the Hunter region, which was renamed earlier this year in his honour—and very rightfully so. In 2007 he was named in the Queens Birthday honours for his service to the Australian parliament, particularly in the area of transport policy and for his service to the community of the Hunter region through local government, his works in heritage, and his contribution to a number of sporting organisations and economics education. He was a teacher his whole life, regardless of what title or profession he held.Bob now rests with his wife, Joy, and I extend my sincere condolences to the entire family, including the grandchildren and great-grandchildren. He had a very rich and full family life indeed. Today I speak particularly to Bobs son, Brad, and his daughter, Kelly Hoare, who also served in this parliament as the member for Charlton and gave me a break as a very young woman wanting to get some experience. She took me on as a casual in her electorate office in Charlton, and I am very indebted to her for that opportunity as well. Kelly Hoare went on to succeed her father as the member for Charlton in this place.I hope that the family take some heart in knowing that our local communities and Bobs colleagues in this place are paying tribute to him but also thinking very dearly of his legacy and his family that remains with us. We have the utmost respect for Bob, his perseverance, and his unwaning dedication to politics in our region, and for that we will always be very deeply thankful. May he rest in peace.","Brown, Hon.

365,0,0,0,1,2,"Swanson, Meryl Jane MP",264170,"Paterson","ALP","N/A",1294," It is with great sadness and great pride that I stand here today to pay tribute to Bob Brown, as he was so fondly known to all of us in our local area. I want to acknowledge my friend and colleague the member for Newcastle and say that the Browns, in their way, have touched so many of us across the Hunter. Brown is a name synonymous with the Hunter. Rather than repeat many of the facts that have been given about Bob, Id like to share a couple of my own personal stories of interactions with him and how he influenced not only me but my community and my family.Bob was born in Pelaw Main, in the now seat of Paterson, and he married and raised a family in Kurri Kurri. I remember the house where he and Joy lived with Kelly and Brad. Wed always drive past Bob and Joys house. Bob was a teacher at Kurri high, where I went to school and where my sisters went to school. My eldest sister, Adele Johns, said that Bob was the most influential teacher in her life. And thats really saying something. Adele finished school in year 11. She didnt actually matriculate, as you did in those days. Shes a little bit older than me, 18 years my senior. She went on to work and had a career. But, later in life, she went back and did an enabling program at the University of Newcastle and her HSC and qualified as a speech pathologist. But it was Bob who sparked that fire for learning, and she credits him with that.Bob used to come to our school as the federal member. I can still remember him standing in front of us all in the assembly hall on Benefactors Day, regaling us with stories of our history, what he was doing in parliament and how we mattered as kids from Kurri high. He lit that fire in me for politics. I will never, never be able to thank him enough. I was enamoured by Bob. I truly loved him. I thought he was spectacular. Then, after I was successfully elected as the member for Paterson, he continued to correspond with me. Id see him at functions. Indeed, we were at the inauguration and blessing of the memorial gates at Pelaw Main primary school, where hed gone to school. He told me so many stories about growing up in Pelaw Main.He was immensely proud of our area. He also had a great love and affection for working people, particularly those who worked in our coal industry. He was, of course, a giant of a man in terms of his intellect. Even just a few months ago, when his body—Im sure he wont mind me saying it—was starting to fail him, his mobility was in question but his mind was incredible. He stood at the opening of the new Sir Edgeworth David Memorial Museum at Abermain, the old school of the arts, and named every colliery and pit head that had existed. In granular detail, he gave the geology of the area. This was a man whose mind did not fail him. He was quite remarkable. I said to him that day, Bob, you never cease to amaze me, and he said, Well, Meryl, life and learning is the thing thats amazing. His great gift was the love of learning and passing it on to the rest of us.Bob left a long legacy in terms of his service to his community; thats absolutely undisputed. He planted the seeds and were all now reaping the benefits of that harvest. He created in many people, not just me, a love of community and a love of service to that community, and a hunger for learning and a hunger to make our area, whatever area, better. He did that right up until his very last days. I spent time with him and Joy when he visited her nearly every day in Salamander when her health was failing. They reflected on a life of adventure across regional New South Wales as young teachers and having children, and Bob writing economics textbooks. Joy, in her own right, was a leader as well and a person of great intellect. I feel that the Brown legacy will live on not only in Kelly and Brad, who have their own wonderful achievements and their own wonderful families. It just goes to show that you can leave a lasting, deep and meaningful legacy in public life, but often in ways that you will never know or know of. May he rest in peace. Good on you, Bob.","Brown, Hon. Robert James (Bob), AM","CONDOLENCES","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms SWANSON (Paterson) ","(11:29):"

Bob Brown AM, the former member for Charlton and Hunter. Having served in this place as the member for Charlton myself—in fact, as the last member for Charlton—I know what an honour it is to be a voice for the constituents of Charlton in this place. Unfortunately, the seat of Charlton was renamed Hunter in the 2016 redistribution, and there is no member for Charlton currently in the House. At that time, I became the member for Shortland, and my colleague the member for Hunter now represents about 55 per cent of the constituents of the old Charlton, while I represent about 25 percent, and the rest are in the member for Newcastles electorate.Although I did not know Bob personally, his reputation precedes him. I could go to any meeting of the mighty West Wallsend branch of the Labor Party and the presence and legacy of Bob was always there. He was a fierce advocate for the working people he represented in this place, and he had an abiding commitment to the Labor movement—both its industrial and political wings.Id like to acknowledge Bobs service at all three levels of government that we have in our federation: his time as a councillor and mayor of Cessnock; his time as state member for Cessnock; and his federal service as a member for Hunter from 1980 to 1984 and then as member for Charlton from 1984 until his retirement in 1998. Not many Australians have such a love of public service as to serve at all three levels of government. Id also like to recognise Bobs ministerial career, serving as Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support from 1988 to 1990, and thereafter as Minister for Land Transport until 1993.Bobs service was recognised in 2007, when he was named a Member of the Order of Australia for his service to the Australian parliament, particularly in the area of transport policy; to the community of the Hunter region through his local government, heritage and sporting organisations; and to economics education. Being an economist myself by training, I would say that the people of Charlton certainly benefited from having Bob in this place. I know that he wrote the economics textbook that was the official textbook for the New South Wales school system.His commitment to his community and the great Australian Labor Party was evident from his first speech in this House, on 2 December 1980, when he said:May I say how privileged I feel in the first place to be able to represent the electors of Hunter and people in the wider community as the member for Hunter. I am proud to represent people with whom I have been personally associated for so long. I am here to represent people to whom I feel personally and politically committed because of their allegiance and loyalty to the Australian Labor Party and to the aspirations of the Labor movement.I also note his selfless commitment to the party, when after the sweetest victory of all—A division having been called in the House of Representatives—Sitting suspended from 11 : 38 to 11 : 5 6","Brown, Hon.

367,0,0,0,1,2,"MemberContinuation",249127,"N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Mr CONROY: As I was saying, Bob Browns dedication to his constituents was further evidenced in his statement outlining his reasons for standing aside from the ministry in 1993, where he said:I will have the opportunity to concentrate on my own electorate and on some areas of special interest. I express my appreciation to the ALP members and to my constituents in the Charlton electorate for their continued support and loyalty.Mr Deputy Speaker, it wont shock you to know that members of the Australian Labor Party are dedicated to the cause of the labour movement and for workers ability to collectively organise for decent pay and conditions. We will always fight for the rights of workers, and Bob Brown certainly exemplified this. Bob Brown, when talking about the waterfront dispute in 1998, told parliament:Scabs are people who betray their fellow workers. They sabotage industrial action which is taken by organised workers to improve their circumstances, consolidate their gains or protect their wages and conditions. Scabs are thieves who try to improve their own position by stealing from other workers. They steal their jobs and their incomes and, in the process, seek to feed their own families with food they steal from the tables of others.I would be interested in knowing what Bob would say about the current conflict with GrainCorp in the port of Newcastle who are looking at using strikebreaking workforces during their negotiations of the new enterprise agreement right now.In the same speech, Bob went on to refer to the often violent birth of the Australian trade union movement, where workers were shot and killed by police at coalmines and wharves, and said:To those who say those events were long ago, I say that we have recently seen the vile images of balaclava hooded thugs in black suits with their rottweilers, alsatians and mace sprays, as well as the darkened buses with the shrouded windows smuggling scabs on to the wharves and the mine sites. They are foul, vile, gut-wrenching images that despoil our humanity.This passion was a product of the minefields and the coalfields of the Hunter Valley, where workers risked their livelihoods and often their lives to advance conditions such as workplace safety, where workers were shot and maimed and, in one instance, killed for taking industrial action to protect the community. This is where Bob came from, and Bob lived those values each and every day on this planet. Bobs passion for the rights of workers to collectively bargain is incredibly evident in those words.I also want to reflect on and pay tribute to Bobs activism in the movement against the Vietnam War. In recognising the service of his predecessor, Bert James, Bob stated in his first speech:Bert James was one of the most forthright and courageous members of the Federal Parliament and, among many of those great issues which he pursued, probably the most courageous stand which he adopted was in relation to the horrific experience of the Vietnam War. The position which Bert James adopted has been completely vindicated.

John stood against Bob in the preselection for the seat of Hunter in 1980, and John recalls that Bob was something of a hero locally in the late 1960s because of his brilliant organising and activism, particularly in organising marches against the Vietnam War around the Hunter.I will end my contribution by sending Bobs family my condolences and also our best wishes and thanks for his service.

373,0,0,0,1,2,"Gosling, Luke MP",245392,"Solomon","ALP","N/A",1297," On 30 August the last leader of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, died in Moscow at the age of 91. Those who remember or have heard about how tense the late Cold War was in the seventies and eighties may remember Gorbachev as the fearsome name and face of the USSR. It is important to note that Gorbachev, a Communist Party faithful who rose to be general secretary in 1985, was no pushover or pro-Western, as critics have claimed. Gorbachev did all he could to preserve and expand the power of the Soviet Union. When he spoke of restructuring Moscows foreign policy and its economy and of bringing transparency to its society, Gorbachev envisaged the Soviet party state that had emerged from the 1917 revolution growing its industry and military capabilities to keep contesting the Cold War.In 1986 Gorbachev made a landmark speech in Russias Pacific Fleet headquarters of Vladivostok that signalled that only the tone of Russian strategic policy had changed. This speech and the constant port visits of Soviet submarines into the South Pacific sent shockwaves through Canberra. Many of our hard-nosed defence planners worried that the Soviet Union had overcome Australias area denial strategy in the Pacific. But, as we know from history, Gorbachevs social and economic reforms unleashed forces that had long been heavily repressed by the brutal hand of the Soviet state. Gorbachevs legacy is defined by what he did next.When the non-Russian peoples of the Soviet Union began agitating for independence, Gorbachev, a committed Leninist, hesitated. At first, protesters were violently repressed in Georgia, but when the contagion of freedom which he had caused spread to the Baltic states, Gorbachev backed down. The Baltic states are free today thanks to this decision. He resisted the pressure from his security apparatus and every instinct of the Soviet state to crush any open threats to the partys monopoly over power. Russian nationalists to this day resent this decision for destroying Russias sphere of influence in Europe and for fatally undermining the Soviet Union itself. But, from my perspective, Gorbachev should also be remembered as a proponent of freedom who helped to end the costly Cold War.Gorbachev would later visit Australia in 2006 to lobby the Howard government to sign the Kyoto protocol. We know from our former ambassador to Russia Peter Tesch, who bought him his first Akubra, that Gorbachev was curious about Australias prosperous, multicultural society that didnt throw its weight around against its neighbours.Mikhail Gorbachev remains a divisive figure amongst Westerners, Russians and Ukrainians. Gorbachevs memory is painful for many Ukrainians because of his share of responsibility in the 1986 Chernobyl disaster and because he endorsed Russias 2014 annexation of Crimea. But we also know from witnesses that, to his dying day, Gorbachev was crushed by the war in Ukraine—as all of us are in this place. As the war escalated earlier this year, a sick Gorbachev called for an end to the hostilities.Among his remarkable acts of statesmanship and courage was his decision to unilaterally withdraw half a million Soviet troops from Germany and eastern Europe. Thats a force eight times the size of the ADF. He chose to withdraw them rather than unilaterally keeping Soviet forces dominating half of Europe, as many of his advisers wanted to do. Those who criticise him in modern Russia say that Gorbachev was tricked by the West into selling out Russias interests. But, in a 2014 interview, Gorbachev, who was himself closely involved in these negotiations with the US, rejected the idea that the West had deceived him into withdrawing troops. Still, Gorbachev was given no state funeral in Russia.But, as we remember his life, let us keep in mind not only his contribution to the only period in history in which Russians briefly tasted real freedom for one generation; let us also remember his lasting contribution to international peace and security, and to Australias security by extension of that. Dmitry Muratov, a Nobel Peace Prize winner who knew Gorbachev well, recalled that he refused to press the nuclear attack button even for simulated attacks during training. We can only hope that this spirit will guide the leaders of nuclear weapons states who weigh such huge responsibilities. Vale, Mikhail Gorbachev.","Gorbachev, Mikhail Sergeyevich","CONDOLENCES","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr GOSLING (Solomon) ","(12:16):"
374,0,0,0,1,2,"Stevens, James MP",176304,"Sturt","LP","N/A",1298," I rise to commemorate the life of Mikhail Gorbachev and the remarkable things that happened, particularly at the end of his tenure as the chairman of the Politburo and leader of the USSR. It is in the context of the very heartbreaking circumstances in the former USSR that we see before us right now—the Russian aggression against and invasion of Ukraine, and the circumstances in that part of the world, which are very disappointing. It didnt have to be that way, because the opportunity was there when the Iron Curtain fell, and then when the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics disintegrated into its constituent parts and became various forms of new democracies, for Russia, in particular, to have followed the path of countries like West Germany and Japan, which, having been adversaries to the peaceful Western world order, have now joined it and are some of the strongest members of it. What a different place the planet would be right now if Russia had followed the path of the now united Germany—West Germany for a long period of time, until the fall of the Berlin Wall—and Japan. That is the great lost geopolitical opportunity that the United States, in particular, and the Clinton administration have to bear responsibility for. It is heartbreaking that that moment of excitement at the fall of the Soviet Union has resulted in a very different outcome.Nonetheless, Gorbachev was—I was reflecting on this just a moment ago—probably the last significant global figure of the 20th century who was involved in events like the Cold War who has finally passed away. Its an opportunity to reflect on him but also on that era. I was born in 1983, so I dont remember those things in real time, but I know through studies and an interest in global politics, which we all invariably have if we end up serving in the federal parliament.That era that Gorbachev was a part of was a remarkable period of time—a relieving period of time. A previous contribution, from the member for Solomon, pointed out the very different way in which things could have transpired if Gorbachev had been a different type of person to the one he was. He was not to be universally admired, and things happened on his watch and under the regime that he led that were deplorable and disgusting, including, clearly, acts of violence by the regime that he headed, and the death of innocent people.But, comparatively, were very lucky that Gorbachev became the General Secretary of the Communist Party, and were very lucky that, compared to what others in that same position could have done, he saw the peaceful destruction of that Communist regime and, therefore, the end of the Cold War-the end of a period in which the spectre of nuclear war was ever present in peoples minds until that point. Even though we unfortunately still have nuclear weapons and worst-case scenarios present here in 2022, there certainly was a dramatic de-escalation, thanks to Gorbachevs engagement and involvement with President Reagan, in particular, in the nuclear stockpiles and defensive build-up of the USSR, and, commensurately, of the United States—and from us being in a situation with those two powers constantly and very closely potentially triggering one another for the unthinkable to unfold. That never happened, thankfully. Thanks to Gorbachev, the risk of those two powers ultimately triggering something like that event disappeared when one of the two potential trigger fingers was gone.So I pay tribute to Gorbachev and the impact that he had on the 20th century. Im very pleased that he became the leader and led, particularly through perestroika and other measures, the destruction of that Communist regime. I note the bitter disappointment that what could have come out of that—a Russian democratic republic that was a member of the Western world, seeing its future through free and open trade, economic advancement and democracy, and being a part of a responsible world order—did not manifest. Thats not really Gorbachevs fault, because it could have occurred. Disappointingly and depressingly, it did not, and we see the unfortunate reality of that with whats happening in Ukraine. But we should still pay tribute to him, with the very significant caveat that there were a lot of things that he was associated with that we should also deplore and criticise.

Im very proud to be part of a federal Labor government that is willing to roll up its sleeves and take on that challenge, because it is part of our commitment to a fairer, more equal society and to not leave anyone behind.We know it is harder than it has ever been before to access a bulk-billing local GP, and for most people its almost impossible to have a regular bulk-billing GP to look after their health needs, even if they have a chronic health need. One of the changes that have already been implemented in the first 110 days or so of this new government is an election commitment that my community of Dunkley fought very hard to get, which is to change the distribution priority area allocations so that our communitys general practices can now more easily recruit doctors to work in our outer suburban electorate. It means that locals needing to see a doctor will be able to access health care when they need it. For the clinics, particularly those operating in areas like Carrum Downs, Karingal and Langwarrin, the change in classification will give them more opportunities to recruit and retain doctors.As a government, were also strengthening Medicare and the PBS so that more people can afford the medications they need to stay healthy. The burden of worrying about the price of accessing sometimes life-saving or life-extending medication will be significantly reduced, which is so important right now with the cost-of-living pressures that are on everyone but that impact even more on people who are already struggling to make ends meet.The National Health Amendment (General Co-payment) Bill 2022, which was introduced yesterday, will mean that, for the first time in its 75-year history, the maximum cost of general scrips under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will fall. It is truly great news for so many people living in my community, a wonderful area with wonderful people but a community that struggles with rates of chronic disease that are higher than those in other communities across Victoria and, in many cases, across the country. This legislation means that someone taking one medication a month will save $150 every year. A family with two or three medications will save between $300 and $450 a year, not an insignificant amount for many families in my community.The maximum cost to general patients for PBS medications has doubled since 2000, and there had been no help before this federal Labor government was elected. The ABS advises that the high cost of medicines meant close to one million Australians delayed or didnt fill their medication prescriptions in 2019-20. Thats why these changes are important, and its why we are making them—to put about $200 million back in the pockets of Australians every year and to make sure that people who regularly need to take medications can take them and not then worry about how theyre going to put food on the table or buy schoolbooks, school shoes and sporting equipment for their children. We know those are some of the decisions that people often face, particularly women.Im very proud to be part of an Albanese government that is making medicines cheaper, making it easier to get bulk-billing GPs and making it easier for people like Stella in my electorate—an excellent young woman who has type 1 diabetes—to be able to afford CGM technology. These are the sorts of things that truly change peoples lives, and we have to keep doing more of this and the systemic changes that I know are to come for a better, healthier, fairer society.","Health Care","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[1]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms MURPHY (Dunkley) ","(12:29):"
376,0,0,0,1,2,"Watson-Brown, Elizabeth MP",300127,"Ryan","AG","N/A",1299," During my election campaign and in the months since the election, numerous residents in the seat of Ryan have reached out to me with their problems with getting decent broadband internet to their home. I spoke to some residents recently who, while paying for 140 Mbps speeds, are likely to get 30 to 60 Mbps and experience repeated dropouts of five or more minutes every single day. I have spoken to locals in Ryan from Kenmore, Kenmore Hills and Chapel Hill who are working from home as software developers and as researchers. We have locals trying to run small businesses out of their home. They all rely on this crucial infrastructure for their livelihood and to contribute to our society and economy. But they are struggling because, when the NBN was rolled out, it was delivered as fibre to the node not to the premises. Data travels rapidly along good quality broadband infrastructure until it reaches a node, say 100 metres from someones house, after which it hits ancient and slow copper infrastructure that basically renders the new infrastructure useless.Upgrades to the premises are taking place around the country; yet places like Kenmore Hills arent on the list, and locals want to know why. When locals have asked NBN Co if they could have this upgrade done, they were told that they would have to pay $14,000, at a minimum, each. The electorate of Ryan needs a comprehensive rollout of the upgrade to FTTP, and they need it now, and it shouldnt come out of the pockets of everyday locals. I think its a national disgrace that we have such abysmal internet and that we treat our citizens, who simply want the basics they need to operate in the modern world, like they are asking for some kind of luxury good. New Zealand has better internet speeds than Australia, as have China, India and Kazakhstan. So how is it that we in Australia, one of the wealthiest countries in the world per capita, have some of the worst internet going around?We all remember how the Liberals under Malcom Turnbull torpedoed the NBN when they ripped up the original plan of delivering fibre to the premises and replaced it with the significantly inferior fibre-to-the-node model—and now were paying the price. But the problem runs deeper than that. When Labor initiated NBN Co, they tried to move the expenditure for it off the governments books. So they set it up as an independent commercial entity with a corporate structure ready for privatisation that had to partially finance itself through borrowing on the private markets. This led NBN Co to become a particularly profit-hungry entity, having to begin generating significant revenue well before it even finished its initial rollout.NBN CEO Stephen Rue makes $3 million a year and the chairman of the NBN board is the previous CEO of Telstra. It sounds a bit like a corporation to me. And that is what people in Ryan have told me—that interacting with NBN Co feels like interacting with the most opaque and inhuman private corporation. If you wanted to look back further, you could say that the privatisation of Telstra that was prepared by Labor under Keating and completed under Howard laid the foundation for this terrible mess. If Telstra had remained a genuine public entity, we could have rolled out high-quality broadband through Telstra in a planned way where no-one was left behind and nothing was done on the cheap.That is the past, though. How do we fix this tangled web of telecommunications errors now? Firstly, we need an immediate speed-up of the NBN fibre-to-the-premises upgrade, with more investment and a commitment to total coverage. Suburbs in my electorate like Kenmore Hills need to be put on the rollout plan and they need to be given a clear time frame. Secondly, we need to do away with the idea that the corporate model is the best vehicle for delivering key infrastructure. While the government have said that they have shelved the idea of privatising the NBN for now, it is little comfort when NBN Co acts like a giant corporation already. I think key infrastructure like telecommunications needs to be in public hands and not run for profit. It needs to be properly funded and democratically accountable.","Broadband","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms WATSON-BROWN (Ryan) ","(12:34):"

These beaches, rich in natural beauty, represent relaxation, fun and happy memories. Im sure that many of the members here today in the chamber can think of a time from their childhood, or even more recently, when they have enjoyed all that our glorious beaches have to offer. Yet these very beaches, which represent so much happiness, can also become dangerous environments for visitors and swimmers, especially to those people unfamiliar with the beach or with limited knowledge of the constantly changing water conditions. I am very proud of the many surf lifesaving clubs across Australia, especially in my electorate of Robertson, that ensure visitors to our pristine and magnificent beaches are kept safe and out of danger.In the Central Coast region there are approximately 15 surf lifesaving clubs, all with their own unique challenges and advantages. In total, there are 8,332 active members of Surf Life Saving Central Coast. I would like to particularly acknowledge Club of the Year for 2022, and my former Nippers club, Umina Beach SLSC, who were awarded this title because of their continued demonstration of excellence in governance, lifesaving, education, membership and surf spots. Umina SLSC were followed by Avoca Beach Surf Life Saving Club, who took out second place.In the electorate of Robertson, we are home to nine of these clubs, from Umina Beach, Ocean Beach and Killcare in the south, to Macmasters Beach, Copacabana and Avoca in the middle, to North Avoca, Terrigal and, finally, Wamberal in the north. Every summer, volunteers from all nine of these surf clubs patrol, ensure safety and provide rescue operations when the call arrives. Without these brilliant and hardworking surf lifesaving clubs, our beaches would be very different places to be and a lot less safe for swimmers. To all our courageous and tireless surf lifesaving volunteers, a big thankyou from me, the people of Robertson and the people of Australia. Your service is so appreciated and never goes unnoticed.Im pleased to be a member of the Parliamentary Friends of Surf Life Saving and to join with parliamentary colleagues to support the efforts of surf lifesaving clubs and surf life savers across our great country to improve the relationship between government and these clubs.Further, I was honoured yesterday to be given the privilege and the honour of presenting life savers from Robertson, from the Avoca Beach Surf Life Saving Club, with special certificates and recognition after a heroic rescue operation that occurred at the start of this year. On Saturday 15 January 2022, five- to eight-foot waves, strong currents and onshore winds made Avoca Beach hazardous. A group of four swimmers lost their footing and were swept out to sea. Surf life savers responded immediately, entering the water on rescue boards to retrieve the swimmers. A fifth patient was then seen struggling to keep their head above water and was swiftly rescued, as a further three swimmers became caught in the rip. More swimmers were rapidly being swept into danger at various locations along the beach. With each rescue board supporting up to four patients, the surf life savers worked hard to keep the patients safe and calm until the IRB could transport them back to the beach. In total 14 people were rescued by surf life savers. Without their vigilance, bravery and coordinated efforts, the outcome could have been multiple fatalities.I thank every life saver that took part this rescue operation and commend the club on ensuring that no fatalities were recorded on this day. My thanks go to the following Avoca Beach SLSC life savers who took place in the rescue: Brett, Peter, Vincent, Paul, Andrew, Andrew, Chris, George, Stuart and Lynette. I look forward to visiting the Avoca Beach Surf Life Saving Club and personally thanking the hardworking and dedicated members who were not able to be recognised yesterday. Finally, in this coming summer season, remember, if youre at the beach, please swim between the red and yellow flags.","Robertson Electorate: Surf Lifesaving Clubs","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[3]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr R EID (Robertson) ","(12:39):"
378,0,0,0,1,2,"Wood, Jason MP","E0F","La Trobe","LP","N/A",1301," Im going back a long time, to when I was a detective at the Boronia criminal investigations branch, but I will never forget every Monday morning. When you came in, you would speak to the weekend crew to see what jobs theyd had, and every single Monday morning, tragically and sadly, thered been a sleepover or an event where a young child had been sexually abused. It was very sad, obviously, for investigators, but you cannot ever imagine what the poor victims and their families had been through.Back in 2019, the home affairs minister at the time—and a former police officer too—and now Leader of the Opposition, Peter Dutton, raised the issue of the need to have a national child sex offender register. Subsequently, in my role as assistant minister for community safety, I took over the fight to ensure we could do everything possible to have measures in place to protect our most valuable asset—our children. Theres always been this view—even in law enforcement—when this has been raised, that its mainly strangers who commit these abhorrent crimes. I knew better, from my days as a detective. Theres also been a view that we dont want vigilante groups going after child sex offenders, which, obviously, is fair and reasonable.It was at one of the police and emergency management meetings I went to with police ministers and attorney-generals where we got agreement to base it on evidence. If there was evidence there, the various states and territories would look at this, and, hopefully, then support the need for a national child sex offender register. So I was able to commission a great group of men and women to conduct research into repeat child sex offenders, and this was led by Dr Rick Brown and Anthony Morgan, research manager and the author of the report.I very much thank the Queensland, Victoria, New South Wales and WA governments, who provided that data. Sadly, Canberras data was so low it couldnt even be used. South Australia couldnt provide data at all. It was the same with the Northern Territory and Tasmania. The data looked at offences committed by a child sex offender—and alleged offences were included—between 2005 and 2014, followed by a subsequent offence between 2015 and 2019. Over that four-year period, there were 1,321 alleged child sex offenders who committed a repeat offence, against another victim, and there were 1,780 victims abused, aged 15 years and younger.There has always been a view that these offences occur at parks et cetera. Sixty-six to 82 per cent of these 1,780 offences occurred in residential locations. Fifty-one to 61 per cent of these offences involved a family member or a person known to the victim. It could be, as I said, a sleepover; it could be someone whos visited. The rates of reoffending were seven per cent or more, up to 11 per cent, and the offences were committed over a 10-year period.Lastly, the offenders nearly always knew their victims, and the average age and sex of the victims was an 11-year-old girl. Im calling on the Albanese government—I know that every member in this place would hate to see children being abused. But, sadly, we cannot provide information to, say, a mother in a relationship with a new partner—allowing that new person to get into their home and have access to their children. Thats precisely—when I was talking to Dr Rick Brown—what these offenders are doing. Theyre making the most of opportunities; theyre being predators.What we need now is the leadership to go and look at a program, or look at what they do in the UK—its based on Sarahs Law—where an application is made, and the police undertake an interview with the person making the application to determine what information should be provided. Its all done to protect children. I strongly urge this new government to support this proposal.","Child Sexual Abuse","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[4]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr WOOD (La Trobe) ","(12:44):"
379,0,0,0,1,2,"Phillips, Fiona MP",147140,"Gilmore","ALP","N/A",1301," Today is R U OK? Day, a day to check in on your mates and a day to remind us that mental health matters. Mental health support is something I am passionate about because I know how important it is to our community. Mental health in regional and rural areas is always more acute than in the cities. Among a range of reasons driving this is that traditionally we have less access to services or more difficult access to services. Thats why I have been working hard for years to improve access to mental health services in my electorate of Gilmore on the New South Wales South Coast. Dealing with drought, then record-breaking bushfires, a pandemic and flood after flood has been particularly tough on the mental health of our community. And young people have been hit hard by this.Before the 2019 election, I committed to a full headspace for Batemans Bay. Ive had years of seeing the amazing difference the Nowra headspace makes to the lives of young people in the Shoalhaven, so Ive been a big champion of this service. In the wake of the 2019-20 bushfires, I pushed the former government to bring that funding forward, with an interim service opening soon after in Batemans Bay. I was delighted to officially open the full Batemans Bay headspace in April last year, and I regularly visit to see how things are going. Im really proud of it, and I know it is making a big difference to the lives of local young people.The last time I was there, I took the new Assistant Minister for Mental Health and Suicide Prevention—along with $1.2 million to help reduce wait times. I thank the assistant minister for her support of the service. Id also like to thank all the wonderful headspace support workers on the ground helping young people in need. Your work is invaluable; thank you. My passion for improving mental health services for local young people hasnt stopped. At the last election, I promised another headspace for the Kiama community. Kiama is a beautiful regional town in the north of my electorate, which has devastatingly seen a string of local youth suicides during COVID. Its heartbreaking. We need to be stepping up support for young people in this community.Since the election, Ive been meeting with the health minister and the CEO of headspace to make sure this commitment for a headspace in Kiama stays front of mind. It takes some time for these centres to get up and running, so Im working closely with the minister to ensure the funding is released as soon as possible. And Im really pleased to say that that is progressing. I thank the minister for that. Thank you also to everyone in the community who has advocated for this service and has worked with me to secure this commitment. Im looking forward to delivering a headspace for Kiama this term.I mentioned the floods earlier. My electorate has been hit hard by successive natural disasters over the last few years. Weve had two disaster-declared floods this year alone, in March and in June, and we are still cleaning up from these. Many local communities still dont have full road access to their homes, with landslides across the South Coast doing serious damage to our road network, and its taking time to get that fixed. Im working closely with the councils on that, and the Australian government is providing funding support for this as well. But the impact is still being felt, and it is yet another drain on the mental health of our community.I am really delighted the Albanese government is delivering a further $450,000 to the South Eastern New South Wales Primary Health Network to support the mental health and wellbeing of our community. Funding will go towards an emergency response coordinator, who will work with primary and mental healthcare providers and relevant agencies to make sure local people have access to support services. The PHN will also, pleasingly, deliver small community connectedness and recovery grants of up to $10,000 to build resilience and social connectedness.On R U OK? Day, as with every day, supporting the mental health of the South Coast community is front of my mind. I will keep working closely with the relevant ministers to continue improving our mental health services to help us recover from our seemingly never-ending string of natural disasters. And I encourage everyone to ask their mates today, R U OK? Sometimes, just knowing a friend is there can make all the difference.","Mental Health","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[5]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs PHILLIPS (Gilmore) ","(12:49):"

Established way back in 1962, it is one of the biggest clubs anywhere in the St George region, with well over 500 players, from under-sixes to over-45s. It is great to see an increasing number of women and girls participating in the Lugarno football club every year. That number continues to grow. In particular, it was great to acknowledge Sue Dick on the night. She really personifies everything that is great about Lugarno FC. It was also great to see Michael Jarevski, the president, and so many other members of the executive and families who have an association with the club. Lugarno FC, congratulations on a great 60 years.On 2 September I caught up with the Revesby Rhinos at their home ground down at Neptune Park in Revesby Heights. Its a beautiful spot and a great home ground for the club. The club has grown significantly in recent years. There are now 10 teams, all performing well, with three making the finals this year. Recently the club received a $7,500 grant through the Stronger Communities Program, which I was very pleased to be able to assist with. Thats gone into purchasing a second-hand copy machine, additional storage, a freezer and an EFTPOS machine—all those practical things that make a difference for the club and the families associated with the club as they gather each weekend. It was really good to see Paul Sawaqed, the president. Id like to also acknowledge Wayne Hunter, the vice-president, and Rita Sellars, the secretary. It is a club on the up and up, and it was really good to visit.South Hurstville Carss Park Cricket Club has perhaps one of the most beautiful grounds anywhere in Sydney and probably anywhere in Australia, right on the bay at Kogarah Bay. It was great to go down there recently with Sandra McDonald, the very energetic junior secretary of the club, and talk a bit about some of the issues down at Carss Park. The reality is that the field is not in good enough condition. There are a whole range of problems with the pitch and with the playing field generally, and it is important that Georges River Council take action to address those problems, because this is a wonderful club with close to 200 players and they deserve to play in good conditions. They have a beautiful location, but the field does not match the location at the moment. So that needs to be fixed, and I look forward to continuing to work with Sandra and the club. I thank and congratulate the club for all of its work supporting young cricket players in the region.St Christophers Catholic Primary School is a wonderful school, and on 17 August I attended their science fair. It had been postponed for a couple of years because of COVID, because you couldnt really have those sorts of events, so it was really terrific to visit the science fair on 17 August. The theme was real-world water problems impacting our environment. The kids did some really interesting and thought-provoking displays about environmental issues, including the importance of conserving and protecting water and ensuring that it is there not just today but in the decades and centuries to come. It was really terrific to visit. The St Christophers community is a special one, and it was great to go down there. Id like to acknowledge Warren Loy, the principal; Brooke Watson, the assistant principal; and Charlotte Garner, a teacher who had a huge role in organising what was a very successful event.Lily Monteverdi School of Music has a proud history of providing music to our community. The school specialises in violin, viola, cello, flute, clarinet, piano and guitar, and it teaches students to a very high standard. Theres an annual concert. Its been at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music in some years. I believe its at the Sydney Opera House this year. It really reflects the stature of Lily Monteverdi, a terrific local group with more than 200 people, mainly kids, who are learning the beauty of music through their instructors at Lily Monteverdi.
