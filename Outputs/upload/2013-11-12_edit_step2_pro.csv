As all of us who have known the honourable member well for a long time understand, she is a formidable character, and I can think of no-one more likely to deal with all of the other formidable characters in this place without fear or favour. Bronwyn can do what is necessary to maintain control of what is sometimes an unruly House.This chamber should always be a place of spirited debate. But it should never be a place where motives are impugned or characters assassinated. When any of us are tempted to be low, mean or petty, the member for Mackellar is well equipped to recall us to our duty. This parliament will be a different one and a better one, I hope. The member for Mackellar loves this parliament. She reveres its traditions, and she has the capacity to help all of us to be at our best.

3,0,0,0,1,1,"Pyne, Christopher, MP","9V5","Sturt","LP","N/A",6," It is my great honour to second the nomination of the member for Mackellar as Speaker of this House. The member for Mackellar was the first member of parliament that I met on my first day in parliament 20½ years ago. I arrived at the Senate chamber to see my great friend Amanda Vanstone. I walked in as a fresh-faced 25-year-old member of parliament like many colleagues on this side of the House and the other side of the House. I came through the doors. I had been questioned by the attendants as to whether I was a member of parliament, because I had left my badge at home in my flat—that is a common occurrence for many new members of parliament—and the first person I ran into was the then Senator Bishop. She clasped me by both forearms, kissed me on both cheeks and said, You and I are going to become great friends. I was a little sceptical at the time!But 21 years later it is my great privilege and honour to second her nomination as Speaker in this chamber. There is nobody else in this chamber who will do the job as well in the 44th Parliament as Speaker of the House. The member for Mackellar is knowledgeable, experienced, intelligent and effortlessly charming. And she is as tough as a Sherman tank, as she has described herself over the years. In fact, she used to have a model of a Sherman tank on her desk when she was a minister. I hope she will be generous, particularly to her nominator and seconder on this side of the chamber. I expect her to be firm, especially with the opposition. Sometimes, I think, she will be firm with the government—and that will only be because it is appropriate at the time.Laurie Oakes said in the newspapers on the weekend that it would be a situation of the poacher becoming the gamekeeper for the member for Mackellar to be the Speaker. My advice to the fourth estate is that poachers usually make very good gamekeepers, and I commend her nomination as Speaker of the House.The Clerk: Does the honourable member for Mackellar accept the nomination?","N/A","PARLIAMENTARY OFFICE HOLDERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr PYNE (Sturt—Leader of the House and Minister for Education) ","(11:31):"

6,0,0,0,1,1,"Thomson, Kelvin, MP","UK6","Wills","ALP","N/A",7," Mr Clerk, I move:That the honourable member for McEwen do take the chair of this House as Speaker.The opposition is not unmindful of the tradition of governments promoting their own for this position, but there is also a strong tradition of oppositions putting forward and supporting their own. There is occasionally a lament that the modern Labor Party no longer has any tradesmen as members of parliament, but the member for McEwens background with RACV roadside assistance makes him someone about whom this cannot be said—as well as making him a very useful person to know.He was elected to the Victorian parliament in 2002 as the first Labor MP to represent the Central Highlands Province electorate in the Legislative Council. When he came to this parliament in 2010 he brought with him considerable understanding of regional Victoria. He was a founding member of Victorias first Community Emergency Response Team and passionately devoted himself to assist the many families in his electorate who were devastated by the Black Saturday bushfires of 2009. During the last parliament he served on the Speakers panel, he served as Deputy Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Regional Australia and he served on the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network.This election for Speaker takes place against a somewhat unfortunate background. After the 2010 election the opposition were aggrieved that they had not won, and, in particular, that the Independents had not supported them. They hoped to make the hung parliament unworkable and to force an early election. They refused, for example, to provide any members for the Speakers panel and engaged in a parliamentary strategy of havoc, chaos and mayhem. In doing so, they caused some damage to the standing of this parliament. Given that there appeared to be no penalty for this conduct there is some grievance on this side of the House and, of course, the temptation to retaliate in kind. We are, however, aware of the desire of the Australian people that parliamentary standards be improved and that the conduct of members of parliament improve. This is where the role of Speaker is important.No-one doubts that the member for Mackellar is experienced, but we have experience of her. I think members will understand what I am saying when I say that she is very black and white: there are certainly no shades of grey with her. I understand that it is her intention to continue to attend meetings of her party room. On this side of the House, we are looking for a Speaker who can be even handed, reasonable, capable of seeing the other persons point of view and capable of seeing the other side of the argument. In this respect I commend to the House someone like former Speaker Jenkins, the member for Scullin, who I think was adept at presiding over the House through goodwill and by earning the consent of members rather than through the use of the rule book. In this respect I think that the member for McEwen has the right qualities. He is liked by both sides of the House and is capable of seeing the other persons point of view. Given that he has those qualities I urge the House to support his nomination.The Clerk: Is the motion seconded?","N/A","PARLIAMENTARY OFFICE HOLDERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.2/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr KELVIN THOMSON (Wills) ","(11:34):"
7,0,0,0,1,1,"Perrett, Graham, MP","HVP","Moreton","ALP","N/A",8," I second the nomination. The member for Wills commented about the member for McEwen and the member for Mackellar. This is my third parliament and I have not seen the member for Mackellar in the chair. The member for Wills said that, unfortunately, because of the direction of the then Leader of the Opposition no member of the opposition sat on the Speakers panel apart from the member for Maranoa, who is a good and honourable man, who sat in the position as Deputy Speaker and did his job admirably. So I did not see the member for Mackellar in the chair in order for me to know how fair she could be. Obviously, a Speaker must be in love with democracy. They cannot use their role as a mechanism to wield power and promote or protect privilege. That is not what this chamber is for. The 150 people elected to this chamber have a solemn duty to their electorates, and that is about democracy. I have never seen the member for Mackellar sitting in the chair and being fair and impartial.I think the Prime Minister said that the Speakers role should restore dignity. I take offence at that comment because the 43rd Parliament had dignity.","N/A","PARLIAMENTARY OFFICE HOLDERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.2/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr PERRETT (Moreton) ","(11:37):"

When we unpack democracy we could look at what the nominated members have done. Let us have a look at whether the member for Mackellar followed that great Liberal tradition of looking at the policy and crossing the floor, and we will see whether she is prepared to be bipartisan. I have been in only two parliaments and I have seen only two MPs in this chamber cross the floor on a topic. I think the member for McMillan did it over asylum seekers, and he was rewarded by being totally overlooked. We had the member for Wentworth cross the floor over the ETS, and he was rewarded by being placed on the cover of the Real Solutions brochure. In the other place I saw Senator Sue Boyce cross the floor the day after the member for Warringah was made leader, and she was rewarded by being overlooked and then by being booted out of parliament. I know the member for New England has crossed the floor, and I look forward to seeing how he goes when it comes to voting on GrainCorp. I am sure he will talk tough and walk soft.Let us look at how the member for Mackellar and the member for McEwen have treated democracy. The best way to analyse it is by looking at how they have voted on legislation that brings votes to the Australian people. Let us look at the 2010 election review, when we tried to get 1.5 million people back onto the electoral roll, and the dissenting report from the member for Mackellar.I am sorry to say, Member for McEwen, that maybe we should support the member for Mackellar for the sake of the sisterhood rather than you. You have a Y chromosome and she does not. There is a saying that the head slave whips the hardest. Let us have a look at how the member for Mackellar has treated the sisterhood when given the opportunity. When she stood out the front of this place in front of a poster saying, Ditch the witch, and a poster saying, Juliar … Bob Browns bitch, what did she do? Did she apologise for that? No, she never apologised for that. She actually said that the people who had those signs were good, decent Australians.","N/A","PARLIAMENTARY OFFICE HOLDERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.2/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[4]","N/A","N/A"

I think very seriously about these decisions. Obviously, it is an important role and it is good to have a bit of humour. In the last six years I have seen the member for Mackellar make two good jokes. She made a joke about the size of Julia Gillards nose. Then she made a joke about the clothes that Julia Gillard wore. The jokes were quite funny, but the humour of someone in the chair needs to have a touch of self-deprecation. I think the member for Mackellar has deprecation down pat.

17,0,0,0,1,1,"Truss, Warren, MP","GT4","Wide Bay","Nats","N/A",9," Madam Speaker, I congratulate you on your election to this office. You have held most positions in this parliament—in the other chamber and here. As a member of the Senate and a member of the House of Representatives you have been a minister and a shadow minister. You have been active in the parliamentary committee system. You have certainly played a major role in the parliament over quite a long period of time. You had five years on the House Standing Committee on Procedure, which would have been an excellent opportunity for you to get the experience you need to grasp how the standing orders work and, no doubt, would have given you some ideas also about how you might like this parliament to work better in the future.In many ways, in spite of all the things that you have done as a parliamentarian—and you have been well recognised and acknowledged around the country for those achievements—I think you have, in some ways, always been destined to be Speaker; it has certainly been one of your loves. I think it would be a very, very brave member of the parliament who would come to the dispatch box with the House of Representatives Practice under their arm and challenge your rulings; you know every page and, seemingly, every paragraph. I am sure that you will exercise your experience to the benefit of the House.The last parliament was a challenging time for the Speaker. The fact that there were three Speakers obviously did not help. It was a parliament that I think many of us would like to put behind us. The public expect our parliament to behave better in the future. They want a parliament that is orderly and businesslike. I believe that you have the skills, talent and ability to lead the parliament to aspire to achieve reform and to make sure that the business of the parliament is conducted in an orderly and businesslike manner in the future.

People have remarked today about this being reminiscent of the Harry Potter novel in which they all returned to Hogwarts and found that Dumbledore was gone and Dolores Umbridge was in charge of the school.We have a situation where, for everything that has been said by those opposite about the commitment to the new parliament, a number of very specific commitments to the new parliament were made. Page 167 of House of Representatives Practice refers to the fact that the Speaker is ordinarily nominated by a private member and not by the executive, and certainly not by the Prime Minister.

22,0,0,0,1,1,"Bishop, Bronwyn, MP","SE4","Mackellar","LP","N/A",11," I thank honourable members for their comments. In taking this office and being elected to this office, I would say that I consider the office to be one of enormous privilege. When the Prime Minister nominated me, he said that I care passionately for this place. I do. I care passionately for its traditions. I care passionately for what it represents, in looking after the welfare of the people of Australia. So, when we talk about the need for more decorum, what I hope from that is that the people of Australia may see us as upholding their interests in a better way.I notice the comments made earlier when an alternative candidate for Speaker was nominated. I think perhaps the lesson there is that sometimes you can talk yourself more into trouble than you can out of trouble. But that is not to reflect on the way in which I will be in the chair—I mean to be impartial. The comments I have made about attending party meetings are simply to do with the fact that I am a Liberal. But we do not deal with tactics, and I would not be part of that. In this chair I will act impartially. That is a responsibility that goes back to 1377.I am delighted to say that I did not have to struggle too much today, because the welfare of Speakers has improved markedly over that period. It is part of the tradition that we do indeed show that in that struggle there were previous Speakers who, in acting as the interlocutor between the monarch and the parliament, perhaps either ended up in the Tower of London or lost their heads.Can I say also that, when we make analogies to the parliament, I regard this as a strong and robust place of debate. It is not a classroom and it is not a polite debating society. It is a place where we fight for ideas, and the width of that table is symbolic in that we do not use weapons such as swords and we do not use fisticuffs. But we do use words. Sometimes we use them harshly, and we have standing orders that apply to that. As we go forward in this parliament, I do hope that we will raise our stakes in the eyes of the people for the peace, order and good government of the people of Australia.Just for the record, the mode of address I would expect to receive is Madam Speaker. I also intend perhaps to revive a couple of the other niceties we have used from time to time, but we will see how that goes.Can I end by simply saying that I am delighted to have my family present in the gallery today. I also am very honoured to have had friends come today. It is for me, I think, the capping of my career. It is true that I am the first woman from the conservative side of politics to have held this role. We have had two from the Labor side, and I pay respect to Anna Burke for the job she did.In relation to words said about the sisterhood, I say that I have never, ever put myself forward other than to say, I am the best person for the job. I hope that is the reason that 93 people voted for me today.I will conclude by saying that there will be times when there will be turbulence and there will be times when we can feel that the heat and the anger of the place rises. It will be my job to try to keep order whilst the place remains one for robust discussion of ideas and competing ideas.I thank the House for the vote I have received.

31,0,0,0,1,1,"Bishop, Bronwyn, MP","SE4","Mackellar","LP","N/A",17," I have to report that the House this day attended Her Excellency the Governor-General in the Senate chamber, when Her Excellency was pleased to make a speech to both houses of the parliament. I have received a copy of the speech, which will be incorporated in Hansard for record purposes.The speech read as follows—IntroductionHonourable senators and members of the Parliament of Australia.Today, at the opening of the 44th commonwealth parliament, we celebrate the enduring health of our democracy.One hundred and twelve years after the first federal election, nearly 14 million Australians have cast their votes in another free and fair election.For only the fourth time in three decades, the Australian people have voted for a change of government.The people have set a new course for our country. On 7 September, the Australian people voted for a government that said it would repeal the carbon tax, establish a Commission of Audit and improve the budget, strengthen border protection and build the roads of the 21st century. My government will honour the will of the people and repay their trust.Members of the new government take office with a deep sense of humility for the honour conferred upon them. Today and every day, my government will work to deliver the commitments it made to the Australian people.My government has a clear and comprehensive plan of action for building a stronger Australia. It will be a purposeful government. Every day it will work in a way that is careful, collegial, consultative and straightforward, because this is the best way of delivering the better government that the Australian people want.At the heart of my governments plan for Australia is a strong, prosperous economy.A strong and prosperous economy, built on strong, prudent economic management, is the basis for realising every other national goal.My governments plan for a stronger Australia begins with building a more productive and diverse economy that will guarantee Australias future prosperity by building on our national strengths.It will strengthen the economy through lower taxes, less regulatory burdens and higher productivity.It will work to deliver more jobs and more opportunity—so there is less pressure on families and so that more Australians can get ahead.It understands that the foundations of a strong economy are found in policies which reward hard work and individual effort and which encourage personal aspiration and ambition.We should never be a country that seeks to cut tall poppies down to size but one where everyone is encouraged to grow and succeed. Australia needs more successful people and we should give our people every opportunity to succeed.My governments vision is not of bigger government but of stronger people. It is a vision of a dynamic, confident Australia—where all 23 million of us can individually and together pursue our hopes and dreams.Cutting taxesThe repeal of the carbon tax and mining tax are at the heart of my governments plan to strengthen the Australian economy.As its first order of business, this parliament will consider legislation to repeal the carbon tax.My government believes the carbon tax is a burden on every Australian business and it is a burden on families.As part of my governments commitment to families, it will repeal the carbon tax—but will keep the current tax thresholds and fortnightly pension and benefit levels—ensuring real assistance to families.The repeal of the carbon tax will enhance the competitiveness of both big business and small.As well, legislation to abolish the mining tax will be before parliament this year.The end of the carbon tax and mining tax will be a clear message that Australia is open for business.My government is determined to re-energise the resources industry and to create more jobs in more projects, through restoring Australias reputation as a good place to invest.Australias mineral wealth is one of our great national gifts and all Australians will benefit from a bigger and stronger mining industry and more certain investment settings.The government will cut the company tax rate by 1.5 per cent from 1 July 2015. The new company tax rate of 28.5 per cent will benefit all Australians. As the Henry Tax Review noted, a lower company tax rate will not only result in higher growth but is also likely to result in higher wages.My government has already determined that it is not proceeding with changes to FBT arrangements for leased vehicles—and this will provide all parts of the car industry across Australia with certainty and confidence.Role of governmentMy government understands that taxpayer money is best spent on delivering better services and a better society—not on interest repayments that come from spending more than you have.It also understands that every dollar it spends is a dollar that has been earned by someone else. As such, government has a duty to ensure that every dollar is used prudently and wisely.A Commission of Audit has been established that will identify waste and duplication and provide taxpayers with better value for money. It is the first such audit in nearly two decades.Its focus will be on making public administration more cost-effective and more productive through reducing duplication and overlap between governments.Honourable senators and members, this will be an active government, not a big government.It aims to strengthen the economy, improve the budgetary position and lay out a plan for long-term sustainable growth.By strengthening the economy, we strengthen Australia.Small business and deregulationEmploying almost one in two people in the private sector, small businesses are the best job creators in the Australian economy.My government will lower taxes, cut red tape and make it easier for small businesses to grow and employ more people.For the first time in two decades, there will be a root-and-branch review of national competition policy—because competition drives productivity growth.The company tax cut will reward those who have the courage and resourcefulness to start and grow their own business.My government will lighten the red-tape burden because too many businesses spend too much time meeting a seemingly ever-expanding list of regulatory requirements.My government intends to cut red-tape costs on businesses and community groups by $1 billion a year.And reduce green tape by creating a state-based one-stop shop to streamline the environmental approvals process.As part of the governments plan to boost productivity and reduce regulation, every significant Commonwealth government department and agency will be given an annual target for red-tape cost reductions. Meeting these targets will be essential criteria by which departmental secretaries and senior public servants are assessed.And for two sitting days each year, this parliament will meet to review a deregulation report and repeal redundant legislation and regulation.Employment and welfareAs part of its commitment to boost productivity, the Australian Building and Construction Commission will be restored to ensure that, on commercial building sites, the rule of law is respected, productivity is improved, jobs are created and major national construction projects are kept on track.The law will be changed so that registered organisations and their officials are held to the same rules and standards as companies and their directors.My government believes in the dignity of work and the importance of participation, so it will reinvigorate the Work for the Dole program to help ensure that all working-age people are working—preferably for a wage but, if not, through the Work for the Dole program.There will be incentives for employers to take on more mature-age workers and young people. These incentives include a job commitment bonus for long-term unemployed people who get work and remain off welfare for 12 months, with an increased bonus at 24 months—and a new job seeker relocation bonus for young people who move to take up work.Workforce participationMore accessible, affordable and flexible child care is good for the economy as well as good for families.Improving access to child care provides parents with more choice, provides the workforce with more workers, and lifts the productivity of the nation.My government is tasking the Productivity Commission to undertake an inquiry into child care. The Productivity Commission will identify how the current system can be improved and how it can be made more responsive to the needs of parents.My governments Paid Parental Leave scheme, starting on 1 July 2015, is also part of its plan for delivering a stronger economy through improved workforce participation.The new scheme will pay women at the rate of their actual wage—rather than the minimum wage—and for 26 weeks rather than 18 weeks under the current scheme.Currently, of the more than 30 countries in the OECD offering a paid parental leave scheme, Australia is one of only two that fail to pay parental leave based on a replacement wage.The new scheme will provide a woman earning an average full-time salary with $21,300 more than the current scheme.Paid parental leave should be a workplace entitlement, not a welfare payment.Above all, it gives working women the support they need to balance the competing responsibilities of career and family.Jobs targetBy growing the economy, we can create the best conditions for more jobs, higher wages and the funding of better services for all Australians.This will provide benefits for all parts of the economy—in manufacturing, agriculture, education and research, and services, as well as mining.Within five years, my government envisages that our economy will have delivered one million new jobs.And within a decade, over two million new jobs will have been created.Asia and the regionAs well as playing its part in the wider global community, my government will strengthen Australias relations with key partners and will bring a Jakarta, not Geneva focus to our foreign policy. The focus of our international policies will be on the advancement of Australias core strategic and economic interests.Australia has global interests but it is particularly important that we focus on the Asia-Pacific region.As the economies of Asia continue to expand, demand for Australian minerals and other exports will remain strong.As the Asian middle class grows and demographics shift, there will be new demand for Australian education and research, expertise in advanced services, manufacturing and agricultural products.To make sure this moment is not missed, my government will fast-track free trade agreements with South Korea, Japan, China, Indonesia and India.These are agreements that will provide new and enlarged markets for Australias high-quality products and services—which means more exports and more jobs for Australians.Australia needs to be Asia literate and Asia capable.My government will work to develop stronger people-to-people links and to foster the culture and mindset necessary to capitalise on Asias historic economic transformation.Academic and cultural exchanges are crucial to building this kind of network, so the government will implement a new, two-way version of the former Colombo Plan that will encourage more young Australians to study in the universities of Asia, as well as bringing students from our region to Australias universities.A revitalised, competitive, productive and Asia-ready economy is the beginning, not the end, of my governments vision for Australia.Rural and regional AustraliaNorthern Australia is Australias growth frontier.If we prepare ourselves well, our cities and industries in the North will be well placed to capitalise on the expected growth from the Asia and Pacific regions.Unlocking Northern Australias potential with more investment, more exports and more jobs will not only benefit the region but the entire country.Over the next 12 months, my government will develop a white paper to guide the policies and plans that will unlock the full economic potential of the North.A strong and competitive agriculture sector is essential to Australias future.To support this aim, $100 million will be invested in agricultural research and development, with a focus on improving productivity.And within the next 12 months, a white paper focused on the profitability and competitiveness of the agriculture sector will be developed.Economic growth plan for TasmaniaWhile the governments plans to lower taxes, cut red tape and lift productivity will benefit all Australians, my government also recognises that parts of Australia are under sustained economic pressure.In particular, my government is determined to restore confidence and jobs growth in Tasmania and change the economic trajectory of that state.The government will implement an economic growth plan for Tasmania to reset Tasmanias course to one of higher growth, more jobs and rising living standards.The economic growth plan for Tasmania includes establishing a joint Commonwealth and Tasmanian economic council as well as a major projects approval agency, which will be a one-stop shop for all projects valued at over $50 million.Roads of the 21st centuryWorking with the states, my government will build the roads of the 21st century, with cranes over our cities and bulldozers on the ground.The WestConnex and the F3 to M2 upgrade in Sydney; the East West Link in Melbourne; the Gateway Motorway upgrade in Brisbane; the North-South Road corridor in Adelaide; the Perth Gateway project and Swan Valley Bypass; and the Midland Highway in Tasmania.As well as completing the duplication of New South Waless Pacific Highway and upgrading and flood-proofing of Queenslands Bruce Highway.Better major roads and less congestion will allow Australians to spend less time stuck in traffic and more time at home with their families.There will be better infrastructure planning and more rigorous and transparent assessments of taxpayer funded projects.There will be a decision on a second major airport for Sydney.In collaboration with the states and territories, there will be a rolling 15-year infrastructure plan that identifies funding priorities on the basis of published cost-benefit analysis.For the first time, there will be an annual statement to the House of Representatives on the construction status of major infrastructure projects, the amount of Commonwealth funds spent on them and whether milestones have been met.BroadbandThe modern, connected economy has made broadband an essential strand of 21st century infrastructure.My government will deliver the fast and affordable broadband that Australians need and have been calling for.Australians expectation of faster broadband has not been met. A new model for the National Broadband Network is needed if the fast and affordable broadband that Australians want is actually to be delivered.My government will build fibre to tens of thousands of distribution points—not to 12 million premises—and then use existing infrastructure to deliver much faster broadband to Australian homes.A ranking of broadband quality and availability in Australia will be provided to parliament to guide prioritisation of the rollout.NBN Co. will be required to amend its rollout plan so that priority can be given to the areas identified as inadequately served.National Disability Insurance SchemeMy government will make the National Disability Insurance Scheme a reality for Australians with disabilities and their carers.It is a vast undertaking almost without precedent in our national life.My government will continue the rollout of the NDIS in line with the Productivity Commissions vision and the timetable detailed by the intergovernmental agreements with the states and territories.Delivering the right support for people with disabilities and their carers is a bipartisan project. So a bipartisan joint parliamentary committee will make sure the NDIS is kept on track.HospitalsTo improve the performance of public hospitals, my government will work with the states and territories to give communities a real say in the management of their local hospitals.This approach should instil a patients-come-first culture and deliver better outcomes at a local level. It will put more control into the hands of local hospital administrators and local doctors and nurses, ensuring better decisions are made.My government will continue to support the rollout of Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centres and will establish Australias first National Centre for Excellence in Youth Mental Health.My government is committed to providing transparency, certainty and confidence to the listing of medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.It will take steps to ensure that medicines are listed on the advice of the independent Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, ensuring that decisions made are based on the advice of medical experts.To continue the tradition of great Australian medical breakthroughs, my government will provide $200 million to help Australian scientists find a cure for dementia.The government will also provide $35 million to help find a cure for type 1 diabetes.This funding will help the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation to fund patient trials and co-ordinate a nationwide approach to diabetes research.EducationAs with public hospitals, my government wants to lift the quality of state schools by giving parents, principals and school communities more of a say in how their school is run.My government will work co-operatively with the states and encourage them to give schools greater independence through simpler budgeting and resource allocation and more autonomy in decision making.In the classroom, my governments vision is for a national curriculum that is rigorous and challenging without being cluttered or prescriptive.We also must make a concerted effort to get the basics right to ensure that all children leave school with strong literacy and numeracy skills.To inspire the next generation of Australian innovators and inventors, the Primary Connections science education program will continue.And because every Australian student has the right to a safe and happy school day, my government will work with social media operators, schools and parent groups to tackle cyberbullying and other harmful online material directed at children.Older AustraliansOlder Australians deserve peace of mind, certainty and confidence.During this parliament, there will be no negative, unexpected changes to the superannuation system—so that Australians planning for their retirement can face the future with confidence.We will provide fairness in superannuation pensions to our veterans. The Defence Force Retirement Benefit and the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefit superannuation pensions will be more generously indexed from 1 July next year.A first ever aged-care provider agreement will set a new framework for ageing policy and aged-care arrangements into the future—reducing bureaucracy and keeping the focus on quality care.A more secure nationProviding national security is the first duty of every government.To rebuild the Australian Defence Force, my government will restore defence spending to two per cent of GDP within a decade.A new Defence white paper will identify costed, affordable ways to meet Australias national security objectives.And responsible savings found in the Defence bureaucracy will be reinvested in greater military capacity.2014 marks the commencement of the Centenary of ANZAC. It is my governments hope that every Australian will be involved in some way in the commemorations that will take place in coming years. It will be a time to reflect on our history and renew our commitment to our country.Stronger bordersHonourable senators and members, the government will strengthen Australias borders and stop the flow of illegal arrivals.My government has reintroduced temporary protection visas—to deny the people smugglers a product to sell.Operation Sovereign Borders has already commenced to combat people smuggling and protect our borders.A presumption against refugee status will apply to those who arrive without papers, and those who deliberately discard their documentation will be denied the benefit of the doubt when determining their refugee status.Priority will be given to offshore refugee and special humanitarian visa applicants over those who arrive by boat.My government is putting in place a regional deterrence framework with our partners to strengthen our regions borders and thereby strengthen Australias borders.Border Protection Command has been tasked to deploy the full set of measures necessary to ensure the integrity of our maritime borders and protect Australias sovereignty.All of this will occur in consultation with our friends and neighbours in the region.Environmental prioritiesThe government will take direct action to reach its goal of a five per cent reduction in carbon emissions by 2020.My government will establish an Emissions Reduction Fund, capped at $1.55 billion over the forward estimates.A cleaner environment helps all Australians—now and into the future. However, the best actions are practical and direct ones to improve our rivers, soils, air and farms. This can be done without a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme.There will be a 15,000-strong Green Army charged with clean-up and conservation in local communities throughout Australia.The Green Army will supplement the land care efforts of councils, farmers and volunteers and work to rejuvenate our parklands and the bush.Indigenous AustraliansHonourable senators and members, empowered communities are far more important than an empowered government.Nowhere is the truth of this more apparent than in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.My government wants a new engagement with Aboriginal people to be one of its hallmarks.The Prime Ministers Indigenous Advisory Council, chaired by Mr Warren Mundine, has been established.The councils focus will be ensuring that children go to schools, adults go to work and the ordinary rule of the land operates in Aboriginal communities.Training for trainings sake programs will be replaced with initiatives that help Indigenous Australians find, and keep, meaningful and rewarding work.In cooperation with the Australian Employment Covenant and Generation One, $45 million will train 5,000 Indigenous people for guaranteed jobs—because a real job offers dignity and hope and is a critical part of our reconciliation journey.A new concerted emphasis on attending school and finding work can break the cycle of welfare dependency and the entrenched unemployment that has held back Indigenous Australians for too long.Constitutional recognition of Indigenous peopleWithin 12 months, my government will put forward for public consultation a draft constitutional amendment to recognise Indigenous people in the Constitution and establish a bipartisan process to assess its chances of success.A referendum recognising Aboriginal people as the first Australians could be a unifying and liberating moment for the nation, even surpassing the 1967 change or the national apology.Such an acknowledgement of Aboriginal people as the first Australians would complete our Constitution rather than change it.ConclusionThere will be more for this parliament to do.New challenges will arise; new problems will need to be solved.But my government begins its time in office with a sense of optimism.There is no limit to what Australia can achieve, but only if we respect the limits of government, as well as its potential.Over the next three years, my government aims to provide mature and stable leadership that matches words with deeds, leadership that puts its faith in Australias greatest resource—the genius and creativity of our people.Honourable senators and members, at the opening of the first parliament in Canberra in 1927, the Duke of York said that a new parliament marked a new page of history. He said that the opening of the Australian parliament was an opportunity for the rededication of this Commonwealth to the great ideals of liberty, fairness, justice and the cause of peace.Today, with a new parliament, a page has turned. A new page in our countrys history is about to be written.May we all play our part in writing that shared history and building the stronger Australia that we all want.It is now my duty, and my pleasure, to declare the 44th Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia open.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","The SPEAKER ","(16:08):"

Bruce Scott is my electorate neighbour. We came into the parliament at the same time and I have very much admired his contribution to the parliament over the years. He has a very large electorate—almost three-quarters of a million square kilometres touching the Northern Territory, South Australia and New South Wales borders. Of course he has already served in this House with distinction as Deputy Speaker since 2012, and it is testament to the member for Maranoa that he was nominated for that post by the member for Sturt and seconded by the then Independent member for New England. I am sure that the new member for New England will be equally enthusiastic about the appointment of the member for Maranoa to this position.The member for Maranoa brought dignity to the chair and a wealth of experience—experience gained also from the earlier time that he had spent as Second Deputy Speaker from 2008 and, earlier than that, from 2002 to 2007 as a member of the Speakers panel. So he is a veteran of this House and its procedures in both government and opposition. Earlier he had served as a minister, for 5½ years, in the Veterans Affairs portfolio and also as Assistant Minister for Defence. The Veterans Affairs portfolio can be quite a difficult one, but he met those challenges with a great degree of enthusiasm, and Bruce and Joan were very popular figures in the veteran community during his time in that office. He delivered benefits to 350,000 veterans based on worlds best practice medicine and delivery of services. He also introduced the highly successful Their Service—Our Heritage commemorative program and oversaw the upgrading and expansion of the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. He even gave the vets Viagra!Beyond his parliamentary career, Bruce came to the parliament with a history of service to primary industry as a merino wool and prime lambs producer and an industry leader. I am certain that, as Deputy Speaker, he would be a person that you, Madam Speaker, could rely on. He would greatly support you in your task of restoring respect and dignity to the chair and of course to the House. It is with great pleasure that I nominate Bruce Scott for a return to the position of Deputy Speaker.","N/A","PARLIAMENTARY OFFICE HOLDERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr TRUSS (Wide Bay—Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development) ","(17:00):"

Bruce Scott is eminently suitable for this job because, while he is a man of Western Queensland—a man for the Maranoa and places like Birdsville—he is very much at home in this chamber. He honours the traditions of this place, and it is great testament to him that he can be just as at home in the Birdsville pub as in the chair of this chamber. I have great pleasure in seconding the nomination from the Leader of The Nationals for the member for Maranoa to be Deputy Speaker.","N/A","PARLIAMENTARY OFFICE HOLDERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p","Mr COULTON (Parkes—The Nationals Chief Whip) ","(17:03):"

57,0,0,0,1,1,"Truss, Warren, MP","GT4","Wide Bay","Nats","N/A",31," Thank you, Prime Minister, for giving me this opportunity to talk about Brigadier David Thomson. He gave great service to the nation in many areas. He particularly was a champion of the north. Brigadier David Thomson said in his first speech in this House:I urge all honourable members to go north and to see for themselves the problems imposed by the tyranny of distance and to see also the vast potential of the area.He went on to talk about the size of his electorate, which in those days was even bigger than the electorate of Leichhardt is today. He said that it was 1,200 kilometres from Innisfail to the north of his electorate, which was only a couple of kilometres south of Papua New Guinea. His electorate extended from the Barrier Reef west for 1,200 kilometres to the Northern Territory border. If you took in the sea and the islands it was roughly four times the size of the state of Victoria. He observed that Victoria had 34 members in the House of Representatives at that time. He also went on to comment that his electorate had 12 times more length of coastline than the state of New South Wales, and they had 45 members of parliament at the time. I think he was trying to say that he was doing the work of 79 members. He certainly spoke out strongly on behalf of the people of Leichhardt and those of the north.Those sorts of words summed up his commitment to the people of the north and his vision for what Northern Australia could do for our nation. There was a need for a determined national effort to ensure that those prospects were fully realised. I am sure that he would very much appreciate the announcement by the coalition on its determination to develop a Northern Australia strategy and for that to be a key policy initiative of the new government.David Thomsons parliamentary and ministerial career in the 1970s and 1980s followed his long and distinguished service in the Australian Army. Both these career phases were linked by an outstanding commitment to this country and to its people.David was part of one of the truly great generations of Australians. He was born in Sale in Victoria in 1924. His leadership qualities were already very clear in his early years. He graduated from Duntroon and was commissioned as an officer in 1943 aged just 19. During World War II he served in Borneo, New Guinea and Japan. After the war David continued his military career and, again, saw active service in Korea in 1951. As a major he was awarded the Military Cross in recognition of outstanding skill and gallantry for his service in Korea. He also served in the Malayan Emergency in 1965 and 1966. I believe that exemplary gallantry and exemplary service summed up Davids character, his career and his life.He was the first commander of the 4th Battalion Royal Australian Regiment and was Patron of the RAR Association right up until the time of his death. From 1967 to 1970 David Thomson was the Director of Infantry and Regimental Colonel of the Royal Australian Regiment.He was not only an officer but a gentleman. He had a really delightful manner and was greatly loved by those who knew him. He proved his diverse talents by operating a tourism business in the 1970s before his entry into federal parliament.David achieved a notable political goal by winning the seat of Leichhardt, for what was then the National Country Party, in 1975. This was the first time that the conservative side of politics had won Leichhardt in 24 years. It was typical of Davids character that he paid a genuinely gracious tribute to his Labor predecessor in his maiden speech.He had a remarkable feel for both the opportunities and the intricate problems of his electorate and of Northern Australia. He also had a particularly good understanding of the importance of developing a close relationship with New Guinea and knew how important it was going to be to have a cooperative approach so that the interests of both our countries were preserved.He equally understood the diversity of his electorates people and their interests. As he said in his maiden speech, he would spend a whole day under the trees where Indigenous people would bring their concerns directly to him. His military background also gave him a highly informed perspective on the defence and security of Northern Australia.He served in this House for eight years until 1983. He embellished an already fine record as a natural and, indeed, visionary leader by serving as Minister for Science and the Environment from December 1979 to November 1980 and then continued to serve as minister for science until March 1983. He was very active in placing the essential concerns of northern Australians on the Fraser governments agenda, ensuring that each of the outer Torres Strait Islands finally received their first public telephone after he invited Eric Robinson, the then Minister for Post and Telecommunications, to come to the Torres Strait. He also played a key role in the decision to build a new runway and domestic and international terminals at Cairns Airport. That single decision probably did more than anything to boost tourism to Northern Australia and deliver a generation of tourism related growth to the north.Although he was defeated at the 1983 federal election with the Fraser government, he continued his interest in politics and the North. He regularly attended National Party conferences, he was chairman of the board of John McEwen House from 1984 to 1997 and he was instrumental in its redevelopment and the new building that was opened in 1996.My own party and the coalition are certainly proud to be picking up the baton for Davids vision of developing Australias north, and this will be one of our key policy objectives in the term ahead. So it is fitting that today the member for Leichhardt is in the vanguard of that charge for the Norths growth and prosperity.David died on 13 October in the presence of his wife Judith and son Alistair. May David Thomson rest in peace while his beloved North marches on. I extend my condolences to his family and to those who admired him and worked with him over the years and acknowledge his great service to our party and to the people of Australia.","Thomson, Hon.

I understand that David Thomson served his nation with distinction, within the parliament and beyond. He was Victorian born, he graduated from Duntroon during the Second World War, and he served for 30 years with the Australian Army, serving at Balikpapan, New Guinea, Borneo and then in the occupation of Japan immediately after the war. He again saw active service in Korea where he was awarded the Military Cross in 1951 in recognition of his skills and gallantry. If he did nothing else in life, that award in itself and the activity to earn it speak volumes of the man.Towards the end of his military service he was posted to Far North Queensland. After operating in a tourism business in the region, he went on to serve as a member of parliament, representing the electorate of Leichhardt. I understand David was a passionate advocate for Far North Queensland and its constituents, from farmers to tourism operators and also Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. That advocacy and dedication was recognised by his electorate, securing him three election victories in a marginal seat.David was a minister in the Fraser government. His first ministerial appointment was as Minister for Science and the Environment. He later served again as Minister for Science and Technology. In those roles he campaigned for the protection of the Great Barrier Reef and increased investment in science, research and development. Indeed, in his later years he remained engaged in public service, working with Legacy and Landcare in his adopted home of Batemans Bay. David Thomsons exemplary contribution to Australia as a soldier, a business operator, a science minister and an engaged citizen is recognised by all of us on this side of the chamber. On behalf of the opposition, I extend our condolences to the Thomson family, including Davids widow Judy and their three sons.","Thomson, Hon.

He was a good friend of my father and I had a lot of interface with him.The decision by the Menzies-McEwen government to base the Army in North Queensland has had a very salutary effect upon North Queensland. We had a very great man in David Thomson, staying on in North Queensland, much to the benefit of North Queensland. Brigadier General Grey stayed on in North Queensland and became a very great asset to North Queensland, and Brigadier George Mansford, one of our most outspoken North Queenslanders, God bless him, stayed on in North Queensland. So it was an excellent decision by the Menzies-McEwen government.As the minister for Indigenous affairs in 1984, I had a very rocky road. It was a very conservative government, with attitudes that were extremely conservative, and I had to hoe a very radical path, whether I liked it or whether I did not. My back was protected very much by David Thomson. It took a lot of courage to protect my back in those days. I think that the First Australians owe David a very real debt of gratitude. Wonderful breakthroughs occurred in those years. Without a lot of people like him protecting my back, I do not know whether they could have been achieved—self-management and the issue of title deeds, of course, being the two leading ones.Also, the Torres Strait was being handed over, effectively, to New Guinea. There was a tremendous fight by the Torres Strait Islanders. They did not want to, but the Australian government and the American government thought it would be good to please people by handing them over. He took a very strong position behind the Torres Strait Islanders and having the Torres Strait Islands remain as part of Australia. His buying into that battle, against a lot of hostility down here in this place, led to the Torres Strait still being part of Australia. I think we are looking forward to an era in which some autonomy should be delivered there. In any event, we can deliver the autonomy because we have the power. Also, there was a tradition of terrible fighting between the Torres Strait Islanders and mainland New Guinea. It was a traditional battleground. It would have been terrible for them to be placed under people that they had fought for centuries.Finally, the Institute of Marine Science is one of the very great institutes in the world. It is one of the leading six institutes of marine science in the world. I do not think it would be there without Professor Joe Baker, but also David played a very, very key role in bringing that result around, which has been of great benefit not only to Australia but to the entire planet Earth. I join with the other people in praising David and remembering, with great affection, David Thomson.","Thomson, Hon.

60,0,0,0,1,1,"Entsch, Warren, MP","7K6","Leichhardt","LP","N/A",34," David Thomson was very well known as the National Party MP who, in 1975, reclaimed the seat of Leichhardt after Labor had held it for some 24 years. He was Minister for Science and the Environment from December 1979 through to November 1980 and then Minister for Science and Technology with the Fraser government until its defeat in the 1983 election.What that does not tell you about David Thomson is the fact that he was very widely recognised as an absolute gentleman. He has made a very lasting and significant impact on Leichhardt. To this very day, he is very fondly remembered for his achievements. David, as has been said by previous speakers, encouraged the federal government to fund the expansion and upgrade of the Cairns airport in conjunction with then Cairns Harbour Board. Work began in 1981, and it officially opened in early 1984 with a new runway and domestic and international terminals. I can tell you, as somebody who was there and involved in tourism at that time, that it made a huge, lasting and profound impact in our region. It is a legacy, and we will always appreciate the efforts of David Thomson.He also convinced Malcolm Fraser to visit Burketown for their Never Never Get Together function, where the PM presented the Burke Order of the Outback. That was the first time a Prime Minister had ever visited Burketown. He encouraged the federal government to provide funding for a new domestic satellite, Aussat, which ultimately facilitated the broadcast of TV for the first time in many of those remote areas of Australia. He also took the then Minister for Post and Telecommunications, Eric Robinson, to the Torres Strait as a precursor to the first public telephones being installed on each of those outer islands. It is great that that communication started. We now have mobile phones in most of those areas as well, which is greatly appreciated by the local people.As was said also, he had a great affinity with people in remote communities, both in the Torres Strait and throughout Cape York. Much has been said about his very distinguished military career. Can I say that I recently talked to Davids long-time electorate secretary, Bev OHara. She described him as one of the best employers ever and a thorough gentleman, who would never berate his staff when things did not go to plan. But she also recalled Davids maiden speech in the parliament in 1976, which was on—interestingly enough—the tyranny of distance. It was very appropriate as, in the age when there were no computers, telexes or fax machines, Davids wife Judy had to dictate the speech over the phone to Bev in Cairns, who then took it down in shorthand and had to transcribe it. Bev, as a brand-new employee, said she was very, very nervous. But fortunately she was up to speed and got Davids speech to the local newspaper on deadline.I would, from time to time, run across David both in Canberra and—on a couple of occasions—up in Cairns. He always showed a very strong interest, given that I was successful in the seat in 1996, and offered me a tremendous amount of encouragement and often an opinion on the way things were going. Over time, I have to say, I very much appreciated his support, his opinions and the advice that he offered me. Given my role now as the chairman of this new committee for developing opportunities in northern Australia, I think that we will be able to certainly be fitting a real legacy for the focus and the commitment that David showed to us all those years ago.I would certainly like to pass on my condolences to his wife Judy and his family and of course all those who have had the pleasure of knowing and being associated with him.","Thomson, Hon.

61,0,0,0,1,1,"Ruddock, Philip, MP","0J4","Berowra","LP","N/A",35," It was a great privilege to know David. I served with him in the parliament. I thank the Prime Minister for giving me the opportunity to represent him at the state funeral at Duntroon last week. It was a great privilege to hear something of the wider service that David gave to this nation. The Military Cross is not easily obtained. When you heard about the way in which he conducted himself in military operations on behalf of this nation, you could not help being very proud of what he had achieved.It was a remarkable achievement when you know something of the trials of his early upbringing. I was not aware of it and members may not be, but his father had been a very distinguished soldier. Members may be aware that sometimes in battle people are traumatised. David was unfortunately a person who lost his mother quite early in his life, and his father, who had to bring him up on a farm in Victoria, was very seriously challenged in being able to undertake that task. David earned himself a scholarship at a very exclusive school in Victoria to be able to obtain his own education, and that led to the later achievements which he proved were possible.I think he was a very remarkable man. I was very proud to know him. I was very pleased to be able to represent the government, the Prime Minister and my colleagues at what was a very fine farewell. And it was a bipartisan farewell. One of the oppositions former colleagues, Barry Jones, was there and was able to say something of his respect for David Thomsons outstanding service to this nation. Madam Speaker, thank you for this opportunity. I was prepared to wait to be heard in the Federation Chamber, but I do believe it was appropriate to add those observations. As a mark of respect, I ask all present to signify their approval by rising in their places.Honourable members having stood in their places— I thank the House.Debate adjourned.","Thomson, Hon.

65,0,0,0,1,1,"Abbott, Tony, MP","EZ5","Warringah","LP","N/A",36," I rise to express on behalf of all Australians our deepest sympathies to the people of the Philippines in the wake of the terrible loss of life and the extraordinary damage caused by Typhoon Haiyan. This typhoon has affected up to 10 million people. Almost a million people were pre-emptively evacuated. Many thousands have perished, including, it seems, one Australian. I have contacted President Aquino to convey our thoughts and prayers to the Philippines people at this sad time.As the Minister for Foreign Affairs announced yesterday, Australia is contributing $10 million in emergency assistance, including $3 million for Australian NGOs undertaking immediate life-saving assistance work, $4 million for the UN appeal and $1 million for the Australian Red Cross. There is extra for emergency supplies, including basic health kits. An Australian medical team is expected to be deployed to the Philippines tomorrow and five Australian disaster experts are on the ground to assess whether there is more that our country can usefully do. When nature is at its worst, people are often at their best. Australia stands ready to help our Filipino friends at this very testing time.","Philippines: Typhoon Haiyan","STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ABBOTT (Warringah—Prime Minister) ","(18:01):"
66,0,0,0,1,1,"Shorten, Bill, MP","00ATG","Maribyrnong","ALP","N/A",36," I too rise to speak of the immense devastation as a result of Typhoon Haiyan and to offer the oppositions thoughts both to the people of the Philippines and to their families and communities in Australia. What Filipinos have endured in the past few days and what they will endure for months and years through the recovery is truly challenging to comprehend. The scale of this natural disaster has been likened to the tsunami in terms of the loss of life. Some 10,000 are feared perished and millions have been affected. But perhaps the deepest sadness also comes with the knowledge that entire areas have not yet been contacted and cannot be accessed since the typhoon hit the shores of the Philippines. I wish to offer my and the oppositions condolences to the family of the Australian man who was killed and pray for the safe return of those who are still missing. I wish to acknowledge the extraordinary and immediate donations provided by individuals, communities and organisations in Australia and around the world. I am immensely proud of the National Critical Care and Trauma Response Centre, which will send 36 medical professionals and mobile medical units to the affected areas. These extraordinary individuals from Australias north are sadly all too familiar with the devastating events and effects of natural disasters.I would also like to express my deep gratitude and sympathy to the Australian Filipino community, who have united to offer their help to their loved ones. Their contribution does not commence in response to this disaster alone; I know that their generosity provides a continuous stream of support and comfort to family in the Philippines. As indicated by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition directly to the Foreign Minister, the opposition are ready to support the government in any way we can to help facilitate Australias contributions to relief efforts. On behalf of the opposition I offer our thoughts and prayers to the people of the Philippines as they deal with this traumatic event and commence the immensely difficult task of cleaning up and eventually rebuilding their devastated communities and, in many cases, broken lives.","Philippines: Typhoon Haiyan","STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr SHORTEN (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) ","(18:03):"
67,0,0,0,1,1,"Abbott, Tony, MP","EZ5","Warringah","LP","N/A",37," About a fortnight ago the Leader of the Opposition and I travelled to Uruzgan province in Afghanistan to mark the imminent withdrawal of Australian military forces from that province. As I said in Afghanistan, Australias longest war is ending not with victory, not with defeat, but with hope that Afghanistan will be a better country for our presence. We note the high price that has been paid by our military forces: 40 deaths; 161 very seriously wounded; and hundreds, perhaps thousands, of the 25,000 who served there carrying the unseen scars of war for the rest of their lives.We have paid a high price for limited progress in Uruzgan province. Nevertheless, there has been progress, and perhaps the greatest progress has been the advancement of the life of the women of the province as a result of our presence. I can report to the House that there are now some 26 girls schools in Uruzgan province, which is a 20-fold increase since 2001. Up to 80 per cent of expectant mothers receive at least some prenatal care. This is an extraordinary change in what until very recently was almost a feudal society. It is the men and women of the Australian armed forces and the men and women of the Australian aid effort, uniformed and civilian, who have been largely responsible for this, working with our Afghan allies.While the Leader of the Opposition and I were in Uruzgan, we were presented by the Governor of Uruzgan with some artefacts that he invited us to present to the Australian parliament as a token of gratitude for the work of the Australian teams, both military and civilian, in the province.There is still a vast distance to be covered before that province, or indeed most places in Afghanistan, could even begin to resemble a pluralist democracy. But nevertheless progress has been made. Still there are some five male students for every female school student in that province. But Malalai High School, one of the high schools that has opened and flourished with Australian support, is about to graduate a class of girl students. The governor of the province presented the artefacts I am holding to the Leader of the Opposition and me in the hope that they would be laid before the Australian parliament as a token of the gratitude of the people of Uruzgan to the people of Australia, and of the respect of the people of Uruzgan to the people of Australia for the sacrifices that have been made by our country on their behalf.With your indulgence, Madam Speaker, I will present these artefacts to the Clerk.","Afghanistan","STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ABBOTT (Warringah—Prime Minister) ","(18:06):"
68,0,0,0,1,1,"Shorten, Bill, MP","00ATG","Maribyrnong","ALP","N/A",37," On the first day of the 44th Parliament, it is a good day to say well done to the men and women of the Australian Defence Force and our supporting civilian agencies. Our long commitment has been characterised by two intense phases: the initial international intervention in 2001-02, and the significant re-engagement from 2005 to 2013. Along with 49 other countries, we have been part of a United Nations mandated mission to deny resources and opportunity to international terrorism that possessing the state of Afghanistan had formerly offered. We have also helped bring to an end one of the most brutal regimes we have seen.We are proud in this parliament that we have maintained bipartisan support for our troops and our civilian agencies in Afghanistan. I am proud that the Rudd and Gillard governments found a new way forward to give the best chance of success to our aims, by reorienting the strategy that was being pursued, which included a focus on building Afghanistans capacity to assume responsibility for their own security and laying the foundation for better governance and a better future for Afghans.Our understanding is that such conflicts are resolved by addressing the range of security, economic, social and political factors at issue, as evidenced by our creation of the Australian Civil-Military Centre, the development of better approaches to our provincial reconstruction effort, and by ensuring that this has become a central focus for our military support.We leave behind in Uruzgan a legacy that includes schools and roads, skills and social and health infrastructure. We welcome the progress in transition to Afghanistan-led security right across Afghanistan, of which the handover ceremony attended by the Prime Minister and me on 29 October in Tarin Kowt is but one signpost.I am grateful to the Prime Minister for the recent invitation to visit our troops. I believe I am the first opposition leader to accept the invitation. It was a profound and informative experience, most clearly, I would have to say, about the professionalism and dedication of our armed forces. They have taken the vow of absence, risk, distance from home and the daily uncertainty of what each hour of their tour will bring. Any persons in this House—and I know there are many—who have visited Afghanistan immediately perceive how close the risk is and how unpredictable events can be at any tick of the clock and from almost any direction, be it at midnight or in the morning. It is in a land and a nation that we can never fully understand or predict.I believe there are no words to thank our troops and our civilian agencies for their sacrifice of the ordinariness of life that we take for granted. We take for granted being able to come home to our children or go out in safety and regularity and good cheer to a football field or a day at the beach. Our domestic, unheroic, ordinary lives far from hostilities and furies are protected by the risks of our servicemen and servicewomen. We thank our troops, but, of course, words are not enough. Our military forces have almost gone beyond the reach of our gratitude. The opposition salutes our troops and our civilian agencies. We wish them good fortune in the days and months of our mission still pending before they make it home. It will be a glad homecoming from a tremendous job after many years.Along with the two artefacts the Prime Minister presented, I would like to present a list of the young women who have been able to complete education at high school in Uruzgan.","Afghanistan","STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr SHORTEN (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) ","(18:10):"
