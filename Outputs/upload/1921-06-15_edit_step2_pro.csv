40,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"GREGORY, Henry","KFE","N/A","N/A","N/A",9048,"- In regard to the duty on reapers and binders, I want the Government to strike out the ad valorem rates. Increased duties having been placed on steel, I naturally assume that the Minister would insist on having a higher fixed duty upon reapers and binders if the ad valorem rates were struck out. In this schedule there is a fixed duty on reapers and binders of Â£6 10s. British, Â£9 10s. intermediate, and Â£10 general, or an ad valorem duty of 30 per cent. British, 40 per cent, intermediate, and 45 per cent, general, and the importer of the machine pays whichever rate returns the higher duty. My wisest course is to ask for a reduction of the ad valorem duty on the first sub-item, although I quite recognise that without the Ministers concurrence I have no chance of securing any reduction; but I want to impress honorable members with the fact that the imposition of a 45 per cent, duty against Canada, where most of these machines are made, will mean placing a big handicap upon the purchasers of them, because in common with other machinery the cost of these implements has risen enormously, not only in Australia, but in every other part of the world. Therefore, I hope the Minister will see his way clear to make some reduction. Prior to the 1908 Tariff reapers and binders were on the free list. In the 1908 Tariff there was a provision making them dutiable in certain circumstances, but it did not become operative. Under the 1914 war Tariff reapers and binders -were made dutiable at 5 per cent, under the general division, and under the 1920 Tariff the duty was 10 per cent, until the 31st December, 1920. The duties on this class of machinery under the general Tariff were fixed to operate after the 1st January, 1921, as follows: - Hay rakes, Â£3, or 45 per cent.; reapers and binders, Â£10, or 45 per cent. ; mowers, Â£4, or 45 per cent., whichever rate returned the higher duty, which, undoubtedly, owing to the high cost of this machinery, the ad valorem rate would do. These higher rates were enforced on reapers and binders, but in respect to rakes and mowers they were suspended until the 1st July of this year under a regulation framed by the Minister.I have already referred to the natural protection afforded to locally produced machines. The figures given by me on a previous occasion included the cost of assembling, and in those I intend quoting there will need to be deducted from the natural protection an amount on that account. The natural protection on a 6-ft. binder in 1914 was 30 per cent., but owing to increased freights it is now 61 per cent. The figures in respect to a 4-ft. mower are 39 per cent, in 1914 and 61 per cent, to-day, and on a 9-ft. hay rake 32 per cent, and 53 per cent. From each of these items we can deduct 10 to 12 per cent, for the assembling of the machines. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Greene) is compelled to add 10 per cent, to the value of the machines under the Customs Act, and a 45 per cent, duty, on the present basis of commercial exchange, really means an impost of a little over  62 per cent., so that protection, both natural and that provided by the Tariff, amounts to considerably over 100 per cent, on each machine. It is not my intention to refer at length to the local productions, hut we know that in Victoria last year machines were produced by Mr. H. V. McKay at the Sunshine Harvester Works. These machines were inspected by some honorable members, and so far as one could judge they appeared to be particularly serviceable. It is difficult, however, to judge their suitability except under actual working conditions in the field; but there seems to be no reason why machines of this type should not be manufactured in Australia on a large scale. Knowing the policy of the Government, I believe that some duty will be imposed, although my personal opinion is that machines of this type should be admitted free on account of the natural protection afforded. Until last year reapers and binders had never been made in Australia, but since then three or four machines have been manufactured. The duty was made effective on the 1st January of  this year, and up to that time machines had never been manufactured in any quantity, although to-day I believe they are being produced somewhat extensively. It is, therefore, to be assumed that before the coming harvest manufacturers will be able to supply some machines, although not sufficient to meet requirements. Are we going to say that the farmers of Australia must purchase machines which have never had what can be termed an effectual trial?","In Committee of Ways and Means","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is not my intention to attempt to disparage in the slightest degree the products of Australian manufacturers, because I have no wish to do so. I would be very pleased if Australian manufacturers were producing machines superior to anything imported into the Commonwealth, but at the same time we are not justified in compelling farmers to purchase machines which have not had an effective trial. The present price of Â£102 for a reaper and binder is based upon a 10 per cent, duty, and if the importers had not imported a large number of machines in November and December last on that basis the additional duty proposed under this sub-item would immediately be added, which means that the imported machine would cost about Â£130 instead of Â£102. Even if the machines produced at the Sunshine Works are superior to those imported, which is very problematical, it will not be possible for the manufacturers to meet the demand in the coming year, and a duty of 45 per cent., as proposed, will really mean an impost of 60 per cent. in addition to the natural protection, which is altogether preposterous.","In Committee of Ways and Means","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I do not think there is, at present, any necessity for imposing any duties, but, of course, we are living under abnormal conditions, which are not likely to prevail for any length of time. Personally, I think these duties should be deferred for a time, in order to see if Australian manufacturers are in a position to produce reapers and binders in sufficient quantities to meet the demand. If Australian manufacturers can produce machines in large quantities, I do not think they would be affected if the duty were deferred. In some of the States reapers and hinders are used very extensively, hut in Tasmania we cannot largely use harvesters. In certain portions of my electorate a few machines are in use, and I understand they are giving satisfaction. They are chiefly made in Victoria, at the  Sunshine  works. But the bulk of the farmers, especially the small men in Tasmania, for climatic and other reasons, cannot use the harvester. Besides, a great deal of their crop consists of hay and oats, and a reaper and binder suits them very much better than a harvester. I want to see the Australian machine used.  The history of the  Sunshine  people, and of other Australian firms, affords good ground for expecting that any difficulties which may present themselves to-day in the manufacture of the right kind of implement will be overcome. In this instance,, seeing that conditions are abnormal, I suggest that tha Minister consider whether it would not be wiser to defer the duties for a matter of six months.","In Committee of Ways and Means","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
46,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FENTON, James","KEV","Maribyrnong","N/A","N/A",9050,".- I cannot agree with the proposal of the honorable member for Wilmot (Mr- Atkinson). In the past the reaper and binder has been almost exclusively imported; the Australian farmer has had long experience of the foreign make and its local importer. Whether the machines have come from Great Britain or America the farmer has had to pay through the nose for the past forty years. The overseas makers have had a free run, and have heavily exploited the Australian market. If the total sum of the profits made in Australia by foreign manufacturers of these implements could be authoritatively compiled and made known in this Parliament, the figure would prove astounding. The groundless fear expressed by the honorable member for Wilmot is not a new one. I refer to the allegation that if importations of these machines cease, as an outcome of the new Tariff, there will be a serious scarcity, with resultant harm to the Australian farmer. That is an old bogy. As soon as there is a possibility of the local manufacturer coming into competition with the importer of the foreign implement, the printing press throughout the country is set in active motion, and agents and representatives of the imported machines, from one end of the land to the other, diligently spread the tale that if the protective duty is agreed to, the farmer will be unable to secure his necessary machinery. The Customs YearBooh shows the following particulars of importations of reapers, hinders, and mowers:- 1919-20, Â£69,000; 1918-19, Â£63,000; 1917-18, Â£84>000; 1916-17- a little while prior to the introduction of the Tariff- Â£131,000. The total for the four years shows that Â£348,951 worth of reapers and binders was imported intoAustralia. From recent monthly returns supplied to the Customs Department, it is found that from July, 1920, to April, 1921,. reapers and binders and mowers to the value of Â£385,846 were imported ; so that importations, in this brief term of ten- months, practically equalled the total of the previous four years.","In Committee of Ways and Means","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The facts and figures reveal the cunning of the importer. This huge total has been imported from overseas since the Tariff was first tabled. The importers are trying, as far as possible, to smother the local industry, or prevent it from getting any standing in the community. As for the complaint that if the duty is agreed to there will be a disastrous cessation of importations; whereby the farmer will be stranded, the figures for the ten months which I have just quoted suggest that enough machines have been imported into Australia to supply primary producers for a consider able time to come.","In Committee of Ways and Means","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It was a long time before the Federal Parliament came to their rescue and struck down the strangling clutch of the foreign makers. With the assistance of the Federal Parliament, once more, the local manufacturers will be given a fair chance and, given that, they are capable of effectively fighting the foreign manufacturers. It is very apparent that there will be a good supply of reapers and binders, and mowers in this country for a considerable time. Consequently the Australian farmer is absolutely safe. There are enough reapers and binders in the Commonwealth to-day to supply the whole of our farmers requirements during the next two or three years.","In Committee of Ways and Means","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The consensus of opinion of this Committee, from the time the Tariff was introduced into this Chamber has been overwhelmingly in favour of the encouragement of Australian production.

We possess all the raw materials to enable us to achieve that objective; we have workmen who are second to none in the world from the stand-point of efficiency; and we have also the inventive genius which has supplied not merely our own farmers, but the farmers of other countries with some of the best agricultural implements that are in use to-day.

Do honorable members of the Country party wish to deny our manufacturers an opportunity of introducing such improvements? We have given to the world some of the best implements which have ever been placed upon the farm, and if we are afforded an opportunity to do so, we shall produce even better machines. If we had manufactured the 6,000 combined harvesters which have been imported into this country, how much cheaper would our factories have been able to turn them out?

I am very sorry that the Minister is absent from the Chamber just now, because I want to invite his attention to a supplementary duty. Whilst the duties proposed upon reapers and binders in this schedule may be all right so far as the complete machines are concerned, it may be possible for the makers of them to import them in. parts, and have those parts assembled in Australia. Consequently, the best thing we can do is not merely to impose duties upon the complete machine, but also to impose a duty upon the various parts of it. This course is absolutely necessary if we are to effectively protect local industry. For instance, the weight of a 6-foot reaper and binder is given in the Massey-Harris price-book as 15 cwt. 3 qrs. Of this total, the metal parts weigh, approximately,14 cwt. If the machine were imported in parts to be assembled here, the duty on the parts at the rate of2Â¼d. per lb. would amount to much less than the duty on a complete machine. It will thus be seen that unless departmental precautions are taken, the duty may be evaded by this importation in pieces.

An extraordinary high duty on reapers and binders will have the effect of limiting the number of machines available for the coming season. In spite of the figures quoted by the honorable member forMaribyrnong (Mr.Fenton), there are good grounds for the fears in this connexion; indeed, I consider his figures absolutely worthless. It is idle for the honorable member to attempt to show that, because there was an increase in the number of machine imported last year, there will be a surplus available for next season. Obviously that increased importation was to meet the demand occasioned by an extraordinarily good season. It must be remembered that in, the bad seasons, such as that of 1915-16, when, at the same tume, the prices of the machines were high,farmersrenovated their old machines, and kept going in the hope of better times.

In 19 07 there were 69,163, which, the Bulletin remarked, was wretchedly poor progress, but still progress. The paper adds that that was shortly before the  heroic loan and settlement boom began. In 1919, when the latest estimate was published, it was possible to trace only50,881 of these agriculturists.  If the same rate of decline takes place for the next thirty-one years, says the Bulletin, there will not be a solitary agriculturist remaining in New South Wales.","In Committee of Ways and Means","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I hope that the new reaper and binder which is to be manufactured by H. V. McKay will be just as pronounced a success as the harvester manufactured at the Sunshine works. I admit that H. V. McKay has built up the finest manufacturing business in Australia, andI am satisfied that if the Australian reaper and binder proves to be as good as the harvester turned out at Sunshine, as well as by Robinson and Company and one or two other manufacturers, competition from American manufacturers need not be feared. The Australian machines stand alone. Very few farmers care to buy a stripper-harvester of American make, and I repeat that if the McKay reaper and binder is as good as the Australian harvester, this duty will not be required to protect the industry. And are we going to place this tax of 9d. per acre on every acre of hay that is cut in Australia for the sake of one industry? It is absolutely unfair, and in sub-item b I intend to move that the duty be Â£10, Â£12, and Â£15. I trust that the Committee will give consideration to the interests of the wheat grower, who will be vitally affected by this duty. Our wheat is worth Â£50,000,000 this year, and, as the Treasurer said the other day, it is going to save the finances of the Commonwealth. It is practically the only taxable commodity that the farmer has, and, unfortunately, the tax will go into the pockets of the manufacturer. I challenge the statement made by the honorable member for Maribyrnong (Mr. Fenton) that if the duty is not imposed, the primary producers of this country will be at the mercy of the importers. . For many years our farmers have been able to get their reapers and hinders at Â£38, Â£40, and Â£41, but it appears that, from now onwards, they will be called upon to pay anything from Â£98 to Â£105, and probably more. I intend to support the amendment moved by the honorable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory). I remind the Committee that duplicates represent a very important item to the farmer because he is replacing parts of his machine from time to time. There are scores of old out-of-date machines in use throughout Australia. The machines are not now being imported, but the parts are coming in and are dutiable. In order to enable the farmers to keep the machines going a little time longer, I think the duty on these parts should be at the same rate as the old machine itself.","In Committee of Ways and Means","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/continue[10]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Last night, the honorable member called me to task for not having consulted the Board of Trade in regard to these matters, but this is one question upon which that Board was consulted. The origin of the industry affected by this item lay in certain negotiations which took place between the Minister for Repatriation and the Australian agricultural implement makers, with the idea of creating work in special industries for returned soldiers. A proposal to this end was submitted to the Board of Trade, which considered it and made a unanimous recommendation upon it, which we have incorporated in the Tariff. Therefore, although I feel strongly inclined to meet the request of the honorable member for Dampier, I am in this difficulty, that I feel that I am obliged to give expression in the Tariff to the definite undertaking arrived at as a result of these negotiations. I have never held that these duties will be passed on to the farmer. The evidence we have had is the clearest indication possible that they are not passed on. Before this particular duty came into operation, the importing firms had raised their price to Â£98 in Australia, in New Zealand, and in Great Britain, where no duty is imposed upon them, to the farmer the price is Â£97 and Â£92 10s. respectively. The Australian manufacturer is now supplying these implements at his works for Â£95.

157,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MASSY-GREENE, Walter","KNF","N/A","LP; NAT from 1917","N/A",9061,"- We all know that the price of these machines has been going up steadily for years past. The total value of importations during the years 1916-20 was Â£349,000, whereas during the last ten months the value of the machines imported was Â£336,000. Even allowing that the price has doubled - and I doubt whether, on the average, that is the case - as many machines have been imported in the last ten months as were imported in about two years prior to that period. These facts indicate quite clearly that the importers have already provided their full requirements for the ensuing harvest, and that these machines are already in Australia. In any case, the history of the agricultural implement industry in Australia shows that the duties have not been passed on to the farmers, and that the importing firms, in almost every case, have had to take a smaller profit because of the fact that it was impossible for them to stand up against the competition of the local manufacturers if they attempted to pass the duty on. The statement of the honorable member for Corangamite (Mr. Gibson) that these duties represent a charge of about 9d. per acre on the farming industry i3 very wide of the mark, and cannot possibly be substantiated. So far from the duties being passed on, the reverse is the case. The local manufacturer is turning out these machines at Â£95, as against Â£97 or Â£98, to which the importing firms had raised the price before the duty became operative. Therefore, the local manufacturer is saving the Australian farmer from some of the charges which would have been imposed on him if there had been no local manufacture. In view of the unanimous recommendation of the Board of Trade, and the, definite undertakings entered into, if this industry were established, with a view to employing, as it is employing, a large number of returned soldiers, the Government must stand by what has been done, whether it is right or wrong. I am not saying that it is wrong. Therefore, although I did feel inclined to meet the honorable member, but not to go to the length the honorable member for Dampier has suggested in reducing this duty, I feel that the Government are obliged to stand by the undertaking given which for the moment I had overlooked.","In Committee of Ways and Means","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[8]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Of course, the Minister explains that he will see that these machines do not come in as parts, but he will be giving his officials a particularly arduous task to perform. Furthermore, I am quite certain that the importers will growl that they are being imposed upon if they are charged full duty upon parts which, when assembled, will form portions of a full machine. Under this proposal the assemblers of the parts will be able to import at reduced rates which will enable such firms as the Massey-Harris Company, which are the biggest sweaters in Australia, to underpay their workers. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Greene) has handed the assemblers over to the tender mercies of the Massey-Harris Company and the International Harvester Company, and they will now have an opportunity of improving their position. I suppose pressure has been brought to bear upon the Minister, and that is why he has shown such weakness. We on this side have not had any assistance from the supporters of the Government, or the members of the Country party, and it appears that some honorable members are making preparations for the next election.

That naturally appeals to those honorable members who feel that they can always do something for their constituents by getting the ear of the Minister and begging for personal favours. That is the way in which certain lucky people can get a line of machinery which they may require placed by the Minister under a duty-free item. This objectionable phrase, I repeat, is entirely new. Item 175 of the 1914 Tariff says :-Any dutiable machinery, or machine tool, or any part thereof specified in any proclamation issued by the Governor-General in pursuance of a joint address passed on the motion of Ministers by both Houses of the Parliament, stating that such machinery, machine tool, or part cannot be reasonably manufactured -within the Commonwealth, and that it should be admitted free; British, free; general, 10 per cent.That is the procedure which has hitherto been followed. The Minister has had no power to declare that various lines of machinery, upon which this Parliament at one time or another had fixed duties, should be allowed to enter the Commonwealth free. I have had a list prepared of the machines which have been admitted duty free since March of 1920. It will be said, of course, that, since these various lines were not being manufactured, or could not be made, in Australia, it was only right that they should be admitted duty free ; but it is only the manufacturer who gets the concessions. Anyhow, they include the following: -Machines for wrapping confectionery.Paper finishing, cutting, and folding.Boilers for flour mills:Shell forging presses.Brazing and steaming machines and all component parts thereof except brushware and leatherware for use in manufacture of yarns (for use in the manufacture of textiles) and textiles.Evaporators for use in production of alkali.Machines for affixing to wheels rubber carriage tyres having an internal wire or wires.Machines for close jointing rubber carriage tyres having an internal wire or wires after attachment to tyre.Swaging machines for tube making.Electrodes of graphite for use in the production of metals, sulphur, chemicals, and lead sulphate.Photographic developing, washing and toning machines.Photographic exposing, typewriting, and cutting machine (automatic).Weaving machines for manufacturing reed or basket work from cordage made of paper.Woodworking - bobbin and spool barrel boring and reaming machine, bobbin and spool barrel turning lathes.Barbed wire making machine.With respect to the last-mentioned item, a Western Australian gentleman some time ago imported one of these machines. He subsequently told me he had been compelled to pay duty at the rate of 45 per cent. I advised him that, under instructions issued by the Minister, the machine was being admitted free. He thereupon made representations to the Customs Department, and eventually secured a rebate of the amount of duty which he had been called upon to pay.","In Committee of Ways and Means","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[20]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

But I have not the slightest objection to the insertion of those words, because they merely reflect what, as a matter of practice, has always been done. Let me tell honorable members how this thing is worked. When we receive an application for the free admission of any particular class of machinery, we immediately ask the applicant to support it with declarations from a number of prominent manufacturers in the line that they do not manufacture that class of machinery. We then proceed to make independent inquiries as to whether it is manufactured in Australia. It is only when an application is definitely supported in the way I have outlined, and when we cannot find anybody who is prepared to manufacture it, that the machinery to which it relates is placed upon the free list. In practice, the definition to which I have referred has always been followed.

They do not include the ordinary machines which are used in manufacturing operations. As a matter of fact, in the working of the Department, the definition which I have quoted has been generally applied. Let me give an instance of this. I visited a factory a little while ago in which a machine was being used for the packing of goods. An empty carton went in at one end, passed along a machine which cut off a piece of paper, and the carton was then filled, weighed, and finally shot off the machine. I do not know whether that machine is a machine tool or an appliance. To my mind it is both. The honorable member for Dampier has suggested that the adoption of this proposal may open the door to corruption. I think that it would be an extremely difficult thing for corruption to occur in connexion with it, for the simple reason that it can be applied only when goods are not manufactured in the country. That is the test. Suppose that any Minister were to say, I am going to allow So-and-So to have certain machinery free of duty, notwithstanding that it is being manufactured in Australia, what sort of hornets nest would he immediately draw around his devoted head? He would not be able to stand against the opposition which would be created for a single instant.

It was probably to meet some special case of that kind that the action in question was taken. But had we done any wrong upon that occasion, Parliament would have learned of it within a very short space of time. As to the application of this item, if honorable members will turn to item 176, they will find a sub-item which reads, Machines and machinery n.e.i. It is one of those drag-net items in the Tariff in which practically everything in the way of machinery is included. It includes every class of machinery, and a vast quantity which is not made in this country. It is impossible to set out in detail in the Tariff all the various classes of machines in existence, or that may come into existence. Take any industry that is being conducted in Australia today. The honorable member for Dampier is always telling us that the local manufacturer ought to be efficient. He certainly ought to be; and if there is invented in some other country a machine which revolutionizes the methods of production in his industry, it is necessary, in order that he may compete, that he shall obtain that machine.

There are quite a number of things which have come under my notice from time to time to which free entry has been given. The honorable member must recognise that to impose the full duty on a machine which cannot be made in this country - and the test all the time is as to whether the machine can be made here - would be to impose immediately on the local manufacturer requiring the machine an additional overhead charge as compared with his competitors abroad, and thus to put him in a relatively worse position. This is not a case where the machine in question is made in this country, but where it is not made here, and in such circumstances we would put the local manufacturer requiring that machine in so much worse a position than that of the manufacturer abroad. As a consequence, we would then have to give him additional protection to enable him to compete. Wherein would lie the wisdom of such a procedure? From a Protectionist point of view, one could not excuse or condone it. It would be nonsensical to load the manufacturer here with a huge additional overhead charge in respect of machinery which could not be made here.

We are fortunate in having, in charge of the Department of Trade and Customs to-day, a Minister against whom the breath of suspicion cannot lie. That gives us an opportunity of discussing these matters entirely free from any personal application, and we should therefore provide such safeguards as will make it impossible for future Ministers to be subjected to? grave suspicion without being able to protect themselves unless specific charges are made. That is the position of every man who is called upon to exercise autocratic powers over matters which affect the interests of sections or individuals in the community. There is no doubt that the power conferred by this clause is such as to make it very much to the interests of some people- importers or manufacturers - to have it operated in either one way or the other. I think it very unwise for Parliament to allow its power of supervision over this matter to pass to the Minister individually, particularly when it covers so wide a range of articles as are. included by the change made in the wording of the item. It is scarcely open to the Minister (Mr. Greene) to rely on a report of the Inter state Commission in this instance, when he has rejected so many of the other reports made by the same authority. I admit at once that it is necessary that some body should have authority to do this thing; but it is highly undesirable that it should rest in the hands of one man without the supervision of Parliament. It places a Minister in a position in which he should not be placed if other remedies are available, and it seems to me that in this case other remedies are available. The Minister, before taking action, should be moved either by specified officials of the Department or by some specified authority.","In Committee of Ways and Means","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[22]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In the case of mangles, for instance, with which we dealt a little while ago, we had no information to show that even ten of any description are produced in a year in Australia. Yet because, somewhere or other, a little industry has been established, as to which, as I say, we have no information, every user is to be taxed. That, I think, is a principle for which, we cannot stand. It is laid down that, if there is an industry producing an article on a commercial basis, the Tariff shall operate, and the whole of the power is placed in the hands of the Minister alone. It is, of course, a great power for any Minister to exercise, and there ought to be every possible safeguard. I further think that the decisions of the Minister should be brought before Parliament in some more definite way than simply in the form of a document handed in with a host of others from time to time. The assent of Parliament should be necessary for these changes at some stage. There cannot be the slightest objection to such subsidiary Tariff arrangements coming before Parliament every quarter, half-year, or year ; and in that way honorable members would be kept informed of what was being done. Then greater publicity ought to be given to these decisions ; the people interested in the particular industry ought to have the fullest notice of what is proposed. I venture to say that not one-half of the members of this House knew that the Minister possessed this extraordinary power until the honorable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) informed us that the Minister could make items free, and could give retrospective relief, as in the case of Tasmania, involving thousands of pounds. I feel quite sure that honorable members generally did not know that by the mere official publication of a document such things could be done. At any rate, it was certainly news to me; and I think there should be some method of either requiring the consent of Parliament to the decisions, or providing that the latter shall be placed before us in some definite way, so that there may be the constant check of publicity on the actions, nominally of the Minister, but really of the officers of the Department.","In Committee of Ways and Means","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[22]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We are very fortunate in having the services of the present Controller-General, who, like his predecessors, has for years followed the practice of selecting the most brainy men for special training, with the result that now, I believe, the Department stands in the happy position of possessing some of the most efficient officers to be found in any part of the world.

I admit that the by-law does not go through all the formalities usually associated with a regulation, but the enactment of the order by the Minister, and its publication in the Gazette, -constitute a departmental by-law for this particular . purpose. As the Minister says, it is obvious that there are many watch-dogs about. The Minister must, first of all, . protect himself by an assurance that the- commodity in question can be commercially . produced in Australia, and to that end he requires certificates from the leading manufacturers in the line in support of the application. Many industries owe their origin to the fact that it was made. possible to obtain patented machines free of duty. In some cases if duty had had to be paid on a machine worth, perhaps, ?100,000, the duty might be anything from ?25,000 to ?40,000, representing all the difference between starting and not starting an industry. I quite admit that it is possible, as in many other Departments - although surrounded by such safeguards it is not likely- that there may be corruption, and that _ a degree of influence may be exercised on a Minister. I have urged for many years the creation of a Tariff Board, and I am glad that the present Minister proposes to appoint one, which I trust will be composed of experts, for the purpose of guiding Parliament in these matters. It maybe advisable, when the Bill is introduced, for the Minister to consider the wisdom of including a clause to the effect that before this item operates it must receive the recommendation of the Tariff Board.","In Committee of Ways and Means","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[24]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The automatic process by which the goods are allowed to enter now is preferable to the older one, by which the introduction was a mere matter of decision by the Executive. In this case, we are safeguarded by conditions that are reasonable and right, namely, that the article is not being made in Australia, and is not likely to be made. Therefore, I think that even the most ardent Free Trader will agree that this is a power which certainly ought to exist in connexion with the Tariff, and which, if exercised in a proper way, will be advantageous to the industries of the Commonwealth. The honorable member has also said that certain electrical appliances cannot be made in Australia. I know that an effort was made a little while ago to convince the Minister that even some of the machines which are being made in Australia should be- allowed to enter the Commonwealth duty free. It so happens that transformers are being made in Western Australia, which, however, is so remote from the immediate interests of the majority of honorable members that they probably will not give that State credit for a manufacture of this kind. The following telegram from the manufacturers of electrical appliances in Western Australia is enlightening: -Strongly protest against allegation that it is impossible to manufacture high-tension transformers in Australia. Output of our works last twelve months was fifty-three transformers, ranging from 6,000 to 150,000 volts, total, 1,450 kilowatts.That is a pretty good record for Western Australia.

In a letter that I have received from persons interested in the carbon industry in Australia, they say that their company recently tendered in Sydney for a contract, and was beaten by an American firm, which put in a price almost 50 per cent. less. They add that the Americans are determined to capture the carbon market of Australia. Prior to the war, Germany and Austria chiefly supplied the carbon used here, but the Australian firm, if it gets the protection that it seeks, will be able to meet the needs of this country in regard to carbon. Men who have invested their money in this business are satisfied that, if they get the protection which was practically promised to them, they will be able to build up an industry that will fully supply the needs of Australia. The opponents of this duty say that sufficient money cannot be raised in Australia for the purpose of establishing factories for the manufacture of all the different classes of carbons required by the various trades operating in the Commonwealth, because the manufacturers in the older countries of the world have not only more up-to-date machinery, but also the advantage of the worlds markets at their command. But our concern should be, not as to what is done in other countries, but as to whether we can build up industries here capable of supplying a/11 the needs of Australia. In order to enable them to be established here; I would build up a wall all round Australia, and prohibit the importation of any goods capable of being satisfactorily manufactured by ourselves, both, in regard to quantity and quality. I know that the picture-show proprietors are anxious to secure an article much below the Australian cost of production, but I am sure this Parliament will not listen to opposition of that nature when the life of young industries is at stake. One firm has already spent ?15,,000in the purchase of land, the erection of a building, and the installation of the necessary machinery for the manufacture of carbons; and it has undertaken to supply the whole of Australias carbon requirements. Our Government Departments were very glad to get the carbons made by this firm during the war; and surely now, armed with the assurance that the company will provide the necessary quantity and quality, the Minister should favorably consider the request of these people for the increase of the duty by another 5 or 10 per cent. The wishes of the picture-show proprietors are a secondary consideration. I have not asked the Minister for much during the consideration of the Tariff, but I hope that the request I am putting forward will appeal to his common sense, provided the people manufacturing these carbons can supply the whole of the needs of Australia, which I am sure they can do.","In Committee of Ways and Means","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[35]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I have, however, read the circular forwarded by the company referred to by the honorable member for Henty (Mr. Francis). My information is that these people are not using graphite to the extent it should be used, and that they are making their carbons from coke. If that is the case, they cannot possibly compete with the carbons made in Great Britain, because the article used in picture shows must be guaranteed to stand a very high voltage. I have seen an Australian carbon side by side with a British carbon, and the evidence in favour of the British article was overwhelming. We have graphite in Australia, and there is no reason why it should not be used. An industry which seeks protection ought to be in a position to deliver the goods. I do not believe these people are doing so. Mr. Langley, an expert in picture-show work, who submitted the Australian carbons to a practical test covering a period of several months, has assured me that they do not approach the British article in any point. On one occasion he found that through the faultiness of the carbon he was using his machine was almost ruined, and if he had not had a stand-by, the show in which he was using the carbon could not have proceeded.. The . protection -on this item - 45 per cent, under the general Tariff - is about the highest protection afforded in the schedule. At any rate, it should be enough to induce any firm to make a good article. It is not worth while imposing a handicap upon other people unless the industry so protected can  deliver the goods  up to the amount of that handicap. The protection afforded in this instance is altogether too high. Mr. Langley is willing to . give a demonstration before any electrical expert nominated by the Government to prove that his evidence is correct. Those associated with him say that they are quite willing that this high duty should be imposed if their evidence is wrong, but that under present conditions they moist use British carbon, -even if the duty be 60 per cent. However, they ; also say that if the Australian . manufacturer can produce carbon aap to the right standard, they will use nothing else. This isa fair proposition, and I think that the discussion on the item should be adjourned to enable this demonstration to be given. We are anxious to foster Australian industries on sound lines. Here is an opportunity of doing so. Let us have a demonstration that this industry is  delivering the goods up to the necessary standard. The same firms are agents for the Australian products. I have made inquiries from another source which show that if one desires to purchase Australian carbons they are not always available. There may be an understanding with some of these firms so that it may pay them better to sell something that is not manufactured in Australia. That is what we should endeavour to prevent. My information was not obtained from the same source as the other information given to me by an expert who said that he was prepared to use the Australian product if it was as good as the British. He also said that he would be compelled to use the British product irrespective of the duty.","In Committee of Ways and Means","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[37]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
340,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"ANSTEY, Frank","JLY","Bourke","N/A","N/A",9080,".- The honorable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr. Foley) appears to be full of information, but so far as I could gather he has not been quoting from any file. I have before me a most voluminous document from the Amalgamated Pictures Limited, which contains nothing but information, but after reading it, I have come to the conclusion that it is of little value; it would take a great deal to convince me on the arguments adduced by that body. I am not likely to alter my opinions in the slightest degree, on the evidence brought forward by this corporation, because all the arguments used against this Australian industry have been employed against other industries. For instance, they say that it is inadequately capitalized, and in answer to that I may say that there is nothing in the world to prevent them contributing the requisite funds. They also say that the products of the Australian Carbon Proprietary Limited are of unsatisfactory quality, and if there is anything in that, the same argument might be used against other industries. There is another statement in their circular letter - I do not think it is true - in which they say that biograph carbons used to cost Â£25 per 1,000, but owing to the new duties, and various other factors, the price has risen to Â£57 per 1,000. That may be so; but what do the other parties say ? The local manufacturers say that for various sizes they, the Ever Ready Company of Sydney, quoted 36s., 43s., 58s., 64s., and 220s. per 1,000 carbons. The prices for the imported article of the same type were 17s. 10d., 19s. 10d., 22s. 2d., 32s. lid., and 123s. 2d. per 1,000, and the opinion is expressed that these were German goods coming in as British. There has evidently been under-cutting to kill the local industry. The Australian Carbons Proprietary Limited say that when their company quoted the Ever Ready Company of Sydney for a large parcel of cell carbons, they were informed that their prices were about 50 per cent, higher than the quote from England notwithstanding that the quote was under the cost of production. They also state -During the war, the cellmakers were charged Â£40 per 1,000 for cell carbons by importers, when my company were able to supply we quoted at Â£12 10s. per 1,000. The result of this was that cellmakers were able to get orders for cells; to-day, two new firms - Widdis Company and McIlwraith Company - are making cells, and only recently received an order for 150,000 cells from the Post Office. This order was only possible on account of our company being able to supply them with the carbons as required, and at a reasonable price.I do not care to what extent the duties are increased. If an industry was worthy of support during the war, and could produce a satisfactory commodity, we should give it adequate protection. In the words of the honorable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best), the higher the duty the lower the price. Of course, every one knows that when the rates are increased the importers bring down the price, in order to compete with internal competition. In this instance we can be a light to the world by producing our own carbons, and if the Amalgamated Pictures Limited want carbons, let them use those manufactured in Australia. Carbons used during the war period can be used in times of peace. I believe the honorable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr. Foley) said that a duty of 45 per cent, was a sufficient handicap, but it all depends on how far a competitor has to run. A handicap of 45 per cent, over a short distance would be a great advantage, but over 100 miles it would not be of much use.","In Committee of Ways and Means","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[38]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Did the Australian Navy use Australian carbons in their searchlights during the war period? Did the Military Department use Australian carbons for military work?

At the same time, I wish that the whole of this Tariff could be taken in globo, so that we could discuss the difference in exchange dumping Bill, which is to be introduced. I was surprised to learn from the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Joseph Cook) yesterday that the difference in exchange with Czecho-Slovakia is eleven times greater than it was in pre-war days. Prior to the war, a German piano could be purchased in Berlin for Â£20, after allowing a fair profit to the seller. If the cost of production of that piano has increased by 100 per cent, 200 per cent., or 800 per cent., the price on the last-mentioned rate would, therefore, be Â£60, which, phis another Â£20, makes it Â£80 for a Â£20 instrument. If Â£20 was sent, by permission of the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Greene), through the Melbourne Post Office, or if a credit was passed through to Great Britain, it would have . a purchasing power of Â£150, so on that basis three pianos could be purchased for what the pre-war price secured one, and a balance would still remain. That is a serious thing, and that is why I am strongly in favour of passing the Tariff so that we can deal with the other very important phase of the question. I believe it is the first time a Minister for Trade and Customs has promised to appoint a Board which will be able to go into the whole matter of Tariff charges. The honorable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) informed me this evening that we might endow that body with the powers that I understand exist in Japan, to follow up the goods even after they are sold. I have carefully perused the Tariffs in existence in other countries, but I had overlooked that important provision. I have received a communication from Williamsons Limited, but there is one paragraph in their letter which I resent very strongly. It reads -We have assisted the carbon manufacturers here during the last two years by experimenting with the local products, in order to give them a fair trial. We have pointed out where the difficulties lie, but there has bren no improvement in the quality of the carbons. We are quite prepared to give you a practical demonstration by an expert as to the inferiority of the locally-made carbons, and the impossibility of using them on our biographic -machines.These people are quite prepared to accept the money of Australian patrons at their shows, but are so unpatriotic that they do not desire to support Australian manufactures. I would like to see an advertisement displayed on their screen in these words, Williamsons do not believe in using the carbons produced in this country. Although these people are personal friends of mine, I feel it my duty as a true Protectionist to place this matter before them. Honorable members will recollect that during recent years the prices of admission have increased considerably, and some companies saved expense by eliminating musicians and placing  hurdy-gurdy machines  in their place.","In Committee of Ways and Means","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[41]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If those Departments have not done so, and are not doing so, the fact carries no weight as an argument against the quality of the Australian productions. The Postmaster-Generals Department uses them, as far as possible, in its activities; and, if we can protect the industry, as the amendment of the honorable member for Bourke (Mr. Anstey) would do, all the Commonwealth Departments would be able to use these carbons, and they would find that they are of the very highest quality. The industry should have the degree of protection which it so richly earned by supplying Australias requirements during the war.Bolts, nuts, rivets, and metal washers, n.e.i. screws with nuts or for use with nuts; engineers set screws, ad val., British, 27Â½ per cent.;. intermediate, 35 per cent.; general, 40. percent.","In Committee of Ways and Means","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[42]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The use of automatic machinery for the manufacture of a host of things in England during the war threw upon the market, at the end of the war, great quantities of very valuable machines, some of the best of which were sent out to Australia at very reasonable prices. The result has been that a number of new industries have been established which call for protection now, so that, in a world of keen and open competition, they may have a chance to become established and prosper. Among these is the manufacture of bright finished or milled screws, nuts, and so on. They- are made in quite a different way from the other lines mentioned in the item; and, in the course of their manufacture, the waste of material is so great that the rates of duty which permit the production of those other lines to be carried on successfully . are altogether insufficient for this new branch of the industry. Of the steel which goes originally into the factory, only one-third is sent out in the finished article. To put the position in another- manner, for every ton of manufactured goods, three tons of raw steel are required. I trust that the Minister will agree to the amendment, since the rates proposed are necessary to preserve an infant industry, which, even in its present state of development, is able to supply the whole of the wants of Australia to-day.

The honorable member for Wimmera (Mr. Stewart) wishes to know why I moved as I did, if my purpose was not to give manufacturers an opportunity to raise their prices. In regard to nearly every item of the Tariff, I am confronted with the position that, if Australian industry is to have a fair chance, the Tariff must be sufficiently high to keep out the most cheaply produced foreign goods. In order to bring that about, such a Tariff must be imposed as would enable the local manufacturer, if he saw fit, to raise his prices to just below those at which the imported goods would have to be sold to cope with the duties. Thus, the Australian maker could improperly exploit the people. But I know that unless a high Tariff is given, Australias industries must struggle against a competition which they cannot overcome. I have arrived at the conclusion, therefore, that, in this Tariff, I shall go as far as the Minister is prepared to go in respect of most items, further than the Minister with regard to some, and not at all with him, possibly, concerning some others. Generally, however, I shall go as high as I believe is necessary to give to the local manufacturer a fair chance to capture the whole of the Australian trade. When he secures that trade, he ought to be able to reduce his prices.","In Committee of Ways and Means","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[43]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I am extremely disappointed that it does not do so. If there is any article in respect of which it is essential we should have the best quality for use, I should say it is horseshoe nails. While the Minister was. speaking, I heard an honorable member interject that the Australian-made article, as usual, was of no value, and it is frequently said that Australians will not use any article made in Australia if they can avoid doing so. Such statements are absolutely absurd and it should be unnecessary to dwell on them. To say that a farrier objects to use an Australian horse-shoe nail solely on the ground that it is not an imported article is ridiculous. The farriers surely know which is the better article, and I have been assured by a number of them that until quite recently it was almost impossible to obtain a good horse-shoe nail. Those used during recent years have been almost exclusively of Australian manufacture. As the Minister has explained, the imported article is now coming into use again, and the Australian manufacturer finds it hard to carry on against this competition.. Unless, however, the Australian manufacturer can make an article equal to that which can be imported, we are not justified in giving him any protection. I regret that the Minister cannot see his way to reduce instead of proposing to increase the protection on horse-shoe nails. Although not a farrier, I have been compelled occasionally to nail on a horse-shoe, and I know how important it is that only nails of the best quality should be used for such a purpose. I therefore consider that the Minister is scarcely justified in proposing to increase instead of to reduce the protection on horse-shoe nails until he has assured himself that the locally-manufactured article is equal to that which is imported.","In Committee of Ways and Means","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[45]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If the Minister (Mr. Greene) had moved to raise the duty on saddlers tacks and lines of that kind, and to reduce the duty on horse-shoe nails, there would have been far more reason in his proposal. Inferior saddlers tacks and brads can do no serious harm, but the use of an inferior horse-shoe nail often leads to the laming of a horse. The Minister, like the rest of us, may some day have a long journey interrupted and the horse he is riding ruined as the result of the introduction of some of these bad nails, which are going to be forced on the community. It is dangerous to restrict in any way the choice of horse-shoe nails. Every mart with experience of horses must know that horses have been crippled by the use of inferior nails. I can bear out the statement made by the honorable member for Darwin (Mr. Bell) that one inferior nail is sufficient to ruin the best horse in Australia. Th.e Minister would be well advised if he reconsidered the item. Every farrier likes to have a choice of nails, and different farriers use different brands. If we take away from a tradesman the nails to which he has been accustomed, we. may have a number of pricked horses and a horse with a pricked hoof is often ruined for life. The laming of one good horse a year would involve to the owner a loss greater than the profit -which the additional duty will give to the local manufacturer.","In Committee of Ways and Means","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[47]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I know as well as does any honorable member who has been in , the country that an inferior horse-shoe  nail is the last thing you want to meet with on a journey. The position, however, is roughly this : In 1905, a . manufacturer of horse-shoe nails here turned out 14,098 boxes, . each of 28 lbs. weight. That quantity -would shoe a . fair . number . of horses.. For -a number pf years later he turned out , well over 10,000 boxes.

Here we have an industry which apparently gave to the Australian public complete satisfaction, as shown by its large output for some years. The manufacturer could not maintain his trade for a number of years unless his nails were giving satisfaction; but he now finds it impossible to compete with imports from outside. I am therefore asking the Committee to agree to this additional duty on horse-shoe nails. It will not work out at a much greater rate, but I think it will give that additional protection which will enable the manufacturer once more to carry on his industry.","In Committee of Ways and Means","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[48]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We, therefore, have to, look for some other reason for the locally-manufactured article dropping out of use. That cannot, be due to the Tariff, because the Tariff has been there all- the time ; and, apparently, under a lower rate the manufacturers did better than they are able to do now. The real reason as. already mentioned, is that the quality of the local article is not so good as that of the imported article. Farriers like the best of nails, and if they find that, with the local article they have to use two nails instead of one, and, at the same time, run; the risk of crippling the horses, all the duties in the world will not keep such nails in use. The duties of 8s. 6d. to 12s. are extremely heavy, and if the quality of the local article is as good as that of the imported, they have ample protection for the industry. Costs are rising in all directions, and we do not know when this is going to end.

I have taken very little part in this business of increasing the cost of living during the last few days. It has gone on satisfactorily and pleasantly without my assistance, but for once I should be in favour of a very substantial duty. I should like to move, but I do not say that I will do so, to substitute for the duties mentioned in the schedule duties of, say, 50 per cent, all round without discrimination, with a view to the introduction of subsequent legislation designed to prevent the manufacture of these articles within the Commonwealth. If a satisfactory duty were imposed for the purpose of making it difficult to import them, we might be prepared to -deal with the other matter afterwards with an open mind. I leave the question to the Committee in the confident belief that when they see I* am favorable to a high duty they will rally round me and give me the support which, in the special circumstances I deserve. The item deals with revolvers and pistols, amongst other lethal weapons. It would be fine if we could prevent their importation, and discourage, as far as this Parliament is able to do so, their free and easy use by youths of seventeen and eighteen in the streets of Melbourne. It is becoming so fashionable to carry a gun nowadays, that a man who is not an expert gunman after having gone to the picture shows about a dozen times is not fit to move in polite society in Melbourne, or indeed, I am sure, in any of the other State capitals. The Minister (Mr. Greene) does not seem disposed to tell me to what extent the bayonet industry, for instance, is flourishing in the Commonwealth. I should like to be assured that we have a good stock of bayonets in hand ready for the day on which we shall have really made the world safe for Democracy and reduced armaments to the standard that the allied nations and our late enemies are endeavouring to reach at the present time by vigorous competition in  the manufacture of lethal weapons of various kinds.

This evening, I have been informed by a big manufacturer as to the arrangement made with him by the Board of Trade, and, presumably, also by the Minister (Mr. Greene) for the manufacture of reapers and binders in Victoria. I am given to understand that negotiations were opened with him by the Board of Trade urging him to make an endeavour to commence the manufacture of these implements, which he had no desire to de-, and that, after some pressure upon him, he was given a definite promise by the Board of Trade that if he did so the duties contained in the Tariff schedule would be placed upon reapers and binders. If that is the position, I contend that it was the duty of the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Greene) to bring the matter before Parliament, because one can readily realize how unfair it would be to a manufacturer if representations of that nature were made to him and he expended large sums of money in establishing an industry. It would be very unjust if the promise had been made by an irresponsible body or an irresponsible Minister. The proper course was not adopted, and as a similar instance may arise in the future, this Parliament - because Parliament and its members are pledged - should have the opportunity of expressing an opinion before the Government or a manufacturer is in any way committed. I mention this matter to enable the Minister for Trade and Customs to explain the position.","Census - The Tariff: Reapers and Binders : Electrical Accumulators","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
445,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BOWDEN, Eric","JRH","Nepean","N/A","N/A",9094,".- I desire to make a personal explanation in regard to an item in the Tariff schedule which has been passed by the Committee. The honorable member for Parkes (Mr. Marr), who is at present attending the sittings of the Cockatoo Island Dock Commission in Sydney, asked me to bring before the Committee an amendment to item 180 e, which embodies accumulators for large electrical works. The matter is of considerable importance in connexion with some contracts which were pending, and which have since been cancelled owing to the high duties. These accumulators cannot be manufactured in Australia, and, after consultation with the Minister (Mr. Greene), I was informed that it was intended that they would either be omitted from the item or that a different . definition would be submitted which would cover what was wanted without- excluding more than was necessary. When the item in question. was> under consideration, I was called out of the chamber, and it was passed, so that I had no opportunity of discussing the matter or submitting an amendment. In fairness to the honorable member for Parkes I think it my duty \o make this explanation,, particularly as I had promised to bring the matter before the Committee. I am to some extent to blame, but the Minister for Trade and Customs must also share a portion of the responsibility, because I had received an assurance from him to the effect that the point I raised would be provided for..","Census - The Tariff: Reapers and Binders : Electrical Accumulators","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
446,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MASSY-GREENE, Walter","KNF","Richmond","LP; NAT from 1917","Minister for Trade and Customs",9094,". - In regard to- the point raised by the honorable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory), I desire to say that I informed the Committee when the item was under consideration exactly what had happened. As far as my recollection serves me, the position was this: The Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen) was looking round for some new industry in which returned soldiers could be employed, and I believe he approached the agricultural machinery section of the Chamber of Manufactures, either directly or indirectly, in an endeavour to arrange for the establishment of an industry in which returned soldiers could be employed. It was out of those negotiations that the proposal arose for the manufacture of reapers and binders, mowers, and hay rakes. The question was submitted to the Board of Trade, so that it might recommend what, in the circumstances, would be a fair rate of duty to impose if that industry were established. It is not correct to say that the Board of Trade promised anything, because it has not any administrative power, and simply acts as an advisory body to the Government in connexion with matters referred to it. The Board of Trade, as such, cannot make any promises, and it did not do so on this occasion.","Census - The Tariff: Reapers and Binders : Electrical Accumulators","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

448,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MASSY-GREENE, Walter","KNF","N/A","LP; NAT from 1917","N/A",9094,"- The Board of Trade did not make any promise, because it has not the power. It merely submits recommendations. The gentleman- referred to- was advised of the position, and that isWhy I adhered to the duties. The Government assured this person that if he started in the industry they would endeavour to impose certain duties; but it was explained at the time that he would commence operations at his own risk, because the verdict rested with Parliament, It was impossible for the Government to say what the duties would be. All the Government promised, if he started the industry, was to stand by the duties we were proposing; and that is why, after referring to mypapers,I found I had to adhere to the schedule.In regard to the matter mentioned by the honorable member for Nepean (Mr. Bowden), . I may explain that for some time -past we have been endeavouring to get adefinition which would enable us to discriminate between various types of accumulators, but up to the present have been unable to do exactly what we wish. I may inform the honorable member that even if the Tariff goes through in its present form, there are means to do what he wishes if on inquiry we find that these particular accumulators are not made in Australia. I will promise the honorable member that the Government will do one of two things. We will either take action, after satisfying ourselves as to the correct procedure,under item 174 or some similar item, or we will recommit the item to give the honorable member the opportunity he desires.Question resolved in the affirmative.","Census - The Tariff: Reapers and Binders : Electrical Accumulators","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
