Eight or ten contractors submitted prices for the work, and paid deposits as a guarantee of good faith, these in some instances amounting to Â£1,000. An alteration in the arrangements was, however, decided upon with the change of Ministry, and a Dill is to be brought before the Federal Parliament to authorize the construction of the line under somewhat different conditions. As it is considered that the contractors who had placed deposits with the Government might be somewhat embarrassed by the delay which now seems probable, it has been decided that their money shall be returned to them, and fresh tenders will probably bc called for at a later date.Part of the statement is obviously incorrect; but I shall be glad if the Minister of External Affairs will explain the other part of it.","COMMONWEALTH RAILWAYS","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[1]/question[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I am not aware that tenders have been invited for the construction of the railway. What was done last session was to pass an Act authorizing the survey of a route for a distance of 50 miles. I understand that my predecessor thought that that Act might be held to be sufficient sanction for the construction of the line; but, in my opinion, a more regular procedure is to bring in a Bill to authorize the construction, and that will be done in due course. It has not been contemplated to invite contracts for the construction of the line pending the passing of such a Bill. What seems to be referred to in the newspaper statement is the action of the last Government in calling for tenders, in anticipation of parliamentary sanction for the construction of the line, for, amongst other things, steel sleepers. Those who tendered were anxious to have the matter decided, and some of them wished for the return of their deposits. I, therefore, went into the matter as soon as possible, and decided that, pending authority being obtained from Parliament for the construction of the line, it would be unsafe to accept any tender for steel sleepers, and I wrote a minute to the effect that the acceptance of tenders would have to bo postponed until Parliament had sanctioned the construction of the line; and that, in the meantime, deposits of tenderers might be returned to them.","COMMONWEALTH RAILWAYS","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[1]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Attorney-General, having interpreted the law in that way, the Government are bound by his statement, and the views expressed warrant this side of the House in taking extreme action. Ministers could not try to evade the law in a more subtle and insinuating manner than by a general intimation to the public such as that of the Attorney- General. I made an intimation to the public, he said, I did not direct the organizations of the Liberal party to send in objections. The honorable gentleman simply made the general intimation that objections could be sent in, and the Department would proceed to examine each one of them. A deposit is required by the Electoral Act to prevent the striking off of names of bond fide qualified electors. Some honorable gentlemen who represent metropolitan and closely-settled country constituencies, in which it is easy for electors to get their names placed on the roll, and to see that names are not improperly struck off the roll, may not see the effect of the Attorney-Generals public intimation. But things are different in the back country, where men have sometimes to be away from their homes for eight months in the year, and are constantly moving from place to place, so that they cannot reply to objections lodged against the appearance of their names on the roll. If the Department acts on the suggestion, or hint, or public intimation of the Attorney-General, it will evade, if not the letter, the spirit of the law, which is upheld by every honest thinking person in the community.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[1]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I presume that he did not intervene merely for the sake of interrupting me. He says that Ministers have made no charge. The Attorney-General has undertaken the purification of the roll. I am not going to reflect on his action as a public man; I am merely concerned with his conduct here. Since he joined the Ministry, he seems to have thought it to be his first public duty to restrict the franchise as much as he can. He may, by the advice he tenders to the Government, enable the Ministry to evade a Statute passed by Parliament to prevent any person from objecting to a name on the roil without depositing 5s. as a guarantee of good faith. If organizations throughout Australia, holding fierce political opinions, views, and prejudices, are allowed to send in objections without incurring any personal responsibility beyond what might be incurred by reason of fraudulent misrepresentation, political corruption is as sure to occur as it is certain that I am standing here. What this will mean must be that organization must check organization, and that machinery must be created whereby every political party can protect its interests. Otherwise the names of electors are likely to be removed from the rolls unjustly. It has been the aim of the Democracy of Australia, especially in connexion with the Commonwealth elections, that every person who is entitled to vote shall be enrolled. The last Government made it the duty of the permanent officials of the Department to see that every qualified citizen was enrolled. It should be a reflection on the Department that any qualified person was not enrolled. Only by the enrolment of every person qualified to vote is pure democratic government possible. No doubt it will be stated by Ministers and their supporters that there were too many names on the roll on the occasion of the last election, but the permanent officials of the Department assure us that that anomaly is absolutely necessary if every person qualified to vote is to be enrolled.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[1]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Chief Electoral Officer who took part in our consultations was asked to suggest a mode by which it would be possible to minimize the excess by removing the names of those, who were dead. I quite agree with the Leader of the Opposition that we cannot get rid of the whole excess if we desire that every one who has a right to be enrolled shall be on the roll, but the Chief Electoral Officer was asked to suggest what should be_ done to minimize the trouble. He pointed out, very properly, that the ordinary official machinery - that of the police of the States - could not be expected to thoroughly and efficiently perform that duty. He said that we must rely on information from local sources which would enable him to put the machinery in force. Tue mere giving of information will not remove a name, or do anything towards removing it. It will simply inform the Chief Electoral Officer of a case which requires to be looked into.

He finds it impossible to explain or in any way justify the extraordinary action taken by himself, presumably on behalf of the Government. In what he was pleased to term his full explanation, he either inadvertently or cleverly failed to touch the real issue, namely, why this intimation was given at some banquet or social, that persons would be permitted to violate the spirit and letter of the electoral law. To that point, however, I hope to return in a few moments. Briefly the position is that, until a few years ago, when honorable gentlemen opposite, under different names, carried on the government of the country perennially, persons were permitted to object to others being on the rolls without payment of fee, and without penalty or responsibility. The outcome was that, in different States, large numbers of bond fide electors were removed from the roll, or were unduly harassed or seriously inconvenienced in attempting to keep their names there. There are to-day in existence wealthy political organizations, who dare not say whence they get their money, and who, systematically, by the aid of men and women canvassers, and a small army of clerks, go through the rolls and take objections to names thereon. Their plea is that they are out for pure rolls, which, from their point of view, are rolls on which their opponents are in a minority. There are organizations in existence which, with the aid of an army of clerks and paid canvassers, systematically object to names being on the rolls. Such organizations are in active existence in South Australia to-day, with the result that almost daily a batch of objections issue from the Electoral Department, in many cases objections being taken to persons living in homes where they have re sided for five to twenty-five years; and the outcome is that, unless these people -make special efforts, in many cases losing half a days pay, in other cases a days pay, and in other cases incurring the serious displeasure of their employers, their names are removed from the roll. That method was in existence in the Federal arena until within recent years, and it was found to be so objectionable in many directions that the Electoral Act was amended to provide that there should attach to these organizations a responsibility when they raised objections.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The existing provision, however, is objectionable to certain political leagues operating to-day. They have objected to it times out of number; they wish to go back to the old method under which, without responsibility or penalty of any description, in a wholesale way, they could lodge objections brought in by their paid canvassers, and through which large numbers were deprived of their right to vote. The Ministry recognise that while this section is in the Act it should be in operation; but, in their suggested amending Electoral Bill, they propose to delete it. They recognise its purpose; they recognise its strength; they know, also, that to their party it is an objectionable provision; they further recognise it has been a wholesome corrective, and they seek, by the power of their majority, to delete it from the Act; but, so far, it remains the law of the land, and, until it is deleted, it should be obeyed. Singularly enough, though it is the law, and has been observed for a number of years - objected to, of course, by the Liberal leagues - the Attorney-General, at a speech given at some social or banquet, intimated in a general way that, in his opinion, the different leagues had the right to make objections without lodging the fee prescribed. We accepted it as merely an opinion the Attorney-General was entitled to express ; but we could not take the view that this intimation of opinion on the part of the Attorney-General was an expression of policy on the part of the Government which the Ministry intended to observe, and which they had instructed their officer? to observe, quite apart from the provisions of the Electoral Act. I am not aware who gave that instruction to the Electoral Officers - if it has been given. According to the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, no such instruction was given; but the reply was qualified by the words,  Under the Bill before the House for amending the Electoral Act; and, because of the qualification, another question was put to the Minister. No doubt the Ministry felt that the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs was in a difficulty, for the Attorney-General immediately jumped to the rescue, and put what, he termed the legal position of the matter, in order to prevent the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs from falling more deeply into the hole which the senior Ministers were digging, possibly without his knowledge. This matter becomes prominent because, during the past few weeks, we find certain political leagues have again become active in a direction where their efforts were checked by the Electoral Act.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[3]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

237,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"ROBERTS, Ernest","KZG","N/A","ALP","N/A",1457,"- As the result of this activity certain questions are put in the House, and then we find that what was understood to be a general intimation and expression of opinion on the part of the Attorney-General at a social was, in reality, a public declaration of Ministerial policy, and we assume that certain political organizations have been given to understand that they may violate the provisions of the Electoral Act. Otherwise it is difficult to account for the sudden renewal of activity in the way of lodging objections to names on the electoral rolls. The excuse advanced by the Attorney-General this afternoon is that the payment of the 5s. fee provided in the Act, which undoubtedly conveyed the spirit of Parliament at the time, and which undoubtedly has been obeyed in the spirit during the last few years, need only be lodged when the person taking the objection demands that the Electoral Officers should subsequently investigate the case; and the Minister has got over the difficulty of the statutory provision by intimating to these people that they can take objections now without limit and without payment of the fee, although there is no guarantee for them that the Electoral Officers will directly investigate each case put before them. That is the excuse given by the Attorney-General for his permission to certain political organizations to violate the provisions of the Electoral Act. It stands to reason that if these objections are put in, and it is the policy of the Government to approve of objections without a penalty or responsibility, and to intimate to their officers that every objection put in must be carefully scrutinized, then the provision in the Act goes for nothing, is of no value, is of no use, and, by the action of the Government, has been deliberately violated for party political purposes in accordance with the desires of the Liberal leagues that control honorable gentleman opposite. It was their practice in the past - and they desire it to be their practice again - to raise objections to thousands of names on the roll in the sure and certain hope that a fair percentage of those objections, frivolous and unjustifiable as they might be, would have effect, and the rolls be depleted of certain names. At present there is no statutory or imperative obligation in the Act, even on the part of Electoral Registrars, to investigate every objection submitted to them. What, then, will be the outcome of this? Thousands of objections will come in, aud the Electoral Department will be kept as busy as it can be inquiring into them if full effect to the provision of the Act is given; but there is no doubt what the method will be. Each case cannot be inquired into; otherwise an army of inspectors would be needed; the number of officers in the Electoral Department would need to be increased a thousandfold, and the whole community, the Labour community in particular, would be daily harassed by visits from inspectors and by inquiries as to whether names should be kept on the roll or not. If the slightest, notice is to be taken of objections, the practice adopted will be similar to that followed in the States. When an objection is lodged the clerk in the Electoral Registrars office will fill in a form to that effect, and send it to the person to whom objection is taken, chancing whether he gets it or not. If he receives it, and can afford the time and money to raise objections to his name being removed from the roll, it may be left there. If, on the other hand, he does not receive the communication, as will be the case with hundreds and thousands of bona fide workers throughout the Commonwealth, his name will be removed. Honorable members must know we are dealing with certainties, and not possibilities. Hundreds and thousands of bona fide workers will not receive the communications in time, and their names will be struck off by default. Is that what is aimed at? Is that the object of honorable members opposite? Whatever their object may be, they must agree with me that will be the result. Thousands of men will lose their votes because they happen to be seamen, shearers, rouseabouts, boundary riders, casual labourers, men out of regular employment, and men who have to travel to seek employment, men whose presence is essential to the welfare of the community, even though they are not permanently employed, and who, whenever they are able to do so, perform honest and useful work. But, for no other reason than that they may be travelling in search of work, because they may be nomadic in their character or nature, honorable gentlemen on the other side of the chamber will subject them to the indignity and injustice of having their names removed from the electoral rolls. I do not know whether it will be permitted. I hope sincerely it will not, otherwise it will be a grave injustice and a serious reflection upon those who are responsible for it, even as the conduct of the Ministry now amounts to a serious reflection upon them. May I return for a moment to the original point at issue? The information given by the Attorney-General deliberately violates a provision of the Electoral Act. In this way we see to what length honorable members on the other side will go. They will frame regulations to suit their desires. They will carry out their administration as pleases them. But when they go further, and deliberately allow the public, without responsibility or penalty, to disregard the provisions of a measure passed by both branches of the Legislature, we are forced to the conclusion that their standard of honour is one previously unknown in the Federal arena, and that no interest is safe in their hands, because no sense of justice moves them. I hope that honorable members on this side will not permit such conduct to pass without the condemnation that it deserves; without that exposure that will let the electors see what Ministers are prepared to do. I put it clearly to honorable members that, if we tamely permit Ministers to break one Act of Parliament to-day to suit the desires of the Liberal Leagues which control them, they will break another Act to-morrow, and a third the next day, and no interest will be safe. No section of the community can move with a feeling of safety when there is in power a Ministry who, to suit party purposes, will deliberately break Acts of Parliament, and will override them with an indifference that defies description, seeking, though lamely, to excuse their conduct.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[3]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The outcome of the inquiry has been disappointing in the extreme to Ministers and to their supporters. We do not know what it might have been, or what allegations might have been published in the newspapers, had not scrutineers been provided for. Prior to the inquiry, the newspapers teemed with allegations of misrepresentation, duplication of votes, personatiou, and all kinds of frauds.

Yet the right honorable gentleman continues to believe that there were irregularities, and will believe it of every electoral division that has not returned supporters of the Government. He will not believe it of the divisions whose electors are so benighted that they returned Ministerial supporters. In those divisions no fraud or wrong was done. That is the mental condition of the right honorable gentleman. However, I do not desire to be drawn off the point at issue. I want to raise, in as clear terms as possible, my decided objection to the action of the Ministry. The evidence that they have produced proves conclusively that no interest is safe; that Ministers regard with no respect, much less veneration, an Act of Parliament; and that when ib suits their party purposes, or when the organizations controlling them desire it, they will permit of the violation of the law. No one knows better than the Attorney-General the effect of the intimation that he made to the public the other day. He knows that it violates the spirit and the letter of the Electoral Act. Section 67 is as clear as need be, and the practice adopted during the last few years in respect to it has been clear. It has been a wholesome corrective which honorable members have hitherto desired. There were three parties in politics when the provision was adopted, the so-called Liberals gladly joining with the Labour party in voting for the provision to check the admittedly Conservative section - with which they have since combined forces - from wrongly removing names from the rolls. In addition to the intimation which the Attorney-General has made in his speech, there must have been an intimation given to the Liberal Leagues, if not directly by him, by other members on that side, of an alteration of policy, and of their privilege to violate the Act, because these leagues have become suddenly active, and objections are being lodged without limit. If honorable members, knowing what the outcome will be, are prepared to allow the present state of things to continue, they must be content with having placed upon them the stigma that they deliberately connived at the removal from the roll of the names of bond fide electors. It has ever been the method of the Conservatives to reduce the voting strength of the community, because where the voting strength is weak they succeed. When a Democracy is permitted to exercise its voting strength, Conservatism shrinks. Because honorable members opposite are temporarily in power, they revert to the old Conservative method of weakening the electoral roll. I would raise objections to this sort of thing under any circumstances. If, by virtue of a mandate from the people, or because they thought they had such a mandate, they proposed an alteration of the law, we should have to submit to it. But they are attempting to violate the law by means of administration, without giving, even to members, an intimation of what they intend to do. We have had to drag an avowal from them as sometimes teeth have to be drawn from patients.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[3]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I do not believe that any honorable members opposite are personally anxious to remove names from the rolls; the request for such action must have come from outside. But Ministers are providing for this by an administrative act, which shows clearly that their standard of honour is not such as to justify the belief that any Australian interest is safe with them, and that, although possessing merely* temporary power, they will do such things as will reflect seriously upon them, violating the rights and privileges of the general public.

326,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MCDONALD, Charles","KQP","Kennedy","N/A","N/A",1464,".- The one object of the Honorary Minister a few moments ago was to divert the attention of the House from the position taken up by the Leader of the Opposition and the honorable member for Adelaide. I observe that the honorable gentleman is leaving the chamber just after he has made his speech, although he is in charge of the Department the maladministration of which is under review. The most extraordinary point is that, when the honorable gentleman was asked to-day whether a certain thing had been done, he replied in the negative, and it was left for the Attorney-General to say that it had been done. What are the Government doing to allow these inconsistencies and inaccuracies ? If we are entitled to anything, we are entitled to the fullest information in connexion with Acts of Parliament and their administration. The statement of the Honorary Minister was either made designedly or in gross ignorance - he can take his choice. But it was left to the Attorney-General to clear up the matter. Is it not a most remarkable thing that it was left to the Attorney-General to get up again and explain the Bill after both the Prime Minister and the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, with an amount, I might almost say, of impudence, had given the House their explanations and been caucussed ? In spite of what the Honorary Minister says, section 67 of the Electoral Act, as defined by the honorable member forAdelaide, makes provision for certain people who desire to lodge 5s., and make objections to persons names being on the rolls; but, in the event of any objection being frivolous, it is within the power of the Department to mulct the person objecting to the extent of Â£5; and that is the thing that deters many organizations from lodging objections against names on the roll. Then the Honorary Minister comes along and says that the honorable member for Adelaide is not fair in not reading section 69. But the honorable member himself omitted to read it until his attention was drawn to it. Clause 69 provides for the Electoral Officer getting the necessary information to make up the roll in a correct way ; he may get the assistance of the police, or may get assistance from other sources; but section 67, which the Government now through their action practically nullify and violate, says that there should be a 5s. deposit, and section 72 makes the person lodging it liable to be mulct to the extent of Â£5 in the event of a trivial objection. The violation of this section will enable political parties - the Labour party, the so-called Liberal party, the Fusion party, or the Womens National League - to drag the provision into the mire of politics; and we know that when party politics are so bitter as they are now, things will be done on both sides not calculated to work in the best interests of the rolls. The Attorney-General says that the wild statements made by myself about hundreds of people being knocked off the roll were not worth considering. But I have seen thousands of names knocked off the rolls. I have seen fifty or sixty names enrolled from a shed, but at the next Revision Court the men were not at that shed ; the shed was not their address; they were shearing a hundred miles away, perhaps. What was the result? The station manager, or whoever was presiding there, would send into the Electoral Registrar objections to these names, because the persons were not at that address, and, though these men were working and living in the electorate, they were disfranchised, and could not vote at the election. According to the Honorary Minister, there are 177,000 names on the roll more than there should be. These are said to be the figures of the Statistician; I do nob know whether they are, because we have had no return laid on the table to show whether it is true or not, but I am prepared to accept it - and the statement has been made, not only in the House a number of times, but it has been made by a number of speakers on platforms outside the House. What is the actual result? It has been done to deliberately mislead the people, because it is not true. I say it is not true, because I take the case of my own electorate, which, I presume, is typical of every other electorate, though there may be in my district more people who have to move from place to place in search of employment. From the ordinary roll and the supplementary roll, it would appear that there are 39,000 odd electors on the roll ; but that is not the actual case, as the official roll on which the recent election was fought contained only 34,000 names. Every one knows this, and knows that there is no inflation of the rolls at any time. If there was inflation of the official roll, the presiding officer, or the Electoral Registrar, should be dismissed at the earliest possible moment. But, as a matter of fact, as soon as it is known that a person has left the district or made an application for transfer, the Electoral Officer erases the name of that person from the official roll, and that is the roll issued to the presiding officers throughout the electorate. Now, if that can be done in the electorate I represent, which covers an area nearly four times the size of the State of Victoria, it could be done in the various electorates of Victoria ; and when we hear these statements made time after time that rolls are inflated, we know it is not so. The Attorney-General wishes to get pure rolls with the additional names on them. But I say he cannot do it. If he consults his officers, they will tell him that they cannot do it. If he gives the matter a moments thought, he will find that they will not be able to get pure rolls.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I have been accused by the press of the other side of everything from  pitch-and-toss to manslaughter; so his statement does not worry me in the slightest. I say the rolls are really not inflated, and I say distinctly that, whether or not, you have the provision now proposed, you will still have a certain amount of inflation. It cannot be otherwise. We must have the original roll apart from the supplementary roll, and while the original roll is there, there must be hundreds of people moving from one electorate to the other from the time the roll is printed until another takes its place. It does not matter whether we close the rolls a month or two months prior to an election. Unless we are prepared to do it three or four months before an election we cannot possibly have the rolls absolutely devoid of names that should not be there. Ministers talk about an inflation to the extent of 177,000 names. I know, up our way - and I have heard it said about other electorates - that a large number of people were not on the rolls at the last election. I suppose if we could get at the actual number, we would find that there are probably tens of thousands of people in Australia who did not have votes at the last election. There is justification, therefore, for our viewing this action of the Government with suspicion, because we know what has taken place. Those connected with members on the other side have the means of getting together vast sums of money, by which they can employ paid organizers and paid clerks. I have seen dozens and dozens of those clerks employed looking over the rolls. What do they do it for? It is for the purpose not of trying to put men on the roll, not to see that every man has a vote, not to see that the rolls are purified, but to see how many names they can knock off, more particularly the names of those opposed to them. I have seen it done very frequently. In the State from which I come, I regret to say it was done to such an extent that it became a scandal, and if it had occurred in any European country to half the extent it was done in Queensland in connexion with the electoral rolls, it would have caused a revolution. We must judge honorable members opposite by their associates. In South Australia, at the present time, they are cutting up the electorates, and, by their majority, forcing a Bill through the House so that the man who lives in the city shall have only a third of the voting power of the man in the country.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[7]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is idle for honorable members to say it is not so. In this case, the worst feature is that there was a clause specially put into an Act of Parliament to prevent such a state of affairs. I regret the Attorney- General should allow himself to be dragged into this matter. He has a big reputation as a barrister, and to put up the paltry excuse he did this afternoon was certainly not creditable to him, nor to his ability, nor to his great reputation. He wandered on trying to explain this practically illegal act. If there is one thing Parliament should guard against more than another it is administrative attempts to evade the law. One of the most serious things that any body of men could be guilty of is the attempt to act contrary to law. An Executive should disregard the law only in great emergencies, as in time of war, when the safety of the nation might demand it. Ministers who can disregard an Act of Parliament in a small matter will do the same thing in regard to big matters. There is cause to wonder, therefore, how far Ministers are prepared to go. They find their position hopeless, there being no possibility of doing business. Why should they be permitted to do business? No more disgraceful state of affairs than at present exists has ever been known in the history of Australia. The two political parties are evenly divided, and the Prime Minister carries round a particular vote in his pocket. That is a disgrace. But Ministers are trying to gerrymander the electorates, so that, in the event of an appeal to the country, they may have a chance of being returned. If I had my way, I would keep them in office for six months, because, judging by the blunders that they have already made, they would, in that time, blunder themselves out of existence altogether. I view what has been done with grave suspicion, and I regret that they have dragged departmental officers into this controversy. Such action is despicable. No Minister should drag in his officers, saying that they wish such-and-such a thing to be done. Our officers cannot defend themselves here, and they should not be mixed up with party politics. Every Minister should be responsible for what he says and. does. I presume that a Minister, before accepting information from an officer, makes sure that that officer is fully acquainted with the facts. It is the duty of a Minister to decide what use he will make of departmental information; but he must take full responsibility for anything he does, and not try to put any blame on his officers. I have full confidence in the officers of the Electoral Department. Whatever their individual opinions may be, I am sure that they will act honestly and rightly in the conduct of elections. But when organizations such as the Womens National League, the Peoples Party, the Liberal Association, the Trades Hall, and others, are allowed to submit long lists of names which, they say, should not appear on the roll, injustice is sure to be done to many electors. The Government have committed a crime, and their action would cause great trouble in any other country than this. By the cunning of the Attorney-General they have set aside an Act of Parliament.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[7]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

They said that they took office to restore Ministerial responsibility and honest, efficient government; but we find them contradicting one another - the Minister controlling electoral administration making one statement, and the Attorney-General another. But there are ample grounds for the grave suspicion that their administration will mean the disfranchisement of thousands of persons. Whether, technically, persons may send in objections without depositing 5s. in each case matters not, so far as the general public are concerned, because what percentage of the electors have read the Electoral Act? A few active spirits connected with political organizations may have copies of the Act in their offices, but the masses of the electors have not read it. They are made aware from the platforms, and in other ways, that if an objection to a name on the roll is lodged a deposit of 5s. is expected to accompany it. In the past, every difficulty has been put in the way of enrolment, and every facility given for the striking of names off the roll. Until the last amending Act was passed, men who had been living for twenty years in a small town, under the eyes of the local police who collected the names for the rolls, often discovered on election day that their names had been removed without their knowledge. The rolls were always incomplete, thousands of persons entitled to enrolment not having their names on the rolls. This was due to faulty administration. The Attorney-General says now that quite an innocent thing has been done by the Government. He is an able man, and no one knows the meaning of language, especially of legal language, so well as a lawyer. He tells us that the Government have invited the co-operation of the general public for the purification of the rolls, and that the Act imposes on registrars the duty of investigating objections to enrolment. He did not tell us what the word  investigate  means. If we do not watch carefully this action of the Government, there will be an immense disfranchisement. It is strange that the present month should have been chosen for this attempt to purify the rolls, seeing that in September those engaged in the most important industry in the Commonwealth - the wool industry - are necessarily absent from their homes in large numbers.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In the past, the man of nomadic occupation has been prevented by legal technicalities from recording his vote. But at the last election, for the first occasion in our history, we had a very large enrolment. The printed roll necessarily, if every person qualified is enrolled, must have more names on it than there are persons entitled to vote, because it is impossible to keep it up to date and prevent some names from being recorded twice. It does not follow, however, that there is duplicate voting, and it has been proved that there was none at the last election. We are told that it is the duty of the registrars to investigate objections to enrolment. A registrar is told that So-and-so is not entitled to have his name on a roll. He asks why, and is informed that the man lias left the district. The registrar then makes an inquiry into the allegation. Does he personally go to the address of the person objected to to ascertain whether he has left? We know that he does not. Registrars do their work as efficiently as possible, but, generally, they are busy postmasters with large responsibilities. The roll is not collected by them , and they have not to look into these matters personally. They depute their investigations to others, taking such evidence as they can get. At the present time there are at least 50,000 men engaged in the wool industry away from home, and they may be away for three months. Under the Act, after a man has been away from a district for a month, he is expected to transfer his name to the district to which he has moved. That, of course, does not apply to persons who are only temporarily away. But when objections are lodged to the enrolment of such persons, and an intimation of the fact is sent to their permanent address, they often never get the intimation, because they are moving from place to place. If, under such circumstances, their names are struck off the rolls, they are treated unjustly. But that has happened in thousands of cases. It is the method taken by Conservative and alleged Liberal Governments for reducing the voting strength of the community. During the last three years the policy was the reversal of the old policy.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[8]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Men who are under engagement must carry out the terms of their contract. Shearing at one shed may last for a month or six weeks, and during that time the shearers or shed hands are away from home. Their names, however, are on the roll, and they are entitled to vote. Under this precious proposal they will be disfranchised. The Attorney-General says that when objections are lodged the police will be instructed to make inquiries. I am sure that he has not the authority of the Electoral Office for that statement. If the police are to make these inquiries, then the Government are proposing to introduce a new system. As a matter of fact, the police are not available to make inquiries whenever an objection is lodged. The police have many duties to perform, and are expected to know every one in the district in which they are stationed. If, in one of the cases to which I have referred, a constable reported that he had made inquiries, and found that the person concerned had been away for a month or six weeks, what would the Registrar do? Apparently he would remove his name from the roll. It is difficult to obtain any information from this Government, although they have introduced the system of a double-barrelled Ministerial head for one Department. Under that system we find one Minister contradicting the other. If one says that a certain thing is black, while the other declares it to be white, we shall never be able to find out what really is the colour.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[8]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

353,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"SPENCE, William","KUF","N/A","N/A","N/A",1469,"- The honorable member is right. The Government party is a Fusion team, and they are bound to be contradictory of each other. They have bungled everything that they have attempted to deal with. In the case of shearers and others who are away from home for a month or six weeks inquiry would disclose the fact that they were absent. It would be said that they had apparently left the district, and, as their address would probably be unknown, they could not be communicated with, so that on their return they would find their names off the roll. This proposal will affect many thousands of workers. So far I have referred only to those engaged in one industry, but there are thousands of persons engaged in other seasonal industries, such as harvesting and fruit-picking, who have to leave their homes for some weeks at a time in order to earn their living, and these will be disfranchised. Surely it is bad enough for a man to have to leave his home and his family to find work without being disfranchised. It is all very well to say that it is the duty of the Registrar to keep the rolls clean, but we are face to face with an entirely new development. The late Government said to the Electoral Officers,  It is your duty to keep the rolls as correct as possible, but it is especially your duty to see that every adult is enrolled. The compulsory enrolment provisions of the Act were designed to throw upon electors the responsibility of seeing that they were on the rolls, and it was recognised that, in the desire to have an absolutely correct roll, some names, which ought to be on, would be removed. It is absolutely true, as stated by the honorable member for Kennedy, that the immense number of voters on the voters roll is not in keeping with the number on the official or certified rolls which were used on election day. The present Government entered upon their duties with the idea that, since their predecessors were a Labour Administration, everything must have been conducted on crooked lines, and that all sorts of fraud had been committed in connexion, with the last general election. Their investigations, however, showed that the election was one of the cleanest ever held. They were utterly unable to find any evidence to support their allegation, but, with the object of getting ready for another election, they are now issuing a new set of instructions to the officers of the Electoral Department. Those officers do their work as well as they can, but honorable members find it impossible to obtain in the House any information from the Government. What information we have is gathered from statements by Ministers at tea parties outside. It is clear, however, that the attitude of the present Government is exactly the opposite of that taken by the Labour Administration, which directed the Department to give every adult a chance to exercise the franchise. This Government starts off by telling the electoral officers that they must revise the rolls, and get rid of as many names as possible. Men of experience know that it is exceedingly difficult to ascertain the names of deceased persons on the rolls. The average, man will say,  Surely, as every death must be registered, there should be no difficulty in obtaining this information. But experienced electoral officers will tell you that there are several difficulties in the way. Sometimes a man dies in a hospital, and the hospital authorities do not know his address; whilst very often the deaths are recorded of several persons bearing the same name, and it is impossible to know which name ought to be struck off the roll. That is an inherent difficulty. Some one reports that  John Smith -=- and the Smith family is a very large one - has died. If the address of the deceased person is given, the information may be very useful; but why leave to the general public the giving of such information? I enter my strong protest against these proposals on the part of the Government. Experience shows that thousands have been disfranchised because they have had to leave home temporarily to seek work. Others, again, owing to the defects of a bad system, have been disfranchised, although they have never left their usual place of residence. Listening to Ministers talking of the Department getting the assistance of various political organizations, the inexperienced outsider would imagine that they had made a new discovery. As a matter of fact, their political organizations have always been active in this regard. They are not going to be more active now, unless it be that they intend to work in a way that they have not done previously. Officials of the Womens National League, for instance, have always been active in trying to remove names from the rolls. At the last general election I saw a printed list of hundreds of names which were to be objected to, if possible, on polling day. The only people whom such organizations desire to be enrolled are those who have  correct  views.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[8]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I regret there has been such delay in delivering the Budget-speech, but it was not possible to have it earlier. This, the third temporary Supply Bill that I have had to introduce, asks for a months Supply to the amount of Â£1,121,979. There is nothing unusual in the proposals contained in the Bill. The only matter that really requires explanation is that of the Treasurers Advance, which it is proposed to increase from Â£650,000 appropriated in the two previous Supply Bills by a further appropriation of Â£300,000. This increase is due to the system which has been adopted ever since the establishment of Federation, and by which all works and services prior to the passing of a Works Appropriation Act have to be paid out of Treasurers Advance. In the early days this method, so far from being inconvenient, was, in fact, very convenient; but the works now have attained such immense volume that it is no longer suitable. Personally, I do not like asking for what apparently looks like entrusting the Treasurer with an advance on account of nearly Â£1,000,000. It is entirely due to the system which has been in force for the last twelve years, and not to any desire on the part of the Treasurer to spend money in directions not authorized by Parliament.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[9]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Thinking that honorable members might adversely criticise the request for Â£300,000 more for the Treasurers Advance, I had a statement printed and circulated showing that out of the Â£650,000 previously voted a sum of Â£606,650 had been expended on the following works : - Additions, new works and buildings, Â£241,000; construction of telegraphs and telephones, Â£279,000; naval and military new works, Â£64,100; Northern Territory works, Â£12,550; and wireless telegraphy, Â£10,000. This leaves only Â£43,350 as the amount really chargeable to expenditure under what is properly Treasurers Advance. I can assure honorable members that the greatest care has been taken in the expenditure of this large amount of money ; but, as I say, I think the better, and, indeed, necessary plan in the future will be to obtain Supply for Works and Buildings in hand authorized by Parliament during the previous year, and to avoid asking for large sums of money for Treasurers Advance. In Committee, I shall be glad to explain any of the itemsI have just read, and be able to show honorable members that everything has been done regularly and in order. It is understood that temporary Supply Bills shall not include works and services not already authorized by Parliament. That, to some extent, is inconvenient, because works have to be delayed until the approval of Parliament is obtained. There is, however, no alternative, as there is no authority- to spend money on works not already authorized unless small works out of the Treasurers Advance. I do not think I need say anything more. We shall have the Budget this day week, and then I shall have the opportunity of placing before honorable members, as well as I can, the financial position of the country in all its various aspects.

I am in charge.In respect to this little Bill, he admits lie has not done quite right;. he does not believe in the Treasurers Advance Account;  But what could I do V he says - and this is encouragement to us all - if you only leave me here another year, I will not do it at all. A man with as little heart and soul in him as there is in a stone monument could not resist an appeal and inducement of that sort. For my part, the Treasurer shall remain there for many years if we have a positive assurance that he will give to various measures that careful consideration that he obviously has given in this case. I am sure that all that explanation of the use to which he has put the moneys he is asking for has sunk into the bottom of the soul of every man here. I venture to say that there is no human being in this chamber who has the faintest idea of it. But that is entirely because we are unable to appreciate the manner in which the right, honorable gentleman sets forth his arguments. There is that personal equation. To understand the right honorable gentleman we must appreciate him, and trust him with absolute faith. No Christian scientist ever approached a difficult problem of acute colic with that pathetic faith and trust in the efficacy of belief with which the right honorable gentleman approaches the financial position. However, wo are to wait a week before we can get anything further, and we are, at the same time, face to face with a declaration by the Attorney-General with reference to an electoral matter which places the House in a very awkward position. We dp not care to refuse Supply; that would be quite improper, not only from the stand-point of the country, but because it would inflict on the right honorable gentleman a blow which, in his delicate state of health, I venture to say, he could hardly survive ; and I shall not venture so far. I say, however, to the Attorney-General that in making a statement of the sort that I have been told the learned gentleman did make, in reference to the rights of electors under the present Act, in relation to objections, he failed altogether to point out the fundamental distinction between giving information and making an objection. These things are fundamentally distinct. What the elector now has is the right to supply the Electoral Office with information. It is an inherent right, not only in regard to the electoral law, but practically in regard to all laws where a citizen is not, for some reason, statute barred; but, as in most other cases, while a citizen may give information, it remains for somebody else to initiate a prosecution. In this particular case the individual elector may supply to the Electoral Office as much information in respect to as many electors as he pleases, and the Electoral Office may, or may not, investigate that information ; and, if it thinks fit, may even proceed, under sections 67 and 68, to bring the matter before a Court, which Court has the power of striking names off the roll. What is now proposed in the Electoral Bill is, instead of the present method, by which objections are to be made, each objection having to be accompanied by a sum of 5s., to substitute a system by which objections lodged by an individual elector are made the foundation of a proceeding before a Court. The foundation of the present proceeding in the Courts is action by the Electoral Office, or action by some person who has deposited a sum of 5s. It is proposed now to enable any person, without depositing the sum of 5s., to proceed to instigate the Court to action, and to strike off a name. The Attorney-General speaks about having a pure roll. We are just as anxious to have a pure roll; but there is a difference between a pure roll and offering an inducement to party managers and organizers to strike off the rolls the names of their political opponents. We are all very human, and party organization is about as human an institution as it is possible to get. We say,  We give yon money; we supply you with machinery; your business is to lodge as many objections as possible. It is notorious that, in England, the two party machines, between elections and preparing for by-elections, are almost exclusively engaged in striking off the rolls the names of their opponents, and in putting their own on. The right to supply the Electoral Office with information is a right that should not be curtailed. It is now in the possession of- every elector in Australia, and I have been told - and if it is not true we should be informed - that the Electoral Office, because of that information, has acted on it, and will act on it. That, however, is quite a different matter from the proposal in the Electoral Bill, which is that this information, coming from a tainted and an interested source, is to be the foundation upon which a mans name is to disappear from the roll. True, the man has to be notified; that is to say, notice has to be sent to his last postal address. The Australian is more largely nomadic in his habits than the inhabitants of other countries. The other day the honorable member for East Sydney gave an amusing illustration of the extent to which men and women move about during elections. A large proportion of the people in any electorate shift about, and I venture to say the sending of a notice to the last postal address of the average elector is a very poor way of notifying the elector of the objectors intention to object to his name. The present position is that every elector has the right to supply information to the Electoral Office to assist in the purification of the rolls.The present right is fundamentally different from the right which will exist if the Electoral Bill becomes law. However, as it is desired to report progress, I shall reserve any further remarks I have to make for another occasion.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[10]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
