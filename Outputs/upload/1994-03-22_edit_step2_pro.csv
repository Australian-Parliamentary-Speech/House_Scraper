That should basically provide for private members business for some hour and a half prior to question time. This is in response to a number of propositions that were made from both sides of the chamber that, where Mondays are holidays and the parliament does not sit for some reason, all of private members business ought not to be lost.Accordingly, we have put in the traditional private members debate, the grievance debate, and made sure that that has been persisted with. I notice that the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) had asked in particular that members statements, the 90-second statements, should also not be lost in the process. I think, on reflection, that this is probably not enough and that in future when private members business is ruled out we will look at a more extensive opportunity for private members on the subsequent day or more specifically, as is likely, on the Wednesday where there is a full morning sitting.Nevertheless, at this stage the government is responding to those propositions by including that hour and a halfs worth of private members business for tomorrow, and I hope that honourable members will find that useful. As I said—because I am sure I am anticipating debate here—I am sure a number of members will say, `What happened to the motions? What happened to the committee reports?, and all the rest of it. That is a fair point, on reflection, and this is not a particularly good week for that, being the last week of a block of sittings. But in future we will look at a much broader private members opportunity when those Mondays are ruled out.","N/A","BUSINESS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

78,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr PEACOCK","MI4","(Kooyong)","LP","N/A",1792,"—Mr Acting Speaker, the subject of the Strategic review lies at the heart of not only Australias defence policy but also its foreign policy. I will be somewhat critical of assumptions made in this review, notwithstanding the fact that we have a broadly bipartisan foreign policy in this country. There is very little bipartisanship in domestic programs in this country, but in the field of foreign policy where we have differences with the government we state them firmly and to the point. In recent weeks we have had differences with the government on its recognition, and the manner of it, of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and a week before that some trenchant criticism of ASIS and the need for a review of the Australian Security Intelligence Service.Taken overall, there is a large degree of bipartisanship. This is not just because we want to be agreeable in this area. We generally take the view that where it is possible for countries to see an ongoing commitment in the relationship—notwithstanding changes of political parties in government from time to time—that is the better approach. The Strategic review , however, whilst extremely important from a foreign policy point of view, is primarily involved in defence assessments and defence oriented aspects. But we hardly have a foreign policy if there is no credible defence policy.In the brevity of these discussions today, it is not my intention to focus on the more strictly defence elements of the Strategic review . These have been addressed by the shadow minister for defence, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith). In assessing the Strategic review , my point of departure from the government is the emphasis it places on Australias post-Cold War strategic outlook, on regional security dialogue and on redefining, against that background, Australias alliance relationship with the United States.The 1993 Strategic review makes clear that `region wide multilateral security dialogues are only beginning to be established. The processes of Asia-Pacific regional security dialogue are less than a decade old and have only within the last year found a formal venue in the newly created ASEAN regional forum, which was established by the ASEAN post-ministerial conference in Singapore last June and which will hold its inaugural meeting in Bangkok this July. This represents a tremendous and very positive step forward, and I wholeheartedly endorse it. However, the fact is that regional security dialogue is new and its direction and scope are not yet clear. It is, and must be, a very high priority for Australian foreign policy, but it has not yet reached that degree of institutional maturity where it can be seen as a cornerstone of Australias defence posture.I fully welcome and encourage the now evident trend not only in Australia but throughout our region to focus on constructive exchange and dialogue on regional security issues, but we must recognise the necessarily limited role this emerging regional dialogue is able to play in enhancing Australias security in the foreseeable future. This dialogue cannot yet in any way substitute for Australias existing network of bilateral defence and security arrangements in the region, nor for a strong Australian Defence Force. This is a simple pragmatic point. It is too soon to seek to redefine our defence relationships, as the 1993 Strategic review attempts to do, in terms of the hopeful cooperative possibilities embodied in a very new regional institution. The time may come—and it would be welcome—but it has not yet been reached.Australias active engagement in regional security dialogue should not diminish the importance we continue to place in this country on our bilateral defence relations with ASEAN countries, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and so on. Recent years have seen impressive developments in defence cooperation between Australia and certain South-East Asian neighbours. Singapores decision to base air force training activities at the RAAFs Pearce base in Western Australia and similar proposals about the use of ADF facilities in northern Australia are cases in point.More frequent joint training exercises with Indonesia and other South-East Asian countries also highlight the trend. But whilst regional security dialogue can complement these activities it cannot substitute for them. In the same manner, the new priority on regional security which is evident in the Strategic review should not aspire to replace or diminish the importance of what must remain a full and complete ongoing commitment on the part of this country to our alliance relationship with the United States.I am concerned that some may infer from the 1993 Strategic review a justification for narrowing the scope of our relationship with the United States and for underplaying the importance of nurturing the existing network of defence cooperation arrangements we have with other major players in our region. I take issue with the governments apparent view that `the notion of a Western strategic community is no longer a defining factor in ensuring global security. Whilst it is no longer strictly appropriate to describe the strategic consensus which underlies alliances such as NATO and, in our region for us more directly, ANZUS and the five-power defence agreement as `Western, these alliances remain fundamental to our national security and need therefore still to be taken into account in Australias strategic planning.I cannot agree with the view of the present government, as expressed in the Strategic review , that our alliance relationship with the United States should be seen primarily in the context of our shared commitment to security in the Asia-Pacific region. This is overwhelmingly the case in normal circumstances but it is not exclusively to be seen in that context. Australias recent involvement in the Gulf War shows that such a focus is too narrow. True it is that that was a United Nations commitment, but without the involvement of the United States that commitment would not have been made.Again, I find the assessment in the Strategic review of the growing role of economic factors in international relations rather shallow and insufficiently forward looking in the context of future economic trade and investment developments in the Asia-Pacific region. I do not dispute for a moment the importance, from a foreign policy perspective, of sound Asia-Pacific economic relationships—indeed, I am the strongest advocate on this side—and of the APEC forum as a potential foundation for improved regional security relationships. There is no doubt this will be a major contributing factor for improved regional security relationships over time, but I do question the governments complacent apparent belief that sound Asia-Pacific economic relations will necessarily and automatically provide for sound security relationships. In my view, the Strategic review gives excessive emphasis to economic issues as determinants of Australias future defence posture and at the expense of other current influences on Australias immediate strategic environment, such as the regional arms build-up.While confidence in the region post-Cold War will not and cannot be built overnight, attempts to do so must be given high priority foreign policy attention. For that reason I would like to return very briefly to the ASEAN regional forum and discuss its role in confidence building in the region. Although the ASEAN regional forum is an outgrowth of the annual series of dialogues carried out by ASEAN with its western partners, it is not strictly an ASEAN body. All members have equal status. Initially it was discussion by ASEAN with Western associates, partners and other countries, but it has expanded well beyond the so-called West of the past. The forum now includes the United States, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, as well as the European Union. It now includes China, Russia, Vietnam, Laos and Papua New Guinea. Papua New Guinea of course is an observer of ASEAN.Key questions remain to be resolved regarding what the ASEAN regional forum might realistically do and how cautious or ambitious it should seek to be, but, like the government, I would support a fairly ambitious and forward looking agenda for the forthcoming meeting in Bangkok. I would hope in particular that, even in its early stages, the forum would work towards cooperative region-wide approaches to preventive diplomacy. I would point out that the 1993 Strategic review calls for the first time for `strategic partnerships with the countries of South-East Asia, thereby supposedly going further than the governments earlier concept of `strategic engagement with the countries of ASEAN. On closer examination this concept seems to me to mean that, from now on, our South-East Asian partners will be required increasingly to meet their own costs in defence science and industry cooperation with Australia. While I support the governments aim to promote Australian defence industry cooperation with South-East Asia, I question the governments assumption that this approach will now make a major contribution to enhancing regional security.I also say a few words about the United Nations role in global peacekeeping and peace enforcement, and Australias contribution to the global effort. I welcome the development of United Nations issues being covered in the review but, while the review notes that the Australian government is expending some energy in seeking to improve the UNs capacity to respond to security problems, it barely takes this fact into account in setting out its guiding principles.The review, unfortunately, still shows no recognition on the part of the government of the need to take United Nations obligations into account in determining overall force readiness levels but not force structuring, and the focus given to United Nations issues is again strongly and excessively regional. I can understand why this is done, but the emphasis seems too strong and exclusive, if you like. The review does not mention the relevance of our alliance with the United States as a factor which may need to be taken into account in determining our participation in peace enforcement operations. I would emphasise the ongoing importance of this factor.In conclusion, I reiterate that, whilst I see the emerging regional security dialogue process as full of promise, offering the prospect of enhanced cooperation and understanding, there is still a very long way to go before the regional security environment will have benefited from this process to the point which would justify a fundamental reorientation of Australias defence outlook. Whilst this may eventually be the case, in the meantime Australia should in no way neglect its all-important bilateral defence alliances with our neighbours, and in particular with the United States, nor must our defence capabilities be allowed to erode while pursuing policies whose success may assist but cannot guarantee Australias national security.","N/A","MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
79,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Ms DEAHM","LV5","(Macquarie)","ALP","N/A",1794,"—It gives me great pleasure to contribute to the discussion on the Strategic review 1993 . This document is a forward looking one and provides an up-to-date blueprint of where Australia is going with regard to its defence forces. Whenever we look forward, I think it is also appropriate to reflect on where we have come from with regard to our defence forces. It is very easy at times to criticise the recent past while arguing about what we will do for the future. Taking a historic perspective often provides us with information about the lessons we have learned and enables us to take pride in our achievements.Australia has a unique history in terms of its military activity. Being a peace-loving country, we have never declared war on another nation and have only once been under real direct threat. Unlike many other nations, Australia has mostly contributed to the defence of other countries and come to the aid of its neighbours and allies. Even before Australia constitutionally became a nation, its colonies took part in various military engagements on behalf of the so-called mother country.Our first engagement was in the Sudan in 1885 when our forces lost nine men, with a further three wounded in action. A few years later, the six colonies of this continent sent over 16,000 troops to the Boer War in South Africa. There were 1,161 casualties in that particular war, which lasted from 1889 to 1902. In the meantime, over 550 troops were sent to the Boxer Rebellion in China in 1900. However, our great involvement and our greatest casualties were in the two world wars.Being a student of Australian history, I find it extremely difficult to read about the First World War in particular without feeling a great deal of anger and sorrow at the waste of human lives in this most awful of wars. The number of Australians who lost their lives during the First World War was 60,504, including huge numbers in single battles. Gallipoli is the battle of which we hear so much, but it was on the battlefields of France and Belgium that Australian troops were slaughtered in huge numbers. Those who did not die in battle often died from the effects of gas poisoning.The First World War was the first in which Australia fought as a nation. By the time the Second World War broke out, we had an established army, navy and air force and all three services contributed to this effort. A total of 39,429 Australian deaths were recorded as a result of this engagement. It was the last war which Australians would fight on European soil on behalf of Great Britain. The wars which have been fought in our own region, particularly in Korea, Malaysia and Vietnam, have claimed a further 900 lives. In total, 94,000 Australians have died in wars in which our troops have been involved. For a small nation, this is a huge loss and one which I sincerely hope will never be repeated.We should also not forget the casualties who came home from the war—those whose injuries were not physical and easily identified; those who suffered from the effects of gas poisoning, shell shock, and the stress that goes with seeing ones comrades dying in difficult circumstances. Those people left their families as fathers, brothers or sons, and came back to Australia as different people. Often they were unrecognisable by their families—except for their physical attributes. In many cases, the survivors of these encounters were given to bursts of anger and unpredictable behaviour. Of course, in those cases they were casualties of war—they suffered from stress. But, in those days we did not recognise such an injury as stress.With the birth of military forces in the various colonies which made up the federation after 1901, governments quickly set about bringing the colonial forces together under single Commonwealth units. On 1 March 1901, the Commonwealth naval force came into existence. On the same day, out of the armies of the various colonies, the Australian Army had its birth. The Royal Australian Air Force was formed in March 1921, thus completing the full strength of military services. Those who have been involved with the defence forces, or have had anything to do with their personnel, will know that there has always been a rivalry between the different branches of the defence forces. However, over recent years the levels of cooperation have, very obviously, been growing.As a result of the Tange report in November 1973, individual service departments were abolished and the position of Chief of the Defence Force was created. Whilst the three branches of the services maintained their separate identities, a single Chief of the Defence Force commanded the whole of the ADF. Since 1976, senior officers from all branches of the services have served in this position. There is no doubt that this unified military voice in defence decision-making has been a forward move for the coordination and management of Australias defence forces.This unifying of the services at home is in keeping with Australias role in multinational peacekeeping operations. As well as involving our forces in the wars of other countries in an active sense, as outlined previously, Australia has also been extremely active in this peacekeeping work. Since 1947 Australia has been involved in 25 peacekeeping operations on a multinational basis. In addition, our forces have been involved in United Nations commissions and investigative teams. Some of these operations are ongoing, and we will all be aware of the fine work undertaken by the ADF recently in Somalia and Cambodia.In reviewing the activities of Australias defence forces since before Federation, we see a picture of Australians as givers. We have contributed to other peoples war efforts and to the worlds peacekeeping operations. This is truly the sign of a lucky country where, in working to defend our own country, we have contributed—perhaps at times disproportionately—to the peacekeeping efforts of the world.In so doing, our alliances have changed from Europe to the US and Asia, and it is appropriate that the Strategic review 1993 focuses very strongly on our regional activities. Cooperation with our neighbours is surely the best way to keep the peace. It would be unrealistic to think that the world will ever be free of armed conflict, but with Australias activities in peacekeeping and the prevention of the proliferation of weapons, it has a mighty role to play, both at home and in the world context. Strategic and constructive partnerships with our neighbours within the Asia-Pacific area can only strengthen the peacekeeping effort.I have spoken before in this place about the role of the ADF, and in particular the activities of the personnel of RAAF base Richmond in my electorate, in community support. I think it appropriate to take this opportunity to again draw attention to the involvement of the ADF in the recent New South Wales bushfires. RAAF Richmond was on full alert at that time. Many personnel based at Richmond returned from their holidays to play an active part in firefighting, back-burning and creating fire breaks in the affected areas. The base also accommodated a large number of elderly people from local nursing homes who had to be evacuated due to either fire danger or smoke problems. I pay special tribute to the personnel of the RAAF base hospital who found themselves in such an unfamiliar medical engagement. The army and navy, working in tandem, also worked hard on the bushfire effort in my electorate. I am delighted that the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, and the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Senator John Faulkner, visited the RAAF base at Richmond recently to personally thank those who had worked in this civil operation.Australia has not only a fine record for military activity and peacekeeping work but also a fine reputation for looking after its war veterans. While I lived in the United Kingdom in the 1960s, I realised that ex-service people there, following the last world war, had nowhere near the provision of services that our ex-service people had.I have taken a particular interest in the rehabilitation of Vietnam veterans, many of whom are still suffering from the trauma of that awful war. Recently I was privileged to visit some of them who were undertaking a program for post-traumatic stress disorder at St John of God Hospital in my electorate. Many of these men had been in and out of hospital since the war, suffering from depression and other stress related ailments. I was delighted to hear of the progress being made through this program, and I sincerely hope that more Vietnam veterans will be able to benefit from this kind of therapy.In conclusion, I commend the Strategic review , which I think will receive wide acceptance and approval throughout the Australian community. Its strategy of framing the defence of Australia, increasing regional involvement, and the continued US alliance, along with an expanded role in global security, aptly sums up the appropriate program for defence in the 1990s.","N/A","MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
80,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr TAYLOR","OJ4","(Groom)","LP","N/A",1796,"—The preface to this 75-page document states:Strategic Review 1993 is part of a continuous cycle of defence planning, but it comes at a particularly important time. It begins the process of adapting our strategic and defence policies to the new challenges of the still emerging post-Cold War world. It has a time-frame of 3-5 years. Work is now underway on a White Paper that will consider the longer-term outlook into the next century. The Government plans to publish the White Paper in 1994.In that context, I would like to repeat in part what I said two years ago in this place in response to the governments May 1991 force structure review:The Executive Director of the Australian Defence Association, Michael OConnor, hit the nail on the head at that time in his description of the review, which he saw as a mixture of ordinary housekeeping, a shopping list based on nothing more than good intentions and a manpower restructuring based on vague hope.I went on to say:. . . the strategy that underpins the 1987 Defence White Paper and its defence policy is questionable . . . Even in regional terms, our operational capabilities—have—. . . serious limitations.The Government has done nothing to redress these since other than to persist with the line that the White Paper remains a valid cornerstone of its national security policy. In particular, our commitment to the Gulf war started to focus public attention on some of the real limitations of our defence capabilities. In some quarters—this is a view I share—there has been a basic question mark as to whether the 1987 White Paper was written so that it meant all things to all people. The result is an uneasy compromise between competing strategic and financial views. However, I would suggest that the White Paper now poses bigger problems for this Government. Although the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) will not bring themselves to admit it, many of the underlying strategic assumptions have been overtaken. More significantly, it has locked the Government into a multi-billion dollar capital equipment purchasing program despite its failure to live up to the Budget allocations which the White Paper identified.I went on to say:The consequences are that other areas of defence spending, particularly manpower and operating costs, have to be squeezed to pay for the equipment.. . . . . . . . .The Minister for Defence and the Minister for Foreign Affairs should accept that they need an early reassessment of national security strategy. Senator Rays tablet of stone approach to the 1987 White Paper no longer holds water, as the increasing volatility of the international arena shows. The force structure review of last year—1991—is therefore poorly based and is a substantial figment of the Governments unfunded imagination.What the review lacks but requires for its own creditability is a number of things: it needs a clear assessment of the strategic realities facing Australia; it needs an analysis of the implications of these realities for Australias national security situation; and, finally, it needs an outline of the restructuring of the Defence Force that flows from that changing strategic and security outlook.Albeit two years later, Strategic review 1993 is therefore a good starting point for a more realistic force structure review in the context of an updated white paper late this year or possibly, more realistically, early next year, but with question marks persisting about the possible degradation of existing alliances like the ANZUS alliance referred to earlier by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock). That said, it has and deserves a lot of support from this side of the House. As Carol Reed said in Janes Defence Weekly in December last year:Australia is at a crossroads in its geopolitical, economic, cultural and historic interests. As traditional links with Europe and the UK slip into the past, and while the defence relationship with the USA remains firm, Australia is seeking to involve itself more heavily with South-east Asia, economically and militarily.In moving to align Australia with its neighbours on both economic and strategic fronts, Canberra is effecting a major realignment of national priorities.She went on to say:Two long-term trends have prompted this response. The first is the end of the Super Power confrontation as a result of the end of the Cold War.The decline of Soviet influence in the Pacific has already brought changes in how the USA projects its influence in the region. As this happens, and as the USA/Japan relationship evolves, Japan and China are expected to expand their influence and security role in the area. The Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) is responding to this by taking on a larger role in security affairs. In this context, Australia is evolving its security interests to participate in the security affairs of and in Asia.The second long-term trend is economic growth in the Asia-Pacific. As this accelerates, the strategic potential of the countries in the area will increase. The combination of population growth and expansion of technological and industrial capabilities will change the nature of the regions strategic environment dramatically. By the 21st century, these trends will have persisted and produced an environment significantly different from todays.It is therefore not surprising that the Vice Chief of the Defence Force, Lieutenant-General John Baker, said at the time:Our practice has been to undertake the strategic review every four years, but only write a white paper where there is a fundamental redefinition of defence policy.He went on to outline the five key tenets of the Strategic review in order of priority as follows:. The defence of Australia;. Emphasis on collaboration with regional neighbours. A shift from a position of defence co-operation to a new position of strategic partnership with South-east Asia;. Continuing alliance relationship with the USA and with New Zealand;. Continuing commitment to global security by contributing to the United Nations peacekeeping operations and participating in arms control and non-proliferation initiatives;. Closer integration of defence and other national policies, notably foreign policy and defence industry policy. Here, national resources such as local defence industry—mentioned by the honourable member for Kooyong—and military support services will be harnessed in the total defence effort.The 1994 Defence White Paper will incorporate these and address their impact on Australias force structure and the Department of Defence priorities. Significantly, this policy initially is being carried out in an environment in which there is no specific threat.He said:We are now talking about security with the region, as distinct from a threat-based perception.He was further quoted as saying:But to engage fully in the region we need to do that from a position of confidence. Hence the emphasis is still on convincing and demonstrating to the Australian people that we have the technical capability to defend Australia should the unexpected happen.. . . . . . . . .We are under severe budgetary pressure, so we need to continue on the path we have set ourselves of finding efficiencies within the Defence Department—to divert resources from the support area to the combat and sharp end of the defence force to preserve our overall capability.The article finishes by quoting General Baker as saying:. . . one of the issues we are facing is the declining defence budget at a time when we are trying to preserve our investment programme; at a time when our level of activities are increasing to represent our closer relationship and working with the region; and at a time when we are going through a fairly severe cultural challenge in the ADF which requires that we also increase our emphasis on personnel development and training to retain and develop the high skills that we require in the defence force,. . .So we have an increasing problem of maintaining the level of resources and ensuring that we get the most cost-effective outcome from those resources. Its an interesting problem. The quicker your economy grows; the easier it is.The Strategic review 1993 is not without its critics. In another article, the Australian Defence Association is quoted as saying that the review:. . . is a collection of the same tired old cliches and logical non-sequiturs that have characterised the national approach to defence for far too long.The article goes on to say:The problem is that SR93 makes no commitment to adequate forces and, indeed, implies that there will be no significant change to capability or resources for defence.Alan Wrigley, the defence correspondent in the Australian , wrote:The review simply slides past issues that have not been resolved in years of bickering and which, because of their central importance in the development of the force structure, have left the defence organisation doggedly locked into an increasingly irrelevant course.He further stated:But there is one flash of light. The minister has at last acknowledged what was abundantly evident at the end of the 1980s—that the Cold Wars end would bring great changes to Australias strategic environment. As late as September 1992, Ray insisted that while there had been historic global changes over the past few years, those events had only a limited effect on (Australias) national security. Those who doubted him then will be interested to read, in the new review,—the Strategic review 1993 —that the changing nature of the US strategic policy after the Cold War is a key issue, both for global security and for the future stability of Australias region.I will finish my remarks by referring to six key issues. The first issue relates to the public apathy to defence. It is pretty clear in this nation that there is deep apathy on defence until we start to get into trouble. That is something that this place, this parliament and other people will have to overcome. The second issue relates to funding levels. I was pleased that my colleague the shadow minister for defence, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), made this point as he finished his contribution to this debate:The funding of it is a critical issue. It is one which is very high on my list of priorities as the incoming shadow minister for defence. If there is one message out of my remarks for those interested in defence issues, it is that I will be campaigning strongly to ensure, both in coalition and government policy, that the necessary expenditure for our proper defence of this country is made available by the political process.The third issue relates to professionalism. The professional standards of the Australian Defence Force have always been high. I take this opportunity to pay particular tribute to my close friend, the recently departed Chief of Naval Staff, Vice-Admiral Ian MacDougall, and to wish him well in his retirement. I also wish equally good luck to my brother who has taken over the reins as the Chief of Naval Staff. It will not be easy but I am sure that my brother will relish the challenge and will do what he has always done in the past: contribute very fully in the defence area.The fourth point relates to peacekeeping. Whilst peacekeeping is important and is mentioned in the Strategic review , it must not become a force structure determinant. Peacekeeping is an element of the Defence Force that we need to preserve but, in my view, it must not become a force structure determinant. That will be debated in the context of the defence white paper later this year or early next year.The second last point relates to the maintenance of technology within the Defence Force. We have a lot of high technology activities that should be maintained. It is good both for our power projection and the balance of power that we keep ahead in our region.Finally, and very importantly in defence, we need to talk about transparency. We need to make no apology for our strategic capability whether it be in terms of the F111 force or, indeed, the submarine force. We are only as strong as the public perception of our power projection.I reiterate what the honourable member for Kooyong said: we must make sure that, as a result of this Strategic review , the defence white paper 1994-95 provides a much better balance to the Defence Force than we have at the moment.Debate (on motion by Mr Cleeland ) adjourned.","N/A","MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Among other things, the bill provided that employers who had a training guarantee shortfall or excess could set that off against an excess or shortfall in the next year. This was not to apply to companies which had elected to group because of complexities relating to the ownership of excesses or shortfalls when groups broke up in the next year or companies joined groups in the next year.The amendments made by the Senate extended the one extra year to two for shortfalls only. They prevented employers from electing to carry forward a shortfall in the fourth year, and they extended the provision to groups but without addressing the ownership problems. A third provision—to abolish the training guarantee—was defeated in the Senate. Although an extension of the carry forward period for the excesses does not appear in the list of the Senate amendments, it is clear that these amendments moved by Senator Teague were intended to extend the carry forward period for both excess and shortfall for two years.The Senate amendments do not effectively address the issues arising from the extension of carry forward and grouping and, during the committee stages, my colleague Senator McMullan made it clear that the amendments would not work. He indicated that the government would be proposing amendments to the bill which would put Senator Teagues intentions into effect. Therefore, it is proposed that the Senates amendments be disagreed to and replaced by the amendments I have put before the House. These amendments give practical expression to the principles of the Senates amendments.The proposed House of Representatives amendments extend the carry forward period for both shortfalls and excesses to two extra years. They expand the rules governing the effect of an election, the application of excess and the provision of statements to overcome the deficiencies of the Senate amendments to cover all the situations which may arise.Further provisions have been drafted to allow groups access to the carry forward provisions. The rules covering these provisions prescribe the ownership of excesses and shortfalls so that employers who join or leave groups take their shortfalls or excesses with them. The carry forward provisions would then be applied year by year just as for individual employers.I turn now to the proposed House of Representatives amendments. The amendments propose to amend the Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill in a number of areas, the first of which is the carry forward provisions. The carry forward provisions provide for training guarantee excesses arising in a year to be set off against any shortfalls postponed in the previous two years. The excesses are to be applied first to the earliest arising shortfall. The employers may then carry any residual excess forward for the next two years. During those next two years, the excess may be used to offset shortfalls which arise.The provisions also allow employers who have made training guarantee shortfalls in a year to elect to postpone payment of those shortfalls for the next two years. Any excesses arising in those next two years will be set off against the shortfall first arising. Any residual shortfall existing at 30 September in the year following the second of the two years after the relevant election to postpone will then become due and payable as if the election had not been made. Late payment penalties will then become payable at the rate of 20 per cent per annum calculated from 30 September in the year following the year in which the shortfall first arose; that is, the time at which the relevant election to postpone was made.I turn now to the grouping provisions. The amendments to the grouping provisions set out the rules for ownership of excesses and responsibility for shortfalls made by a group. These rules are necessary for the application of the carry forward provisions but will not affect the current position for groups unless members leave or new members join. The carry forward provisions apply in the same way as they do for any individual employer. Simply stated, the rules provide that, when an excess or shortfall is made by a group, the excess or shortfall owned by each of the members will be determined by apportioning the excess or shortfall to each company on the basis of its annual national payroll. If a company leaves a group it will simply take that portion with it. An excess or shortfall belonging to a company which is part of a group which elects to group in a year will be aggregated with the excesses or shortfalls of the rest of the group.To achieve the above, a number of amendments are made. Clause 3 is amended to include a new definition of `training guarantee shortfall which takes account of the changes and to define an `employer group as two or more entities which are treated as a single employer as a consequence of their making an election to group.Clause 6 is amended by deleting paragraph (d) which made grouping and carry forward mutually exclusive. Clause 7 is amended by adding a further section 14A(2), which provides for the apportionment of a groups training guarantee excess between its members on the basis of their separate annual national payrolls.The new sections inserted by clause 8 of the original amendment bill are replaced by a number of new sections. New section 15A allows employers who have made a training guarantee excess to carry it over for two extra years and to set it off against shortfalls which may arise in those two extra years. It should be noted that grouped employers individually carry forward their proportion of the groups excess.New section 15A(1), in conjunction with sections 15A(3) and 15A(4), applies where an employer has an excess in year one and a shortfall in year two. New section 15A(2), in conjunction with sections 15A(3) and 15A(4), applies where an employer has an excess in year one and a shortfall in year three. New section 15B allows an employer to make an election to postpone a training guarantee shortfall.The deletion of subsection (4) eliminates the limitation on postponing a shortfall two years in a row. New section 15BA allocates a group shortfall to the members of the group in proportion to each of their annual national payrolls. Section 15BA(3) deems each member of the group to have elected to postpone the shortfall. New section 15C prescribes how a shortfall postponed under section 15B will be set off against excesses in the following two years or paid in the third year. Subsection (1) allows the non-payment of a shortfall in a year in which an election is postponed and in the next year and that in the third year it will be paid in accordance with subsections (3), (4), (5) and (6). It should be noted that grouped employers individually carry forward their shortfall.Section 15C(2) provides that, where an excess in the second year is greater than the postponed shortfall, the excess will be reduced by the amount of the shortfall and the shortfall reduced to nil. Section 15C(3) provides that, where an excess in the second year is less than the postponed shortfall, the shortfall will be reduced by the excess and the balance carried over to the third year. If there is an excess in the third year, subsections (5) and (6) apply. But, if there is no excess in the third year—that is, there is a shortfall or the employer just satisfies the training guarantee obligation—the residue of the shortfall becomes due and payable.Section 15C(4) provides that, where there is no excess in the second year—that is, there is a shortfall or the employer just satisfies the training guarantee obligation—and there is then an excess in the third year, subsections (5) and (6) apply. But, if the employer does not have an excess in the third year, the residue of the shortfall becomes due and payable. Section 15C(5) provides that, if the excess in the third year is equal to or greater than the residual shortfall carried forward from the second year, the residual shortfall is reduced to nil. Section 15C(6) provides that, if the excess in the third year is less than the residual shortfall carried over from the second year, a training guarantee charge equal to the remaining shortfall amount is payable.Section 15C(7) provides that any residual shortfall at the end of the two extra years becomes due and payable as if the election had not been made. This section makes employers liable to penalties calculated from the original due date on that part of the shortfall that is not eliminated by training guarantee excesses in year two or year three. This prevents employers from gaining an advantage by postponing a shortfall with no intention of making it up.Section 15C(8) provides that employers who have a shortfall in one year but are exempt in the next have an excess in the second year equal to their net eligible training expenditure. Section 15C(9) has the effect that an employer who makes a shortfall in any year has to lodge a training guarantee statement.New clause 14A amends section 40 in the principal act to require the lodgment of training guarantee statements whenever a shortfall arises. Clause 15 is amended to increase the details required on training guarantee statements by section 42 in the principal act to include a shortfall made in any year and any excess from either of the two previous years set off against a shortfall in the current year. Clause 16 is amended to further increase the details required by section 42A on further guarantee statements about postponed shortfall to include excesses in the second or third years which are set off against a shortfall in the first year.Finally, clause 18 is amended to include in the details an employer is required to keep, by section 84(2) in the principal act, the amount of a training guarantee shortfall and the amount of any excess, whether arising from either of the two years before the postponed shortfall or in the next two years, which is set off against a shortfall. I commend the amendments to the House, and I table the supplementary explanatory memorandum.","N/A","TRAINING GUARANTEE (ADMINISTRATION) AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
93,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr ANDREWS","HK5","(Menzies)","LP","N/A",1805,"—I indicate at the outset that the opposition will be following the course which has been outlined by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free), who is at the table; namely, that the amendments which were moved in the Senate be disagreed to and replaced with amendments which have been put before the House today by the minister. We accept that, in this regard, the government has accepted the principles which underlie the amendments which were made in the Senate. The government has looked at the original amendments with the resources that it has, and the opposition has not, and improved them.These amendments are important because they add two crucial elements to the training guarantee system, if it is to continue to exist, in fact two crucial elements to the whole training reform agenda, as it has been described by this government. Those elements are that we have a real sense of flexibility in the system so that it is responsive to the various demands on training in this country and, as part and parcel of that, that we have responsiveness to industry so that the training being provided for Australians will lead to real jobs at the end of those training proposals.The training guarantee legislation was introduced in 1990. It places a levy of 1.5 per cent on companies with an annual national payroll of $220,000 or more. In other words, if the companies do not spend that amount of money on training for their employees and staff, then a levy is payable into the consolidated funds of the government. That is the principle behind the scheme.I will not go into the reasons why the coalition believes the scheme ought to be totally abolished, as they were advanced in the second reading debate. In summary, those reasons are that there is a high administrative burden placed on the scheme. In many cases, companies in Australia were spending 10 per cent or more of their payroll on training, whereas this new measure will introduce a lower benchmark for training in Australia. Another reason, which relates to the sheer weight of businesses in this country, is that some 93 per cent of businesses are small businesses which are not covered by the legislation.When the matter was previously before the House, we moved amendments seeking the abolition of the scheme. Unfortunately, those amendments were not adopted by the other parties in the Senate and, therefore, we are left with these amendments which add more flexibility to a scheme which we still believe ought to be abolished entirely. We do not believe that there should not be training in this country. Quite clearly, training is an important component of the future wellbeing not only of the nation of Australia but also the individuals concerned, whether they are young people or middle aged people, who find themselves working in industries in which the nature of the work has changed. Therefore, these people need to renew their training, skills and knowledge in order to maintain their employment.We are told that by the year 2000 a great proportion of people in the current work force will not be working in the same jobs as they are at present. Ordinary Australian workers could be changing the very nature of their jobs as many as four or five times during their working lives. Quite clearly, training is required, but what is coming from business and industry is a clear call that we need a flexible system which is responsive to industry—not a system like this one, which is simply imposed in a bureaucratic manner.It is for those reasons that the coalition in the Senate moved amendments which are now being replaced by amendments which have been redrafted by the government in order to add further flexibility to the system. As the minister outlined, if a company has a requirement under the training guarantee levy to provide training but does not do so, it must pay the levy. But these amendments will allow that company to have the ability to average its training over a number of years. The original amendment bill sought to allow some averaging but quite clearly, on the advice of business and industry itself, that averaging should have gone further. That is the effect of the amendments before the House at the present time.The other set of amendments relates to companies that operate as a group, the purport of which is to allow those companies in a group to also have access to the averaging provisions in the legislation. This is legislation which, in terms of the amendments, fulfils the principles that I set out at the beginning of my remarks, and which should motivate any scheme of training in Australia to be flexible and responsive to industry.As we believe that this is a second-best option for the training guarantee levy and have previously moved amendments aimed at abolishing the scheme, it was amusing to hear Senator Bell, on behalf of the Democrats, say in the Senate when this matter was being debated:I was indicating that the Australian Democrats were not entertained by Senator Teagues temptations and that, in fact, we would be looking for the completion of the Department of Employment, Education and Training review and from that we would hope to see a scheme vastly changed from that which we now have.Senator Bell was referring to Senator Teagues comments about including a sunset clause in the legislation, such as we had moved in this chamber, and to the fact that the Democrats rejected such an inclusion. Lo and behold, two days ago the Democrats came out and said, `No, we think that we ought to suspend the training guarantee levy for a period of three years. Over a week ago the Democrats had the opportunity in the Senate to actually do something—to act rather than just speak as they usually do. Yet Senator Bell quite clearly said on behalf of the Democrats, `No. Were not bothered with that. Were just going to wait for the review. We wont take this opportunity to put a sunset clause in the legislation.As the minister would know, the effect of a sunset clause is that the legislation can be suspended. Once a sunset clause is in place it is open to the government to come along in a months time and say, `Right. The sunset clause is there until this legislation finishes on 30 June. But, for the reasons advanced, we want to extend that sunset clause for another year. One of the effects of a sunset clause can be to suspend the operation of the act. Just over a week ago the Democrats were saying, `No, we dont want to do that. We will wait for a review to take place; yet two days ago they were running up another flag for the Australian people to watch flutter for a while before they pulled it down, saying that we should suspend for three years the operation of the training guarantee levy.Unfortunately, that is typical of the way the Democrats behave in relation to these matters. They say—I suspect the minister will agree with these comments, although maybe from a different point of view—`Well, heres an issue. We may get some coverage of this. This sounds like a good idea. People will say hooray for the Democrats; then they pull the flag down again, having let it flutter in the breeze for a little while, and are on to another issue. That is the approach to government that the Australian Democrats seem to employ, particularly in relation to educational matters—and if I went into that in more detail I would be even further from the topic of this amendment than I am at the present time. I shall resist that temptation before you direct me to resist it, Mr Deputy Speaker.In summary and in conclusion, we will be supporting the amendments as they have been moved by the minister. They are an improvement on the amendments that were drafted on behalf of the opposition in the Senate. Therefore, we are quite willing—we are delighted in fact—to accede to the invitation to replace one set of amendments with another set because, in effect, they are based on the same principles of further flexibility and responsiveness to industry in relation to training in Australia.","N/A","TRAINING GUARANTEE (ADMINISTRATION) AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

96,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr CHARLES","OT4","(La Trobe)","LP","N/A",1806,"—I followed it all right. I followed it well. While I was listening to the ministers speech, the bureaucratic procedures involved here brought to mind the nature of this legislation. In the past week in the newspapers we have seen information about the diabolical trouble that the French are in, in terms of training their young people and getting their young people into employment. I remind the minister that this legislation was a direct steal from France—by way of Australia Reconstructed, an ACTU document. That is how this legislation, the amendments to which we are now dealing with, was supposed to address Australias shortfall in training.I am not aware of any evidence anywhere from any industry group in Australia that this legislation has contributed to advancement of the training agenda in our country. There is some evidence that this legislation has made some companies more aware—with small businesses certainly not being required to participate—but it has not necessarily lifted their game in that regard.The real fact of the matter is that we are currently faced with a falling number of apprenticeships. We need to deal with the whole macro-issue of the training agenda—not only how we go about imparting the skills to new entrants or intending entrants into the work force but how we reskill those in industry, in the work force, in jobs, to cope with new technology, changes in operation, improvements in productivity, and lateral flexibility. `Lateral is a good word; we need to do a bit more lateral thinking in here. How we cope with all that will not be enhanced by a centralised bureaucratic procedure called the training guarantee levy.We are very pleased—and I certainly am pleased—to see that we are adding a bit of flexibility to the act in order to allow employers to carry forward and average over at least three years their expenditure on training. That will take some of the hills and the valleys out of the equation. Nonetheless, at the same time those employers still have to spend the huge amount of money they are faced with in terms of accounting procedures to account for the expense of training.I have made the point before, and I will make it again, that accounting procedures to deal with the profit and loss of a company do not set up natural cost centres that will deal with training in a discrete sense. They never have and they never will. So it is an artificial accounting requirement that we put on companies in order to deal with the training guarantee. At the same time that we impose those costs on them, we ask them—at least the government is asking them—to spend more on new capital investment and to do something about employment to create jobs.This amendment will help a few companies average their expenditure under the Training Guarantee Act for bureaucratic purposes, but the chances are that the majority of those companies would have spent or will spend the money required on training in any event, notwithstanding this act. So the whole exercise means that we are spending more money in industry on bureaucratic procedures. In fact, this is costing the country jobs.The amendments that we have previously put up in this place were really to dump the act. I suspect that, following debates in this place, the minister had it in mind, when the budget is presented, to accept the suggestion that Bill Kelty made in the regional development report that the act be put in suspension for three years. I suspect that the minister had it in mind to accept that. That would be the easy way to let it down without having to agree that the opposition was right that we should dump the act altogether and get rid of the Training Guarantee Act. That would have been the political way for Labor to get out of this problem.Unfortunately, in the last few days the Australian Democrats have entered the equation. Now the Democrats have ridden into the Senate and said, `Hey, hey, hey, we think it should be suspended for three years. So the Democrats have agreed with Kelty. That is fine, but that makes it a bit more difficult politically for the minister, because if he now suspends the act during the budget session of this parliament—which means that we will have wasted all our time in here discussing these amendments—","N/A","TRAINING GUARANTEE (ADMINISTRATION) AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

98,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr CHARLES","OT4","(La Trobe)","LP","N/A",1806,"—I said `if. If he suspends the act then the Democrats will make the charge and Mrs Kernot will go on national television and say, `We convinced the government that this was an iniquitous act and should be suspended; and Australians should all come and thank the Democrats because we fixed up the country once again. Now the minister is in a spot. I am convinced that he would love to be rid of the training guarantee legislation. Honest to goodness, how many pages worth of excess and shortfall did we just go through? That is only the proverbial tip of the iceberg. This legislation requires so much bureaucratic procedure from industry that it is wasted time and effort that could instead be used on useful training, and doing something about our real shortfall in training in Australia.I ask the minister to think about what he is going to do about apprenticeships and how we are going to solve that problem because in the next few years we are going to have a shortfall, if our growth corresponds with the Treasurers predictions. The rules and regulations that companies go through are all part of restrictions on companies profitable operations that might be devoted to more productive activity.This is one micro-economic reform that would serve the nation well. These amendments make it easier for companies but do not relieve them of any of the accounting procedure requirements to which they must adhere in order to pass muster under the act. So the overall effect, as far as this side of the House is concerned, is that the act is not a positive. France has found that it is not a positive. France is in diabolical trouble now, trying to introduce a training wage to its young student population, because its training guarantee act has not produced any positive results either, notwithstanding that its training culture is different and more advanced than ours.Our discussion on this issue of vocational training is really only very new. It is something that I certainly have been talking about in this House since 1990, and I will continue to talk about it. I do not believe that this legislation enhances training. While the governments amendments do enhance it and make it a bit less onerous, the act itself does not encourage training nor does it give us national benefit, which should come from telling industry what to do.","N/A","TRAINING GUARANTEE (ADMINISTRATION) AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"
99,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr FREE","HG4","(Lindsay-","ALP","Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training)",1808,"—In closing the debate, I thank the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) and the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) for their comments, and I thank the opposition for its indication that it will be supporting the government amendments.In one sense, the opposition has never really changed its position on the training guarantee. I do not quite know what version of the cracked record we heard from the honourable member for La Trobe when he was talking about the importance of abolishing the guarantee. I congratulate him at least for his consistency in this matter. Throughout that kind of discussion the opposition has never ceased to use the results of small sample surveys to an extent which the authors of those surveys would never have intended the results to mean. Of course, neither has it acknowledged the review process which the government flagged back in 1990, and which the government has in place.I also should congratulate the opposition on recognising the importance of training. It is not all that long ago that the honourable member for Menzies, as opposition spokesman on this matter, made a speech in which he rejected the governments training reform agenda as being narrowly instrumentalist. He argued instead from the position that we would never get job growth, that the projects for young people in particular were hopeless, and that really the best we could do was to look at educating people for `rational leisure. I congratulate the honourable member for Menzies on his ability to move his position over six months and to now be in a position to agree with the government that training is important in a macro sense. It is important because it contributes to our competitive position; it is important for individual firms.I am glad that we have now what appears to be the beginning of a bipartisan position on training. I am pleased also that we have been able to reach bipartisan agreement on these amendments and that we are able to combine, as government and opposition, to fix up the Senate amendments and assist the Senate to actually say what it meant to say.Question resolved in the affirmative.","N/A","TRAINING GUARANTEE (ADMINISTRATION) AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

101,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr CLEELAND","KF4","(McEwen)","ALP","N/A",1809,"—There is no question at all that every member of this House has a view one way or the other of Australias strategic needs and the defence force relationship with foreign affairs. Indeed I do not suppose there are more hours spent in debate than on the areas of foreign policy, Australias role in the world, and the relationship of that role to Australias defence requirements. There is also no doubt at all that there are fundamental changes occurring throughout the world in terms of Australias historic links with western forces. That fact cannot be better illustrated than by an examination of the current role of NATO itself.I was fortunate to visit NATO last September with other parliamentarians from this House and to be briefed by both the North Atlantic Council and the organisation itself on where they saw the role of NATO and European defence going vis-a-vis the rest of the world. Quite frankly NATO and the powers that form its basis have no idea where they are going because the fundamental change that has occurred in eastern Europe, and indeed in Europe generally—we only have to see what is happening in the Balkans at the moment—is such that the very fundamental role of NATO has gone.NATO was formed and did exist—indeed it still does exist theoretically—to form a defence pact between the western powers as against the Soviet bloc countries. The wall has come down, the need for NATO has fundamentally gone, and yet we have this very bureaucratic political-style organisation in Europe which is now seeking to find a reason for its own existence. In terms of many of these debates it is a great pity that we do not learn from what is occurring elsewhere in the world in defence matters. It is not just NATO; the United States is also fundamentally reviewing its role in terms of international defence and the role of the United States in terms of its international policing role, which has attained so much since the Second World War.The US Navy has left the Philippines—has left Subic Bay—and retreated eastward. The US Air Force no longer has major air defence capacity in South-East Asia. Increasingly, there is a view among United States politicians whom I have spoken to that the US should go further eastward and leave the role of defence in South-East Asia and the Pacific to countries such as Australia, New Zealand and the ASEAN group. We can have many views about the changing role of defence and what Australia should be doing in planning for its long-term defence. Fundamentally, it seems to me that there is no simple answer because the fluidity of geopolitics today is such that what is right for today will be wrong for tomorrow. The worlds allegiances and economic realities are changing faster than is possible for most countries to plan adequately for what is going to occur tomorrow.I listened with interest to the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) and other members of the opposition in this debate. The honourable member for Kooyong firstly said that the opposition generally supports the thrust of the white paper and the thrust of the governments approach to the strategic needs of Australia post-1993. Yet all opposition spokespersons have, in one way or another, disagreed with many of the fundamentals contained in the white paper.For example, I was somewhat surprised to hear the honourable member for Kooyong suggest that economic allegiances have no relativity to strategic allegiances. I find that a very strange statement to make because the history of international relationships is fundamentally involved in economic relationships. There was no necessity for prewar Great Britain to look at Australia as an area in which its defence relationships were involved unless there was a need for Britain to do so. It is obvious that in that period we as a country were a major supplier of rural resources to Great Britain, which it needed to maintain its economic growth and defence capacity. It is very obvious in historical terms that fundamental allegiances are economically based.It has been suggested that the interests of the United States in Australia or in this region are other than fundamentally economically based or other than to maintain, in the immediate postwar period, a forward defence base for itself far from its own shores. I would like anyone to argue that the United States interest in defence in this region is not, first and foremost, self-interest and economically based. I find the statements by the honourable gentleman somewhat bemusing. They are not, in my view, part of the reality of international relationships and of strategic demands of Australia.There are some matters which interest me personally. Those interests arise from the fact that the base of Puckapunyal, which is the home of the armed corp, is within my federal boundaries.","N/A","MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

103,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr CLEELAND","KF4","(McEwen)","ALP","N/A",1809,"—It was very gentle, if at all. Puckapunyal does interest me because it is the home of the armed corp. In more recent years the fundamental planning of Australian defence has meant that we are upgrading, at considerable capital cost, the navy and the air force. The honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) will no doubt be very happy to see that the new F111s and FA18s are going into the air force. He will no doubt be happy with the avionics upgrading of the F111s and the role they can play in the defence of Australia. I am sure that the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) with his navy background would be more than pleased with the new Collins class submarines and with the program for the Anzac frigate, which again give Australia this forward capacity of defence.I am sure all of us are very happy with the role of the new over the horizon radar systems being built in the north of Australia. However, with the armys interest at heart, in many ways the army is suffering as a result of the present capital outlays. Armour is a very necessary part of infantry capacity. Infantry without armour is like a navy ship without weaponry. The armour is both mobile artillery and a rapid-fire capacity to support infantry. Our M113s—the old Vietnam War armoured personnel carriers—are now very old. Our Leopard tanks—we have approximately 100—are now 20 years old and are no longer state-of-the-art armour. Mind you, in many ways, we have upgraded the weaponry and the electronic capacity of the Leopards to fulfil a more modern role; nevertheless, they are running out of their useful life. In my view, the army needs up-to-date armour and up-to-date armoured transport carriers.We currently have a program of purchasing more updated armoured carriers from Canada. When I was at Puckapunyal the other week I noticed an armoured vehicle which is surplus to US marine requirements was being trialled. That may well be a capacity which we can utilise. Let us face it, the world has a surplus of modern weaponry. I am also led to believe that the German forces have surplus Leopard tanks of the latest variety which are currently on the market at some $500,000 a tank. Considering we bought the Leopards 20 years ago at $1.2 million, I believe we have to look very carefully at whether, in the current budget requirements, we can acquire the updated Leopard tank version at a cost of some $500,000 a tank.I point out to the House that the modern armoured vehicles are primarily built to withstand missile attack. The new armour available in the world is a sandwich armour—a sandwich of armour, ceramic and armour, which gives much greater protection to those people inside the vehicles from either HESH shells or depleted uranium type ammunition. Our tanks have not currently got that capacity. They are capable of being penetrated by depleted uranium shells and also by HESH shells. I am concerned that the army is not getting the type of armoured equipment it needs to maintain its forward role and approach to modern weaponry.Having said that, there is no doubt that the governments approach to the Strategic review is the right approach. My own view has always been that Australias role in defence lies in our own region. We need to create better relationships with countries adjoining our own area. We also need to assist those countries to work cooperatively with our defence forces, which we are now doing. I think that is fundamental. The honourable member for Casey might agree that it is a pity we have not upgraded Butterworth—I suspect he might have spent some time there—and that we no longer have that forward capacity in Malaysia. That is a personal view. I do not profess necessarily to be a defence expert, although I think all of us in this place probably are defence experts in one way or another. I also take the view that Australia has a major role to play in peacekeeping forces throughout the world.As a nation, we should be very proud that, largely through Australian initiatives, Cambodia is now a more peaceful country. As a government and as a parliament, we should be very proud of the role that Australian Defence Force personnel have played throughout the world, be it in the Suez area, Cambodia, the Middle East or wherever they may have been, in maintaining peace and in working towards a solution to armed conflict.I am very supportive of the general thrust of the white paper. I point out to those members of the opposition who speak on this matter that they sometimes speak with hollow voices. I shall not forget that Fightback proposed a cut of $400 million from Defence Force spending—only a paltry $400 million—yet I consistently hear suggestions by members of the opposition that the government is not spending enough on defence. If they honestly believe that, they should have disagreed with Fightback, they should have told their party that Fightback was wrong, yet they did not. They stood in the last election on the policies of Fightback, on a policy which would have cut $400 million from Defence Force spending in this years budget.I think members of the opposition have to come to grips with the fact that it is a tight budgetary time for all of us and that the government is maintaining a reasonable approach to Defence Force spending. I could argue for more, as I said in relation to the Leopards. Overall, I believe that most Australians find the reviews general thrust satisfactory and it certainly has my full support.","N/A","MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
104,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr HALVERSON","3H4","(Casey)","LP","N/A",1811,"—Although a relatively short document, the expurgated version of the governments recently released Strategic review 1993 makes interesting reading. Bearing in mind that the review will provide the basis of the white paper to be released later this year, the information and analysis it contains will have a critical influence on our future defence planning. Many of the major issues canvassed in the review have already been discussed in this debate. There have been several areas of consensus, although there are other significant items which are a cause of some concern to those on this side of the House.I intend to concentrate my remarks today on two matters which I believe are particularly important in the context of Australias national security and, therefore, this debate on the 1993 Strategic review . The underlying message in this important document can be summed up by paraphrasing the title of a well-known Beatles song: well get by with a little help from our friends. The minister puts it in slightly different terms in the preface to the review. He states:The defence of Australia will remain at the heart of Australias defence policy. As will be clear from this Review, there is an integral link between the defence of Australia, and our increasing defence engagement with regional nations, the maintenance of our alliance relationships and our commitment to ensuring international peace and security.This is a somewhat conventional line. We must be ready to defend ourselves, but if future difficulties arise we will be looking to assistance from others. The interesting thing is that over the years the list of `others is changing and developing. No longer do we rely totally on our traditional American and European allies, although they are still a significant factor in the overall defence picture. The implications of the considerable international political and economic changes which have taken place since the 1989 review are acknowledged in the introduction to SR93, which states:The prolonged economic downturn in industrialised countries and its consequences for Australia affect the financial assumptions on which defence force structure and forward planning are based.The ADF is undergoing a major structural and cultural change. More broadly, with the end of the Cold War, there is a process of fundamental change under way in the global strategic balance, the effects of which are already evident in the Asia-Pacific region.With the recognition that our place in the world is more immediately and appropriately within the Asia-Pacific region comes the realisation that in future friends on our doorstep will be just as important as those who are further afield. One of those regional friends and certainly a most important one is Indonesia. The review acknowledges the fact that there have been significant positive developments in Australias relationship with Indonesia over recent years. It also states that there is a strong recognition in both countries of the value of a sound relationship, although a warning is included that the improving relationship may be disturbed by events in either country. In chapter 3, entitled `Enhancing regional security, the review reiterates what most people who are at all interested in these matters already know: that regional security is one of the most important elements in our defence planning and policies.In the section relating to defining our priorities within South-East Asia, the review identifies Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore as being of the highest importance to Australia as these nations form a strategic triangle that provides stability across the most likely approaches to our north. The review states:More than with any other regional nation, a sound strategic relationship with Indonesia does most for Australias security. We should seek new opportunities to deepen the relationship in areas that serve both countries interests. We should be careful to ensure that new areas of cooperation are based on mutual benefits and are developed at a pace with which both sides are comfortable.The review also suggests methods by which we may continue to build a closer relationship with Indonesia, including activities which provide for increased contacts and will facilitate the development of greater understanding on a personal level; for example, training programs, exchanges of observers, study visits, combined exercises, placements on courses and at our various colleges, and wider instruction in the Indonesian language. I believe that the significance of the Australia-Indonesia relationship cannot be overemphasised or overestimated.In November last year, the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade tabled a report entitled Australias relations with Indonesia . This report was the third in a series. The two previous reports dealt with Australias relations with the South Pacific and with Papua New Guinea. As a member of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I was involved in the preparation of these reports and I commend them to the House as documents which provide invaluable background material on both foreign affairs and defence matters relating to countries and regions with which Australias future is inextricably linked. In this context, the report on our relations with Indonesia is one of the most important documents that has been presented in this House for many years. It examines economic relations; cultural, political and security issues; and regional issues involving Australia and Indonesia.The comments contained in the Strategic review 1993 regarding the importance of our relationship with Indonesia reflect the investigations undertaken and the recommendations made by the committee in this report. For example, the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade found:The defence relationship with Indonesia has been sound at times when the political relationship was disturbed, so that any difficulties in the former have been caused by the latter. This has been based on a solid, cooperative program where there are important security interests in common and on increasing personal contacts and friendships between various senior officers of the respective armed forces. There is a cooperative approach in which a number of aspects provide a capacity to work together as regional partners.It is also relevant to mention that the committee found:There will probably always be some Australians who see threats from neighbouring countries which, like Indonesia, are `different, large and unknown.However:Indonesia has repeatedly made it clear it is no more a threat to Australia than we are to Indonesia . . .Neither country has any aggressive designs on the other.The committees recommendation that:. . . current discussions about regional security continue and expand, with the object of working towards the creation of a cooperative regional defence structure.is certainly in line with the approach taken in the Strategic review . I would like to take this opportunity to say that it is to be hoped that other recommendations made by the committee in regard to defence equipment purchases, Australias cooperative training program with Indonesia, and the provision of defence and defence related assistance to Indonesia will also be taken into account by our defence planners.Unlike Indonesia, North Korea potentially poses enormous problems in regard to the present and future peace and security of our region. The review states that:Australias defence and security planners . . . face a period of growing complexity and uncertainty.It identifies several key factors of change within the Asia-Pacific region, which include:. the possibilities for proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles;and:. the Korean peninsula as an area of substantial change over the decade and as a potential flashpoint;The issue of proliferation is dealt with more fully in chapter 1, `Australias Strategic Outlook. The review states that the continued spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons is an important issue in the post-Cold War era. It specifically mentions the fact that in the Asia-Pacific region North Korea has been trying to develop nuclear weapons. It also acknowledges that future developments in north-east Asia will be an important factor in Australias strategic outlook. Key uncertainties in north-east Asia over the decade, which are identified in the review, include the prospect of a reunified Korea, which it describes as a clear possibility, which would constitute a new and dynamic element in the north-east Asian strategic environment and which may have complex consequences for the strategic balance in the region.These somewhat cursory references to North Korea do not accurately indicate the magnitude of the currently critical and, unfortunately, apparently rapidly deteriorating situation. We know only too well, and from relatively recent experience, that tyrants and weapons are a lethal mixture. In response to a question without notice on 3 February 1994, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said:The matters at stake in the Korean peninsula are of the highest security significance to Australia and to the region. The proliferation of nuclear weapons there would pose a grave threat to the security of the Asia-Pacific region. The whole talk of the attitude of the North Koreans and their program to date has already had very unsettling effects in the area. It would profoundly complicate Australias security planning and that of our friends and neighbours. It would also make it much more difficult to uphold the global non-proliferation regime.On 17 March the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), also in response to a question without notice regarding the ongoing tensions on the Korean peninsula and the DPRKs lack of cooperation in regard to the International Atomic Energy Agency inspections, said:This is a serious and disturbing development which again calls into question North Koreas commitment to peace and stability in North-East Asia . . .. . . . . . . . .. . . the Prime Minister and I have both recently made very clear the seriousness of this issue for Australias and the regions security interests.The escalation of the crisis over North Koreas suspected nuclear program has taken the headlines in many of our newspapers this morning and has also been the leading item in most electronic media news reports. In a comment which appeared on the front page of todays Age , Graham Barrett, the Foreign Editor, summed up the situation very succinctly:There is no more dangerous a creature than a nation under a madman who seems to be acquiring nuclear weapons.Saddam Hussein tried it in Iraq. Kim Il-sung and his son, Kim Jong-il, appear to be trying it in North Korea. It is their last hope in a world that is passing them by like a BMW overtaking a Trabant.If they are indeed developing a weapon of mass destruction, and are trying to evade detection in order to spring one last dirty trick, East Asia is in trouble.What Graham Barrett says is absolutely correct. If East Asia is in trouble, the rest of our region and, indeed, the whole world will most assuredly feel the effects. Under the circumstances, the review should have taken greater account of the Korean situation. There are other areas which have also been neglected but, as I said previously, most of these have been highlighted by my colleagues who have already spoken in this debate and by other expert analysts and commentators, including Michael OConnor of the Australian Defence Association and Gary Brown whose recent book Australias security: issues for the new century should be compulsory reading for everyone concerned with or about defence issues.In concluding, I endorse the comments made this morning by my colleague the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) in regard to the role of the United Nations and also our existing alliances and relationships, particularly with the United States of America. The defence of our nation should be a matter of paramount concern to all Australians. Hopefully, the debate which has resulted from the release of the Strategic review 1993 , and which will undoubtedly increase following the release of the white paper later this year, will help encourage and increase public interest in and awareness of the continuing challenges we face in regard to our national security.","N/A","MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
105,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr KNOTT","GV5","(Gilmore)","ALP","N/A",1814,"—In the course of my contribution to this debate on the Strategic review I will make some comment about the contribution of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson), because some of the statements he made reflect his prejudices rather than any basis of reality.Unlike some other people, I do not rise in this place claiming to be an expert on strategic matters or on defence. I rise in this place speaking as an Australian. My credentials on this matter come from being an Australian and from my own family. My family has contributed to Ares, the god of war. My family has holes in it from the losses that have taken place on foreign battlefields. I have got one other claim as to why I have to speak on this subject. I have two sons—Sam, who is 2 1/2 years of age, and Joseph, who is 11 months old. I tell this House that the last thing that I ever want to have to do is stand down on some rotten wharf and watch them go away in a ship to maybe come back, maybe not come back. If they were to come back, they may come back incomplete in terms of their physical ability or mental ability.I was against the Vietnam war. I have the greatest respect for those people who partook of it. I believe in many ways that their decision to take part in that war was a mistake, in terms of the politics of the whole situation, but one can have nothing but respect for people who are prepared to put their lives on the line in the service of their country. I have naval establishments in my area and I have great respect for the people who work in and who are part of those establishments.There are a number of things in this Strategic review which I believe in some ways fall short of reality. Future global security is assessed in terms of who can shoot at what and why—crystal ball gazing. My humble opinion as an Australian is that the economic expectations of the underdeveloped world are by far the greatest threat to global security. Let me make this point: if we in the Western world, with our per capita use of resources, fail to realise the economic expectations of, and take into account the right of, people of the Third World—the 1.2 billion people in China, the people in India and the people of Africa—to have a life as good as ours, then we will have real problems. The real strategic problem on this earth is that if the rest of the world has the economic standards that we have then the globe will collapse because there is not enough energy, not enough food and not enough of everything to go around. I hoped that this document would have addressed that issue and would have addressed the fact that the expectations of those underprivileged people in the world probably pose the greatest threat to international and global security. That, unfortunately, is an economic problem and one which really does not enter the thoughts of those people talking about strategy.Let us look at the great wars. The First World War, from 1914 to 1918, it is almost unanimously agreed, was a trade war. Look at the contribution that this nation made in life, blood and guts. My grandfather had one whole lung and two-thirds of the other taken out because he was gassed in France. For what? Can anyone in this place tell me for what? The reality is: unless we look at the rest of the world as human beings having equal rights to live with us, then I am afraid this report is just bunkum. It just sets out the rules about how we kill each other.I am not a pacifist. I make that clear to the House. I am a peace activist, not a pacifist. If someone punches me in the mouth the first two times I will step back. The third time someone does it I will knock his head off. That is reality. I realise that we need to nurture a defence presence—and the word is `defence. I think we would have a lot more integrity and future global security if we spent a lot more time putting energy into a democratic world government, not a US world government, not a Group of Five nations which have veto power on the Security Council—not a little club which says, `We control the world and you are going to do what you are told.That would mean that the great powers of this world which scream for democracy would have to start instituting a bit of democracy in the United Nations. Let us have a one nation, one vote situation, instead of one nation having hundreds of votes or the ability to veto. Let us see what happens then.The Strategic Review 1993 talks about the nuclear threat. As part of the nuclear cycle we also talk about the nuclear threat. Two-thirds of the worlds plutonium supplies will be in the hands of one nation by the year 2000. I can assure honourable members that that is a worry to me. Last year the Akatsuki Maru went past our shores, taking plutonium to Japan, but very few honourable members noticed. I am not one of those xenophobes who look at Japans relationship with us in the last war and say, `Japan is always going to be our enemy. I have managed to establish relationships with the young Japanese. Many of those young Japanese who have kids, just as I do, are just as scared. They are scared because they do not trust politicians. When we consider the history of the world and humankind, how the hell could we expect anyone to trust politicians?Some statements about North Korea were made earlier in this debate. Let us be clear as to what North Korea is about. The Americans are pushing a very hard line in North Korea. Why? I ask honourable members to give me a reason. The Americans did not push the same line on Israel or South Africa. They are not pushing the same line on Pakistan. Honourable members should think about this. Those opposite will start talking about Saddam Hussein, but who created Saddam Hussein? The United States did. It was the CIA—that great democratic institution which has brought down more democratic governments than communists ever have.Our strategic assessment of the nuclear threat should not just end with the demobilisation of those weapons. Some people believe that a weapon which has 100 people protecting it is in some way safe. However, as soon as those 100 people are taken away and the weapon demobilised, the weapon becomes waste, and radiation from waste can kill just as much as radiation from a bomb can. I suggest that we need to have a good look at what the nuclear cycle has done.I want to deal with our relationship with the United States in a little more depth. I commit myself as a friend to the citizens of the United States. I have visited the United States before. In fact, my attitude towards the people changed when I went there. I went there thinking that the Yanks were big mouths who tried to push and bully the rest of the world around. The American citizens are not like that. It is only their government. Why? Their government is predominantly run by two entities: the arms manufacturers in the United States and the CIA. A paragraph of the Strategic review 1993 , which is of interest to me, reads:The eventual shape of the United States overseas commitments—and its underlying national security strategy—are still evolving . . . However, the global strategy of containing the Soviet Union has been supplanted in US thinking by a wider range of priorities, including the ability to win smaller regional conflicts, economic and trade interests, human rights and democratic reforms, and opposition to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.If only they meant it! If only the CIA and the Americans who are running the show believed in democracy, that would be good. Unfortunately, they do not. It has often been said that, if people have friends like the US, who needs enemies? Honourable members on this side of the House have mentioned that on many occasions with respect to wheat, trade and various other things about which we have open knowledge.There is a man in the United States who is in gaol now because he sold secrets to the Russians. One of the reasons he did so was because the CIA was destabilising the Whitlam Labor government. He lost his allegiance to his country. He said, `If thats what you do to friends, what the hell do you do to enemies?.The underlying security strategy of the US has nothing to do with the broad interests or wishes of US citizens. Being in a friendly military alliance with the US is like being a male black widow spider about to make love—he has to be very careful or he will end up being eaten. The US through its policy is capable of creating a war tomorrow. If it pushes the North Koreans and takes a bloody-minded attitude, there will be a war there. Anyone who thinks the relationship with China is strong enough to keep them out should think again. I would be much more secure in my rights as an Australian if I knew that the US foreign policy had less to do with the US arms manufacturers and dealers and the domestic popularity of the President and more to do with the reality of what is really going on in the world and with world peace.I turn now to regional friendships, which over time have been somewhat bumpy. Regional friendship is about mutual respect. I believe that in relationships with people we have to be open and honest and we have to have the ability to criticise. Unfortunately, some of our Asian neighbours do not realise that we do not shoot journalists or gaol them for their profession. I remind honourable members that five journalists were shot in East Timor. Not once have we had an apology for that and not once have we had an acknowledgment of it. East Timor is still a sword in our regional side, as are Bougainville and west Papua. A mature relationship with our neighbours should mean that they recognise that we do not control press; we have free press. A mature relationship should mean that those people realise that we have democracy and that we do not have to kowtow to anyone.This document says that civil military coordination in this country should be broadened—that it is a great thing and it should happen more often, and that in time of conflict the government should be able to implement a unified national response. Why not at all times? I would have thought that the Australian defence forces would be capable of helping us to defend ourselves against flood, fire and typhoon. I would have thought that a coordinated response would be vital in peacetime and wartime. I would have thought that all the resources that we put into our armed forces would be just as adaptable in looking after our people in times when they are defending themselves against natural elements. I would like to see that.","N/A","MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

108,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr REID","VT4","(Bendigo)","LP","N/A",1816,"—It is with pleasure that I speak to the Strategic review 1993 , which was presented to the Australian parliament by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray). It is a matter of great importance to everyone in Australia. I take this opportunity to support the comments of my colleague the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) in speaking to the House earlier today in this debate. He has a great knowledge of Australias defence requirements, having been a former Minister for the Army, and he has a great knowledge of defence throughout the South-East Asian area. I am pleased to support him in this discussion.One of the most important things in the strategic outlook report appears on page 5 of the document, where it refers to the changing nature of US strategic policy involvement, particularly after the Cold War. It certainly has an impact on Australias defence future and the future stability of the region in which Australia takes its place in the world.Paragraph 1.3 of the strategic outlook report states:Global efforts to solve security problems throughout the world continue to depend heavily on the political will and military capability of the United States. But the United States is working towards a more cooperative style of global strategic leadership in which its allies take an increasing share of the political, economic and military burden. This presents particular challenges in the Asia-Pacific region, where Cold War arrangements were less collective than in Europe, where China continues to play a unique and independent role, as it did in the Cold War, where Japan is still cautious about taking part in military activities, even peacekeeping, and where region-wide multilateral security dialogues are only beginning to be established.The key point is that some of these security dialogues are very much in a state of preliminary negotiations and discussions between Australia and its near neighbours.On page 13 of the Strategic review , there is quite extensive reference to South-East Asia and Australias relationship in that part of the world. I will quote once again from the Strategic review : Section 1.43 states:No ASEAN state sees Australia as a military threat. ASEAN members and other South East Asian nations have welcomed what they see as a new commitment by Australia to develop economic, security and other links with Asia, although some sometimes find our media and policies on some issues uncomfortable. Continued fostering of ties will be required to manage occasional bilateral difficulties. Nevertheless, the prospects are good for our active involvement over the 1990s in a `regional security community.Throughout this document there is constant reference to the security of this nation and our security in relation to South-East Asia.It is important for Australia that those security issues be addressed. It is particularly important to the area that I represent, because an army establishment happens to be in my electorate. The Army Survey Regiment has its headquarters in Bendigo. It performs a very valuable role in security and strategic planning. I will come back to that later.On page 14 of the Strategic review , paragraph 1.52 of the conclusion states:Our strategic outlook for the 1990s is more complex and uncertain—the emphasis is on the word `uncertain—although not immediately more threatening. At least in the short term, a period of disorder is likely as constraints imposed by the Cold War are released. New tensions are also emerging arising from economic imbalances and other transnational issues.We must address our planning for the future defence of Australia. On page 42 of the Strategic review , the minister addresses some of those questions. Once again, the review refers to the strengthening of our security in this nation. There is constant emphasis throughout the Strategic review on the security of Australia and its future in South-East Asia. Paragraph 5.20 of the document states:In our defence planning, priority will be given to developing the capabilities to respond to threats that could arise with little warning. But attention will also be given to planning and developing concepts that will allow us to be confident that we can respond to more major threats should strategic circumstances change.This is where the logistic support and logistic facilities come into play; it is the planning for the future to ensure that Australia is protected and is secure in its place in the world. As well as logistic support and logistic facilities, the Strategic review addresses:. the continued development of joint or shared logistics arrangements, including munitions storage, maintenance facilities and common-use supplies;. the development of operational sustainability guidance, specifying indicative periods of sustainment as the basis for determining stock levels;. the efficient use of civil resources and infrastructure . . .. greater use of national industry for base-level support, repair and recovery and through-life maintenance;. automated systems to enhance efficiency and reduce manpower where practicable;. maximising the interoperability of equipment and systems within the ADF;and—importantly for me and for the people in my electorate—. the continued participation by Defence in the broader national efforts to survey, map and collect relevant data on our physical environment, using advanced digital systems and focusing on the more likely areas of operations.I want to impress upon the House just how important that statement is. The Army Survey Regiment, which is located at Fortuna, Bendigo—I know that the honourable member for Kooyong has visited it many times and is very aware of the fine work people there do—is a very important part of the service sector economy of Bendigo as well. The 300 salaried workers of the Army Survey Regiment currently earn approximately $11.7 million per annum and the flow-on effects create an additional 180 jobs throughout the local economy, with a net value effect of approximately $4.5 million which flows into the Bendigo regional economy.The personnel of the Army Survey Regiment also play a role in a whole range of other activities in the community life of Bendigo. They have a field of technological expertise and capacity which they make available to a wide-ranging group of organisations throughout the Bendigo area. It is my understanding—and I have been closely involved with the staff of the Army Survey Regiment in their defence mapping facility—that they have put in a bid for the commercial support program, which is currently under consideration by the government. It is my wish that the government give that bid its absolute No. 1 attention. I think it is vital for the security of Australia that the Australian defence forces have control over this type of activity with survey work, mapping and the development of their computerised systems, which have been used in Australia as well as many other areas of the world.The economic impact of the Army Survey Regiment in the Bendigo area cannot be underestimated and I would like to see that regiment expand its activities in the area. It has enjoyed the confidence and support of the Bendigo community for many years in the role that it plays and, as I indicated to the House, the personnel from the Army Survey Regiment do have a tremendous impact on the everyday life of Bendigo and its citizens. They work for a number of charitable institutions, sporting organisations and community organisations, and their families also play a very important part in those areas.This is one of the most important aspects in the logistics support facilities program. I am pleased to see that the minister has acknowledged in Strategic review 1993 `the continued participation by defence to survey, map and collect relevant data on our physical environment. The defence department and defence forces should play a major role in controlling the collection and dissemination of that data throughout the Australian defence forces and its interrelationship with the United States of America and our allies.I know that during the Middle East crisis—the Gulf War—the Army Survey Regiment, through the development of some of its systems, played a role in supporting the United States of America and other allied forces. The expertise that it has built up as a result of interchange programs between personnel from the Australian survey regiment and forces in the United Kingdom, the United States and some near Asian countries, has been welcomed by our allies. The cooperation that has been achieved in the planning and the mapping of Australia and other nations, including Papua New Guinea, has been welcomed. I want to put on the record the importance of that Army Survey Regiment and the importance of it remaining under the control of the defence forces.","N/A","MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
109,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr HORNE","UU5","(Paterson)","ALP","N/A",1818,"—I rise today to support the ministerial statement on the Strategic review 1993 , which is about defence. Proudly, our nation has never earned a reputation as an aggressor, and neither should it. I sincerely hope, as I am sure all members of this House do, that we never become an aggressor in any conflict.Australia prides itself on being not only a member of the South-East Asian community but also a leader, a technological innovator. As a nation we have great hopes for increased trade in that region. I am sure all members of this House share that hope. Historically, we have played a different role in the Asia-Pacific basin. From the Second World War to the present, we have been involved significantly as a peacemaker and as a peacekeeper. Korea, Vietnam and Malaysia all saw long and involved commitment of our country to making our part of the world safe and peaceful.I can assure honourable members that no-one resents defence expenditure more than I do. I guess it is a bit like paying out hefty insurance bills on our homes year after year with no visible return. I know that many people in the Newcastle area shared that view until the earthquake of 1987. Since then not as many people in that area resent paying their insurance. Unfortunately, defence spending is just one of those insurance policies. It is exactly what it says—a defence force that we maintain to safeguard our citizens, our property and the property of our friends.Our preparedness to commit funds to a modern, well-trained defence force also indicates to our neighbours that we are prepared to accept our responsibility to ensure stability in our region. The last two decades have seen major changes in our region. We have seen the emergence of major economic and industrial growth centres. We have seen a major change in living standards and in international relationships. While the end of the Cold War and the tearing down of the Iron Curtain may have seen major changes between East and West in Europe, the changes in the Asia-Pacific basin have been less obvious, more subtle.The Strategic review 1993 is essentially a process of determining our objectives for defence that will not only guarantee our integrity as a nation but also enhance the security of our region. The review looks ahead three to five years and identifies challenges that we are likely to experience over that period. The review will precede a white paper that is to be published later this year. The white paper will look ahead to the next century and set those long-term approaches for maintaining our security and managing our total defence resources.As a nation, we spend about $10 billion a year on defence. We source about 35 per cent of our capital equipment offshore, 65 per cent being sourced here in Australia. Those areas that are currently involved in projects building the frigates at Williamstown and the submarines in the Newcastle and South Australian areas know the value of defence industry expenditure and the value of the technology that is being developed in those projects. There are certainly high expectations in my electorate and adjacent electorates for the minehunter project that is to be announced later this year. We will see a billion dollars being expended by this government in the establishment of new minehunting technology. We will be able to share that with the whole of our region, as we develop this technology and as we give jobs to young people. That is one of the major spin-offs from defence expenditure.In my own electorate, the RAAF base at Williamtown—our largest air base—is a significant contributor to not only the economy but also the community. In excess of 3,000 people are directly involved with that air base. It is home to the No. 3 Squadron that has FA18 Hornets, No. 76 Squadron with its Macchi trainers, No. 77 Squadron with its Hornets and No. 20 combat unit that also flies Hornets. It is something that no-one in our local community resents. Add to that the Australian Defence Force warfare centre with No. 41 wing, plus the base support wing, and we can see how involved they are.The ADF Centre is a joint service unit that was established to develop, teach, promulgate and provide advice on the Australian Defence Force joint operational and peacekeeping doctrine. Invariably, the people who staff these squadrons are committed to their task; they are proud of the role they play in guaranteeing our national defence. They are good citizens. Unfortunately, over recent years their morale has taken a few blows, as we have seen cuts in defence expenditure and heard rumours of change. I believe this review is vital to reassure them of their future, to reinforce their self-image that what they are doing is worth while and to show them that the community at large values and shares their ideals for making our nation a safe place, a place with a future and a place with a commitment.Another aspect of this review is to assess the changing attitude of the United States to our part of the world. We also need to evolve new partnerships of the highest priority with Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. We must explore the possibility of moving beyond the framework of existing cooperative activities and consider new opportunities. We should consider shared training facilities; defence, science and industrial cooperation; and procurement.Our relationship with New Zealand and New Guinea must also be examined. We are already aware of the shared relationship, especially with New Zealand, over the frigates. The frigate contract will share those common boats that New Zealand has already contracted to purchase. They are being built in Australia and added to in New Zealand. There needs to be a sharing of the technology and the cost of developing that technology.With New Zealand, our efforts to promote our shared defence interest and our commitment will be based on closer defence relations and the coordination of our policies throughout that region. With Papua New Guinea, our closest neighbour, and other south-west Pacific states, our strategic commitment will of necessity focus on cooperation which assists in promoting national resilience and increases the capacity of these nations to deal with security problems.Asian powers are evolving today. What China and India develop into at this stage in the history of the world is as yet unknown. We need to monitor that. We are certainly hopeful that our relationship with those countries will continue to be a peaceful one, but we cannot predict that with any certainty. In particular, we need to understand their interest in and attitude to our part of the world.I have already mentioned the United States. We as a nation pride ourselves on our close relationship with the USA, but it is a symbiotic one. It is a relationship of mutual benefit. It cannot be one-way traffic. We need to show the United States that we, as a mature and independent nation, are prepared to make a commitment to our own defence and not simply allow a big brother to take care of us. Maintaining the important benefits of our defence relationship with the United States will remain a key objective of our defence policy.Our alliance relationship with the United States is a key theme of this review with an emphasis on its importance to our shared commitment to security in the Asia-Pacific region. Our defence relationship with the United States helps maintain US strategic links with this part of the world and thereby contributes greatly to regional stability. It is also of enduring significance for our national strategic posture.Our alliance with the United States continues to be valuable to the development of Australias defence capabilities. A number of weapons platforms and technology in our defence inventory are purchased from and supported by the United States and we could not afford to produce such systems locally. Australias defence science activities benefit strongly from cooperation with the US both bilaterally and through the technical cooperation program.The joint defence facilities and our intelligence relationship with the USA remain valuable factors in our security and continue to make a major contribution to global and regional security. In addition, both countries acknowledge the continuing importance of our security cooperation under the ANZUS treaty, including the continuing relevance and value of mutual security obligations embodied in the treaty and our close consultation on issues of mutual security concern. Essentially, this is all part of maintaining our role in global security.The Strategic review 1993 is the first comprehensive post-Cold War assessment of Australias strategic outlook. It sets the scene for the defence white paper that is due out later this year. The Strategic review affirms that providing for the defence of Australians and Australia remains the most fundamental defence responsibility. At the same time, increased engagement with the region, and continuing our increased commitment to multilateral security activities, promotes our continued security by fostering a regional strategic environment which is favourable to our interests. This also benefits the region as a whole. The maintenance of our strong alliance with the United States is also a defence priority based on shared strategic interest, mutual security obligations and the practical benefits we gain which assist self-reliance.","N/A","MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

115,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr WILLIS","ZJ4","GELLIBRAND","ALP","N/A",1821,"—Yes, I am going to answer this one; it is a much more substantive question than the last one. This question asks me about the APEC finance ministers meeting which was held last Friday night and Saturday in Honolulu. It was a meeting which was attended by all member countries of APEC including the new members, Mexico and Papua New Guinea, and also by the prospective new member, Chile. It was essentially a meeting of the world economic growth club because, with the exception of Japan—which of course is about one of the most powerful economies in the world—and one or two others, which are not growing as well, everyone else has been experiencing substantial to strong growth; some, very strong growth. As we are aware, Singapore is growing at almost 10 per cent per annum; Malaysia, which has had seven years of growth, is growing at over eight per cent; and China is growing at over 10 per cent per annum. These are extraordinary rates of growth. The Western developed economies are all growing at more modest but respectable rates. Australia is growing at around four per cent per annum, along with New Zealand; Canada is around 3 3/4 per cent; and the United States is at 3 1/4 per cent.This is a group of countries which represent, indeed, the engines of growth in the world economy. It is very good that Australia is not only there but there with standing—that is, there with a rate of growth which is highly respectable for a developed country and not only producing a good growth rate of four per cent, as the recent national accounts for the December quarter showed, for the 12 months to December, but also having a set of fundamentals underpinning that which gives us extraordinary confidence for the future and a capacity to keep that growth going for a long time. Australia is in the position where it was able to hold its head up high at this conference, talk positively about its growth rate and its potential for continued growth and be in a highly respectable position in comparison with other countries.

117,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr WILLIS","ZJ4","GELLIBRAND","ALP","N/A",1821,"—At the meeting, there was agreement on the types of policies needed to achieve economic growth. I will not hold up the House by talking about those, but I will say that much of the discussion was taken up with the problems resulting from high economic growth, which of course is an interesting change. I must say that in all the time I have been a minister I do not think I have ever been to a meeting where there was so much time spent discussing the problems of high economic growth. Of course, this is because, over the course of the 1980s, Australia has done very well compared with most OECD countries. But at most meetings that one goes to countries are not discussing the problems of high economic growth but how to achieve high economic growth.Here we were having a meeting where there was much discussion about the problems resulting from high economic growth—how to ensure continued growth without inflation, how to deal with large capital inflows and how to develop capital markets which can deal with those large capital inflows; how to provide insurance to investors; and how to help mobilise domestic savings for investment. We also discussed the problems of developing adequate infrastructure. There was considerable agreement on the fact that there was an increasing role for the private sector to play in building that infrastructure.This meeting also provided an opportunity for Australia and others to express concern about the looming possibility that the United States may delay the implementation of the GATT agreement because of congressional problems in passing the appropriate legislation. This results from the so-called pay-as-you-go rules adopted by Congress in 1990, which mean that, if the administration wants to put through a tax reduction measure, it has to come up with compensating tax revenue from some source or other. Some congressional leaders are saying that it is a factor that will lead them to delay the implementation of the necessary legislation for the United States to undertake its responsibilities to implement the Uruguay Round—that is, to reduce its tariffs in the main and to do other associated things—and that that would not happen until mid-1995 instead of at the beginning of 1995.A number of us expressed concern about that. It would mean that there would be encouragement to others who might be inclined to go slow on this matter to similarly go slow, and the whole process of getting the Uruguay Round fully implemented may start to lose momentum. Once that happens, even worse things may result. So it is a matter of some concern. I would not say that the United States was entirely happy about the fact that this matter was discussed, but I am sure it will give a considerable degree of reassurance to the administration in talking to its Congress to be able to say that it needs to get this through because various other countries are very concerned about the fact that it may be going slow. The result will be that the United States administration will push hard for an implementation as quickly as possible, but cannot guarantee that it will happen by the end of this year.This meeting was very satisfying and useful. It did much to cement the APEC relationship. Relationships between all parties were extremely cordial. There is to be another meeting in Indonesia next year. This meeting was a further positive step towards cementing APEC and ensuring that it becomes a major factor for Australia in building better economic relations with the people of the region.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[2]/answer/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

120,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr HOLLIS","DH4","THROSBY","ALP","N/A",1822,"—My question is directed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. Can the minister advise what progress has been made on the development of proposals to protect people on low incomes from the immediate impact of any increase in the basic charge for Telecoms public payphones? Mr LEE —I previously advised the House that Telecom applied for an increase in the basic charge for payphone services last November. Telecoms proposal was to increase the basic charge from 30c to 40c. On two previous occasions Austel has recommended to ministers that increases not proceed, but on this occasion, after an appropriate review, Austel did recommend to me that I not disallow this proposed increase.The reasons were that it was the first increase for eight years; the increase was less than the CPI increase over those eight years; and that the performance which Telecom is now getting out of the public payphone system has increased dramatically, with serviceability rising from 65 per cent, when the Leader of the House was the minister for communications, to 91 per cent when the Minister for Resources was the minister for communications. But I would have to put down the dramatic improvement in performance to the fact that, while the Leader of the House was the minister for communications, Telecom made the decision to introduce phonecards, which has meant that there is less money in cash boxes and less incentive for people to vandalise those public payphones.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[4]/question/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

122,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr LEE","MG4","DOBELL","ALP","N/A",1822,"—I am sure you were not personally responsible for the disappearance of the money from the cash boxes. But since that time there has been a dramatic increase in the serviceability of those payphones. However, in its report Austel said that it did have a concern about the impact that a proposed increase would have on low income earners. The basic statistic that we should remember is that 20 per cent of payphone users do not have a phone at home and make on average four times as many calls from payphones than the typical payphone user.Last month Telecom agreed to withdraw its proposed increase, to seek to develop a transitional package for those low income earners. I am pleased to advise the honourable member for Throsby that Telecom has been working very closely with the Department of Social Security and the Department of Veterans Affairs to come up with a transitional package that tries to help those low income earners who do not have a phone on at home. This particular package will provide for a once only free issue of a $4 Phonecard to approximately 2.3 million Australians to ease the burden of any proposed increase in payphone charges. It is a package which I think does address the concerns raised by Austel.Those eligible will include pensioners and veterans who do not currently receive the home telephone allowance; people receiving jobstart, newstart, and other benefits; as well as working families who receive the health care card. The provision of a free $4 Phonecard to 2.3 million Australians, I believe, is a sensible and responsible approach to try to ease the burden of this increase in payphone charges. It will cost Telecom approximately $9 million. I anticipate that the package and the increase will take effect some time in September.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[4]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

124,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr WILLIS","ZJ4","GELLIBRAND","ALP","N/A",1823,"—It is obviously unwise to speculate about interest rates. But let me say that simply because there are increases in interest rates in another country like the United States does not mean that we need to think that we have to have an increase here—the United States has a different state of the cycle to us. It certainly has much higher levels of capacity utilisation than we have, in terms of physical equipment and also because of a lesser level of unemployment. It is growing less rapidly than we are at the moment, but it does have a higher level of capacity utilisation. It also took its interest rates down further than we did and, therefore, it is more likely that it will start to increase them before we will.We must bear in mind that there are these considerable differences between us and the United States. The fact that the markets have been jumping because the United States increased its official interest rate by a quarter of a per cent does not accord with the reality of looking at the Australian scene and saying, `Is there a need for there to be an increase in interest rates?. Of course, a prime factor—not the only factor—in determining whether there should be increases in interest rates or not is the rate of inflation and inflation expectations. In that respect one would have to say that the inflation rate at the present time of 1.9 per cent is relatively low, with prospects of even going lower at the next quarter, and with inflationary expectations remaining quite low, outside the financial markets it might seem.Certainly, there are very low expectations of inflation by business. A recent survey showed that 80 per cent of businesses expect that inflation will remain below four per cent for the rest of this century. So in those circumstances, I think we should look at the Australian situation on its own merits and not jump and expect change because a change occurs in another country like the United States. If one does that one can make reasonable assumptions about the likely future of interest rates.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[5]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

126,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr CREAN","DT4","HOTHAM","ALP","N/A",1824,"—I thank the honourable member for Melbourne for his question. I can advise of two very disturbing developments of recent times that do threaten the ability of the universities to make decisions about fees to fund student services. These developments have occurred in Western Australia, where that government has legislated to take away that ability, and in Victoria, where legislation is proposed to do the same thing.Apart from the fact that this does challenge the ability of the university student bodies to provide the very services that the honourable member for Melbourne has talked about, such as counselling, health, child care, sport, careers and amenities, it also strikes at the very autonomy of the universities to make decisions about how their organisations should function. We hear moralising from the other side of the parliament about how more autonomy should be given to the universities. Here is a blatant step taken by Liberal Party controlled governments in two of the states that are working quite contrary to this direction. Those on the other side should take note of what the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee has had to say in opposing the Western Australian governments position on this issue and seeing it as an intrusion on university autonomy.Apart from that, this issue also confuses the issue of the provision of services with the so-called question of unionism. As far as this government is concerned, we will not allow those states to take these steps. To ensure that that does not happen, firstly, we have amended the Higher Education Funding Act, whereby the Commonwealth can make up the shortfall and, secondly, we have amended the States Grants (General Purposes) Act to ensure that we can recover the funds through the states general revenue assistance. We will therefore not only respect the autonomy argument that the universities have put forward but also underpin the capacity of the university bodies to continue to provide the services.The final part of the honourable members question referred to the organisation called Victorians for Voluntary Student Unionism. The interesting thing about the pamphlet that comes out under its name is that, apart from talking about the freedom of choice, it talks about taking away the political influence of student unions. It derides the political nature of those student unions. The person who put out this pamphlet is an Angela Doyle of Glen Waverley. The phone number she gives people who want to join this organisation which wants to take politics out of student associations belongs to Senator Troeth, the Liberal senator from Victoria. Senator Troeth used to be the vice-president of the Liberal Party. So much for keeping politics out of student unions!The argument is a phoney one. This government will ensure that it does not proceed. We have the mechanisms in place to do it. I urge those on the other side of the House to get smart, get straight with this issue and call on the state governments in Western Australia and Victoria to desist from their present actions.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[6]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

130,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr BEAZLEY","PE4","SWAN","ALP","N/A",1825,"—I have seen the report that the honourable gentleman refers to. The report seems to suggest that the asset sales task force which operates in my department is in some way an independent decision-making authority of the government. It is not. It is merely an implementation body. When the government makes up its mind to sell all or part of any particular government operation, the asset sales task force does that task. To attribute to the asset sales task force anything other than a purely implementing activity is erroneous. The report does that by implication and directly in a number of cases.As I announced jointly with the Minister for Transport on 4 March, the task force is responsible to me for managing a due diligence process for ANL prior to preparing an information memorandum. There are a couple of other claims in the report which are wrong. There is, as I am advised, no task force internal planning memorandum which refers to calling for expressions of interest from potential buyers in the next few months. It will be a government decision as to when expressions of interest are sought, not a decision by the asset sales task force. While I will not comment on potential sale proceeds, I am advised that the value range quoted from the joint Potter Warburg and Price Waterhouse study in June 1992 is incorrect. ANL has also appointed the London-based firm of Moore Stephens, not to assist with due diligence but to undertake an entirely separate international benchmarking exercise.As announced on 4 March, the government will consider how to proceed with the sale process for ANL after the due diligence and information memorandums have been completed. It will also take account of the ALP national conference in September this year. This week the task force will begin interviews for business and accounting advisers to assist with due diligence for ANL, which will commence with the full cooperation of the ANL board and management after Easter. The first phase of due diligence is expected to be completed before the end of June, and a draft of a confidential information memorandum is expected to be available to ministers by late August.As the honourable member would be aware, the Labor Party at its last conference adopted a policy for sale of part of ANL. A due diligence process is necessary before sale of all or part of any organisation. That is the process which is being undertaken at this moment. When that due diligence process has been completed and an information memorandum prepared, the government will further consider its course.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[8]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

142,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr FREE","HG4","LINDSAY","ALP","N/A",1826,"—I thank the honourable member for Port Adelaide for the question. We are already seeing some skilled labour shortages emerging as the economy shifts into a long period of sustained growth. DEET statistics show, for example, skill shortages in areas such as building and the automotive trades in Western Australia. There are also shortages of nurses, paramedical staff and child-care workers in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia. These shortages are likely to be short-lived. The government believes that they do not reflect a nationwide pattern, but they certainly demonstrate a problem which has to be addressed because skill shortages in expanding industries can choke growth and, therefore, have obvious inflationary impacts.It is impossible to eradicate skilled labour shortages in a dynamic market economy, but training policies are now in place to ensure that we do not stop training during periods of economic downturn. All states are developing state training profiles with ANTA—the Australian National Training Authority—which take into account medium-level labour market demand. The whole idea of flexible pathways in training under the Australian vocational certificate training system ensures that the old apprenticeship system, whereby people could get training only if they had a job, is gone. A participant can now get credit for vocational study both in the classroom and on the job.The House would be aware that the government is spending over an extra $1 billion on the national training system in the four years starting from 1993, precisely with the objective of ensuring that the resources are available and remain available to provide access to flexible skills training. This is not just a good idea; it is the only way that we can ensure avoiding skills crises in the future.To see what would have happened had we not developed this new system, we need only look to the New Zealand experience. The recession of the 1980s in New Zealand was accompanied by a collapse of vocational training in that country. For example, annual apprentice numbers in New Zealand dropped by something like 85 per cent over the decade. This has meant that New Zealand has effectively lost an entire generation of tradespeople. The implications for growth in the New Zealand economy are obvious. New Zealand is already suffering widespread skill shortages in 14 skilled trades areas. The Australian vocational certificate training system in Australia provides the flexibility and resources to ensure that this need not happen to us.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[10]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We have a steering committee comprising representatives of the state governments, the Commonwealth government, the unions and the employers.As I pointed out to the House during the last question time, we have here an industry with exports worth $7 1/2 billion per annum. That is only a starting point. The opportunities for the Australian coal industry are exceptional. We have high reserves of steaming coal, which is in great demand from our Asian neighbours. Not only that, our coal is low in sulfur and is very efficient in the production of clean coal technology energy. In the honourable member for Capricornias electorate the new power station at Stanwell provides a great opportunity for Australian innovation. The third turbine of the first station to come on stream will be commissioned later this year. The first two turbines are already operating. That gives us the opportunity to not only export our coal but also export our technology in building those types of power stations and provide countries, particularly countries like India, with clean coal technology.We hear a lot about the greenhouse effect in Australia. All the incremental benefits we could get out of greenhouse emission reduction in Australia could be achieved by converting one Indian power station to clean coal technology. I thank the honourable member for her question. I hope to be able to answer within the next few days who will actually chair the study into the Australian coal industry.

It appears that the honourable member for Lyne is arguing that I should intervene to determine which areas receive SBS television. There seems to be some contradiction here that I am sure only the National Party can resolve.For the information of the honourable member for Lyne, on each occasion the government considers funding for SBS and the National Transmission Agency, it looks at whether SBS or ABC services should be extended to regional centres and capital cities.

Is it true that the Hilmer recommendations on competition policy threaten the livelihood of taxi owners? What would be the effect of opening up the taxi market? Will the taxi owners lose the substantial investment they have made in their plates or is the Commonwealth going to have to come up with hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation if tax reform goes ahead?","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[14]/question/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
159,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr GEAR","QG4","CANNING","ALP","N/A",1828,"—I have seen reports that some taxi owners think they may lose investments of hundreds of thousands of dollars if the Hilmer recommendations are implemented. I have also seen reports that the federal government may be asked to pay compensation, sometimes for hundreds of millions of dollars. It is true that a major recommendation of the Hilmer report is for regulation review, which is where taxis may be affected. Some states are reviewing their regulations and others may in the future wish for a national approach to regulation review. This might be undertaken by the national competition council, as recommended by the Hilmer report.There will be no action on taxis unless state governments decide that the state taxi industry should be reformed. In this regard, with the Olympics in Sydney in the year 2000, it may well be that the New South Wales state government may wish to take advantage of the reforms in the taxi industry. If a decision is made, a national inquiry would be held with recommendations going back to the state governments, which have responsibility for the licensing of taxis. They can accept these recommendations, modify them or reject them outright. I stress that it will be a public process where all parties can put their views. It may well be the case that taxis can argue that the present arrangements are in the public interest. If they are successful in that argument, then they will be authorised to continue operations in the way in which they do now.I want to stress that state governments will initiate this process and state governments will make the final decision. Consumers have a very real interest in seeing a more competitive taxi market. In most states there are major restrictions on entry into the market with licence plates rising accordingly. In Perth a taxi plate costs about $130,000, in Gosford $240,000 and on the Gold Coast as much as $320,000. These high licence plates mean that consumers pay more than they otherwise would—about $2 a trip. That amounts to $300 million a year with consumers, and often the elderly, footing the bill. Another cost is the long waiting times in peak periods.I was finally asked about compensation. Let me stress that the Commonwealth is not going to be landed with a bill for hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation, but there are many options available.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[14]/answer/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

What are the implications of that report for unemployment in Australia?","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[16]/question/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
169,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr CREAN","DT4","HOTHAM","ALP","N/A",1829,"—I think the broad message that came from both the G7 meeting and the OECD report is twofold: firstly, that there is no substitute for economic growth in solving the problem of unemployment and, secondly, that special measures need to be taken to assist the long-term unemployed—in other words, that economic growth alone will not solve their particular problem. With that in mind, I remind the House that not only did the Commonwealth government arrive at these two conclusions some time ago but also it is in the process of developing a very detailed response to give effect to those in a policy sense.We have said that we need to have targeted policies for the long-term unemployed—a jobs compact that will seek to not artificially create jobs for them but put them in a stronger competitive position whereby they can compete for the job growth that will inevitably come if we can sustain the levels of economic growth we are now experiencing. That is a major challenge for us.One of the major constraints to our ability to sustain the economic growth at those levels is running into a skilled shortage—in other words, that the skills that are available do not meet the requirements of those seeking to employ people because the whole nature of the work will have changed. It is against that background that the Commonwealths white paper response is looking to address the specific questions of not just how we get people who have been out of work for a long time back into work but also how we increase the capacity for this nation to train the work force and to ensure that in the process of increasing training we do not leave the long-term unemployed behind.The OECD in its report indicated that Australia had done very well in the past in terms of economic growth. It compared our capacity to grow in the decade of the 1980s at two per cent versus the rest of the world at about one per cent. Now we are looking at four per cent plus. Therefore, we are well placed through strong economic growth to create the job opportunities. But at the same time we have a policy mechanism in place to develop a response on training and for targeting the long-term unemployed. Therefore, the simple message that came out of the OECD meeting in terms of what government should be looking to do to solve this problem we are doing. Again we have the capacity to lead the OECD countries on this occasion, as we did through the 1980s when we created faster employment growth than any other OECD nation. We must have been doing something right then. We will continue to build on that and develop innovative policies to tackle the problems of the long-term unemployed and the training of the work force.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[16]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

235,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr DOWNER","4G4","(Mayo)","LP","N/A",1834,"—Today—22 March—the Greens have revealed their plans for the 1994 federal budget. The publication by the Greens of their budget proposals follows on from yesterday when the Australian Democrats also put forward a range of different proposals. I do not think this House would want to waste any time getting into a debate about what the Democrats and the Greens think should happen in terms of the budget but I do think it is important to acknowledge one simple thing about the submissions of the Greens and the Democrats: they have given the Labor Party a blank cheque to increase taxes right across the board in this country. Both the Greens and the Democrats have said they would like to join Labors little tax club. They would like to join Labors tax club and increase taxes like the Medicare levy and the fuel excise, they want to impose a jobs tax on Australians, they want to increase company taxes and they want to increase income taxes.The simple fact is that the Democrats and the Greens have got together with the Labor Party and said, `Lets increase taxes on Australians. All of this comes a little more than a year after the former Treasurer and now Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the present Treasurer (Mr Willis) and other members of the Labor frontbench went all around Australia arguing that, if the public voted Labor on 13 March, there would be no increases in tax.Now we know that not only were there increases in tax in last years budget but in this years budget there are going to be further increases in the tax burden on Australians. As far as we are concerned, the Democrats and the Greens have basically become the fourth and fifth factions of the Australian Labor Party. There is no difference between the Democrats and the Labor Party; they want to increase spending, they want to increase taxes—the tax and spend solution to every problem the country has—and spend more taxpayers money and whack up the burden of taxes.The simple formula is there for those three political parties but one thing that will become increasingly clear to Australians is that there are two political parties that will stand doggedly against tax increases. Those parties are the Liberal Party and the National Party. Our parties will not be part of this deal. We will not join the tax club. We will stay right out of it and we will stand by the millions of Australians who are sick of the deceit of the present government and sick of the constant increases in taxes that there have been in the 11 years that Labor has been in power. I will later outline how those taxes have increased.Let us have a look at what is happening now in the lead-up to this years budget. After last years budget, we had the former Treasurer telling this House that there really would not be any more need to increase taxes. The second great deception, the first being the election campaign, was set up—there will be no further increases in taxes after all. A few months passed and then we had ministers going out and deliberately leaking to newspapers plans to increase tax. We had other ministers going around saying they would not rule out increases in taxes in a range of different areas and then we had a bit of deception through the by-election season. In the end, when the budget comes, honourable members can be sure of one thing: Labor will be increasing tax.Let us have a look at the individual taxes that the government is proposing to increase, or the new taxes it is proposing. First of all, there is the Medicare levy. We had the rather unedifying spectacle of Senator Richardson leaking either directly or indirectly to the Australian a couple of weeks ago his proposal to increase the Medicare levy by some 40 per cent—from 1.4 per cent to two per cent. That is an absolutely massive increase in the Medicare levy.I am glad to see that today we have in the chamber, as usual, the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear)—the Treasurer holds the parliament in such contempt he eschews any debate in this place—because he will be able to comment in quite some detail on the issue of increasing the Medicare levy. Particularly Western Australian members will remember that, at the time of the last election, this man wanted to increase the Medicare levy to five per cent. The five per cent man! He should not shake his head, because it is absolutely catalogued in the West Australian and he spruiked it through radio programs all around Australia. He wanted to increase the Medicare levy to five per cent. His colleagues are going to help him on his way. His colleagues believe that 1.4 per cent is not nearly enough. If it is not going to be two per cent, as Senator Richardson is proposing, it is going to be some figure not much lower than that. Generally, the consensus is that it will be 1.6 per cent.Consider the weasel words of the Prime Minister in the lead-up to the by-elections that we have just had. When asked whether he would rule out an increase in the Medicare levy, it would have been easy for him to say, `Yes, I will rule it out. But he said, `No. I dont make statements like that. Today the Treasurer was asked questions about the Medicare levy and other taxes. When he was asked about the Medicare levy he also would not rule out an increase. So we can be sure of one thing in this years budget: there will be an increase in the Medicare levy.We come to the issue of the jobs tax. Members of the government have gone hot and cold on the jobs tax. First of all, there was great enthusiasm for it. Then ministers worried about its political consequences. More recently, it has become clear that the jobs tax is getting quite a good hearing in the cabinet. Suddenly, the government is becoming more enthusiastic about the jobs tax. For example, on 18 March the Australian reported that the Prime Minister had commented the previous day that the jobs tax was `still on the table. Of course it is still on the table, because what the government is planning to do in this years budget is to undertake massive increases in spending and those increases in spending have to be funded somehow.In the last couple of days the government has been given what might be called the green light on the jobs tax. Both the Australian Democrats and the Greens have agreed to that jobs tax. So I suppose there is a comfort zone in the Labor Party, in that it can increase the jobs tax with impunity in the Senate—it can pass it through the House of Representatives and the Senate. But the Australian community will never forgive this government if it increases the Medicare levy and imposes a jobs tax on top of the tax increases that there were at the time of the last budget.A jobs tax will not create jobs; it will destroy them. The net effect of taking all that retail spending out of the community and taking away those potential savings and that investment is that it will destroy jobs, not create them. It is the tired, old social democratic dogma, as it is called nowadays, that every time there is a problem money is thrown at it and taxes are increased. The government has created a massive problem in this country, particularly for the long-term unemployed. The only solution the government has is to increase spending still further from record levels and impose higher taxes. It is the only answer the Labor Party has. It is Australias tax and spend party—the tax and spend party with tax and spend solutions.Then there is the issue of the fuel excise. We had an increase in the fuel excise in the last budget. We had a further increase in the fuel excise on 1 February this year. We will get an additional increase in the fuel excise in August this year. That is already in legislation thanks to the support that the Greens and the Democrats gave the Labor Party to increase fuel taxes.The government is already considering increases in fuel excise over and above the increases that were brought down at the time of the last budget. There will be another new round of increases in the fuel excise. The way has already been paved by the Democrats and the Greens—the junior members of the tax club. They have already said, `Go ahead. They want the government to impose what they euphemistically describe as carbon taxes. At about page 6 of the Democrats document they say that a fuel excise should be imposed at $6.25 per tonne. Further in the document, the fuel excise is at $5 per kilogram, which would raise $50 billion. But I am sure the government will not go that far.The fact is that the government is planning to impose further fuel excise on Australians. The government now not only has carte blanche from the Democrats and the Greens to do that but also has the Kelty report which proposes that there should be increases in the fuel excise in order to finance some sort of regional development strategy. So it is perfectly clear that the government is proposing to find more and more excuses to increase that fuel excise.The final tax that it is quite clear the government is proposing to increase—it will not rule it out here today—is the tax on lump sum superannuation. At the moment there is what is called the retirement benefit limit of $400,000. That means that somebody can take a lump sum of $400,000 without paying tax on it. The government is clearly proposing to reduce that figure of $400,000 to about $50,000. In other words, the plan is to wipe out for most Australians the opportunity of getting that nest egg, their lump sum superannuation, which they would use to pay off their mortgages, car loans, Bankcard bills and so on.The lump sum is the one opportunity that battlers in Australia have to get out of debt when they reach retirement. The Labor Party is now planning to take that nest egg away from Australians. We will not be supporting that plan. The government will get no support from this side in the House of Representatives or the Senate. It will have to trot along to its mates in the tax club, the Democrats and the Greens, to get them to agree to this outrageous proposition.We have had 11 years of Labor government. Goodness knows—the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) would know—how many changes there have been to superannuation in those 11 years. How can we expect Australians to want to put their savings into superannuation when the government keeps changing the rules and is now proposing to whack up taxes on their lump sums? The simple fact—it is as clear as crystal—is that the government is floating the proposal through the media. When the Treasurer was asked whether he would rule out the imposition of this higher tax he refused to do so. All he could say was, `This was a report in a Sunday newspaper; thanks very much. But he refused to rule it out. It certainly was not a proposal that came from anyone in the Liberal Party, as the Treasurer tried to claim. This is a proposal that the Labor Party is refusing to rule out and is considering.The FitzGerald report on national savings—the Assistant Treasurer has probably never heard of it—puts forward this sort of proposal. The government has refused to respond to the FitzGerald report, even though at one stage it said that it would. That is because the government is considering this change to the tax arrangements for lump sums.The proposition is perfectly clear. Labor is the tax party and it has two new mates, the Democrats and the Greens—the fourth and fifth factions of the Australian Labor Party. The Labor Party has a record in government unequalled for increasing taxes on Australians. It has increased taxes by 25 per cent in real terms since it first came to power. This financial year its revenue will hit $100 billion for the first time in Australian history. This government will be the first government since Federation to raise $100 billion worth of revenue from Australians.That is the badge of shame that members of the government will wear right through to the next election. They are tax and spend merchants of the worst kind and they are deceitful because they hid that from Australians before the last election. They have been trying to hide it during the by-elections, but we will keep bringing this issue back to them to remind them of their deceit.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) honestly believes that he can make something come true by repeating it. He seems to believe that if he keeps saying often enough that this is the highest taxing government in Australias history it has to be true. But he did not mention that Australia is the lowest taxing country of the 24 OECD countries. We are the lowest taxing country when compared with countries that provide the same sorts of services as we do in areas of health, education, roads and defence.So we are the lowest taxing country in the OECD. That is something that the honourable member for Mayo cannot get his mind around. He will just go on with his rhetoric, honestly believing that if he says it often enough and long enough then it has to be true, because he keeps saying it. As members of the Liberal Party, including the honourable member for Mayo and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), make all these predictions, who is listening; who could care? We all remember during the last election when the Leader of the Opposition was talking about a double-dip recession. Then he got into depression, and then back into recession again. Of course, the economy has been growing for quite some time now. Last weeks figures show that the economy is growing at about four per cent. That is about as good as we will find in the OECD. What do we have today as a matter of public importance?","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

244,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr GEAR","QG4","(Canning-","ALP","Assistant Treasurer)",1837,"—About a year ago the honourable member for Mayo and all the others on the other side were out there advocating a 15 per cent goods and services tax. Here they are talking about a possibility that the Medicare levy may go up—and that is all it is; speculation—yet they were going to put a 15 per cent tax on everything; that is, on all goods and on all services. How is that for a tax? Those opposite were going to take $27 billion from Australians. They talk about our being a big-taxing government. They can talk all they like in here—they can repeat themselves and they can convince themselves—but in the end when they get out where it really matters, outside this parliament and outside Canberra, and they start addressing Australians about who they believe they can trust with taxation, they will find that it is the Australian Labor Party.Let us look at some of the things we have done while we have been in government. One would not know the taxation system now from the one we had 11 years ago. Eleven years ago it was said by a royal commissioner that the fastest growing industry in Australia was tax avoidance. The royal commissioner also said it was an option for the rich whether they paid any tax at all. That is the sort of tax system we inherited—one with loopholes and major holes in it everywhere, with the revenue not being collected. We have transformed that run-down system into a modern taxation system that Australians are proud of and can have confidence in.We have also expanded and broadened the tax base with a number of other measures, such as in the area of goldmining; in the life insurance business of friendly societies; in super fund incomes; and in lump sum benefits. We have made the taxation system more equitable by introducing a fringe benefits tax and a capital gains tax. Those of us who can remember the situation prior to the introduction of those reforms would know that people who received all of their income in cash paid tax on the whole lot of it. Salary packages were offered in the executive sector whereby part of the income was taken in cash—a small percentage in some cases—and tax was paid on it, but of course the majority of the remuneration was in fringe benefits on which no tax was paid.When we introduced that reform in the House, it was opposed by the Liberal opposition. We had to fight it to get that reform in. Similarly, we saw shameless electioneering against the capital gains tax. We have introduced that tax. It is a fair tax. It is part of the tax system. There is only one person in Australia who is talking about getting rid of it, and that is the potential leader of the Liberal Party, former Senator Bronwyn Bishop.By broadening the tax base in the way I have outlined, we have been able to drop taxation in Australia. We have dropped the top personal income tax rate from 60 per cent down to 47 per cent. More importantly, for people on low incomes we have dropped the bottom tax rate from 30c in the dollar down to 20c in the dollar. It does not end there. We have dropped the company tax rate from 46c down to 33c. We have also introduced dividend imputation to make sure that, when profits from companies are distributed, they do not get taxed twice, as used to happen under the former government. Of course, that has promoted investment in equity over speculation and has led Australia to become one of the countries with a fair taxation system, a taxation system in which the people of Australia have confidence.Also, for local Australians who invest in local industries that distribute their profits by way of franked dividends, the incentive now is to put them into activities like that, which actually produce goods and wealth for the country, rather than to put them into speculative activities, as used to happen under the former government. There is a different landscape altogether when we are talking about taxes. We have had 11 years of reform of the tax system, and today we have a taxation system that is second to none.I said at the outset that we do not hear much about proposals from those opposite, but there are a few from the last election which I think I should share with the House to remind us of some of the things they were going to do had they been elected to government. They talk about cuts in government spending. Here are a few rippers.Those opposite were going to abolish the CES. They would say to all of the people looking for jobs, `No CES for you. That would have saved them $160 million a year. They were going to cut $400 million from spending on the Commonwealth-state housing agreement; abolish funding for the urban public transport system, at a saving of $72 million; force unemployed people to run down all their liquid assets before providing them with jobsearch allowance, at a saving of $152 million; and cease paying the sole parent pension when the youngest child was 12. This is what the Liberal Party was going to do, yet those opposite are in here talking about us as if we did not care about the people in the community and all we cared about was raising taxes. As I have pointed out, we have the lowest taxes in the OECD, and we have one of the best social security systems and one of the best health insurance systems in the OECD—funded from those taxes.Unlike the opposition, the government understands the importance of Medicare to all Australians. Quality health care, we believe, is not the exclusive right of the rich. Under Fightback, health costs would have increased by at least $2 billion a year. It would have dramatically increased doctors fees and the cost of private basic hospital insurance but would have done nothing to improve access to health care. That was the oppositions proposal at the last election. To fund it, those opposite would have cut $1.2 billion from public hospitals.On TV last year, the honourable member for Mayo admitted that the dumping of the GST meant that the opposition could not get rid of the sales tax, payroll tax and the fuel excise without introducing a new tax. So what is its agenda? Here it is speculating about what we may or may not do. All we hear from that side of politics is silence. In the lead-up to the next election, those opposite will have to start telling us how they are going to do a few of these things and about their policy vacuum. Once they have settled the leadership problem, maybe they can start floating a few ideas about how they are going to raise taxes now that they have ruled out the goods and services tax. Finally, I turn to the governments fiscal strategy.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start[5]/para","N/A","N/A"

254,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr GEAR","QG4","(Canning-","ALP","Assistant Treasurer)",1837,"—No, I did not. That is totally untrue. The fiscal policy is set in a medium-term framework, which, while providing a short-term stimulus to support the recovery, is at the same time directed at increasing public savings over the medium term. The governments decision to adopt a medium-term deficit reduction strategy was motivated by a number of factors, including a credible fiscal consolidation program. We know that it is an essential part of the governments strategy to promote growth and, especially, investment. A continuation of the recent stronger economic growth requires a substantial pick-up in business investment. Such a pick-up is expected next year.I know that the opposition was happy to see the release, last Monday, of the Chamber of Manufactures survey, which highlighted the strong intentions of business to increase investment. In fact, confidence among manufacturers is now at its highest level in 30 years. Companies say that they are poised for a sharp lift in investment. To ensure that that investment eventuates, it is essential that business confidence continues to improve and, in particular, that business is confident that inflation and interest rates will be maintained at low levels.The deficit reduction strategy is essential to attaining these outcomes. Reducing our deficit will also bolster confidence in Australia as a place to lend to and invest in. It will overcome concerns about increasing debt, which would result in higher interest rates and lower investment. Fiscal policy also has an important role to play in raising national savings when national investment is growing.While a strong increase in corporate profits will help to finance this investment, it is imperative that the public sector make room for that expansion without requiring increased calls on overseas savings. The growth in government debt needs to be slowed so as to preserve future fiscal policy flexibility and limit the debt servicing burden on future taxpayer generations. This government called together all governments of Australia—state and territory governments—to agree to this national debt reduction strategy. This is the first time it has ever been done in Australias history.As the Treasurer (Mr Willis) recently explained, it was this governments fine fiscal record during the mid to late 1980s that made it possible for us to respond appropriately to the recession by way of providing substantial fiscal stimulus. In the last budget, that amounted to about $16 billion.This government turned our fiscal position around from a budget deficit of 4.1 per cent of GDP in 1983-84 to a surplus of 2.2 per cent of GDP in 1989-90. While the fiscal stimulus and the recession have resulted in higher levels of net government debt, Australia is in a very good position by international standards. As at June 1993, only three OECD countries had lower levels of net public debt to GDP than Australia. With a strengthening recovery, it is appropriate to wind back on the deficit as a proportion of GDP. This framework will provide a foundation for achieving sustainable and strong growth in activity and employment while at the same time having low inflation.Australia, within the OECD, is now in the low inflation league. We are among half a dozen countries with inflation rates below two per cent. One would have to go back 30 years to match that. Certainly nothing that ever eventuated under a Liberal government could ever come close to that.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start[9]/para","N/A","N/A"

257,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr NEHL","AE4","(Cowper)","NP","N/A",1841,"—Having heard the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) on this occasion and many other occasions and all his colleagues, I really wonder how those poor wretched people on the government benches can sleep at night. They could not even lie straight in bed because they are all bent up and crooked from flying kites. This government has perfected the art of kite flying. Before every budget comes along—it has done this for the last 11 years—the government starts flying kites.The Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) has said that the Medicare levy will rise to two per cent, which represents a 40 per cent increase. The whole community has said, `No, you cannot do that. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said, `No, we cannot do that. But a couple of days later, he said, `Perhaps there will be a slight rise.Kite flying is like sending somebody along to heavy a person. The first person says, `Im going to break both your arms and both your legs and then, after breaking only one leg, says, `Wasnt that wonderful? I broke only one leg. That is what the government has done with taxation time and again and that is what it will continue to do.I note that the Assistant Treasurer has already left the chamber. It is a pity, because he was pretty much an orphan while he spoke. But he did the usual thing that government members do: he did not really talk about what the government is going to do. He did not tell us anything about the new taxes and the increased taxes.The Assistant Treasurer floated the old notion about the Fightback policy last year. He selectively quoted. He said, `The opposition was going to put tax up by 15 per cent, but he forgot to say that, with a 15 per cent GST, we were going to abolish sales tax in toto. Labor has put it up, and it will put it up again. He did not say that we were going to totally abolish payroll tax. It still exists under Labor. He also did not say that we were going to totally abolish fuel tax, which is not only still there but has gone up and is going to go up again.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

The people of Australia know what the Prime Minister and the others said at the last election last year. They said to the people of Australia that there would be no tax increases and no new taxes. They also said to them, `You cannot trust the coalition because it will introduce a 15 per cent GST, without telling them about the seven taxes that were going to be abolished. There was again selective quoting. Government members said that there would be no new taxes and no increased taxes, but they have done nothing since that election but put up tax.As for the prospect of minor tax increases in the May budget, the Left has called for a substantial increase in tax for high income earners. The Left comprises the push-me, pull-you members of the Labor Party. On the Sunday program on 20 February this year, the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), said that the government had done most of what it wanted to do on the revenue side in the last budget. He also said, `We would not consider ourselves having too many options in that area. He told the Channel 9 program that it was not in the interests of the public or the economy to have further large increases in taxation.We should watch his lips, because when this budget is brought down we will remind the honourable member that he said the government had done most of what it wanted to do on the revenue side in the last budget and that it is not in the interests of the public or the economy to have further large increases in taxation. He will read these words and weep when the budget comes in.Look at the governments tax record since the 1993 election. Government members said, `There will be no tax increases and no new taxes. What happened to the workers of this country—the ordinary Australians or so-called `true believers, as the Prime Minister calls them—in the last budget? Following the promises of no new taxes or no tax increases, petrol went up by 3c per litre on 18 August 1993. Leaded petrol went up another 2c per litre on 1 February, and it will go up again another 2c per litre on 1 August. That is three increases.Mr Kelty is the darling of the blue-collar set, if it still exists; I do not believe that it does. We have ordinary Australians who are keen to survive. They want to get an income for themselves and their families. They want to get off the dole, they want to work and they want dignity. I hope that something comes of the marvellous regional development plan, particularly since Mr Keltys committee recommended more money for the Pacific highway. That is one recommendation that I would like to see implemented, but I will believe it when I see it. Mr Kelty has also proposed an additional fuel tax of 5c per litre to finance regional development. Talk about slugging the motorist.Then of course there is the increased tax on long service leave, which is now taxed at the full marginal rate—for men and women who have worked hard for 10 or 15 years and accrued annual leave. Where is the fairness? Where is the justice? There is to be a tax on separation packages. That is great if people get the sack, if they get retrenched, or if they are taking early retirement because of redundancy! On 1 July 1994 that tax will rise from 2 1/2 per cent to 31.4 per cent, and there is the possibility for people on a higher rate to face a rate of 48.4 per cent. The government has increased the tax on wine. Wine is one of the growth industries of this country; an industry that really could have done without being slugged by more taxation.There is a tax on credit unions. Again, I make the point that it impacts on ordinary Australians. It is workers, it is people who desperately want to work—the unemployed—who use credit unions. What did this government do? It taxed the credit unions. Sales tax went up on everything. The government has the appalling hide to talk to us about a GST when it has increased its sales tax on absolutely everything. It will deny that, and I am sure the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan) will get up in a moment and talk about Medicare. He will not be telling the truth either because those on the other side have selective memories.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

That is what the people he represents expect from him. So I ask the honourable member for Lilley to tell the truth—it will be the first time in a long while. Again, I said there should be no tax increases. What is going to happen? What is the government actually looking at? The government is right now considering increasing the income tax rates and changing the tax free threshold. It is going to increase the Medicare levy and it is looking at taxes on superannuation. It is going to increase the direct taxes on commerce and industry, such as company tax and fringe benefits tax. These are all the options that it is considering.Increased sales tax is coming—increased sales tax perhaps on assets which do not attract stamp duty—and, in a form of hidden taxation, the government is going to demand that government instrumentalities increase their dividends back to government beyond normal commercial rates of return. We in the coalition believe that no new taxes should be introduced, because the government has increased taxation already. But it is looking at a jobs levy. We see one headline that says `No jobs levy and then in another article somebody else from the Labor Party has a different view. It is all part of that kite flying and `I am going to break your left leg—that is all act.The government has lost the plot when it comes to a jobs levy; it has lost the plot when it comes to unemployment. Jobs are not created by training people. Jobs are created by giving businesses and farmers a go—so take taxes off them; do not impose more taxation on them. The way to get this country going again is not by increasing taxation in the way that this Labor government is going to do in the budget on 10 May—mark my words. On 10 May we will see increases in taxation. We will probably see new taxes as well. For businesses to become profitable and competitive both domestically and internationally they really need to be given a go. It is then that they can create jobs; it is then that they can employ people. That is the only way we are going to get job creation. We can have all the schemes under the sun that train people but they do not create a single job.

267,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr SWAN","2V5","(Lilley)","ALP","N/A",1843,"—The fist tax policy was the honourable member for Bennelongs tax policy, which plundered ordinary wage and salary earners and made tax optional for the rich, so that all of the burden during those years was thrown back onto average wage and salary earners. It was a tax policy that gave to the rich and took away from average families. Its legacy was extremely high marginal tax rates—a minimum of 30c in the dollar and a maximum of 60c in the dollar. They are rates which have of course been slashed by this government.The second tax policy was Fightback. Fightback—for those people over there on my right—would have made 60 per cent of self-employed people in this community worse off and 70 per cent of wage and salary earners worse off. There is one theme which links those two approaches to taxation that have come from the coalition: to plunder ordinary people in this community by making tax optional for the rich and making average wage and salary earners in this community carry the burden. It has been a theme of unfairness that has gone through every aspect of the policies that the coalition has put around.When the community had the chance to judge the fairness of the opposing packages—the package that we took to the people at the last election and the package that the opposition took to the people at the last election—Fightback was the one the Australian people all stood up and held their noses at. They could not stand the stench. They could not stand the stench of a 15 per cent GST on all of the goods and services that people have to consume. The coalition had a $23 billion tax grab in Fightback—15 per cent on all those essential items. Of course, Fightback put the coalition where it rightly belongs: on the conservative side of politics. It took the Liberal and National parties right back to their philosophical base—high taxes on ordinary people and low taxes, or no taxes, for the very well-to-do in the community.Those opposite come into this House and talk about a tax and spend policy. They have a tax, bash and trash policy. Their tax policy is to get out there and bash ordinary income earners—be they small farmers, blue-collar workers or white-collar workers—and make tax optional for the well-to-do in the community. It is a tax, bash and trash policy. When people in the Australian community had a chance to look at the rival packages, they held their noses because they simply could not stand the stench, the rank unfairness, of the coalitions Fightback policy which, after all, was only harking back to the policy that the honourable member for Bennelong had implemented in the 1970s—the policy that made tax optional for the rich.At every stage of the tax reform process that has taken place in this community in the 1980s, where have the Liberal and National parties been? They have been opposing tax reform. They have been opposing all of the measures that we have brought in to bring some fairness to taxation in this community and to make sure that everyone in the community pays his or her fair share. They opposed the capital gains tax. They continue to oppose the capital gains tax. They opposed the fringe benefits tax. They opposed the end to the business lunch and all the other rorts that made tax optional in this community. That is why when we are talking about the tax record of the Liberal and National parties I say that they have a tax, bash and trash policy. It is a policy which we will continue to tell the community about because it will go to core values. Labor has a core value in its tax policy; it is one of fairness. The opposition has a core value in its tax policy of unfairness, so it only follows that one principle in tax.As the coalition has now professed to have trashed Fightback—although I will talk about that later on—let us examine what particular policies it has. We have had the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), in here today talking about what the government may do in the budget. He will find out what we are going to do in the budget, but today we can talk about what the opposition has said and what we have said about taxation. I would like to start with what former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser has had to say about the approach of the Liberal and National parties. This is what he said in a recent article in the Australian :The Liberal Party is in deeper trouble than at any time since its formation.I know the National Party agrees with that, by the way. He continues:Through 1991 and 1992 it tried to force Australians in directions they did not want to go.That is dead right. He went on:Twelve months since the loss of the March 1993 election, we are as much in the dark about what the party stands for as we were the day Fightback was buried.So what does the opposition stand for on taxation if it does not stand for Fightback? He goes on:John Hewson has told us that he has the numbers. If there are real contenders, he could call on them to put up or shut up and give the party a vote.They have been putting up right around the country in recent times. The honourable member for Bennelong has had a few things to say about the positions that have been adopted by other leadership aspirants in the coalition. This is what the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) had to say about the professed views of the honourable member for Bennelong on family policy:I mean narrow the party back and have nothing to do with this group or that group. If it did it would be irrelevant in about 6 months flat and the Labor party will laugh themselves stupid that you have such an incredible misunderstanding of the nature and basic values of the people of Australia.Where does the opposition stand on taxation and family policy? The policy put forward by the honourable member for Bennelong was repudiated by the Leader of the Opposition.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

He is not really a man of the people because he believes that the tax regime we should have in this country should be equivalent to that which applies to our Asian neighbours. He also believes that we should provide a level of services equivalent to what should apply to our Asian neighbours.If we were to cut revenue to the tune of $10 billion to $20 billion a year, what will the opposition cut? What will the honourable member for Downer tell all of those people on the back bench over there, from whom he is angling for a vote in a forthcoming leadership tussle, what he is going to cut?

He will back away from that at a rate of knots because it is such an embarrassment to him and the Liberal Party that someone who now professes to be a contender for the leadership of that party could seriously argue that we should have Asian levels of taxation in this country to be followed by Asian levels of services.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start[4]/para","N/A","N/A"

289,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr LES SCOTT","8J4","(Oxley)","ALP","N/A",1846,"—by leave— Report 330—Review of Auditor-Generals reports, May 1991-September 1992 details the committees review of 72 audit reports. The review was conducted in accordance with the Public Accounts Committee Act 1951, which requires the committee to examine all reports of the Auditor-General.As well as representing the fulfilment of a statutory obligation, the review on which this report is based has given the committee an opportunity to re-visit a series of audits which had been conducted some years ago. With the perspective of time, the committee has been able to identify issues which have not, in the intervening years, been properly addressed by the audited agency.The committee has not canvassed in detail all of the issues raised in the audit reports. To have done so would have gone over ground already well covered by the Auditor-General and would have delayed considerably the tabling of this report. Instead, the committee has focused on the recommendations contained in the audit reports. We have surveyed and checked the responses given by each of the audited agencies.In the vast majority of cases the audited agencies have agreed with the recommendations contained in the audit reports and have taken appropriate, timely and effective remedial action. In these cases the committee has made no comment. The committee has commented only in those cases where the agency response has been inappropriate, tardy or ineffective. Most of the recommendations, therefore, are aimed at encouraging agencies to complete actions taken in response to a particular audit report.However, I wish to draw attention to two recommendations which have wider implications. The first concerns internal audit. The Auditor-General had recommended that the Department of Finance should develop better in-house knowledge and expertise in the area of internal audit so that it could help to improve standards in public sector internal auditing. The Department of Finance disagrees, maintaining that in a devolved environment it is inappropriate for it to have a broad role in assisting agencies to develop expertise in internal audit. The committee supports the view expressed by the Auditor-General and has recommended that the Department of Finance take a broader and more active role in improving internal audit standards in Commonwealth agencies. The committee believes this role fits squarely with Finances policy and program responsibilities.A second recommendation I wish to draw attention to concerns the mandate of the Auditor-General. The committee notes that the Auditor-General has for some time sought to have himself appointed as the auditor for ANUTECH, a wholly owned subsidiary company of the ANU. This is consistent with recommendations contained in the committees Report 296, The Auditor-General: Ally of the people and parliament , which called for the Auditor-General to be the auditor for all statutory authorities, government owned companies and government business enterprises. Moreover, in December 1990, the government announced its agreement to this principle.The committee endorses the Auditor-Generals view that full public accountability to the Parliament of ANUTECH is not assured under the current auditing arrangements. Accordingly, we have recommended that the Auditor-General be appointed as ANUTECHs auditor.Although Report 330 is necessarily brief in the consideration it gives to the audit reports, the process of checking agency responses has been valuable in itself. Many agencies have been required to report to the committee, in some cases more than once, on their progress in implementing the Auditor-Generals recommendations.The committee regards its review of reports of the Auditor-General as an important part of its work and intends to table the results of its examinations on a regular basis. On occasions this will result in compilation reports, such as Report 330 , but on other occasions the committee will review and report on individual audit reports. In addition to this statutory review process, the House of Representatives has, over the last decade, developed the practice of referring some audit reports to its standing committees and to certain joint committees.The committee acknowledges that the referral of some audit reports to other committees is appropriate in some circumstances—for example, where an audit report is relevant to a subject already being considered by another committee or where an audit report deals with an issue in which another committee has developed a particular expertise. However, the requirement to review described in the Public Accounts Committee Act is not satisfied by the referral of an audit report to another committee. It is the committees intention to examine all reports by the Auditor-General which are tabled in the parliament.Although the committee is conscious of the need to avoid unnecessary duplication, it will examine audit reports which have been referred to other committees. It is anticipated that, at times, this examination will show that another committee has reviewed or is reviewing the major issues identified in the audit report. At other times, the committee may decide that further review is needed. The reports of the Auditor-General make an essential contribution to parliamentary and public scrutiny of the executive. Report 330 will remind agencies that the process of scrutiny continues beyond the tabling of an audit report.As honourable members will be aware, there has been some heated debate recently about the need to strengthen the mandate of the Auditor-General and take steps to ensure his independence from the executive. I welcome this debate and remind the House that these issues have been of interest to the JCPA. Indeed, they were at the heart of the committees Report 296 , which was tabled in March 1989. I urge the government to take advantage of the present opportunity to incorporate in its proposed financial management and audit legislation those recommendations from Report 296 which it had previously rejected.On behalf of the committee, I thank the secretariat for its work on the review. I also acknowledge the contribution made by other officers from the House of Representatives who helped in the initial analysis of the 72 audit reports reviewed in Report 330 . Finally, I acknowledge the Australian National Audit Office for its assistance during this review, and, of course, without it this review would not be possible. I commend this report to the House.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1[1]/debate.sub2/speech/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

291,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr HOLLIS","DH4","(Throsby)","ALP","N/A",1847,"—by leave—The report which I have tabled deals with technical training and other facilities at HMAS Cerberus , Western Port, Victoria. HMAS Cerberus is the major training establishment for the Royal Australian Navy and is located on Western Port Bay, Victoria, some 60 kilometres south east of Melbourne.The 1991 Defence Force structure review, endorsed by the Commonwealth government, foreshadowed the closure and transfer of the technical training establishment at HMAS Nirimba , west of Sydney. At the invitation of the honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman), the committee inspected the Army College of TAFE at Bonegilla, which was one of the alternative locations considered for training by the Department of Defence. Although impressed by the facilities at Bonegilla, the committee concurs with the decision made by the Department of Defence, following a survey conducted for it by Kinhill Engineers, to transfer technical training to HMAS Cerberus .The transfer of technical training from HMAS Nirimba to HMAS Cerberus necessitates the provision of additional facilities to enable effective training to continue. Existing facilities and services at HMAS Cerberus date back to the early 1920s. However, a number of facilities are more modern or have been upgraded. This proposal provides for technical training facilities, replacement of those facilities where upgrading is not economical, expansion of facilities unable to cope with increased demand, and new facilities for services operating from temporary and inadequate accommodation. The scope of the work provides for continuous functioning of the base throughout the construction period and includes a health centre, technical training classrooms and workshops, indoor swimming pool, gymnasium extension, motor transport compound and engineering services.The committee viewed the medical and dental services which are presently provided from 18 separate buildings. The majority of these buildings are being utilised for functions for which they were neither originally designed nor adequately constructed. The committee agrees with a comment made by the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, when, at a Senate Estimates committee hearing in September 1991, he described the facility as the `most disgraceful Defence facility I have seen in Australia. The committee commends the personnel at HMAS Cerberus for working under such trying conditions.The question of waste water management was raised by the committee at the public hearing, and the Department of Defence gave the committee a verbal undertaking to carry out a study of the potential for the re-use of waste water at HMAS Cerberus . The committee, therefore, recommended in its report that such a survey be carried out. However, last Friday the committee received a report on recycling of second-class water, which has been carried out by Kinhill Engineers for the Department of Defence.This report concluded that the cost of developing and operating recycled water irrigation systems is high, and the implementation of such schemes will not result in an overall cost saving through the reduction of relatively small volumes of first-class water. The committee commends the Department of Defence for speedily taking action on its recommendation and assures it that the committee will study the report in detail.The committee commends the Department of Defence on the regular energy audits of its establishments and recommends that it be advised on the implementation of the recommendations of the energy audit recently conducted at HMAS Cerberus . The estimated cost of the technical training and other facilities at HMAS Cerberus is $45.5 million at April 1993 prices. I commend the report to the House.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1[2]/debate.sub2/speech/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

293,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr ATKINSON","IT4","(Isaacs)","LP","N/A",1848,"—I did not intend to speak on this particular issue, but prior to question time I listened to some of the comments made by the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) and had some discussions with the shadow minister for foreign affairs regarding those comments. We were in agreement that we should dissociate ourselves from a number of the comments he made in relation to a number of our neighbours, in the Asia-Pacific region in particular. I wish to address some areas that he raised and follow up with some other comments.One of the things I always find fascinating is the number of people who come in here and talk about their support for and active involvement in defence. They seem somehow to be saying, `We were opposed to the Vietnam war but, that aside, we understand all of what our people in the forces have been doing and where they have been headed.In that context I just remind the House that there are three returned servicemen in the two houses of parliament. This is something that concerns me a little these days, although I must confess that those of the vintage of the Second World War are probably of an age where they cannot now be expected to be members of this House. But it does concern me that more people who have been actively involved are not members of this House. Of course, the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) and I are returned servicemen from the Vietnam conflict. In that context I think there is something that we can contribute to the Strategic review which has been put forward.I note the point made in the preface by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) that this is an ongoing review. He points out that it requires the understanding, involvement and support of all Australian people. I concur with that because in any aspect of the defence of this country we must seek to involve and gain the support of all the people in our country to ensure that we are able to present things in the appropriate way.A number of areas mentioned by the honourable member for Gilmore need to be clarified. He went into a number of aspects of our neighbours activities. He raised the issue of East Timor and the issue of the CIA. Quite clearly, in looking at a strategic review, those are not areas with which we should be involved. We should—as the document does—look at the implications of what occurs on a regional basis, and on a global basis these days, and relate that back to what we in this country can do and should do in relation to our defence. The document has addressed that fairly well, although I have to say that, even though we are looking in strategic terms, I am concerned that there appears in many instances to be a lot of rhetoric, and I suspect that behind that rhetoric a lot of work needs to be done on detail.As is mentioned in the review, our security organisations need to relate well with those of other countries, particularly the US. But the review has not looked at the organisation of the security organisations in our country, which I suspect should be looked at. We should be talking about a structured interchange of information between those organisations. That is not mentioned. From my understanding of what is occurring in that area, we should be ensuring the interchange and a passage of information, and maybe a change of command, in the way that that intelligence information is handled.We need to look at our relationship with India. After all, India has been expanding its naval force substantially and I believe there is a need for us to look at stronger relationships with India and to work on the good neighbours principle in building better relationships. In fact this is raised in a number of parts of the document, as is our involvement on a foreign affairs level in trying to establish roles in peacekeeping. Our relationships with these countries are very important.The defence forces of our country have done a great job in building relationships at an officer to officer level between nations. We have had over many years training arrangements between forces in the region. This is not something that has crept in recently. It is something that we should persist with to ensure that our younger training officers, and indeed some of our more technical people, have the opportunity to meet others in training courses. A number of people who trained with me in my early days at Portsea now happen to be senior officers in forces overseas. Although they are not ongoing relationships, I have been able to build up relationships with them and on the odd occasions do have an opportunity to touch base with those people. From a defence point of view that is important in this region. Our region is a lot more stable than others around the world and we should be doing everything possible to build on that stability and make sure that that type of discussion continues to occur.One thing that surprises me a little from having read the document is that, whilst it has addressed the United Nations and some of its aspects, it has not looked at the United Nations protocols. Even from a strategic point of view, I think it is important to look at their implications for Australia and at the countries in our region that have and have not signed those protocols. I know that in February 1991 we debated two protocols. I still have concerns about our having dealt with them in the way we did. Article 82 of the protocol regarding rules of engagement states:The High Contracting Parties at all times, and the Parties to the conflict in time of armed conflict, shall ensure that legal advisers are available, when necessary, to advise military commanders at the appropriate level on the application of the Conventions and this Protocol and on the appropriate instruction to be given to the armed forces on this subject.What it really says is that legal advice needs to be sought in areas in which military personnel can take action. That worries me a great deal. In fact it worried me at that stage and I was assured at that time by the honourable member for Kingston (Mr Bilney) that the defence forces had been consulted. In fact he said:. . . the conclusion that we have come to, as reflected in my remarks, is based squarely on advice from our defence advisers, the Chief of the Defence Force and those in the headquarters of the ADF. That advice is that our national interest is best served by ratifying these protocols and that there is no question that we will be able to continue to operate effectively within the constraints which these protocols impose.I have to say that a number of senior officers in the Defence Force today would have concerns about how that legal application would work, and had questions at the time as to how those protocols would operate. So I just raise the point that, when we are looking at a strategic review and at what we intend to do with our defence forces in the future, we should address as a major factor the signing of arrangements with other countries and the signing of United Nations arrangements. I have not been able to find anything about this in this document. It should be in this document as a principle of how these issues should be dealt with. In many areas we have been involved in the signing of protocols and arrangements before full scrutiny has been applied to them. I suspect that, if the issue is not raised, that type of approach will continue in the future.It is also important that we recognise that there are areas of, one could say, skirmish within our region. The Bougainville issue needs urgent attention to be dealt with. We need to keep an eye on other areas. Our forces have put in a considerable effort in peacekeeping activities in Cambodia, for which I commend them. I suspect that our forces will be involved in that type of role on an ongoing basis in the future. Certainly the review indicates that that is the intention.We need to keep an eye on Burma and the types of problems that occur there. Even though I served in Vietnam with the forces which were opposed to the government structure in place there, certainly on a personal basis I have no animosity towards the Vietnamese. I find it gratifying to see that they are now seeking closer links with ASEAN countries and that there is the opportunity to build an economic base in that country which will enable them to feel part of the region. The area I still have a great deal of concern for is North Korea and where it is headed with its nuclear arrangements. I probably would agree with the comments which were made by the honourable member for Gilmore with respect to the problems there. Certainly I would totally disagree with the other aspects of his comments.Within all of this we need to ensure that the morale of our forces is built up; judging from the people I have spoken to, at the moment it is not at the highest of levels in many areas. We need to recognise also that many of our forces have not had the opportunity to see active service—not that I want them to see active service, but it is important that we give them opportunities at least to see and be involved in peacekeeping and those types of activities so that we have a well and capably trained force for the occasions it is needed. I certainly do not want to see us slip into a situation—although there have been signs of this from time to time—such as we had in past conflicts, where we were not well geared to commit troops to the types of areas that we committed them to.I am reminded that, when during the Second World War we sent forces to Malaysia, we had to develop pamphlets on the fighting of jungle type warfare. That had to be done on the run because, in our strategic planning, we had not thought about the possibility of our forces having to fight in jungle type situations. So I am conscious of that and just hope that the ongoing activities of strategic review make people recognise the implications in the ever and more rapidly changing world and, if we like, defence situation that we find ourselves in. I hope the point I make about those soldiers who fought in the Second World War will be noted. Whilst I think the principles of the content of the Strategic review are good, I am concerned, as I have said, at some of the areas which I see as rhetoric. What I have observed behind them is not necessarily in keeping with what is provided for under the Strategic review .","N/A","MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
294,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr CAMPBELL","CF4","(Kalgoorlie)","ALP","N/A",1851,"—There was very little in what I heard of the speech of the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson) with which I would disagree. I want go back to the philosophy of this paper, the Strategic review . I am reminded very much of that famous and very prolific Greek poet, `Anonymous when he said, `By all the dodos those are words of weight—eminent, wise and out of date. I think that really underlines a lot of what I would call posturing in this defence paper.It seems to me that we have to make some very basic analyses. The paper says that Australia is not easy to defend. I would say to the contrary: Australia is easy to defend. Federation at the time of our founding fathers was fought and won on the basis of `a nation for a continent: a continent for a nation. While we keep that inviolate, this country is relatively easy to defend, and this should never be forgotten.We also have to look at big powers in the world. I have heard people in todays debate belittle the United States. I think it is wrong and churlish to do so, for the United States of America is no different from any other big power. On the one hand, big powers will always look after what they perceive to be their short-term strategic advantage. The fact that their judgment is often awry is beside the point; they are endeavouring to look after their short-term advantage. On the other hand, medium sized powers will pontificate about what is right and proper. I think Australia often falls into that category. We should never lose sight of the fact that, in the final analysis, major powers will always do what suits them and they will wear any international criticism if it eventuates.The paper, as we read it, finds no threat to Australia. However, threats to Australia could develop very quickly. They could develop from areas which we have not even considered at the moment. I think it is a very dangerous thing to assume that there is no threat to Australia. I can think of several areas not mentioned here—and the honourable member for Isaacs mentioned India and instability in Africa. There will be massive instability in the continent of Africa and India could quite easily be tempted into some military incursion into Africa. I am sure that there are many people in India who could justify that.We have to realise that the greatest threat to Australia comes not from without but from within. In Australia it is the enemy within of which we have to be very wary. If in this country we develop apathy, indolence and the attitude that there is no risk, then I can assure honourable members that the risk will eventuate. The honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) said he has two children whom he does not wish to see fight. I certainly do not wish war on anyone. But I too have two sons and I hope that my children would be prepared to fight to defend Australia.There are two ways of looking at Australias future. We can make Australia a land so open to everyone that there is nothing here that anyone needs to be jealous of because they can come and get it if they want it. We hear talk of making us part of Asia, making us part of a more or less wider system of government. I totally reject this. We can have an Australia which is so clearly superior in living standards to other countries that other countries will be jealous of us and will envy us. Frankly, this is the Australia I want: a country which stands out in the world as an example. If we were to have that sort of a country, we would have to be prepared to defend it because if we were to have that sort of a country, believe me, somebody would want to take it from us. Although my two sons are now old enough to make their own decisions, I certainly hope that they would be prepared to defend this country.I now turn to the policy of multiculturalism. This policy has been foisted on Australia by successive governments. I believe that Australians, if given the chance, would vote overwhelmingly to reject this policy. They would say to migrants, `Youre welcome here provided your commitment is to Australia and you integrate into the Australian ethos. I do not think that is an unreasonable position at all. I believe that multiculturalism is turning this country into a nation of tribes. If that is allowed to happen, we will surely fall prey to somebody with unity and organisation.I am very serious about this. I think the recent by-election has, or should have, signalled to major parties—unfortunately, the major parties show no signs of accepting the lesson—that the community at large is disconcerted by the policies presently being pursued by both parties on immigration and multiculturalism and would like to see a change. I think the coming by-elections in Warringah and Mackellar will reinforce this. A government and opposition which ignore this message do so at their own peril. In reinforcing this point, I would like to quote from a poem by Dame Mary Gilmore, who is very famous and, justifiably, an icon of the Labor Party. She wrote:I have grown past hate and bitternessI see the world as oneYet though I can no longer hate my son is still my sonAll men at Gods round table sitAnd all men must be fedBut this loaf in my hand this loaf is my sons bread.When I quoted this poem on a talkback radio program in Perth the woman who was the host of the program said to me, `That is the most racist comment I have ever heard in my life. Frankly, I see nothing racist about it. Those who know of Mary Gilmore would realise that there was not a racist bone in the womans body. The poem was valid when she wrote it and it is equally valid today. We have to look at Australias interests. There is no selfishness in this—no more selfishness than that which is needed for self-preservation. That is the duty of every government and every citizen of this nation. It is a policy which will lead to our survival. If we run counter to that policy, we will simply not survive as a country—the nation of people as we know ourselves today.Chapter 5 of Strategic review 1993 is entitled `Australias Defence Posture. I think `posture is a good word because the review is full of posturing. If we are to be serious about Australias defence, we have to look at Australias industrial capacity. It is quite clear that, without the ability to be self-sufficient, we are vulnerable. If there is a conflict, we cannot be sure that we will have the necessary resources.We came out of the last world war with the capacity to build aeroplanes. We were building some aeroplanes better than anyone else in the world was building them. That would certainly be true of the Beaufighters that we built. Today we produce none. There was a time when Australia produced a lot of diesel engines. Today we produce none.Several years ago the army purchased some French trucks for off-road purposes. It bought a fleet of Mack trucks. The army was told at the time by various people who were versed in these things that the suspensions in the Mack trucks were probably not suited to off-road conditions in Australia. That has proved to be true. The army has therefore moved to replace those suspensions with air suspensions which are much more suitable for rough terrain.Because I was talking to the company concerned the other day, I happen to know that it was approached by the army and it offered to fit Permatrak suspensions to the trucks at $16,000 each. The army demanded that the company comply with all sorts of tender complications and the company said that was frankly beyond it. The army ended up buying an inferior suspension from the United States for $20,000 each. With over 1,000 units required, the total cost was $4 million. I suppose that $4 million is not much if you say it quickly and that it could be written off. But I have a letter from the army saying that its policy is to buy commercially wherever it can. It could have gone out and talked to industry and found out that Permatrak—which invented air suspensions—is well regarded not only in Australia but throughout the world. To people in Australia, Permatrak is the preferred commercial solution. It is good enough for people in commerce, but apparently it is not good enough for the army.I am further aggrieved because the army recently put out a tender for a quantity of 2 1/2-tonne trucks. It did not ask the only Australian manufacturer of those trucks to tender. When I drew this to the armys attention I got the usual blustering. It said that the Australian trucks did not meet specifications. I pointed out that the Oka, the Australian made vehicle, was a 2 1/2-tonne vehicle and that, in reality, if the Japanese truck was a 2 1/2-tonne truck, the Oka was a five-tonne truck and so much better constructed.The army assured me it was to call another tender, which it did, for 68 units. It then replied and said that it had looked at the Australian tender but that, frankly, the vehicle was overengineered, was far too good for the armys needs and its requirements were only for the army reserve. That was a rather backward looking view from the army. It went on to say that the units were $13,000 more expensive. There was no thought of going back to the company and saying, `You are overengineered. How much will you charge if we do not have these options?—things which the mining industry requires but which the army thinks it does not need. That did not happen. Once more, the army simply gave the order to the Japanese company. No consideration was given in that instance to how much more the Australian made vehicle would fetch at resale.At least government departments should be able to look at the through-life cost of this equipment, not just at the capital purchase cost. Capital purchase costs have got us into trouble again and again and again. Foreign companies can cut the price to get the business, knowing that they can make up their profits on the sale of parts over time. I could give the House chapter and verse on that sort of thing.If we are genuine about the defence of Australia, we need to build up this capacity, to create jobs for Australians in the future. It should be realised that, if we do not have a rising standard of living and if we do not have an equitable distribution of wealth in this country, it could and will be argued by many people that the country is perhaps not worth defending and the heart and the will to defend the nation will disappear. It is very important that we strive for and achieve this equal distribution of wealth and jobs for the future. In reality, there will be no jobs in the future unless government and opposition develop a sensible industry policy.We are being preached to by both political parties about the level playing field. Mr Deputy Speaker, I can assure you that the level playing field is a flat earth policy. Nobody else in the world plays on this nonsensical, idyllic situation. They do not because it simply does not exist.There was great celebration in Australia when the GATT round was recently signed. I made the observation then, and I make it again now, that the minute it was signed the signatories to it set about finding ways around the obligations which they had signed. We have seen that happening and we should not be surprised by it. We are told that all that is needed is the opening up of free trade throughout the world. I can assure honourable members that, if tomorrow the United States were to achieve total access to the Japanese market, if we were to sweep away from Japan all protection that now exists, the increase in sales to Japan from the United States would probably be less than $10 billion a year—a mere thimbleful compared with the great deficit the United States is running. The Japanese will continue to buy the Japanese product because of the ethos that exists in that country. Until we can develop that ethos in Australia and have the material for Australians to buy, the defence of this country will be very suspect. The Strategic review 1993 does not even begin to look at that question.","N/A","MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
295,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr MOORE","EI4","(Ryan)","LP","N/A",1854,"—I had not intended to participate in the debate on the Strategic review 1993 document. But this debate is well overdue in the parliament of Australia, for defence is an area where all governments have a huge responsibility to their population. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) always puts forward some very interesting views, which must be in contrast to those of some of his cohorts in the party room. What he just had to say had a ring of truth to it.The nation should take some interest in the debate on the Strategic review . This is a period of enormous change in which we have moved from a bi-polar world to a multi-polar world. We have moved from a world where global issues predominated to a world where regional and national issues predominate. We have moved from super power defences where we could shelter with the Americans and NATO countries to a period of self-defence. We have moved from some degree of certainty in our defence threats to an area of uncertainty and unpredictability.Not only is there the uncertainty of what might happen in foreign relations in this region—our relations with other countries—but also there is a great deal of uncertainty as to who our allies would be in any sort of military conflict. That becomes very important with respect to logistic support, munitions, equipment and things that we need. I will speak later about the industry capacity of Australia under a defence threat.The development of these new imperatives on which the nation of Australia lives means that we must address the problems of defence in what I regard as a logical process. Funding of a defence strategy or position in a democracy will never be easy in times of perceived peace and where the apparent conflict has disappeared with the end of the Cold War, but at the same time the legacy of a lot of the old alliances will tend to fade away.We have seen in this place some new negotiations of treaties; but, more importantly, the biggest development in the last few years has been the United Nations stepping in to play a role which was previously unheard of, which was unthought of and which it certainly was unprepared for. In the last two years we have seen a number of cases which involved major steps taken under the umbrella of the United Nations asking for member nations to contribute personnel and equipment to combat the threat to world peace. This happened mainly in local areas, such as in the Persian Gulf War where the United Nations acted and put down what appeared to be at the time a major problem for the world.The United Nations has gone from that area into areas of famine, for example in Somalia; and civil war, such as in Cambodia, where the country was under real threat from civil war. The nations of the world dictated through the UNO that something should be done to bring peace and democracy to that country, and this took place.When I glance through the review I am not sure that a lot of those areas have been answered. The question of what we intend to contribute to the United Nations in the future has been glossed over. Will the United Nations develop a command structure to enable it to meet the commitments and requirements that will be placed upon it in the future? Will we place at the service of the United Nations such people as General Sanderson, who led the command in Cambodia under very difficult circumstances and, I think, acquitted that position remarkably well? The experience he obtained in that operation ought to be made available to the United Nations by seconding him as an adviser or by facilitating that by appointing him to a Washington post or a New York post where he could be closely associated with the development of the peacekeeping roles of the United Nations in future and establish some form of command structure for the future.This will, of course, necessarily cause some concern within the defence forces at home because they have to make training allowances to fit into this new role of meeting regional and international demands. They have to also assess whether we can realistically afford to have a wide sweep of our personnel at the beck and call of the United Nations to serve in areas which conflict with our perceived national interest. As a consequence, a lot of thought ought to be given in the future as to how we meet our commitments in the United Nations.I fully support what has happened to date, but there is every potential for these difficulties to arise. I would like to see these difficulties met by a method which would not conflict with our particular areas. I refer in particular to the goings-on in the former Yugoslavia. It is fairly well known that the United Nations has sought from us some commitment of troops to that area. This would bring into very real question the national interest in that case, bearing in mind the volatility of some of the ethnic groups that are associated with those particular areas. I think those are matters which have to be considered greatly as they relate to the role of the United Nations.Chapter two of the paper refers to the north-east Asian developments and what our role should be there. It also deals with the south-west Pacific area, which is our natural area of interest, where we have some very pressing problems. Firstly, we should address what our future relationships should be with New Zealanders in relation to their defence posture. Currently they spend a very small amount of their GDP on defence. In fact, if we speak to any of the personnel involved in New Zealand defence areas we will rapidly hear that they have not got the real commitment that is necessary. Does Australia in the future take a line of protecting the smaller nation of New Zealand or do we try to sweep it in with our defence strategy or do we cut it adrift? What will be the public relations aspect of that? More importantly, what is the national interest of Australia as it relates to these things? Can we afford to have another nation the size of New Zealand not fully prepared in some form of defence posture?In areas of north-east Asia, which still have the potential for enormous conflict, economic development is taking place in differing degrees and in differing ways. History has shown in that part of the world that where nations developments are impaired or are vastly different, economic imperialism has been on the march. As a consequence, we have to be aware of what can happen in that area. It is most important that we have some flexibility in our approach to nations such as Indonesia, India, which has the fastest growing defence force in the world at the moment, and the former Indo-China, China, Burma and other countries which will undergo enormous change in the coming 10 to 20 years.Our relationship with the United Nations, which will be presumably the umbrella for all these assignments in the future, brings me to question our industry policy as it relates to the capacity of Australia to defend itself. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, referred to the fact that if we are to embark upon a far more self-reliant defence policy, as the paper implies, then consideration does have to be given to our ability to crank up the resources within this nation. Those of us who can recall the history of the Second World War will remember that halfway through the war we were very dependent on America for the sorts of materials that were needed quickly to arm the Australian forces—in the form of air defence, naval defence and armaments.As has been pointed out, Australian industry did in the end provide a lot of our resources, but it took time. It is worth recording that a lot of the postwar industry policies has largely been based on the final question of the national interest. I refer here to the motor car industry in particular because the motor car plans that were put in place in the 1970s and the 1980s supported heavy industry in Australia because of what were deemed `national interests. If we wipe out a car industry, we will certainly wipe out heavy engineering. If we wipe out heavy engineering, it cannot be replaced quickly and in a case of national emergency it would take us some time to meet that demand. The report envisaged a period of self-reliance in which we look after ourselves and have a closer relationship with the nations in our area. All of that is dependent on the strength of our economy, the strength of our industry and the strength of our will to commit ourselves to relationships in these areas. I urge people to consider those aspects of industry policy.Finally, I refer to what is very much a change in peoples outlooks. These days we appear to be quite prepared to support air strikes or the use of airborne platforms to distribute munitions around the world by means of precision bombing and the like, and that is referred to in the paper. At the same time, the public abhorrence of massive movements of troops or the massive use of offshore bombardment has built up. As a consequence, the defence paper, in my view, does not address the problem of the future.If air power is to be the only supportable force against a foreign power, then many more resources will be needed. But that cannot be at the overall expense of the army and the navy. The paper gives very little thought as to how we can best deploy air power in defence of Australia. Far more thought ought to be given to the development of air bases around the north of Australia and a lot less thought ought to be given to the defence of southern Australia. That is the one gap that I saw in the paper when I briefly looked through it.I welcome the opportunity to have these debates. Australias defence is one of those forgotten areas in many respects. Its budget funding has receded dramatically over the last 10 years. A lot of money has gone into machinery, but a lot less money has gone into manpower. We cannot have the level of machinery that has been ordered, such as frigates, submarines, armaments for troops, and planes unless the manpower is there at the same time. Further shrinkage of defence spending will ultimately place a lot of work that has been done in the past in great jeopardy and the morale and the structure of the forces will decay. If we allow that to continue over time, then any defence threat over a 20-year period would be a major concern, especially if that is linked to a decline in our industrial base.","N/A","MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
296,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr ALLAN MORRIS","FI4","(Newcastle)","ALP","N/A",1856,"—I wish to make a few comments about the Strategic review 1993 , which is the next step in the continuing process of reviewing, adjusting, redeveloping and refocusing our defence policies. The defence white paper was released in 1987 and that was followed by a force structure review which was released in mid-1991. This Strategic review will be followed by a white paper later this year.In terms of defence, the world is very much at a crossroads. I cannot recall a period for some hundreds of years in which there has not been a major power which has either occupied or incorporated within its supposed nationhood other countries. Whilst America is certainly very powerful, it occupies only its own territory. In previous times, there was the USSR occupation of Lithuania, Latvia and many other Russian states which are now separate countries. There was the Austro-Hungarian empire, the British empire, the Turkish empire and the Ottoman empire. There has normally been a major power in the world which has occupied another country. To a large degree, that defined what defence was about. Defence meant either being the aggressor or defending oneself against such a situation. The wars which occurred both last century and this century have largely involved the occupation of nations in some form or other.With respect to Australias strategic outlook, clearly our focus should be on South-East Asia and north-east Asia. That is our immediate region and those are the countries which are closest to us. In the last 10 years we have seen them increasingly as countries to deal with and to link into, not as potential invaders. I still have vivid memories of growing up in the 1950s and the old maps of the yellow peril and the arrows pointing down to Australia. We saw our immediate neighbours as threats—not as neighbours. Our policy and our attitude, our mind-set, was always to defend ourselves against these countries that could invade us. We now realise that that is not the case and that these people have their own defence and security interests. The idea that Australia should always be paranoid about invasion is fast receding.The paper does make some fairly pertinent points about the need for us to be involved in joint exercises, to have a better understanding, to have better training between countries and to recognise the interest of trade. All of the countries which are close to Australia, such as Indonesia, Burma, Vietnam, Cambodia and Papua New Guinea, have some degree of internal tension of their own which we do not involve ourselves in. The idea of defence is no longer simply a question of neighbours, air forces or weapons. It involves trade, internal security, and internal and external stability.I do not think that the paper looks far enough at the adjacent areas, but I trust that the white paper will. We certainly have to look further than Asia. We need to look at the Middle East, particularly the north-western Middle East and the ex-Soviet republics. The new nations that have emerged around the Caspian Sea will be important to Australia for many years to come. That importance is not all that visible yet, but I think we need to be cognisant of the potentially important trade links with our neighbours.We would be unwise to think that geographical closeness is the only factor. There are other forms of closeness, such as religious closeness or cultural closeness. A religious movement in one part of the world may move across and destabilise trade opportunities in countries adjacent to us or even further away, which in turn affects our security. As a trading nation, anything that hurts or undermines our trade undermines our security. We are looking at the world economy and world defence in an entirely new geopolitical context. We are seeing much more localised tribal and internecine warfare within countries than we would normally have been used to earlier in this century and last century, when it was commonly between countries.Some of my colleagues have expressed concern about the existence in Australia of a number of different cultures and backgrounds. Many of these people retain their connections and their cultural identity to a large degree. Some of my colleagues see that as being a danger. Quite frankly, I see that as being a protection for Australia and its future security. It is in countries where that identity has not been able to flourish that we see the greatest tension. We see countries being divided and separated internally by separate groups because they have not been able to manifest their own particular religion, culture or identity within that nation.I think Australias multicultural policies are wise. In many ways, they are an enormous boost to our security. They remove the potential tensions that would otherwise exist. I am sure that, if other countries which are now caught up in such internal tensions had their choice, they would go back and rethink their insistence on single identities. I suspect the best example of that is the Soviet Union. The absorption of the Baltic states was a wonderful example of what happens when people are told to forget that their culture or their religion existed. The idea of suppressing cultural, religious or ethnic attitudes is a recipe for disaster. I think that Australia, by adopting a very positive approach, has certainly improved its security.We have also seen changes in the role of the United Nations, which have been raised by a number of speakers with regard to this paper. In that context, Australia has played a fairly important role. I have met some of our peacekeeping representatives, both from the defence forces and from the Federal Police, in a number of countries. I am proud of the contribution we have made for a very long time. It did not start in recent years. It goes back to Cyprus in the 1970s. We have been operating in the Middle East and in various countries for a very long time. I think we are now well regarded.It is to Australias credit that we saw this as an evolving and important role and we therefore made our personnel and resources available very early in the process. In so doing, we helped to establish a role for the United Nations both in peacekeeping and also for humanitarian purposes. Australia has been at the forefront of both of those ways in which we are seeing the world politics change. Our defence forces have matured and adapted to them more than most countries. I think that reflects greatly upon their level of understanding and sophistication.We should be looking more closely at the actual notion of defence. The notion in the old days of soldiers being simply warriors, a form of weapon themselves, rather than thinking, understanding and caring human beings has now long gone. Our Defence Force personnel are people who have a range of backgrounds and a range of diverse views of their own and are not simply some weapon to be pushed into battle here or overseas.I think the notion of defence itself has changed quite dramatically under this government. This strategic review and the white paper to be released later in the year will take that change to the next step. That is a very welcome process. I am sure that both our defence forces and our community recognise and support the fact that we are maturing and evolving. If we look at other parts of the world, I think we will see examples of where that is not happening. I think in the years ahead those countries will find things much more difficult.A previous speaker said that, historically, Australias role had invariably been defence; that we had not been the aggressor. I think it is very important that in our attitude to both this paper and the previous policies for the last 10 or 11 years we have been concerned overtly with defence. That has been our prime position. Of course, we also need to be self-reliant. The move in those two areas has had enormous implications.One figure that stands out quite dramatically is that the average Australian content of our defence acquisitions now is something like 65 per cent, whereas 10 years ago that figure was 30 per cent. In other words, 10 years ago, when we first came into government, more than two-thirds of our defence acquisition spending went overseas. We were creating jobs in other countries and making other countries defence industries more self-reliant. That has been turned around. We now have 65 per cent of our purchasing in Australia. In that process we have created industries which are not simply defence industries. I think this is the important point to understand.When one talks about aircraft, one imagines that we have factories that make just a particular kind of thing. The fact is that most defence industries are now very diverse. The design of ships, whether for naval or commercial use, is not all that different. The use of software in avionics, in navigation and in internal communications is not all that different for defence or for commercial use. The uses of a whole range of materials—from glass-reinforced plastic, through to carbon fibres, through to powdered metals, through to aluminium—are applicable not simply for defence industry but also for commercial industries.Both defence research and defence manufacturing have long been at the forefront of world manufacturing, world design and world technology. Any country that is not involved in defence manufacturing will not stay involved in manufacturing in general for all that long. Unless one is at the front end of technological change, one very quickly ends up at the very back end or off it altogether.In the last 10 years we have seen a massive transition in Australia in both the designing capacity and the technological research and development of technologies and materials which are vital in defence. In five, 10 or 20 years time, that whole range of technologies, from carbon fibres to hard-wearing surfaces, will be commonplace in industry—some are now—and will be normal industry standards.For a very long time now, defence research has driven technical research for manufacturing. In the 1960s and 1970s when the F111s were purchased from America we did not have the capacity or the right to affect the computer software. In recent times, with the conversion of the F111s to digital, there has been a massive change, at our expense—but we bought equipment when we had no say over the internal operations of it.A modern example is the submarines. The American company Rockwell received American government permission for the first time in history to transfer into Australia the capacity to integrate the weapons system. That is now an Australian-owned copyright. The government spent a great deal of money on that technology, and it is important that it is resident in and owned by Australia. That change in attitude over the last 11 years is important. We could have gone faster, and there is much further to go, but the direction is correct. This report is just one more step on a much longer path.","N/A","MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
297,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr LIEBERMAN","XU5","(Indi)","LP","N/A",1858,"—I welcome the Strategic review 1993 . I believe that it does help to foster better understanding within the Australian community at large, and of course within parliament, of Australias role in defence. It also signals directions for it to travel in. As a member of federal parliament, representing many hundreds of defence personnel in my electorate, and also previously in the state representing those same people, and as a member of the defence forces as a reserve officer and a previous national serviceman, and having grown up on an army base in my early years, I have a certain fascination for the development of Australias defence policies.One of the points I would like to make right from the outset is what a great achievement it is for Australia, having a strong Defence Force with modern equipment—albeit requiring change and upgrading—not to be regarded by any of our neighbours as a military threat but to be regarded as a friend. I think that is a great achievement for our nation. Obviously, our future defence strategies must always ensure that we strengthen that relationship and that understanding of Australias role in the world, particularly in this region. I am mindful of the fact that the defence strategy document is a preview of a white paper which will be released later this year. This defence strategic paper is an attempt to forecast in broad terms the next three to five years. All of us know how difficult that is.In the past few years, while emerging from the Cold War, we have seen dramatic changes in the world, not all of them predictable. I venture to suggest that many of the changes that will occur will not have been predicted by any of us. For that reason, it is important that our strategic defence policies have, as part of them, not only the ability to be flexible but also a ready appreciation of the limitations that this nation will always have in respect of defence.Clearly, we need a strategic defence policy which defends Australia against threat. When one looks at the continent of Australia, one can see how mind-boggling that challenge is. Therefore, it is absolutely essential that our defence forces be supported with modern equipment that enables them to move rapidly, to be hard-hitting when necessary and to be given full support in the area of strategic reconnaissance, particularly in relation to the new techniques of laser and radar technology. The work that is being carried out by Australian scientists as part of the Defence Force, supported by industry, is not well understood in Australia but should be acknowledged. The strategic debate we are having will hopefully open up the world and improve the knowledge of Australians of our scientists achievements.I believe that the difficulties of being career defence personnel are not fully appreciated by many Australians, and that is a pity. I would like to see our future defence strategic policies concentrate more and more on recognising the professionalism and sacrifices that defence service personnel and their families have to make. They have to be prepared to undertake many tours of duty in different parts of Australia, and in some cases the world. The Australian community owes a debt of gratitude to members of our defence forces. On many occasions they are subjected to danger, and often their families are disrupted. We should always remember that those men and women and their families are doing a job for us. They should be respected and recognised. The defence strategic papers and discussions should recognise this.I hope that we make a better attempt to enhance the career structures of our defence personnel. I will provide a brief example of how morale can be easily affected. If morale is not handled properly, it can have a bad effect. That is unnecessary and should be avoided. As we know, government policies with respect to income testing for defence personnel on low incomes who are entitled to family allowances were changed some months ago. As a result, defence personnel families who receive rental assistance and transport assistance on relocation are now in many cases deemed, under the new fringe benefits test, to receive an extra amount of income in notional terms. That has the dramatic and drastic effect of reducing their entitlement to family support allowances.Surprisingly, 30 per cent of Australias defence personnel are in the low income category. This sort of policy by the Australian government is seen as a slap in the eye for Australian defence personnel. It does nothing to help them tackle the challenges that we want them to tackle and to be involved in on our behalf. I hope that more effort is made urgently to remove those areas of irritation and disappointment which continue to exist for defence personnel and their families.I will briefly mention that nuclear threats are an essential part of the assessment of our defence strategy. We all rejoiced at the end of the Cold War. We saw the opportunity to diminish the risk of nuclear warfare between the great powers, and great progress has been made in that respect. However, I greatly worry about the whereabouts and safety of nuclear weapons that were built up and stored during the bad years of the Cold War by some of the European nations.Whilst we rejoice in the fact that the Cold War is over, I do not believe that we can be complacent and consider that Europe is now safe and stable. When looking at the terrible wars in what was Yugoslavia and Bosnia, we must all remember that we are far from achieving peace and security in those areas. With the Middle East being so close, we must appreciate and understand in our defence review that there is a problem with the location of nuclear weapons, who is responsible for them and what is being done about their disposal. We must ask ourselves whether the defence strategy of Australia, as a member of the world community, is taking account of that.We should also share the concern and trepidation of the world at the problems in the Korean continent. Even today, there is further evidence of a breakdown in negotiations with North Korea that involves its nuclear ambitions and capability. It creates a volatile environment, to say the least, and it does not lead us at this stage of our life to consider that the nuclear threat and the problem of proliferation are over. I wish I could say otherwise, but I believe it is essential that our defence strategy take that into account.I pay tribute to the work that our defence personnel have carried out for us as members of the United Nations peacekeeping forces throughout the world in the past couple of years, particularly in Cambodia, Somalia, Sudan and other areas. The United Nations will be celebrating its 50th anniversary next year in 1995. Australia is privileged to be chairing the committee that is planning for the 50th anniversary of the United Nations. Our strategic defence policies will, of necessity—and so they should—involve us in continuing to be a very active member of the United Nations.Regrettably, the United Nations has in a strategic sense proven itself to be an imperfect mechanism on some occasions for dealing with conflict and attempting to achieve peace. We have already seen the dilemmas that face the United Nations forces day by day in Yugoslavia and Bosnia. The Gulf War showed how nations could cooperate and achieve, through collective security action and offensive action, an effective resolution in part to what was a very dangerous and threatening situation for the world. But the lessons from the current conflict in Europe and in the Middle East with the Gulf War reveal to me—I know that the strategic paper touches on this—that the United Nations has been asked to take on a lot. At the moment it is not equipped to deal with those problems and possible future problems. I hope that the debate on the strategic defence of Australia and Australias involvement in the world will pay particular attention to how we can strengthen the United Nations particularly in its preventive strategies, and in peacemaking diplomacy and peacekeeping.The jargon that a member picks up is interesting. As a fairly new member of the federal parliament and as a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I have picked up the pains people go to to differentiate between peacemaking and peacekeeping. Everyone runs a mile when anyone suggests their role is peacemaking but everyone is quite enthusiastic about the role of peacekeeping. One can understand why, having regard to the evidence from Vietnam and other conflicts—where well-meaning nations have attempted to make peace in countries that are internally divided. It is an impossible task.So the future role of countries like ours, as active members of the United Nations in particular, is to find better ways of achieving peacekeeping, to be realistic, to say a few prayers and hope that we are not involved in peacemaking roles in the future. We should be realistic enough to understand that we may be called upon one day to be part of a peacemaking operation. That is why our defence strategy has to take into account the defence of Australia and also the role we, as a nation, have in achieving world peace. The United Nations will have my full support in its attempts to grapple with this problem. I hope that all members of the parliament will follow the debate during the 50th anniversary of the UN and contribute to it.The reduction in funding for Australias defence budget cannot go on. I welcome the indications that I understand from defence planners that we can maintain a good defence force, provided we do not have any further reduction in the defence budget. Therefore, defence personnel are willing to absorb the cuts they have had to experience and develop our future strategic ability and defence forces, but they cannot do that if there are any further budget cuts.","N/A","MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
298,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr FITZGIBBON","FG4","(Hunter)","ALP","N/A",1861,"—When one comes into bat at No. 56 there is not a great deal more to say, so I intend to be fairly brief. I do make the point that there are few things more important than the defence of our nation. I congratulate the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) and all those who contributed to the Strategic review 1993 . No-one in this House should disagree with the sentiments expressed in the preface of the review. As a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I have been pleased to hear my colleagues on the committee praise this review. It has been a somewhat wide-ranging debate but I intend to refer briefly to what I consider the most important points. The preface of the Strategic review 1993 states:The defence of Australia is not just an activity of Government. It requires the understanding, involvement and support of the Australian people.I applaud the governments commitment to ensuring that the Australian people be kept well informed about these developments that affect Australias defence policies and planning and that people be kept well informed about how this government intends to respond to any developments which might take place.Defence is always important and, as other speakers have said, it is no less so in this post-Cold War period. Just when many of us thought that it was safe to go back into the water or were breathing a sigh of relief because we thought that peace was here at last when we saw the end of the Cold War, our relief has been contradicted by events.It must be recognised that this review has a time frame of three to five years. Already a white paper has been embarked upon and it will be published later this year. That white paper will outline Australias strategic and defence policies as we cross into the next century. Most people would see this policy review as being a very realistic assessment—not perfect, perhaps, but as sensible as one would hope it to be. I appreciate particularly the bipartisanship, or the bipartisan acknowledgment, of this strategic review. Earlier speakers from both sides of the House have made well-considered contributions which were appreciated, I am sure, by all people who have concerns for the security of our nation.It is axiomatic that Australias security is linked to regional security. I am pleased that all earlier speakers recognised that regional security can best be ensured by promoting greater openness, greater trust and greater friendship with and among our regional neighbours. Suspicions, tensions and enmities will not develop in an atmosphere of openness and friendship. It is fortunate that so many people from this parliament have had the opportunity to visit our regional neighbours, to mix with them, to get to know them and to develop friendships with them. I have been to many defence training exercises at Canungra and other places, and have seen joint venture exercises involving people from all South Pacific nations. The level of cooperation is heart-warming and instils in one a great confidence about the prospects for the future peace of this region.Strategic review 1993 makes it clear that there is an integral link between the defence of Australia and our increasing defence engagement with regional nations. Peace within our area will flow from our friendship and strategic partnership with our south-east and south-west Pacific neighbours. This regional peace will be an important building block in the establishment of global security.My Hunter Valley colleagues have made references already to Newcastles shipbuilding capacity and the importance of the minehunter project to our region, so I will not dwell on minehunter issues. In the time remaining I pass on my best wishes to the Defence Force personnel in my electorate of Hunter. The Williamtown RAAF base was formerly in my electorate but, as a result of a redistribution, that has gone into the area now served so very well by my colleague the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Horne). But I do still retain what I guess can be called the Myambat supply depot—it used to be the 222 supply depot.The men and women who serve at Myambat are fine people indeed. I pass on my congratulations to them for putting on such a wonderful day when Lieutenant General John Grey CGS officially opened phase one of the explosives storehouse development at that base. Having experienced that happy day, I am sure that an equally successful day will be held when Generals Grey, Hickling and Clunies-Ross attend, and General Grey officially opens, the new School of Infantry developments at Singleton base next Monday.Australia is indeed a lucky country, having avoided war as other countries have known it and the carnage that results from human conflict. It is to be hoped that the Strategic review 1993 contributes to the maintenance of peace in our land.House adjourned at 6.30 p.m.","N/A","MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

373,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Mr Beddall","QE4","GWYDIR","ALP","N/A",1865,"—The answer to the honourable members question is as follows:(1) The nature of the Rural Adjustment Scheme allows farmers to make more than one application under different programs. As such, one farmer may lodge several different applications and receive assistance more than once. In order to reflect the total assistance given to farmers, the number of applications made by farmers to 31/12/93 under the revised Rural Adjustment Scheme since its inception on 1 January 1993 was 18,512.(2) Of the above applications:(a) 11,077 were approved,(b) 6,314 were declined, and,(c) 1,121 were still being processed.(3) At 31/12/93, there had been 12,957 applications made by farmers for interest rate assistance under the provisions of the Scheme, since 1 January 1993.(4) Of the above:(a) 7,083 were approved,(b) 5,298 were declined, and,(c) 576 were still being processed.(5) At 31/12/93 there were 371 farmers in receipt of Farm Household Support (FHS) payments.(6) All 371 farmers in receipt of Farm Household Support (FHS) payments are receiving FHS at the maximum level available to them under the Act.(7) The average sum paid per application approved during the 1993 calendar year under the RAS was $6,635 which includes applications for interest subsidies, professional advice grants, training grants, re-establishment grants, and exceptional circumstances interest subsidies.(8) (a) From 1 January 1992—31 December 1992, 634 applications were received from farmers for re-establishment grants under the RAS.(b) From 1 January 1993—31 December 1993, 811 applications were received from farmers for re-establishment grants under the RAS.(9) (a) Of the 634 applications received 532 were approved, and 170 were declined. The difference is due to the carry over of applications from the prior period.(b) Of the 811 applications received, 349 have been approved, 152 have been declined, and 310 are still being processed.(10) At 31/12/93, 8,748 farmers were still being assisted under Parts A and B of the RAS which operated before 1 January 1993.(11) Immediately before 1 January 1993, 12,132 farmers were receiving assistance under Parts A and B of the RAS.(12) At 31/12/93 there were 1,223 farmers receiving assistance under the rural adjustment arrangements which operated before 1988.(13) As at 31/12/93 the RAS guidelines in operation from 1/1/93 have not been changed.(14) (a) Draw down of $133.269 million of Commonwealth funds held by the States.(b) Nil.(15) It is expected that the Commonwealth will provide $429.143 million for RAS for the period 1 July 1993 to 30 June 1997.(16) No. It is expected that $283.2 million will be provided from Forward Estimates. A further $133.269 million will be forthcoming from the draw down of Commonwealth funds held by the States and $12.674 million from expected savings from the wool exceptional circumstances and from Normal RAS.(17) At 31/12/93 there were no more than 28 people who had received FHS payments for more than nine months and who were liable to repay money to the Commonwealth. This number includes farmers who had received payments under RAS Part C Household Support, which was replaced by FHS on 20/3/93.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[2]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

On the basis of extrapolation from South Australian estimates of new trees and shrubs established by planting, direct seeding or assisted natural regeneration and estimates of existing plants saved by fencing from stock and vermin, Greening Australia arrive at a figure of approximately 550 million trees and shrubs for the first four years of the OBT. Both Greening Australia and the Commonwealth Government consider it would be a difficult and expensive exercise to precisely count the number of trees and shrubs established by the Australian community under OBT and that Greening Australia resources are better directed at encouraging, assisting and empowering all sectors of the community to restore Australias vegetation to a level which allows sustainable production and maintenance of biodiversity.(2) On the basis of the above figures, the OBT Program has achieved half its target in less than four years. An estimated 100 million trees and shrubs are established or protected each year.(3) The amount committed by the Commonwealth Government was $50 million over 10 years, to the year 2000.(4) On the basis of the aforementioned, the Australian community will establish or protect over 1.3 billion trees and shrubs during the life of the Program.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[4]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

389,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Mr Bilney","RE4","BRADFIELD","ALP","N/A",1884,"—The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable members question:(1) ACS carried out a total upgrade of its technical computing facilities from 1989 to 1991 to improve the quality of service to clients and increase productivity. The nationwide networked system was installed in each capital city office of Australia which included Sydney. The AES Graphics application is one of 40 architectural, engineering and management software applications which run on the system.(a) The tender for the acquisition was accepted in June 1990. Equipment was installed and staff trained progressively around Australia with Sydney being implemented in mid 1991.(b) Cost of the AES Graphics Application was $4,646 per licence. NSW office has 42 licences giving a total cost of $195,132 for AES.(c) The nationwide upgrade process was reviewed by an Acquisition Council comprised of Government, Industry and Union representatives.(i) The proposed implementation was submitted to the Expenditure Review Committee of Cabinet and Cabinet approved the project on 1 August 1989.(ii) Specific voting or discussion within the Committees is not known.(d) The selection process involved preparation of a functional specification, invitation to register interest and invitation to tender.(i) Three tenders were received for the upgrade project.ARCadcentre offering GDS and associated applications and hardware.Intergraph offering Intergraph and associated applications and hardware.IBM offering AES and associated applications and hardware.(ii) The lowest tender, IBM, was accepted on the basis that it met all specified functional requirements.(e) Some complaints have been received from staff about utilising AES. They argue that a simple stand alone drafting system would have been more appropriate for ACS and less costly than the current system which provides fully integrated architectural, engineering and management functions. They add that these additional functions could be carried out on other separate stand alone equipment.It should be recorded that considerable praise for the system is also received from staff.(f) ACS usage statistics show that the Technical Computing System in Sydney for the month of October 1993 recorded logon time equivalent to 87% of normal working hours averaged over all workstations.(g) (i) The Technical Computing System operates nationally over a wide area network. It is therefore difficult to accurately attribute costs specifically to NSW and specifically to the AES application.On a purely pro-rata basis of NSW having currently 42 workstations out of a total of 212 Australia wide, the running cost of the overall NSW system would be $713,000 of which $376,000 is depreciation allowance and $95,800 is interest on debt.(ii) It would not be possible to apportion costs just to AES as there are 40 applications on the system which share data and equipment and AES is just one of these applications.(2) The cost of a simple stand alone CAD system will depend on the specified requirements for computer processors, memory, hard disk space, graphics monitors, plotters, printers, digitisers, drawing application functionality, customisation, training, support, maintenance, etc.A rough order of cost per each system for equipment only would be:Computer, Graphics Monitor, Operating System—$5,000Generic CAD software—$6,000Industry Specific Drafting Extension—$5,000Digitiser—$1,000Plotter Thermal—$25,000Laser—$60,000As NSW currently has 42 such systems, the above needs to be multiplied by this number for a capital cost comparison. However,it would not be sensible to purchase separate plotters for each system. These would normally be networked and shared making the overall system, by definition, not stand alone.To this figure must be added the implementation and training costs and the significant support cost of maintaining separate systems which does not occur with a centrally maintained networked system. No allowance has been included for the cost of all the other applications which currently run on the ACS Technical Computing System.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[10]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

391,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Mr Bilney","RE4","BRADFIELD","ALP","N/A",1885,"—The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable members question:(1) No. As in previous years, the Departments Performance Review and Audit Branch will work in conjunction with the ANAO on the Departments financial statement audits and will have the primary role in two of the trust account agency audits.(2) During 1993 the Branch commenced a process of major structural change in response to the impact of commercialisation on the Department and its changing internal audit needs. The extent of this change was such that it had an adverse effect on the morale of some Branch staff, and this was recognised by management. However, the changes introduced should ensure that the work of the Branch becomes more professionally varied and progressively more effective over time, thereby providing a sustainable basis for high morale.(3) (a) There are 5 persons responsible for management of internal audit within the Performance Review and Audit Branch. Their qualifications includeBachelor of Economics and Graduate Diploma in Legal StudiesBachelor of Science (Physics and Maths)Bachelor of Economics and Certified Public AccountantBachelor of Financial Administration and Chartered AccountantBachelor of Arts (Accounting) and Chartered Accountant(b) between them they have some 33 years professional experience in audit and audit management.(4) (a) There are no formal eligibility requirements for appointment to the Senior Officer Grade B level. Selection is based on comparative merit and meeting selection criteria at interview. Normally promotion to the `B level is from the `C level and there were 9 SOG `C officers in the internal audit unit during 1993.(b) Five branch officers applied for promotion to SOG B level within the Branch during the year.(c) None.(5) (a) Following a Branch restructure, three Section head positions became vacant about the middle of the year and the opportunity was taken to redevelop them into account manager positions. The account manager concept was new to the Branch and no staff had experience in the full range of skills required. A decision was taken not to advertise them for permanent filling but to fill them for 6 months with consultants in order to provide training, define performance standards and be role models for staff. This gave internal staff the opportunity to improve their skills and demonstrate their capacity for future promotion. The positions were then advertised and substantively filled in December 1993. One position was filled by an outside appointment and two by the transfer of existing SOG Bs from outside the Branch—again based on the merit selection process.(b) The Consultants received varying levels of cooperation from potential internal applicants depending on the professionalism and common sense of the staff concerned.(6) The Branch reports quarterly to the Departmental Audit Committee on its performance against a range of indicators:achievement of the approved work programproductive time as a proportion of total time availableresponsiveness to emergent issuesconformance with time budgets for individual audits.Performance targets that are objectively measurable and relevant to the revised audit strategy will be implemented during 1994. The critical measure of performance of the Branch is the level of management and auditee satisfaction—an essentially subjective factor. A survey of users of the Branchs services in the Department in early 1993 indicated substantial dissatisfaction in those groups and formed the basis for the change program initiated. A follow up survey will be conducted late in 1994.(7) & (8) The function of internal audit is to provide informed, confidential advice to senior management. Confidentiality ensures that the internal audits provide useful and timely support to management, that staff and management can feel uninhibited in dealing with internal audit, that internal audit can provide independent advice to the Secretary without fear or favour, and that internal audits do not compromise commercial-in-confidence material belonging to DAS commercial agencies. Internal audit complements the external audit activity of the Australian National Audit Office, the reports of which are tabled in the Parliament. ANAO staff participate in the Departmental Audit Committee which, inter alia, oversights all internal audit activity.Some 133 internal audit reports were issued to management during the period since 1 January 1990 and numerous other advisings issued. For the reasons outlined, none have been placed on the public record.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[11]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

As was noted in the Report of the Inquiry into Fraud on the Commonwealth, recently concluded by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration, it is virtually impossible to have all agencies use the same definition of fraud, because there are numerous factors which complicate the practical identification of fraud and fraud losses. The same report also notes that there is no standard Commonwealth approach to interpreting these questions. The answers which follow have been provided by my Department. They relate strictly to those cases where formal action was taken pursuant to statute criminal law for a fraud style offence, or where formal action was taken pursuant to the provisions of the Public Service Act, the Defence Force Discipline Act or the Act of a Statutory Authority within the portfolio, for matters dealing with fraudulent misappropriation or similar style disciplinary breaches, whether or not that formal action was later sustained.(1) (a) 139 cases.(b) 151 cases.(c) 186 cases.(2) The phrase `successfully prosecuted has been interpreted to mean cases where formal action taken under a criminal statute, Public Service Act, Defence Force Discipline Act or the Act of a Statutory Authority within the Portfolio, resulted in an allegation of fraud being sustained.(a) 65 cases were successfully prosecuted.(b) 73 cases were successfully prosecuted.(c) 81 cases were successfully prosecuted.(3) Sums recovered below relate to the cases identified in Question Two.(a) $58,894.30 was recovered.(b) $191,368.01 was recovered.(c) $94,006.11 was recovered.The above figures do not include other recoveries—which substantially exceed the above figures—voluntarily surrendered prior to sentencing; and recoveries from other sources including other legal actions.(4) The answer to this question relates to the specific losses identified in Question Two. The aggregate sum recovered comprises 63.5% of the losses identified in those cases.(5) This answer includes all dismissals for cases of fraud that were identified in Question Two. Nineteen people were removed from employment.(6) Defence does not specifically monitor the movements within other Australian Public Service agencies of former Defence public servants and Defence Force members who have been dealt with for fraud while employed with Defence.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[15]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Recommendation (c) has been acted upon by the Government and Australia Post.(a) The Government considered all the recommendations of the Industry Commission and adopted a phased approach to industry reform. The above recommendations were not adopted because of the estimated significant increase in CSO costs, and the operational implications of increasing service frequency standards. On balance the increase in service delivery could not be supported when assessed against cost and operational criteria.Australia Post undertook a survey in 1992 of rural postal users. The results of the survey revealed that there are an estimated 125,000 households in rural and remote areas which do not receive a roadside delivery. The majority of these customers are provided with an alternative service such as counter service at the nearest postal outlet or rental of private letter boxes at concessional rates.Australia Post has assured me that it is committed to community consultations, particularly in rural and remote areas. This commitment means that it does not make decisions about the frequency and type of service it provides in isolation from postal users in rural and remote areas. Australia Posts local managers assess requests from the local community for new services, service changes and service upgrades.(b) No. The Government agreed to adopt the statutory report contained in Australia Posts 1991/92 Annual Report as the basis of performance standards required to fulfil the Governments social objectives.Australia Posts services to rural and remote communities will be protected through a review of Community Service Obligations by a Parliamentary Committee, that will be conducted during the life of the Parliament. Representatives of rural and remote communities will be invited to work with the review body.(3) Yes.(4) No. The Government confirmed its policy commitment to ensure that all Australians have reasonable access to a standard letter service at a uniform rate of postage, which is to be funded by a cross subsidy on the letter service. This is an equitable approach that shares the cost of providing the service among all postal users.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[38]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

447,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Mr Beazley","PE4","GIPPSLAND","ALP","N/A",1899,"—The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable members question:(1) Defence is not aware of any community or business interests that have publicly expressed concern about the tendering practices for Royal Australian Air Force maintenance work. A number of maintenance organisations have expressed support for the maintenance contracting strategy adopted by the RAAF to achieve untying from the Department of Administrative Services (Asset Services).(2) In accordance with Government guidance, client departments were to operate in an untied environment (where cost effective) from 1 July 1993. This progressive commercialisation of services to government agencies included the provision of maintenance services. The RAAF has developed and is implementing an Australia-wide program to totally untie from Asset Services over a three year period. A component of this program addresses maintenance work estimated to cost less than $6000. A new maintenance contract is being finalised and will be introduced at the first RAAF base in April/May 1994 through an open tender process.(3) Correspondence to Mr McGauran of 2 July 1993 confirmed that the Department of Administrative Services would be treated as a commercial contractor following the untying process. The RAAF has negotiated a three year Memorandum of Understanding with Asset Services to achieve total untying, the necessary transfer of information and to enable the progressive implementation of commercial contract packages. All capital works projects and some maintenance works are being delivered in a commercial environment.(4) Asset Services has successfully and unsuccessfully tendered for RAAF works contracts. Asset Services is a business unit within the Department of Administrative Services and is treated on the same basis as any commercial tenderer.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[39]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

(For example cars used by senior executives are registered in the state/territory in which the senior executive resides.)(5) DAS Fleet charges Asset Services $25.68 for Commonwealth Government registration. For those vehicles registered in a state/territory Asset Services pays whatever fee is current in that state/territory.(6) As part of DAS Asset Services purchases diesel fuel under a Commonwealth wide period contract (arranged by Purchasing Australia) with variable prices in each state/territory.

Government businesses such as Asset Services should not enjoy any net competitive advantage by virtue of their ownership when competing with other businesses.It should be noted also, that within the Commonwealth sector generally, and DAS in particular, commercialisation has provided significant opportunities for private sector firms. Since 1987 markets totalling some $800m a year previously unavailable to the private sector have been opened up.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[40]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

465,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Mr Crean","DT4","MOORE","ALP","N/A",1903,"—The answer to the honourable members question is as follows:(1) The Government begins to reclaim the HECS debt of an individual only when that persons taxable income reaches the minimum income threshold. Currently this is $26,403 for the 1993-94 financial year. If a persons income never reaches the minimum threshold, he/she is never required to repay the debt. It is expected that most graduates will find employment in the future. When these graduates taxable income reaches the minimum threshold, they will begin repayment of the debt.(2) Any HECS debt which is outstanding for 12 months or more is indexed annually in line with cost of living increases. Indexation is applied in order to maintain the real value of the debt. The rate of indexation applied in 1993 was 0.9%.(3) When a debtor dies before wholly repaying his or her debt, the debt is cancelled. If, before the persons death, the Australian Taxation Office had issued to the person a tax assessment which included a HECS repayment, the amount of that HECS repayment must be paid out of the persons estate. The remainder of the HECS debt would be cancelled.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[48]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Following the Commonwealths offer of funding to State Governments (20 August 1993), the Minister wrote to Mr Foss:(i) on 30 September 1993—in response to a letter from Mr Foss dated 15 September 1993, outlining a proposal for the gradual phasing out of the patient co-payment, and indicating that the other Conditions of Grant for the Commonwealth Dental Health Program must be met;Mr Foss responded on 1 November 1993 indicating reluctance to make the suggested changes to the State Program;(ii) on 17 November 1993—providing the Commonwealth conditions of grant and again inviting WA to participate in the Program.(c) See (b) above. Mr Fosss latest approach to Senator Richardson was dated 13 January 1994 accepting in principle the Commonwealths offer of funding, subject to State Cabinet approval and satisfactory finalisation of certain other mattersSenator Richardson responded on 18 February 1994 clarifying these issues and requesting formal acceptance of the Commonwealth grant by the WA Government.(d) The Commonwealth Dental Health Program will commence in Western Australia when the State accepts the Conditions of Grant for the Program.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[50]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
