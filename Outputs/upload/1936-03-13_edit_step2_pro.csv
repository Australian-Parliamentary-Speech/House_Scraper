It is the intention of the Minister for Commerce to confer with the representatives of various sugar-producing countries and also with representatives of the British Government in regard to sugar production. Quite apart from that, however, many other matters affecting the primary producers of this country, particularly those associated with the meat, fruit and butter industries, will receive attention, and I am quite sure the Minister for Commerce will be able to do valuable service for the people of Australia and that his visit overseas will prove to be fully justified. The matters with which he will deal are of the utmost importance to our primary producers. It has been made clear in various speeches that have been delivered recently by honorable members on the economic circumstances of the Commonwealth that the welfare of our people is largely dependent on the provision of profitable markets overseas for our primary produce, and no matter with which we could deal deserves closer or more constant attention.","OVERSEAS TRADE","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1[2]/answer[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

99,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CURTIN, John","009FQ","Fremantle","N/A","N/A",137,".- The Opposition has no objection to the passage of this amending bill. I pointout, however, that the need for it has arisen because of the chaos which prevailed at the end of last session when the original bill was being put through Parliament. The bill as originally presented provided for the payment of 15s. a ton to the users of fertilizers for the production of crops other than wheat, and it was stipulated that all applications for subsidy should be lodged by the 31st October last. It must have been within the knowledge of the Government, and certainly within the knowledge of rural representatives who are conspicuous supporters of the Government, that this stipulation would shut out a considerable number of legitimate claims. My information is that some well-informed users of fertilizers were able to get their applications in at the proper time, not because they had exact knowledge of what their claims should be, but because they were politically wise enough to make an estimate of the area they would cut for hay, thus enabling them to comply technically with the provisions of the act. However, the more bona fide farmers, particularly in Western Australia, who, owing to the lateness of the season, did not know how much they would cut for hay, waited until after the 31st October and had their applications for subsidy ruled out by the officers of the department. I brought this matter before the Minister of Commerce some time ago, and it has apparently been discovered that the only way to overcome the difficulty is to bring in this amending bill.As this bill corrects an injustice which the original measure inflicted on a considerable section of the users of fertilizers, I am agreeable to its passage. At the same time, however, I ask the Parliament to consider how its work is being rendered extremely difficult by the bewildering succession of amendments of bills which it has already passed - amendments made more or less obligatory by the inability of the Government to give adequate consideration to questions involved in legislation before it is brought down. I agreed to the Acting Minister for Commerce (Mr. Thorby) taking a certain course of action this morning on a matter of urgency and yet, so urgent is this matter from the viewpoint of Parliament, the bill has not yet been printed. That is an astounding commentary on the conduct of the Governments affairs. It is a measure which will deal with a subject which is not a new one - indeed, it is a3 old as can be - yet this Government, claiming to represent the best interests of the primary producers, meets this Parliament with ill-conceived bills which are rushed through and which then have to be amended at the very next meeting of Parliament. I object to this course of action when Cabinet Ministers are not able to give full consideration to these problems and legislation is not introduced in its proper form.The measure with which the House is now dealing would not have been necessary but for the hasty and ill-considered way in which the bill which it now amends was pushed through this Parliament. I invite the country to consider how far the statute-book has been littered with amending acts on amending acts, dealing with matters extremely perplexing to the layman. The series of changes made in the law would baffle not only the ordinary citizen, but also the most astute legal man. As Parliament has already agreed that a subsidy of 15s. a ton shall be paid to users of fertilizers in order to stimulate production I hope the money which, I understand, has already been raised, will be made available to all those who have claims to it. According to the speech of the Acting Minister for Commerce, if this bill had not been introduced legitimate claimants for the subsidy would have been deprived of money amounting to £5,000. That, certainly, would not only have been an injustice, but it would also have caused anomalous conditions in respect of farmers in the different States.

The very fact that the last act was unjust because of the late date at which it was passed is attested by the Acting Ministers introduction of this bill, which is designed to correct that injustice. I have no more to say other than to offer an admonition, if the Acting Minister does not mind, because the condition of the primary producers is of an acute character, that if the Opposition in this chamber takes up a position which is critical and condemnatory towards Government policy, it does not do so because it is less concerned with the welfare of the primary producer than those who sit opposite, but because it is convinced that the Government, representing, as it does, two diverse and, we submit, antagonistic interests in this chamber, brings down bills which, owing to the political circumstances associated with their origin, are incapable of being properly drafted. Therefore, in justice to the country and in the best interests of the primary producer, we maintain that all legislation should be carefully scrutinized. Just before Christmas, we had the spectacle of the bill which this legislation is intended to amend being thrust through this House without due consideration.

As soon as my notice had been brought to the anomalous conditions which this bill seeks to correct, I communicated with the Department of Commerce, pointed out the extraordinary circumstances of the harvest last year and asked the Government to extend the period. Steps were taken to do so at the first opportunity. This bill is due not to a blunder but to the extraordinary circumstances of the last harvest, when it was found, at the last minute, that crops kept for wheat would be far better cut for hay. This was done at about the end of October, but the lapse of time precluded the people concerned from putting in their claims within the required period. Those who were planting their crop partly for wheat and partly for hay, in ordinary circumstances, could put in their claims. I cannot believe that farmers would make a guess at the area that they intended to cut for hay and then put in applications. The farmers would not do it because it would be fraudulent.

If there were a measure before this Parliament to make retrospective payments to invalid and. old-age pensioners and war pensioners there would be a good deal of opposition from supporters of the Government. As a matter of fact, this measure appears in an unusual form. Although the Acting Minister for Commerce (Mr. Thorby) has made a statement that the additional amount of money necessary will not be in excess of £5,000, no guarantee has been given that that amount will not be exceeded. Why should this Parliament be asked to give an open cheque to the Government to hand out to a particular section of the community, an unlimited amount of money from public revenues? The original measure contained a provision that a certain sum should not be exceeded and if it were possible to make that provision in the first bill, then it should be just as possible to do so in this hill. It appears to me that honorable members are stampeded into a position in which they believe that unless they give everything to the primary producers which their representatives ask for they are doing something to cripple or injure primary production. As a matter of fact, the representatives of those industries in this Parliament have for years talked about the weight of the burdens they had to carry, but no mention has been made by them of the conditions of the men who actually produce the wheat and the hay, reap the harvest, and lump the crop. The patience of honorable members who represent other electorates is being sorely tried by the continuance of this practice of giving additional assistance periodically to a particular section of the community, many of whom are, comparatively speaking, wealthy men. The act specifically shuts out claims for the subsidy on account of fertilizers used in connexion with actual wheat crops; but, as certain honorable members have pointed out, some wheat farmers have found it more profitable to cut for hay, and thus become eligible for the subsidy.","N/A","FINANCIAL RELIEF BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/speech[3]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Only last night the Minister said that to-day wheat is selling at 3s. 7d. a bushel. Therefore, even if the wheat-growers were to lose on a section of their operations, they are able, because of the improvement of prices in other directions, to show a considerable profit. If a mans operations as a primary producer cover the production of a number of commodities, he is not entitled, in my opinion, to claim assistance by way of subsidy on the fertilizers required to stimulate production on any section of his operations that may have shown a loss if /the profits from his other operations exceed his losses. I am not satisfied that many primary producers who have been receiving benefits from this Government are in need of it; but I am satisfied that a large number of those who have received a  hand-out  by way of subsidy are relatively in a much better position than many members of the community who will be called upon to provide by way of taxation the funds necessary to pay this subsidy. Despite what has been said by government supporters, there are in the cities of Australia many thousands of unemployed who cannot obtain sufficient food and clothing. If they happen to secure a- mere modicum of relief work, such as the two weeks in seven provided by some governments, they are taxed on f.he paltry amount that they receive. For what purpose? To build up the revenues out of which the primary producers receive this subsidy in connexion with fertilizers used in stimulating the production of their crops. I say quite frankly that in my opinion the primary producers, through their representatives in this Parliament, have been able to exercise an undue influence upon the Government and thus obtain relief which in many cases .was not warranted. That i3 my considered opinion. I hope the time is not far distant when we shall have in this Parliament a government which is not dominated by that particular section of the community. Many primary producers may be in needy circumstances. There may be many among them who believe in giving reasonable conditions to their employees, but I am perfectly satisfied that they are in the minority, the majority being anxious to obtain the best prices for their commodities, take all the assistance they can force from the Government, and, through their representatives in this Parliament, oppose the granting of relief to other sections who are in greater need of assistance. They are always talking about their poverty-stricken condition; yet, whenever one visits a country show or race meeting, one cannot get near the entrance gates because of their motor cars. So I ask the Parliament to consider very seriously the wisdom of continuing these inroads into the Common.monwealth revenues. In this particular instance the amount involved may not be great, although we have no assurance on that point.I endorse the statement of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Curtin) that, due to the rush tactics adopted by the Government towards the end of sittings, so that Parliament may be in recess for many months, while ministerial members tour overseas at the public expense, many measures have been passed in an ill considered form. Honorable members should ignore the plea of the Government that it wishes to give the Senate something to do. We have been anxious for a long time to do some work, but have been denied the opportunity. If the Government believed that these measures were urgent, why was not Parliament called together at an earlier date? I hope that the members of my party will not be carried away by the plea of urgency, and the belief that in certain country districts it might be said that they had hindered the passage of measures designed to give relief to primary producers, but that they will carefully examine each measure. Honorable members should look at the matter from a national viewpoint, and consider the claims of every citizen, particularly the low-paid section, whether it be in the cities or the country districts. The wealthy interests are well able to look after themselves. Members of the Labour party should look after the man who works for wages, who has nothing to sell but his labour power. They should not aim to represent the wealthy interests, which are able to buy sufficient influence in this Parliament to protect themselves, but should demand a better standard of living for those who slave for the cockey, those whom the cockey denies decent accommodation and even the bare necessaries of life. Unless there is some guarantee in that direction, unless these individuals who are always anxious to dip into Commonwealth revenues are prepared to give decent conditions there is no justification for the Labour party lending its support to the handing out of subsidies.","N/A","FINANCIAL RELIEF BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/speech[3]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
123,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FRANCIS, Josiah","JWT","Moreton","N/A","N/A",141,".- The legislation we are now considering proposes to extend the period during which applications may be made for a subsidy of 15s. a ton on fertilizers used by primary producers within a specified period. This matter has been considered by the Parliament over a number of years. The earliest application of the principle of giving this assistance dates back about three years. The original legislation provided that the latest date for receiving applications should be the 30th November. The legislation recently passed brought forward that date by one month, to the 31st October, and many primary producers, being unaware of the alteration of the date, failed to make application in time. I am one of those who for some time have urged the Government to amend the law in this direction, and I offer my congratulations to it for having yielded to the representations from many quarters to meet the case of those producers who unfortunately failed to lodge their applications before the closing date. I do not say that the producers are wholly to blame. I have been informed that in some sections of the press, particularly in my State, the closing date was given as the 30 th November. It has also been represented to me that in many parts of Australia the prescribed form of application was not available until the closing date had passed. There is, therefore, ample justification for the proposed alteration, and I hope that it will be widely advertised by the Department of Commerce, so that further amending legislation along these lines will not be needed. I was astonished to hear the Minister say that he estimated the additional amount at only £5,000.","N/A","FINANCIAL RELIEF BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Great caution should be exercised at the present juncture, however, to avoid the granting of doles to those who are wealthy. The primary producer should be placed on the same footing as the man in industry who has to lay his cards on the table and show that he is destitute before he can receive government assistance. Why should we build up an aristocracy of wealthy farmers? The time has come when we should say to the farmer,  You must stand on your own feet, and if you are unable to make a success of farming you must get into that occupation for which nature designed you. I claim to have some knowledge of farming. In the early days of Australia the farmers made a success of their operations without any government assistance. The kindergarten farmers of recent years have proved a complete failure, and have become a burden upon the Australian taxpayer. Time after time they have approached this Parliament for a dole. I should be quite prepared to approve of the granting of assistance to farmers in necessitous circumstances, but I consider it entirely wrong that all farmers should be given assistance at a time when the price of wheat is rising and returns show a fair margin of profit compared with the returns from some other primary products. The Government is asking us to agree to the drawing of an open cheque, for no specific amount is being mentioned. Even the most avaricious farmers who live a life of luxury and drive round the country in American motor cars, using American petrol, will benefit if this measure is passed in its present form. Many farmers grow hay for their horses and they are entitled to assistance in respect of the artificial manure that they use for that purpose. In my opinion steps should be taken to curtail the use of American petrol in American machines and to encourage the working of Australian horses. We should not be pursuing a policy that assists foreigners at a time when many of our own people are starving. I am totally opposed to the payment of a dole to wheat-growers, irrespective of their need, but apparently the representatives of the Country party in this Parliament can force the Government to pay doles for turnip, apple, pear, potato, wheat and hay-growers by simply lifting their finger. No restriction whatever is to be placed upon the uses to which the artificial manures are to be put. Seeing that thousands of people are still on the verge of starvation in Australia it is deplorable that a proposition of this kind should be submitted to us. I am quite willing* to encourage men and women to perform useful service for the country, but I am totally against the making of grants to wealthy farmers simply because their representatives in this Parliament are able to exert undue influence on the Government.","N/A","FINANCIAL RELIEF BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The bill provides that such sums as are necessary  shall be made available for the purposes specified. That seems to me to be a unprecedented provision to insert in a measure of this kind. The Government is apparently to be authorized to draw an open cheque. I consider that persons who do not apply within a specified period for a subsidy to which they are entitled should lose it. The members of the Country party seem to have unlimited influence with the Government, and can force through Parliament any measure that they desire. I make that statement seriously. No doubt it is a joy to members of the Country party to be able to circulate through country districts the information that they are able to get what they wish from the Government. Not only the Commonwealth Government, but also the governments of New South Wales and Victoria, have been able to bludgeon legislation through their respective Parliaments by reason of the fact that the Country party occupies a commanding position. This, however, is a most immoral form of government for the Country party to support. Sooner or later this kind of legislation will be impossible, for the people cannot be fooled all the time. It seems to me to be unreasonable that a fertilizer subsidy should be paid in respect of the growing of hay for use on farms. The majority of our agriculturists are engaged in mixed farming. There are in New South Wales, for instance, 14,000 holdings which carry sheep, and 2,283 which are registered as engaging in dairying. If a man is unable to make a profit from one branch of his business, he ought to be able to do so from another branch of it, and I can see no reason why a subsidy should be paid in respect of artificial manure used for growing barley or hay. Another bill is before this Parliament which provides for a grant of £2,000,000 to assist the wheat-growers. In addition the farmers will benefit this year to the extent of £6,000,000 as a result of increased prices. The return from this years crop will therefore be £8,000,000 in excess of that of last year. The Acting Minister for Commerce (Mr. Thorby) made a statement to that effect last night.","N/A","FINANCIAL RELIEF BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Those who live on the fat of the land, of whom the honorable member for Grey (Mr. McBride) is one, should be the last to laugh at the statements I am making. They should be ashamed to vote for the granting of public money to persons whom they know to be in good circumstances. The money we are being asked to provide for the relief of the wheat industry will be not a just reward for labour, but a reward to certain people who have put representatives in this Parliament to squeeze money from the Government. The Government, as a matter of fact, is in such a position that it cannot resist the pressure that is being brought to bear upon it. I offer a strong protest against the practice of Ministers reading type-written speeches in this House at such a rate that honorable members cannot follow what is being said. The evil effects of this practice is intensified when we are requested to carry the measures so introduced to their completion the next day, and are refused an opportunity to consider the full effect of them.

The wheat-growers of Australia are the backbone of the country. If a similar bill were introduced to provide assistance for the wool growers of Australia, 1 might not support it ; but as this measure is to aid the wheatgrowers, and as every acre of wheat grown in Australia provides employment for a number of people, it has my wholehearted support. The extensive utilization of fertilizers must result in a general improvement of pastures and go a long way towards raising our export standard. Anything that we can do to bring about this desirable result should be done gladly. Ever since I have been a member of the Labour party I have consistently supported the claims of the wheat farmers for assistance to enable them to carry on. They are the hardest working people in the community. The honorable member for Barton said that a wheat grower should not be assisted simply because his crop did not yield 20 bushels to the acre. Any farmer who can crop 20 bushels to the acre is not in need of assistance. As all honorable members know, when a farmer sows wheat he does not know if he will ever reap a crop. In the Mallee this year dozens of farmers with good standing crops lost the bulk of them through storms and heavy rains. Primary production, is the largest industry in the British Empire. As a matter of fact in the British Isles alone more persons are employed in primary production than in any other industry. I trust that this bill will be passed without further opposition.","N/A","FINANCIAL RELIEF BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/speech[9]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is one of the (privileges and duties of this chamber to maintain a very close hold on the purse-strings of the Government. I submit that the procedure to which honorable members opposite are objecting to-day has, over a long period of years, apparently escaped their notice. On the statute-book there are already acts providing for the payment of a bounty on the production of sulphuric acid, one of the constituents necessary for the manufacture of superphosphates, but I have never heard it suggested that there should be a limit to the number of tons of sulphuric acid produced in Australia on which bounty should be paid. There are also the iron and steel products bounties. Similarly, I have never heard it suggested that any limitation should be imposed on the number of tons of iron and steel on which bounty should be paid. Last year this House accepted the principle that there should be paid a subsidy of 15s. a ton on all superphosphates used for purposes other than the growing of wheat. This question of the open cheque to which objection is taken to-day, seemed to have escaped the notice of honorable members last year when the Wheat Growers Relief Bill was passed providing for the payment of a subsidy of 3s. an acre on every acre sown to wheat in Australia. That measure contained no stipulation that a limited amount of money should be appropriated. The relative clause in that measure provided that a sufficient sum should be appropriated. The Wheat Bounty Act passed last year provided for the payment of 3d. a bushel but did not limit the total amount to be appropriated. In that measure a similar clause was inserted. I submit that on very much more important matters than this, involving much greater sums of money, honorable members were not averse to giving the Government what they are pleased to-day to call a blank cheque. No harm will be done on this occasion.The Government is at fault in one respect, however, in that it did not follow, in the original act last year, the procedure adopted in the acts providing for the payment of bounties on the production of sulphur, wine and wheat, and provide an unlimited appropriation, leaving the closing date of its application to regulation. Had that been done, we would have avoided the debate on this bill to-day.There is another point raised by honorable members opposite to which I must reply. It has been said that the great bulk of this subsidy will be received by wealthy land-holders, simply rolling in wealth, who tear about the countryside in expensive motor cars. In my own electorate the direct opposite is the case. I represent a lump of South Australia of very high rainfall and rather poor soil, where scientists are doing their level best to devise means of effectively settling people on the land. It has been discovered that the only way in which that can be done successfully is by the intensive use of superphosphates. Every ton of superphosphates that comes to the south-eastern provinces of South Australia creates employment for many people; first, the men in the factory producing the fertilizers - they are located in the electorate represented by the honorable member for Hindmarsh (Mr. Makin) - then the railway men engaged in its transport - on our return to Canberra last week, the honorable member for Wakefield (Mr. Hawker) and I saw no less than six special trains engaged in transporting superphosphates to that part of the State - and then the numbers of men engaged in clearing the laud. That country is not being cleared for the purpose of wheat-growing; it is not grain country, it is purely grazing country. The main industry to be established there will be the production of wool and meat, the future export of which will assist materially in establishing a favorable trade balance in London, about which we have heard so much on recent occasions.The wheat-grower will not participate in the subsidy provided by this bill; in fact, in the principal act, he is definitely excluded from participation. But the subsidy will be paid to the growers of barley. Last year South Australian barley-growers produced a r*ecord crop of 8,000,000 bushels.Silting suspended from 12-45 p.m.. to 2.15 p.m.","N/A","FINANCIAL RELIEF BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/speech[10]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Nobody on the Opposition side is prepared to say that this industry is not worthy of some consideration by this House. The industry is a considerable employer of labour, and is not assisted by a home consumption price or a bounty on production, as in many other industries. Bounties are paid on the production of fruit of various sorts, and there are even bounties on the production of manufactured goods. I doubt whether the honor able member for Denison (Mr. Mahoney) is prepared to attempt to convince the Parliament that the sulphur bounty paid to the zinc manufacturers should cease.","N/A","FINANCIAL RELIEF BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/speech[10]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The speech by the honorable member, following that of the honorable member for East Sydney (Mr. Ward) was a remarkable contribution to the debate. I shall have no hesitation in quoting the remarks of both honorable members in any country electorate as a reason why no farmers vote should be given to Labour candidates. The honorable member for East Sydney is one of the best debaters on the Opposition side, and, if a Labour Ministry came into power again, the chances are that he would be given a portfolio. I should tell my constituents that they could not afford to run the risk of having the Department of Commerce administered by that honorable member. The honorable member for Barton (Mr. Lane) is similarly antagonistic to the interests of the primary producers. The three honorable members whom I have mentioned represent metropolitan constituencies, and the views which they express from time to time regarding rural industries should receive serious consideration in both United Australia party and United Country party circles. I shall stand solidly behind the Government in seeing that the primary producers receive the assistance to which they are entitled.","N/A","FINANCIAL RELIEF BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/speech[10]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Opposition suggests that no farmer or grazier should be entitled to the bounty if he is making a profit. Is the Opposition prepared to adopt the same attitude when discussing the tariff, and say that no protective duty should be granted to a secondary industry that is showing a profit? Of course not. During a long series of years honorable members opposite have supported the granting of duties to industries that have made enormous profits out of country producers. I might instance the glass, iron and steel and match industries, and, of course, many others could be mentioned.When speaking this morning I was developing a point regarding the provision of employment by the use of superphosphates. On this subject I claim to have some knowledge. Farmers in my electorate are going in for a great deal of agricultural development on poor soil. Scientific investigation has shown that good pastures can be produced on this class of land by the liberal use of superphosphates. The Government has been of great service to the producers in this matter, and the payment of a bounty of 15s. a ton on superphosphates has resulted in a considerable increase of employment throughout Australia. I know of no other measure which could have proved so valuable in providing extra employment, and increasing our export wealth. The addition of the proceeds of the barley crop to our London funds would be of considerable assistance; but, with prices ranging from ls. 3d. up to ls. lOd. a bushel - and the latter price is received for only the best crops, which are but a small proportion of the whole - the industry is not a payable one. The slight advantage which the producers will get out of this measure will not help them a great distance on the road to solvency. In a debate such as this one has to travel a long way from home to learn about ones friends.. I have known the honorable member for Grey (Mr. McBride) for a long time, but I am not aware that he grows wheat. He was accused of being interested in this measure on that score. I know him as a pastoralist, and as an employer of labour who has a good reputation in that regard. Although he may represent a considerable number of wheat-growers, he has not yet indulged in the rather expensive pastime of producing wheat. I thank the honorable member for East Sydney (Mr. Ward) and the honorable member for Denison (Mr. Mahoney) for their generous donations to the electioneering propaganda of the Government parties.","N/A","FINANCIAL RELIEF BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/speech[10]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
179,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"ROSEVEAR, John","L08","Dalley","N/A","N/A",149,".- The House is being called upon again to pass another amending bill which is made necessary on account of ministerial incompetence. When the Country party was in opposition, it was loud in its condemnation of the present Government for not taking a long-range view, and anticipating all aspects which might conceivably arise in connexion with its rural legislation. Yet the rural representatives in the Cabinet have from time to time submitted measures which have soon been found to be defective. These self-styled rural authorities who were responsible for this legislation, failed to gauge the proper date on which applications for this bounty should be made. The second mistake was that they estimated that the bill would involve an expenditure of £275,000. They now ask the House to blunder again by giving them an open cheque to expend as much as they like in the payment of bounty for the benefit of those farmers who missed the jump in the race to get this assistance. The Acting Minister for Commerce (Mr. Thorby) has assured us that only a small extra amount is required, and that £5,000 will be ample. Allowing that he may make still another blunder, let us double that sum, and authorize the expenditure of a further £10,000 ; but, above all, we should at least fix a limit. The honorable gentleman says that it is impossible to estimate the exact amount required, yet in the principal act it was estimated that £275,000 would be sufficient to meet all applications throughout Australia. Now the Government has the effrontery to tell the House that it does not know how much it will need to deal with the claims of a mere handful of farmers who made late applications.I desire to know something of the plan adopted in the distribution of the money already paid. I understand that regular application forms were printed. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Curtin) has assured us that he has- information that certain farmers received their accommodation merely as the result of estimates. Did these farmers get the amount for which they asked, and were their estimates correct? In the absence of this information we have no assurance that fraudulent returns were not submitted. The honorable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory) was indignant because certain farmers in Western Australia had said openly that they had put in estimates only. The honorable member twisted this statement by the Leader of the Opposition, and represented that he had said that they were fraudulent estimates, although no such word was used. I am sure that honorable members would like to know whether the estimates on which bounty was paid were on, under or over the mark. I presume that if they were right on the mark, and the estimate actually covered the farmers requirements, we shall hear nothing from him. If the estimate was over the amount required?, so that the farmer received more by way of subsidy than he was entitled to, I have no doubt that we shall hear nothing from him either; but if the estimate was under the mark, the farmers who so underestimated their requirements will be the first in the field to take advantage of this new provision. With those who stated exactly what they required, no fault can be found, nor can any fault be found, so far as we are concerned, with those whose applications arrived too late. They, too, are entitled to the subsidy insofar as all users of fertilizer are entitled to it, but that raises the question whether we should give this assistance to those wealthy farmers who do not require it. The honorable member for Echuca (Mi-. McEwen) took to task the honorable member for Denison (Mr. Mahoney) for saying that this subsidy should not be paid to those farmers who are not in need of it. The honorable member for Echuca then went on to compute how many votes the Labour party would lose at the next election for opposing this legislation, and how many his party would gain by supporting legislation, the object of which is to hand out subsidies indiscriminately, whether they are needed or not. His main concern seemed to be whether a partys attitude to this kind of legislation would lose or gain votes.","N/A","FINANCIAL RELIEF BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/speech[11]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Country party members, as well as members of the Labour party, have jibed at the Government for not proceeding with such a scheme. From time to time they have taken the Government to task for waiting until sheer necessity drove it to rush ill-considered legislation through the House at the last moment. That was when the Country party was in opposition. Now that it has joined the Government the same sort of thing is going on, and the principal bill, of which this measure is an amendment, was rushed through the House in such haste at the end of last session that a most important point in regard to the date of application received too little consideration. The members of the Labour party do not object to a subsidy on fertilizers being paid to those farmers who are actually in need. We support the payment of sustenance money to men when they are unemployed, and therefore we cannot logically object to proposals for helping farmers who are in need, but we cannot countenance the paying over of public money to farmers whether they need it or not, simply because, as the honorable member for Echuca (Mr. McEwen) informed us, it will secure votes for the Government.","N/A","FINANCIAL RELIEF BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/speech[11]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I support the bill. The two main principles embodied in it are, first, that the date of application for the subsidy should be extended from the last day of October of last year to the last day of April of this year, and, second, that a specific sum should not be mentioned in the bill, but that such sums as are necessary should be appropriated from time to time. The principle of the original bill was supported, tacitly at least, by all members of the House when it was under discussion before Christmas ; and rightly so, because they supported, at various times within recent years the payment of bonuses and subsidies to all manner of industries. This subsidy on the purchase of fertilizers has done more to stimulate production and increase trade than any other subsidy I know of. There is no doubt that the use of superphosphates has had an immense effect on rural production right throughout Australia. I think I am right in saying that the first subsidy on superphosphate was paid in 1932, and since then the production of butter has almost doubled, while that of mutton and lamb has increased by 45 per cent. But for those extraordinary increases, there seems to me to be no doubt that the Government would have had to take some steps before now to correct our overseas trade balance. The point involved is not whether the farmers who receive the subsidy are in need or not; the whole purpose of paying the subsidy is to increase production, and it certainly has had that effect.","N/A","FINANCIAL RELIEF BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/speech[12]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

No doubt the Government made an error when it altered the date of application for the subsidy in last years bill from November to October. All farmers do not study their daily papers carefully, and many of them, no doubt, missed the notice of the change of date. In Western Australia many farmers did not know until the last moment whether they were going to cut their wheat for grain or for wheaten hay. Of course, the actual manure must have been used before the 1st July of last year, so that no question of paying out on a blank cheque arises, as some honorable members have suggested. The manure, which forms the subject of the applications, has been used, and no application for a subsidy can be properly made in respect of manure which was not on the ground before the 1st July last. Therefore, I fail to see how the bill can be called a blank cheque ; if it can be so called, then at least it bears the endorsement  not over a certain amount . For these reasons I support the bill. Very shortly we shall have to examine the whole matter of bonuses. The subsidy on fertilizer has gone far enough. Primary industries should soon be able to do without this form of assistance.","N/A","FINANCIAL RELIEF BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/speech[12]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The discussion which has taken place on this small measure exemplifies the saying that mountains can be made out of molehills. As an amendment to a previous measure, it is designed to ensure that all of those whom the principal act was enacted to assist shall share in this subsidy. However, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Curtin) took advantage of it to give a lecture in which he alleged that the Government had committed a serious error and in which, incidentally, ha pointed out to honorable members of this House and the community as a whole the great consideration that he and those associated with him have for the primary producers of this country. When they read the speeches made on this measure by some honorable members opposite the primary producers will have very grave doubts as to the genuineness of such a claim and, undoubtedly, they will wish to remain free from the control of a Government composed of members who have expressed themselves in such terms. As the representative of a constituency which is largely made up of primary producers, a small percentage of whom will derive some benefit under this measure, I fling back in the teeth of the honorable member for East Sydney (Mr. Ward) the unwarrantable attack which he made against those who will benefit under this bill when he said that it was being passed in the interests of greedy and avaricious primary producers. The primary producers constitute the last section of the community against which such a charge could be justly levelled. As a matter of fact, they are the only section of the community that has, until recent years, as a result of legislation passed in this Parliament, been forced to compete unaided against producers in all parts of the world. The honorable member and his colleagues should be among the last to make such a charge in view of the fact that the policy which they support is one of the chief factors in encouraging combines and monopolies which do more than any other section to exploit the community as a whole. This subsidy will be the means of increasing production of goods which can be exported overseas, goods which will enable us to create those necessary credits abroad about which we have heard so much during the last few days. Quite apart from the unjustifiable charges made by the honorable member for East Sydney, every representative of a constituency, in which primary producers reside, knows that many people who are entitled to the subsidy applied too late to receive it. This legislation has been introduced to enable these people to obtain the assistance intended in the principal act.","N/A","FINANCIAL RELIEF BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/speech[13]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Honorable members believed that the Government possessed the necessary knowledge to assure them that this subsidy would not cost more than that amount, and for that reason the House accepted that estimate. To-day honorable members are not objecting to the principle involved in this measure, that is, that a subsidy of 15s. a ton should be paid on all fertilizer used, but to the fact that, despite its possession of the data necessary to enable it to fix the amount on previous occasions, it has not produced a definite estimate on this occasion. The Government now says that owing to unfortuitous circumstances, its first two estimates were wrong, and, according to honorable members opposite, it asks us to prevent it from making any further mistake by giving it an open cheque to meet the balance of the subsidy. The objection to this measure is not so much to giving the Government an open cheque; the policy laid down in the original legislation of paying a subsidy of 15s. a ton on fertilizer used by farmers must stand, and if, even belatedly, applications are made by people who can prove that they have used a certain tonnage of fertilizer, the Government must meet such applications. Thus the Government is correct in its contention that it must have at its disposal funds to meet such liabilities. The point I emphasize, however, is that, although the Government had the data available on which to frame its original estimates of the amount required to meet the subsidy, it is now, contrary to all precedent, asking for further indefinite funds for the same purpose.

200,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"GARDEN, John","K9C","Cook","N/A","N/A",153,".- We have been told that this subsidy will benefit the primary producers who have never been effectively assisted by this Parliament. Have not the growers of potatoes, for instance, received such assistance? Do not these producers receive benefits under the embargo placed on the importation of potatoes from New Zealand? This embargo is maintained, although it has resulted in the loss of the New Zealand market to the Australian fruit-grower. Furthermore, are not the producers of butter protected under the Paterson scheme? Does not every worker in this country give these producers a bonus every time he buys butter for his bread? Despite these facts, the honorable member suggested that some sections of the primary producers have never been assisted by this Parliament. The fruit-growers also have benefited under Commonwealth legislation. Honorable members on this side of the House do not object to assisting the needy farmer; we object to assisting greedy farmers who invariably want something from the revenues of this country to which they are not entitled. It is the Governments duty to help a man who is in need, but no man who has a super abundance of the necessaries of life should be permitted to dip into the public Treasury. For these reasons I support the remarks made by the honorable member for East Sydney (Mr. Ward). Some honorable members representing country constituencies have suggested that the statement of the honorable member for East Sydney (Mr. Ward) on this measure could be used so as to profit himself politically in (the eyes of primary producers. Undoubtedly, the small farmer agrees with our contention that, in no circumstances, is the greedy farmer entitled to dip into the Commonwealth Treasury, and we are prepared to meet any honorable member opposite on this issue in any electorate, whether it be in the city or the country.We object not to the fact that we are giving aid to primary producers, but to the fact that the bill is a blank cheque. As the honorable member for Wentworth (Mr. E. J. Harrison) has said, at the end of October the Minister intimated that the amount involved in paying the fertilizers bounty would be approximately £275,000. How could the Minister give an estimate then, yet to-day, when an extension for a month is required, the Department of Commerce is unable to estimate the additional amount required? If the amount be £10,000, £15,000, eleven £50,000, this side of the House will acquiesce in making the grant; but it certainly does object to signing a blank cheque. If a Labour Government said,  We shall contribute so much in an open cheque to those men who are unemployed, every one in opposition would be protesting against favours being granted to a special section of the community. To them, however, it is an entirely different matter when the beneficiaries are the farmers; there is no quibble about a proposal to approve of an open cheque for distribution among rich farmers. Surely it is competent for the Acting Minister to estimate the amount involved! Let it be £5,000, £10,000, or £15,000; but at least make it definite! This loose manner of dealing with finances must be stopped.It has been said that we on this side of the House are opposed to the farmers. The farmers received more consideration from the Scullin Labour Government than from any other party that has ever occupied the treasury benches. Regarding it as its duty to support farming enterprise, that Government introduced legislation to assist wheat-growers. Understanding internal economy, we also understand, as everybody knows, that we must protect primary industries, because, if we do not and they fail, our secondary industries will also go to the wall; but we are opposed to money being voted to rich men to assist them in travelling around the country shows, and to every race meeting, in their first-class motor cars. It was the Country party, not the United Australia party, which opposed the Scullin Government in 1931 when it attempted action to help the wheat industry. The Country party men in this Parliament stood up and said, We will not stand for this.

That is a good principle, but is the Commonwealth Government to hand out bounties to people rich enough to pay for their own superphosphates so that they may further enrich themselves ? By an extension of the principle, I could say that, as paint is a great preservative for the homes of the people, those who cannot afford to buy paint should receive a bounty to enable them to use it.","N/A","FINANCIAL RELIEF BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/speech[16]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The honorable member wakes up too late. I told him once before, I think, that in order to give him any pleasure in his old age we should have started to tell him funny stories twenty years ago.I have no objection to this bounty or to other assistance being given to the indigent farmers in this country who need superphosphates to rehabilitate worn-out soils; but, just because science has discovered some means of increasing productivity, it is absurd that the Government should hand out largesse to men who can well afford to pay for the fertilizers they require. There must be some clear line of demarcation between those who are entitled and those who are not entitled to receive assistance.Honorable members opposite talk with their tongues in their cheeks, but I have more respect for the intelligence of the farmers than to think that they will swallow everything that politicians say. For the most part the primary producers know full well that when it comes to a matter of their receiving assistance they have no better friends than the Labour party. That party, however, justly objects to coupling the poor and the rich as mutual beneficiaries from such legislation as this. In October last the Acting Minister brought down a bill fixing a definite amount to be paid under a bounty on fertilizers, but in seeking now to amend the legislation he has asked for an open order to pay whatever bounty he likes. I agree with the contention of the honorable member for Cook (Mr. Garden) that the Acting Minister has had ample time, and he has ample information available, if he likes to look for it, to know exactly how much money is to be involved in this distribution. It might be £275,000 or £400,000, for all we know, but surely, when in October the amount involved could be ascertained, it is equally ascertainable now. The present mode of bringing legislation before Parliament must stop. The Government never seems able to make up its mind. I have never seen so many bills passed requiring immediate amendment. Whether it be due to bad instructions to draftsmen or to failure of the draftsmen to do their job, sheaves of amendments are put before honorable members within a very short space of time after the legislation concerned has been introduced. The time of Parliament is being squandered, and in order to ensure that there will be no repetition at least in the present instance I shall support any move in committee for a definite fixation of the total amount of bounty.","N/A","FINANCIAL RELIEF BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/speech[16]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Had he given that information before the luncheon adjournment, the passage of this bill might have been speedier. TheActing Minister complains that he cannot give the information sought without closing the debate, but his last interjection shows that he can, without rising in his place, answer some of the inquiries of honorable members. All that we seek is information. I hope that in the future, as in the past, not one penny of this bounty will be paid for other than fertilizers actually used. I agree with the policy underlying the bill, even in cases in which the recipient of the bounty is not in grave financial difficulties. It is a good thing to subsidize farmers to increase their production so long as a market can be found for the things which they produce. The greatest problem confronting the farming community is the finding of markets. The Acting Minister for Commerce recently journeyed overseas in an endeavour to find markets for Australian goods. The Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties (Sir Henry Gullett) also travelled extensively with the object of arranging trade treaties with other countries and finding markets for Australian produce, but so far, no report from him has been presented to Parliament. If markets could be found for our agricultural products, the supply of fertilizers to farmers to increase their production would be more than justified, because increased production from the land would mean increased work for not only those engaged in rural production but also transport workers, waterside workers and others. Moreover, increased production under those conditions would hasten the recovery of the labour market. I congratulate the Government on making fertilizers available to primary producers, but I regret that the money was not made available earlier instead of keeping Parliament closed month after month and then trying to rush legislation through this House without affording an opportunity to discuss it properly. It is not right that this House should be asked to pass legislation in this way merely in order that the Senate need not sit next week.","N/A","FINANCIAL RELIEF BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/speech[17]/continue[10]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Yesterday he had in his hand a number of typewritten explanations.

Although large sums of money have been invested in other industries which are now languishing, the Government makes no attempt to assist them by means of bounties, notwithstanding that they are just as important to the nations welfare as are those which are helped from time to time. The Labour party does not oppose the granting of assistance to primary producers who are suffering from the depression or from the lack of markets, but it does object to wealthy farmers who are not in need of assistance participating in bounties. It objects most strongly to members of this Parliament who are wealthy farmers voting to grant money out of the public treasury to themselves. It is interesting to contrast the attitude of the present composite Government towards bounties to farmers with that of the one-party Government which preceded it. Before the coalition, the Government of the day favoured the payment of bounties only to those farmers who had no taxable income, but later, there was a change of policy, and bounties were made payable to all farmers, whether in necessitous circumstances or not. It is evident that the Country party does not represent the struggling farmers.

One industry in particular, the claims of which I have advocated from time to time, is deserving of some assistance to enable it to regain the overseas trade it has lost. In South Africa, assistance is given not only to primary production, but also to the mining industry - by means of a bounty on export coal. When we have asked for such a bounty, we have received very little consideration from the Government, particularly the Country party section of it. That party should adopt a more humane view of the needs of other languishing industries, the employees in which are on the bread line and suffer the pangs of hunger. It would appear that the Government does not intend to assist any industry that has not sufficient representation in this House to bring political pressure to bear upon it, definitely proving that its only consideration is political expediency.Question resolved in the affirmative.Bill read a second time.In committee:Clause 1 agreed to.Clause 2 (Appropriation for Relief to Primary Producers).","N/A","FINANCIAL RELIEF BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/speech[18]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

256,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BARNARD, Herbert","JNX","Bass","N/A","N/A",160,".- In view of the nature of a reply which the Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons) gave to a question which I asked upon notice to-day, I direct attention to the unfair treatment that is being meted out to Tasmania in connexion with the making of Commonwealth grants to necessitous States. I desire that the recommendation of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, in its report of last year, be fully honoured. The recommendations of the commission in respect of South Australia and Western Australia have been adopted by the Government, but its recommendation in regard to Tasmania has not been approved. Repeated requests have been made ever since the publication of the report that the Government should give effect to the recommendation contained in it in regard to Tasmania, but so far without success. The recommendation appears on pages 82 and 83 of the report. I do not wish to read it again for it already appears in Hansard. The Commonwealth Grants Commission was appointed by the Lyons Government and made a careful and exhaustive inquiry into the circumstances of the three claimant States. I can see no reason why the Government should differentiate against Tasmania seeing that it has, for many years now, been doing its utmost to conserve its resources and live within its means. No justification can be advanced for giving better treatment to other States which have not such a satisfactory record in this regard. The social services of Tasmania have, for many years, been on a lower scale than those of other States. Unfortunately this is not the first occasion on which the recommendations of a royal commission appointed to consider the granting of financial assistance to Tasmania have been disregarded. The Lockyer royal commission submitted a comprehensive report in 1926 on the whole subject. On that occasion Sir Nicholas Lockyer, who was sole commissioner, made the following recommendations for the assistance of Tasmania : -A loan, free of interest, in instalments, as may be required, but not exceeding a total sum of £1,000,000, for the development of agricultural and horticultural resources.A special grant of £300,000 a year for ten years, conditional on certain reductions in State taxation on land and incomes.£50,000 a year for afforestation in Tasmania, under Commonwealth control and supervision.£500,000 to relieve Tasmania of part of the capital cost of the hydro-electric scheme, on condition that any further extension or expenditure be recommended by a board of experts approved by the Commonwealth Government.A sum of £20,000 per annum for ten years for a geological survey.A special grant for the construction of a road from Lake St. Clair to Gormanston, the State to find 15s. for every £1 of the amount of the grant, and £25,000 a year for ten years towards the maintenance of State trunk roads, under similar conditions.The present Prime Minister of the Commonwealth (Mr. Lyons) was then the Premier of Tasmania, and he, together with members of both Houses of the State Parliament, expressed considerable disappointment at the failure of the Commonwealth to implement the report. Both Houses of the State Parliament carried motions to that effect. To put it in popular language, the report on that occasion was treated as  a scrap of paper . Apparently that is also to be the fate of the report made last year by the Commonwealth Grants Commission in so far as it affects Tasmania although it is substantially the same as the Lockyer report. In reply to the question I asked him to-day on this subject, the Prime Minister stated : -So far as the recommendation regarding forestry is concerned, the Commonwealth has agreed to make further grants to Tasmania, as well as the other States, in 1936-37 and 1937-38. The original grant to Tasmania for forestry, which was authorized in April, 1935, was £25,000. Of this amount, £19,000 has so far been drawn by the State and a balance of £6,000 remains. For 1936-37, the Commonwealth proposes to recommend to Parliament the granting of £12,500 to Tasmania for forestry, and a further £0,250 in the following year. The whole position in regard to grants to Tasmania will be further considered Uy the Government at the end of the present financial year.The Government and people of Tasmania regard the position as most unsatisfactory. The recommendation of the commission was adopted as regards other States, but not completely honoured in the case of Tasmania. That State expects a long-term grant on the lines recommended by the commission, so that its forestry policy may be developed, am i this important, but wasting asset, coneserved. Apparently the position of Tasmania, as regards Commonwealth forestry policy, has been considered  in relation to the claims of other States, and Tasmania has received its share of the grant; but that is not what was recommended by the Grants Commission. If its recommendation is not to be honoured, what is the use of incurring expenditure in inquiring into the disabilities of a State? I hope that the Government will give some consideration to the requests made by the Premier of Tasmania and other State Ministers, and to the representations made by Tasmanian members in this House. 1 enter my strong protest against the Governments failure to give full effect to the recommendation of the commission, and I sincerely hope that the matter will receive further consideration.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I have mentioned this matter on several occasions during the last six or seven years, and I understand that an amount has been placed on the Estimates to provide for a new building. When last I spoke on this subject, I was informed that plans had been prepared and that the work would be put in hand as soon as possible. As nothing has been done since then, I shall be obliged if the Minister will inform me what has become of the plans, and if it is the intention of the Government to carry out the work. Rundle-street is the principal shopping thoroughfare ofAdelaide, and the present post office is an absolute disgrace. On a former occasion I likened the existing building to a pawnbrokers shop, and as the condition of the building is now worse than it was, I doubt that a respectable pawnbroker would care to occupy it. As South Australia is this year celebrating its centenary, I hope that the Minister will make inquiries and endeavour to expedite the work.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I understand that the Government of Victoria, as well as the Government of New Zealand, has taken action to appoint a royal commission to inquire into tha stability of the company. On the 30th January, the Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons), in reply to a deputation, promised that the matter would be referred to the Attorney-Generals Department. Probably this has been done, and I have been asked to inquire if any advice had been received, and also to do what I can to expedite action, because Australian shareholders are very much concerned about their position.I also ask the honorable gentleman if ho will ascertain what steps have been taken to effect repairs to the post office garage in South Melbourne.
