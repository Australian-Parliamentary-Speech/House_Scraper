The honorable member never used the whip until he had resorted to a good deal of suasion, and had asked for some consideration for the delinquent. The honorable member for Riverina is not exactly the father of the House - that is a position to which I aspire - but he has been in politics much longer than I have, having had considerable experience in the State Parliament of New South Wales, as well as in the National Parliament.

I denied at the time the accuracy of his statement, and was threatened with expulsion; but the proof of the Hansard report furnished to me next day showed that I had spoken on the clause only once.

80,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MALONEY, William","KLM","Melbourne","ALP; FLP from 1931; ALP from 1936","N/A",63,". - Than a lawyer, I know nobody more able to ,put up a case for or against than is the Treasurer (Mr. Watt) . Possibly the profession of the law allows a man to become a sophist. I am sorry to say that the Treasurer is a sophist; to would argue either way. This election is just another phase of the division of the spoils of office. The Ministerial candidate is one of the six survivors of the noble fourteen who left a certain room upstairs when the present Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes), after holding the position of chairman of the party for two days and one night, was afraid to put to the meeting a motion concerning his leadership. The chairmanship is one of the paid positions of the House. With new recruits, the National Labour party number nine, and they have already more than their fair proportion of offices. I accuse the honorable member for Riverina (Mr. Chanter) of having been absolutely unjust while he occupied the position of Chairman. Following the occasion on which I was ordered out of the House - the first time in a parliamentary career of thirty years - the Chairman left the chair, walked on to the floor of the House, and, by his remarks, rubbed the salt into the open wound. I placed the incident on record! in Hansard in the form of a sworn declaration. On a subsequent date the Labour Whip told me that my declaration was being discussed in the House. I came into the House, and the Minister for the Navy appealed to me to agree to expunge the declaration from the records of the House. He stated that the declaration had been read when the House was in Committee, and was, therefore, out of order. The honorable member for Riverina (Mr. Chanter), as Chairman of Committees, should have known whether the reading of the document was in accordance with the Standing Orders. However, I was in a good humour when the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) appealed to me, and, after first requesting that a member from each side of the House should be chosen to investigate the matter, and decide whether the Chairman or I was in the wrong, I agreed to leave the matter in his hands. Ultimately the honorable member for Riverina would not indorse his statement. All that. I desired him to do was to admit that he had made a mistake. I did not want an apology from a man older in years than I am. He would not acknowledge that he was wrong. The sworn declaration was expunged from the records. The Minister for the Navy kept his contract. I remember him saying to the Chairman,  If I were you, sir, I would withdraw and apologize, and so have done with the matter. I told the honorable member for Riverina that if he swore a declaration that my statement was wrong, I would prosecute him for perjury. I could do nothing more. He accused me of going into his district on one occasion to speak against his re-election. The only time I went into his electorate during elections was when I went, at my own expense, to urge the Labour branches of the district to adopt him as their candidate. His own common sense ought to have told him that my constituents required my presence in Melbourne during an election at which I was opposed. Even now, if the honorable gentleman will say that he regretted that he made a mistake, I will accept his word willingly. I come now to a humorous incident. Did not he, when Chairman, call me to order, and ask me to sit down, when I was singing God Save the King*! And did I not tell him and the Ministry that I would see them damned first? Whenever I am singing God Save the King, or whatever is the national song of the British race, I shall sing it standing. If the discussion to-day does nothing else, it will at least prove to the honorable member for Riverina that he, like others, is fallible. It would have been better if he, acting on the advice of the Minister for the Navy, had acknowledged that he had made a mistake, instead of compelling me to take the advantage of an opportunity, which occurs only once in three years, to register my protest. Let any honorable member read the declaration, and ask himself if any man could do more to prove that he had all the evidence on his side.","N/A","CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Concerning the remarks of the honorable member for Yarra (Mr. Tudor) I am able to state  that everything he said regarding what happened upon the occasion in question is absolutely accurate. I can, from my own recollection, confirm his account. But, with regard to the implication that the Chairman of Committees in the last Parliament (the Hon. J. M.

From whatever side of the House a member is chosen to occupy the position of a presiding officer, we have a right to look to him to deal out evenhanded justice. I know that there have been times when we have had an all-night sitting, after a long day in Committee, and without any sleep, when we say and do things which we afterwards regret. We usually find that if a man has made a mistake he has been ready to make amends. In the first words which I spoke here I said that it was likely that I would say and do things on the spur of the moment which I might afterwards have cause to regret, but that if I did I hoped that; I would always be found sufficiently manly to admit my mistake and own up, whether that involved a public apology or not.","N/A","CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The evidence which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Tudor) has presented this morning shows conclusively that the gentleman who occupied the position of Chairman of Committees in the last Parliament made a mistake, and failed to admit it. I think that he ought now, even at the eleventh hour, to admit the mistake he made. A man who shows himself reluctant to admit that he made a mistake is likely, in the position of Chairman of Committees, to commit grievous errors in the future. I feel sure that if it had been the Prime Minister who suffered as the result of the mistake made by the honorable member for Riverina as Chairman of Committees in the last Parliament, he would have been only too ready to admit his mistake, but because it was the Leader of the Opposition who suffered as the result of his mistake, he is not prepared to admit it, even at the eleventh hour.","N/A","CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[8]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It should be remembered, also, that the honorable member for Yarra deports himself in the* Chamber in a way which honorable members generally might well follow. He is amongst the least offensive members of the House, and is prompt in obeying the demands of the Chair. I have pleasure in seconding the amendment moved by the honorable member for Darling (Mr. Blakeley), in order that honorable members may he given an opportunity to show that they do not approve of some of the actions of the Chairman of Committees in the last Parliament, and may be able to record their votes against his election on this occasion.There seems to be a happy combination between the so-called Nationalist party and the so-called Country party.We have had an impassioned address by the honorable member for Grampians (Mr. Jowett), who urged the House to be unanimous in. placing the honorable member for Riverina in the chair as Chairman of Committees of this Parliament.

The honorable member for Grampians has given the show away. I remember that, in connexion with a Wheat Commission which was inquiring in Adelaide, a statement was made to the effect that there was no combination and no Trust, but there was an honorable understanding, and it appears to me that the Prime Minister and his party have an honorable understanding if not with the Country party, them with the officials of that party, including the honorable member for Grampians. It is idle for us to nominate a candidate from this side. This is supposed to be an election by the House, but we know that it has been fixed up. Directly I came to Melbourne a member of the Farmers party told me that the honorable member for Lang (Mr. Johnson) was going to be Speaker, and the honorable member for Riverina (Mr. Chanter) was going to be Chairman of Committees. That is a peculiar thing, but he was a good tipster, if he was nothing else. If the officials of the party had not been discussing this particular matter, the individual members had evidently been discussing it among themselves. To debate the election of Chairman of Committees is beating the air, because it is a foregone conclusion that the honorable member for Riverina (Mr. Chanter) is to be the man.

Before I agree to the motion to go into Committee of Supply I wish to hear from the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, or from one of the Ministers, something in regard to what I consider has been extravagant and reckless expenditure on the part of the Government. Honorable members may smile, but I am sure that the majority of the people of Australia is anxious to have some particulars in regard to this matter. It is strange, indeed, that the Auditor-Generals report, which was issued about eight months ago, was laid on the table of this House only yesterday. I have not had an opportunity of perusing it, and I do not believe it has been printed or made available, to honorable members. I notice, however, from the press that there are certain items of expenditure and certain losses on which some information should be given. I refer to a statement in the daily press of to-day, headed  Shipping Losses, which reads -Details are furnished of the loss entailed upon the Commonwealth in connexion with shipbuilding in America. An agreement was made with the Patterson, McDonald Shipbuilding Company, Seattle, to construct ten wooden cargo-carrying steamers at a cost of 5,300,000 dollars. Subsequently the contract was so amended that the cost would have been 8,900,000 dollars. Advice had, Mr. Israel added, been received that eight of the ships had been sold at a loss of £326,000. In view of the enormous increase in cost compared with the original contract, a very fortunate sale would appear to have been made.I wish to know what the Government have to say in regard to that. The paper from which this statement is taken supports the Government - I do not know upon what grounds - and the statement concludes,  a very fortunate sale would appear to have been made. The people of this country, as well as the members of this House, should have some explanation, and I am sure the primary producers in particular will want to know more about it.","Government Expenditure - Shipping Losses - Directorate of War Propaganda - Cancellation of Shipbuilding Contracts - Marine Engineers Strike - Cost of Living - Profiteering : War Precautions Act","SUPPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It had a very brief existence, and cost £2,266;I want to know all about that, and the reason for its discontinuance. It may be that Ministers are able to give some satisfactory explanation, and, if so, well and good. The report also refers to the cancellation of a contract with the Wallace Power Boat Company Limited, in the following terms: -Cancellation of a contract with the Wallace Power Boat Company Limited, of New South Wales, for the construction of six wooden barquentines cost, including progress payments, £51,839, while the cancellation of another contract with Hughes, Martin, and Washington Limited, New South Wales, cost £72,500.Why was it necessary to cancel those contracts, and why was such a loss incurred ?","Government Expenditure - Shipping Losses - Directorate of War Propaganda - Cancellation of Shipbuilding Contracts - Marine Engineers Strike - Cost of Living - Profiteering : War Precautions Act","SUPPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If they can give an explanation, let them give it. I am also anxious to know before the House resolves itself into a Committee of Supply, who bore the expense in connexion with the hold-up of shipping, arising out of the dispute with the Institute of Marine Engineers. I want to know whether a large proportion of that expense of holding up ships which do not belong to the Commonwealth, was borne by the Commonwealth Government. It is a most important matter, in which a very large majority of the people of Australia are interested, and if that expense was borne by the Government, we should have a full statement of the reasons why. I cannot go categorically into all the matters I wish to refer to, upon which the Government could be criticised at this moment, but there are some things on which it is appropriate a pronouncement should be made at the earliest possible moment, because they are of vital importance, affecting as they do the interests of the whole of the people.

That proclamation, which prevented a body of men from making use of their own funds for the maintenance of their wives and families without the consent of the Attorney-General, was ample evidence of the view which the Attorney-General (Mr. Hughes) holds of the powers the Government possess under the War Precautions Act. Otherwise it was a gigantic piece of bluff on the part of the Government in order to achieve the result they desired. As I was saying, the Government, at the height of their power, when there could be no dispute as to their having complete authority under the War Precautions Act, repealed all regulations which had any bearing upon a reduction- in the cost of living in Australia.
