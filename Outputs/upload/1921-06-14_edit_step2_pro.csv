This House, however, sits longer than any other legislative body in the Empire, excepting the House of Commons; and I am not quite clear that, taking the whole year through, we do not sit as long as the House of Commons. In Canada, Parliament sits for four or five months in the year, and, in South Africa, for four months. Here we are sitting almost perpetually.

I cannot understand that he should fail to foresee the trouble which is brewing for city workers with the discouragement, if not the destruction, of primary industries. It has been suggested during the deliberations of the Committee that I am delaying progress and generally incurring unnecessary expense to the country. But I am. here to put the case for those engaged in primary production; and, although there may be very little result from my efforts in this Chamber, I trust and expect that it will be perceived elsewhere, and in the country. The people to-day are realizing that every action or decision of this Government tends, as a whole, to increase concentration in the great cities. Already the evil resulting from concentration is apparent in the large numbers of unemployed to be found to-day in several of the State capitals. In the course of discussing the rates of duties as set out in the schedule, and as proposed to be amended by the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Greene), no effort has been made to prove. that the various increases have become necessary for the welfare of Australian industries. There has been much talk about a proposed Board of Trade; but nothing has been said of the fact that a Board of Trade was appointed by the Government nearly two years ago. Has that Board, tendered any report concerning any of the grave matters which have come before the Committee during the Tariff discussion? Has the Board offered any opinions or recommendations? So far as honorable members have been advised, it has neither prepared nor presented any report concerning the huge increases of Customs duties. Another significant fact is that, in all that has been said during the deliberations of this Committee, honorable members have not been informed that either the primary producer or the importer or the consumer has been consulted. It appears that only one section of the community has been approached, and that is the section represented by the Chamber of Manufactures. There have been speeches by the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes), the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Joseph Cook), the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Greene), and other members of the Government, one after another. All are in accord in realizing the effects of the war. They have impressed upon the public two great essentials for the well-being of Australia - the one being increased population, and the other enhanced production. I agree that without the latter, certainly, we shall never be able to pay off Australias tremendous war debt. Without a big increase of population, the burden of taxation per head must become unbearable. Considerable expenditure is now being devoted to immigration. Are the newcomers being conveyed here for the purpose of entering our factories; or are we going to ask them, and our own young Australians as they grow up, to go out on the land and take up the heavy responsibilities involved in primary production to-day, while at the same time adding the further handicap of huge imposts by way of Customs duties? If industries are to be built up here, why should not the whole community share fairly in carrying the burden? It is grossly unfair that one section should be loaded with the whole. I can only express the hope that punishment will fall upon this Government similar to that which was meted out  to the Government who stood behind the McKinley Tariff, in theUnited States of America ; that is to say, that they will be promptly kicked out. Can it be shown by the Minister, or by any one else, that Australian manufactures are languishing? Can it be demonstrated that imports are alarmingly increasing, and that business is being taken away from our own manufacturers? I can show by statistics that such is not the case. It cannot be seriously suggested that our manufacturers are becoming impoverished. In all that has been said for the latter, no word has been heard about the grave injury which is threatening the Australian consumer. As for the Australian worker, I yield to none in my admiration for him.  During the great struggle no man of any of the nations showed finer initiative, sounder judgment, or greater courage. Surely, then, those same characteristics should make the Australian worker, as a factory employee, second to none. What with the natural protection afforded to our manufacturers, together with the consideration which has been given them by the framers of past Tariffs, they should be able to stand  on their own  to-day. I shall show that the agricultural machinery industry has prospered in Australia under the moderate duties that have been imposed in the past. One of the reasons given in support of high protective duties is the alleged low rate of wages paid by manufacturers outside of Australia, and I intend to expose that fallacy. I can show from Canadian and Australian statistics that the employees in this industry in Canada to-day are paid at a far higher rate than are those in Australia. I can show also that when, in 1914, the Inter-State Commission was giving special consideration to the question of increased duties, there was no request made for increased duties by the big manufacturers of agricultural implements in Australia. I intend to show further that, relatively to production and population, New Zealand manufactures more agricultural machinery than does Australia, and that machinery is sold more cheaply in New Zealand than it is here.","In Committee of Ways and Means:","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

66,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"GREGORY, Henry","KFE","N/A","N/A","N/A",9001,"- I intend to take up some time in the consideration of this question, and, amongst other things, I intend to let honorable members know that the farmer in Canada can purchase agricultural machinery for about half the price that has to be paid for it in Australia. The natural protection from Canada averages nearly 50 per cent., including freight, insurance, and exchange. With a duty of 45 per cent., and taking present exchange values with an allowance for freight and insurance as well, the Tariff protection from Canada works out at 62.59 per cent., or nearly 63 per cent. I have mentioned some of the questions I intend to raise on this item, and they should be fully answered before these onerous duties are placed on this class of machinery. In connexion with this industry, I wish to make some comparisons between Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. Honorable members will understand that I quote from reports and- from statistics taken from the latest Tear-Books available. I have said that this industry has made progress in Australia under the low Tariff we had in existence up to 1911. In 1908, the number of persons employed in the industry here was 3,134, and the annual production amounted in value to Â£879,000. In 1911, the number employed in the industry had increased to 5,156, and the value of the annual production to Â£1,656,000, or an increase of nearly 100 per cent., in three years. Another satisfactory feature was that the value of production per employee increased in the same period from Â£281 in 1908 to Â£322 in 1911. Whilst the value of local production was nearly doubled in the period, importations did not increase in the same way. The percentage of imports to local production in this industry in 1908 was 30 per cent. ; in 1909, 24 per cent.; in 1910, 27 per cent.; and in 1911, 27 per cent.; an average during those years of, roughly, 25 per cent. In the years following, there was a decline in local production due to many causes, and amongst them the drought and the war. The average percentage of imports to local production in 1913 was 25 per cent. ; in 1914, 26 per cent. ; in 1915, 28 per cent. ; in 1916, 19 per cent. ; in 1917, 25 per cent. ; and in 1918, 32 per cent. I should like honorable members to pay particular attention to these figures, because they show that, roughly, 25 per cent, of the agricultural machinery used in Australia has been imported, and 75 per cent, of it has been locally manufactured. The reason why I wish to make this quite clear is that every Â£1 imposed by way of duty means actually, Â£4 added to the price of the article to the consumer. Despite what the Minister has said, there cannot be the slightest doubt that the local manufacturer has kept his prices well up to what similar agricultural machinery can be sold for by the importer.","In Committee of Ways and Means:","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I received a most important letter about four months ago from the president of the Stock-owners Association of New South Wales, in which he told me that people were attending sales, and paying fabulous prices for old machinery, which was subsequently repaired and made effective, because of the heavy cost of new machinery. It is clear, therefore, that, owing to the war and increased prices, a falling off in production: was natural in the period to which I have referred. There was also a reduction in our exports of agricultural machinery from Australia. In this connexion, I propose to quote a statement made by Mr. Walmsley, who was a member of the Tariff Commission in 1906, and who deals with this phase of the question. He says -The Commonwealth Year-Book, which is simply an official compilation of facts, vol. 7, 1914, page 482, says: - The following table shows the progress of this industry to have been very satisfactory. During the four years the number of establishments increased 13* per cent., the number of employees 51 per cent., and the value of plants and machinery 107 per cent.That was during the operation of the 1908-11 Tariff. Volume X. of the YearBooh for 1917, page 494, says : -The following table shows the progress of this industry in the five years, 1910-15, to have been very satisfactory. A general decline has taken place during the latter part of the period, attributable to various causes, the recent drought, and a reduction of exports to other countries being the principal contributing factors.","In Committee of Ways and Means:","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The honorable gentlemans statement may have been correct, but if he referred to agricultural machinery, it was his duty, before making it, to consult the importers with the object of ascertaining their views upon the Question. Evidently he did not do that. When we consider the effects of the war, coupled with the loss of our export trade, we shall see that there has been no falling-off in production, so far as the industry in Australia is concerned. It has been carried on successfully under the low duties which were operating, particularly in 1908 and 1913, when the industry made much greater strides than it has made at any later period.","In Committee of Ways and Means:","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[13]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I invite my Labour friends opposite, who so strenuously support the imposition of high duties, to carefully examine figures which I am about to submit in this connexion. The contention that the wages paid in Canada are much lower than those paid in Australia, and that, therefore, the imported article can be produced much cheaper there than it can be manufactured locally, is absolutely false, and false to the knowledge of those who make it. The fact is indisputable that the wages paid in Australia are very much lower than are the wages paid in Canada. The particulars which I am about to quote are taken from the Commonwealth Year-Boole No. XII. for the year 1918, and the Census of Manufacturers for the Dominion of Canada for the same year. In Australia the salaried employees numbered 346, and the average salary paid to them was Â£170 2s. In Canada there were 1,129 salaried employees whose average salary was Â£292 10s. In Australia, for 2,.846 operatives, their wages averaged Â£129 18s. In Canada, the factory operatives numbered 8,966, and their average wage was Â£192 12s. It cannot, therefore, be argued that the imposition of higher duties is necessary because the wages paid in Australia are higher than those which are paid in Canada. As a matter of fact, the wage-earners of the industry in the Commonwealth receive upon an average 32Â½ per cent. less than do the employees of the industry in Canada, whilst, taking all hands into consideration, the wages paid in Australia are 34 per cent. less than those paid in Canada for the whole year. When we were dealing with the iron duties, I pointed out how coal has to be imported by Canada for industrial purposes, and how the manufacturers of that Dominion have to compete with the manufacturers of the United States of America. They have to face similar competition in regard to agricultural machinery.","In Committee of Ways and Means:","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[14]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The cost of living in Australia has been high, and wages here ought not to be below those ruling in Canada. I should like to see our workmen getting wages equal to, or even higher than, those paid in any other country. But when we come to look at the added value of this class of machinery, we see at once that there must be something wrong with our manufacturers or our workmen, since we ought to be able to do at least as well as Canada in manufacturing agricultural implements and machinery. The added value of Australian agricultural implements works out at Â£652,406, or equal to Â£196 per person employed, while in Canada the added value works out at Â£3,506,760, or Â£347 10s. per person employed. The value of plant and machinery, is scheduled at Â£355,830 in Australia, which is equal to Â£107 per employee, while in Canada, at the time covered by these statistics, it was Â£1,194,506, or Â£118 per employee. If we divide the gross value of production by the total number of persons employed, we shall arrive,, at the average value of the work done by each employee, and we shall find that in the case of Australia at this time it amounted to Â£424 6s. per head, while in Canada it was Â£690 10s. per head. These facts demand careful consideration. If our manufacturers are not following up-to-date methods, if they are not making the best use of the protection which has been afforded them by putting down complete plants, so as to be able to turn out their manufactures at the lowest rates, is it fair that other sections of the community should be called upon to carry these imposts in order that they may be protected? I think I have shown clearly that Australian workmen in this industry do not receive anything like the pay received by Canadian workmen, and that the value of the output per employee in Canada is considerably more than it is in Australia.","In Committee of Ways and Means:","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[15]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

106,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"GREGORY, Henry","KFE","N/A","N/A","N/A",9005,"- I am quoting a member of the Tariff Commission of 1906, and I take his statements as being absolutely correct, as I think they will be found to be. When the Minister (Mr. Greene) was speaking on the Tariff he said -There are some subsidized freights in existence at the present moment. I can quote one instance which has come under my notice. I cannot give the particulars, because I have them in confidence, but I can give the figures. The ordinary freight at the present time is Â£10 per ton on a certain article; yet one firm is able to bring it to Australia at the rate of Â£1 per ton.I am assuming that the Minister was referring then to agricultural machinery from Canada and the United States of America, and, if that be so, the honorable gentlemans reference was incorrect. The following is information supplied by importers of that machinery: - The steamer freight rate on agricultural machinery from the east cost of America - Montreal, and St. Johns, Canada, and New York, United States of America - for the year 1911-12 was 20s. per ton; for the year 1912-13 it was 22s. 6d. per ton; for the year 1913-14 it was 27s. 6d. per ton. In the early part of 1914 an effort was being made to establish a new shipping line in the American-Australian trade. Agents for some of the old lines offered the agricultural implement concerns and some other large shippers a five-years contract at an average rate for the whole period to the five principal Australian ports of 22s. 6d. per ton. The contract was accepted by both the International Harvester Company and Massey-Harris Company. That contract was effective from 1st June, 1914, to 31st May, 1919, and to the credit of the shipping companies, it can be said that they honoured their contract through that troublesome period, and gave the shippers their fair share of space in every ship they loaded for Australia, although many of their charters cost them from Â£8 to Â£10 and more per ton. Had they wished to do so, the machinery companies could have made enormous profits for themselves out of the contract by charging their Australian customers the prevailing rates ; but they did not do so. Their retail prices throughout the whole period were based on the average rate of 22s. 6d. per ton, and the farmers of Australia, instead of the importing implement companies, got the full benefit of this exceptionally favorable contract, which accounted for the moderate prices of imported machinery in Australia during the war period. At 1st June, 1919, the rate on agricultural machinery from America to Australia was increased to 67s. 6d. per ton, three times the average rate that prevailed during the war period, which has been, next to the increased Customs duties, a most important factor in fixing the present high prices for farm machinery. The Minister laid great stress on the small quantities of machinery being manufactured inFree Trade New Zealand, and I said that I would show that, so far as population and production are concerned, they produce more than is produced in Australia.","In Committee of Ways and Means:","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[23]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

To continue the information I have - The acreage under wheat, oats, and barley, the three principal cereal crops in both countries, was, for the year 1918-19, 9,013,166 in Australia. The total wages paid to the employees in the Australian agricultural implement factories in the same year was Â£428,522, which equals11Â½d. per acre. The finished value of the product of the Australian agricultural machinery factories for the same year was Â£1,415,375, equalling 3s. 2d. per acre. The New Zealand acreage for the same year for the same crops was 399,469. Note the difference between the small area in New Zealand and the large area here. The wages paid to agricultural machinery employees for the year was Â£128,185, equalling 6s. 5d. per acre. The total value of the finished product of the New Zealand factories for the year was Â£380,044, equalling 19s. per acre. The population of Australia for 1919 was 5,247,019. The wages paid in the industry equalled1s. 8d. per head. The value of the finished product was 5s. 5d. per head. In New Zealand the population that year was 1,164,405. The wages paid per head of population was 2s. 3d. The value of the finished product per lead was 6s. 6d. In the case of New Zealand, the population test is scarcely a fair one, for the reason that the population has been increasing there in about the same proportion as it has in Australia, while the acreage under crop has been decreasing. The acreage under the above three crops in New Zealand for the year 1909-10 was 729,500. For 1919 it was 399,469. In Australia the acreage in 1909-10 was 8,157,568, in 1919, 9,013,166. That calculation shows the wages to be 11Â½d. per acre in Australia, as against 6s. 5d. per acre in New Zealand, while the value of the production was 3s. 2d. per acre in Australia, as against 19s. in.

It seemed hardly worth while to deal with that phase of the matter, but, perhaps, it will be just as well to do so, because I want to get these facts into Hansard, so that the people may know them. The Minister has been getting information from the Argentine, and has been asked how and from whom he obtained it, but he has not told us. It would be just as well if he did tell us how he obtains his information about prices in that country. A considerable time ago there was a good deal of comment on the difference in the prices of agricultural machinery in the Argentine and here; but I wish to deal more exhaustively to-day with the question of the prices in Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. I will come back to the question of the Argentine prices later on if necessary, merely emphasizing the fact that the reaper-thresher never could be considered to be properly upon the market there. Several machines were sent there, but they were never an unqualified success, for. several reasons, which I do not propose to go into now. As to reaper-threshers now being tried in the Argentine, they are engine-driven machines, quite different in design and construction from those which are being sold in Australia . Up to the present time none of these machines (have been sold in the Argentine. The International Harvester people are still engaged in developing the machine which they desire to put on the Argentine market.The Minister compared the prices of different machines in New Zealand and Australia, notably disc ploughs, spring tine harrows, grain drills, and fertilizer drills. Why those machines, which have scarcely any sale in New Zealand, were selected it is difficult to understand. I have the following information: -In pre-war times prices in New Zealand were, on the average, lower than in Australia, although the cost of delivering them, as well as distributing expenses, was much higher. Freight rates from the east coast of America to New Zealand were then from 10 per cent, to 15 per cent, higher than to Australia. On account of the broken nature of the country it has been found necessary to have distributing warehouses in the four leading cities, while only one for a much larger business is required in each of the Australian States. Distributing expenses in New Zealand average from 15 per cent, to 20 per cent, higher than in Australia. In Australia farm machinery is sold on the basis of delivery on rails at the station nearest the manufacturers or distributors place of business; the farmer pays the outward railage. In New Zealand the practice is to prepay carriage to the farmers nearest railway station or wharf, and the cost of it, estimated at 3i per cent., is added to the retail price. Then the equipment of some machines in New Zealand is materially different from the same machine in Australia. For instance, in Australia, drills are fitted with steel road wheels, while in New Zealand wooden road wheels, which cost more, are used.","In Committee of Ways and Means:","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[33]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Owing to the difference in seasons New Zealand price lists are usually issued about six months later than in Australia, and some interested parties, when it suited their purpose, have been known to compare current Australian prices with the preceding seasons prices in New Zealand. By reason of its more regular seasons, New Zealand has closely sold out its supplies yearly at prices based on the landed cost of the importations during the year, while quite the reverse has been the case in Australia, where it frequently happened that the machines sold were imported two or three years previously at lower invoice prices and with lower freights, and as prices there were also made on the basis of landed cost, they were, for the time being, more favorable to Australian than to New Zealand purchasers.","In Committee of Ways and Means:","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[34]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

While I was speaking on the first item, the honorable member for Wakefield (Mr. Richard Foster) interjected: - The price quoted here for the imported reaper and binder was Â£130, but as soon as Mr. McKay quoted Â£100 for his machine, the price of the imported article dropped. The explanation is this : The Australian retail price for a Massey-Harris 6-feet reaper and binder for the 1920 harvest was Â£102 payable after harvest. As forward orders for harvesting machines are booked all through the year, it became necessary to fix a price for binders for the 1921 harvest soon after the new Tariff was brought down, and a price list was issued on 19th July, 1920, in which the price for the 6-feet reaper and binder was fixed at Â£130, which included the duty of 45 per cent. under the new Tariff. Honorable members are aware that in March of last year the new Tariff was introduced, which* imposed a duty of 45 per cent. on reapers and binders, but it did not become operative until the 1st January of this year. However, a large number of reapers and binders arrived in December too late for delivery for the 1920 harvest, before the new duty came into effect, but after the High Court decision was announced under which the Customs Department charged duty on the exchange. It is those reapers and binders, carried over from 1920, that are now listed at Â£105 for the 1921 harvest. Had they paid the new 45 per cent. duty and the duty on exchange, their price would not have been less than Â£135. The price established by McKay had nothing whatever to do with the question.Mr.Richard Foster. - The only trouble is that they did not quote the lower price until McKay quoted Â£100.","In Committee of Ways and Means:","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[52]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Massey-Harris Company has supplied me with figures showing the actual cost of importing a 4Â½-feet mower, which was landed in Melbourne last December from the steam-ship Virgilia, and a cultivator, which was landed here on the 30th March last from the steam-shipPort Hacking. These are the figures giving the cost of importing the mower: -N/AA duty of 10 per cent., which was formerly the rate, would have amounted to Â£1 10s. 2d. on par value, or to Â£1 17s. 9d. on commercial exchange value.","In Committee of Ways and Means:","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[61]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We ask that these items be reconsidered. Should the agricultural machinery industry need assistance, let it be given by way of a bounty. Our manufacturing industries, however, made greater progress under low duties than they have made since many of the rates were increased by the 1914 Tariff. The present Tariff will injure the producer, and I do not think it will benefit the workers, although it plays into the hands of Trusts and monopolies, and tends to increase their number.. Honorable members know how the promises that were made when machinery duties were increased in 1908 have been broken. The farmer does not know from day to day what return his industry, will yield him. He has to compete without protection in the markets of the world, and he deserves special consideration. Land has been falling out of cultivation, and though the area that is being cultivated has increased this year, that is due chiefly to the efforts of repatriated men to make homes for themselves. The man who goes out into the bush to win a livelihood by tilling land that has hitherto produced nothing, and cuts himself off from the advantages of civilization, often being unable to get schooling for his children or a proper mail service, is surely worthy of consideration. Yet, these duties fall wholly upon such men and other tillers of the soil.","In Committee of Ways and Means:","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[67]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We are charged with looking solely after the interests of the manufacturer, but we would rather do that than protect the importer. The honorable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) has referred to the Massey-Harris Company. I have a particular objection to that firm, because I believe it is worse than the International Harvester Company. In connexion with the assembling of these implements, the workmen are in a somewhat unfortunate position, as there is not a Federal award covering this particular trade. Victoria and South Australia are the principal manufacturing States, and operations are governed by the decisions of a Victorian Wages Board. Unfortunately, a mistake was made in preparing the Victorian rates and conditions, and the Massey-Harris Company and the International Harvester. Company are taking full advantage of the position. The representatives of the men had it arranged that these firms could not under-pay men, but under certain contract arrangements men are engaged in assembling the parts of agricultural implements at rates which do not allow them to earn a living wage. These firms, however, are controlled, to a certain extent, and we can demand from them wages and conditions which we cannot exact from importers.","In Committee of Ways and Means:","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

At present there is a good deal of unemployment, and these firms are taking full advantage of the situation by employing men to work at wages below those usually paid. Agricultural implements can be assembled by men who do not possess engineering skill, although a certain amount of mechanical knowledge is necessary. In many countries where there is over-production, the manufacturer is compelled to export his surplus to other countries, where, it is sold at a lower price than it is disposed of to the consumers in the country where it is manufactured. It is only six weeks ago that the South African farmers objected to Victorian wheat being dumped in that country, because it was detrimental to the interests of the South African producers. Australian wheat has been sold in South Africa at a lower rate than it was disposed of in the Commonwealth. The American manufacturers are not the only transgressors in this direction, because all manufacturers dispose of their over-production in a way that is detrimental to the interests of those in the countries from which they export. The honorable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) quoted the ruling prices in Canada, New Zealand, and Aus- . tralia, but Canada is really the same as the United States qf America, because the same firms are operating in the two countries, and the Tariff in the two countries is framed to suit the interests of both. The difference in the Canadian price of Â£61 and the New Zealand price of Â£97 is accounted for by extra profit, because in New Zealand there is no competition with the local manufacturer. If the New Zealand price is Â£97 and the Australian Â£102, the difference of Â£5 does not mean ruination to the Australian farmer. Surely the average agriculturist would be prepared to pay that amount if it would mean placing the industry on a sound basis and making the farmer independent of foreign manufacturers. I doubt very much whether, individually or collectively, the Australian wheat-growers would enter any protest if they realized that the imposition of the proposed duty would eventually be the means of placing them in a better position. I quite understand that the farmers representatives are advocating reductions because they fear that some injury will be inflicted, and if they do not protest they may have to explain. I believe that some farmers representatives are asked to make statements with which they do not agree.

They were not paying the wages that they should have paid in a country like Australia, and we desired increased duty to enable them to do so. If such increase had been injurious to the farmer, we would not have sought to impose it. But we knew, and we still know, that it was not injurious. We know, further, that without the imposition of additional duties the prices of imported machinery have gone up and up. The establishment of local factories tends, without doubt, to check importers. That has been proved in New Zealand. The figures which the honorable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) quoted in this respect were not accurate. I say that the machines are cheaper in Victoria, at any rate, than in New Zealand. But even the statistics which the honorable member gave proved that the importer is an exploiter. Unfortunately, he is often an individual whom we cannot get at, since the profits go elsewhere. I wish to quote some interesting figures for the particular benefit of country members. In the financial year 1905-6, the 5-ft. stripper-harvester cost the farmer Â£81. In 1909-10, the price was Â£70. The 6-ft. stripper-harvester in the earlier year was Â£94, and in the later period Â£78.

251,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MATHEWS, James","KNH","N/A","N/A","N/A",9016,"- There was in those days. I am told that there is very little to-day. It will astonish honorable members in the corner to learn that, over a five-year period, up to 1918, the duty which the farmer had to pay upon his imported implements amounted to about one-seventh of Id. per bushel on all the grain produced in the Commonwealth. Such an imposition could not possibly ruin anybody. The amount of duty collected on agricultural implements of all sorts last year was about Â£450,000. The farmer says that that is a direct charge upon one class, namely, the primary producer. It is not so, for the reason that the primary producer passes it on. Honorable members will be interested, I think, in the following extract from the Farm Implement News, published in Chicago: -During the month of February, agricultural implements to the value of $7,082,800 were exported, according to figures made public by the Department of Commerce last week. This is a large increase over February, 1920, when the value of implement exports was $2,869,647: For the first eight months of the current fiscal year, implement exports were $37,272,683, compared with $19,552,593 during the corresponding period of. the previous fiscal year.The annual report of the International Harvester Company, made public 14th April, shows that, while the companys volume of business in 1920 was the largest in its history, the net profit was smaller than in 1919.The report states that the machine selling prices in 1920 showed an average increase of GO per cent, over pre-war prices, and that the increase in repair prices was 40 per cent.The peculiar and significant fact is that while their exports were enormously greater than during the earlier period, their profits were considerably less. It is obvious that American manufacturers were accepting lower prices for their machinery. That is what we fear in Australia. I agree with the honorable member for Dampier that, with the up-to-date furnishings of our factories, and with the intelligence and individuality of the Australian workman, we ought to be able to compete and hold our own with any one in the world. So long as the conditions are fair and normal, we should fear nothing and nobody. But we have to look out for the profit-cutting foreign manufacturer. United States of America manufacturers have had to sell their products for less than formerly, and they will be compelled to continue to do so. They must find and keep and endeavour to expand oversea trade, and they can only do so by selling for less profits than they were formerly making. Acute though the general position may be in Australia and Great Britain to-day, there are also great troubles and disabilities in the United States of America. In their search for, and exploitation of, further markets, the American makers will resort to methods which, if they are not counteracted here, will prove considerably detrimental to Australian industry. It is  up to us, and particularly to the representatives of the farmers, to see that Australias industrial interests are conserved and protected. Does not the farmer perceive that an industrial smash would injure him as much as any other individual in the community?","In Committee of Ways and Means:","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[25]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In Australia, there were duties of 30 per cent, on grain drills and oil engines, and 25 per cent, upon all other lines mentioned above. Notwithstanding this, it will be seen that prices in Australia were considerably lower than prices in New Zealand. That was in 1918-19. In 1920, the difference was even greater. Writing to Ihe Argus of 18th April last, the Minister for Trade and Customs quoted the International Harvester Companys then current prices in the two countries, as under : -These figures show that Protection on farm machinery does not raise prices, and that the New Zealand farmer derives no advantage from the free importation of his implements. Whilst the removal of duties is no advantage to New Zealand, it has serious disadvantages. The Dominion loses considerable revenue, which has to* be made good by some other form of taxation, and the farmer is charged more for his implements.May I add that the Minister is not encouraging the production in his own country of a commodity which ought to he encouraged ? That, to my mind, is the greatest crime of the lot. In New Zealand the duty was remitted, with the object of making these machines cheaper to the farmer, but the result was that they were made dearer.

Upon page 7815 of Hansard of this session, the honorable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory), in discussing the duty upon stripper-harvesters, affirmed that the present duty was Â£50 ls. 5d. at the mint par rate of exchange, and that, the natural protection in 1920 was 38 per cent. The duty upon harvesters imported from America is 40 per cent. ad valorem, so that if the amount of duty were Â£50 ls. 5d. at that rate, the invoice price would be Â£113 6s. The landed cost price of an imported harvester in 1920 would therefore be as under: - Invoice price in America, Â£113 16s.; duty at 40 per cent, ad valorem, Â£50 ls. 5d.; natural protection, 38 per cent., Â£43 4s. 10d.; or a total of Â£207 2s. 3d.

I am, however, chiefly concerned with the dumping proclivities of manufacturers abroad who have overestimated the requirements of their own local markets. I come now to the question of whether Protection imposes a burden upon the farmer. A newspaper article, which I recently perused, thus sets out the position: -Assuming that the farmers get no benefit from Protection, either in the way of reduced prices for their machinery or the introduction of up-to-date appliances, what do the duties actually amount to? To hear some of the statements that have been made, one would think that the duties were a crushing tax on the farmers, and would soon drive them off the land, hut an investigation of the figures shows that this is a fallacy. The amount of duty paid on all agricultural, horticultural, and viticultural machines for the five-year period from 1914 to 1918 inclusive totalled Â£433,948. The value of agricultural productions for the same period was Â£286,075,000, so that the duty equalled only 3s. for every Â£100 worth of produce. If we take the same period and spread the duty over the acreage under crop it works out to less than lid. per acre, or, taking it another way, the duties work out at less than one-seventh of a penny per bushel for all wheat, oats, maize, and barley raised in the years under review, namely, 1914 to 1918, that being the last year for which reliable figures are available.Value of crops for five-year period, from 1914-1918, Â£274,156,452.Bushels of wheat, oats, and barley produced for five-year period, 1914-18, 652,101,816.Value of duty paid on all agricultural, horticultural, and viticultural implements and machines for the five-year period 1914-18, Â£433,948.Acreage of wheat, hay, oats, and harley cultivated for five-year period 1914-18, 71,392,494 acres.Duty equal to, say, 3 s. for every Â£100 worth of produce.Or duty equal to, say, lid. per acre.Or duty equal to, say, l-7th of a penny per bushel.","In Committee of Ways and Means:","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[50]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The. honorable member probably included as a natural protection the loss in exchange between America and Australia, but this should not be considered, since it is only a temporary disadvantage. This Tariff will continue until we amend it, but the loss in. exchange between the United States of America and other countries cannot continue very long without bringing about a crisis. The present situation is of the gravest concern to financiers and businessmen in the United States of America. Almost every week we read in the newspapers cable messages setting out the concern felt by financiers and others in the United States of America in regard to the exchange position. We are told that the. Government of the United. States of America will have to enter into some arrangement with Great Britain to do this, that, or. the other thing, and as soon as the exchange difficulty has been adjusted away will go any natural protection that our manufacturers enjoy in that respect.I shall not enlarge upon the question.

I claim, however, that, the farmer must, bear his share of the cost of administering the affairs of Australia. I claim, further, that, it is better for him that he should have his requirements satisfied by local manufacturers, since in such circumstances he has ready access to the market, instead of having to satisfy his needs by imports from overseas.

I advise him not -to take too much notice of the statements of the Taxpayers Association, which is howling for economy, and wants to bring down wages. We had -exactly the same cry in the early . nineties, and the reduction of wages was followed by a financial smash.

What I desire to do is to follow the honorable member for Dampier in his contention, but it is difficult to know exactly where to begin. Perhaps it would be better to begin where he himself began, when he made a great point of the natural protection which, he says, is afforded. The honorable member contends that the freights represent a natural protection to our own manufacturers, .and mean a great deal to thom. When the Minister (Mr. Greene) was speaking on the first item, he expressed the opinion that this  natural protection  is largely a myth; and I am quite sure that he could have proved to the satisfaction of any fair-minded person that it is so, .indeed. Had the honorable member for Dampier troubled to ask those people, who have been so careful to supply him with certain figures, to tell him what this  natural .protection  really amounts to, I am quite satisfied that the reply would have shown him that it has no existence. As the honorable member did not take that course, I shall, for the benefit of the Committee, the country, and the primary producers, supply some information, which is obtained from no tainted source, but, as I claim, represents the facts of the position. I shall not bother to quote the exact words of the honorable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) when dealing with the first item, but he then contended that this  natural protection  represents a great advantage to the manufacturers of Australia. Is the honorable member aware that, in the period from 1st July, 1914, until the 30th June, 1919, those large Canadian- American firms, to which he referred, were able to import the finished implements and machinery from Montreal to Melbourne or Sydney at a freight of only 20s. per ton of 40 cubic feet?","In Committee of Ways and Means:","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Any Government might well follow the example set by the Canadian Government in their efforts to build up local industries.In the period from 1914 to 1919, Australian manufacturers were unable to procure supplies of steel from Europe and England, and large quantities were, therefore imported from America. On many occasions such steel arrived consigned to Australian implement makers at from Â£6 to as high as Â£12 per ton freight while in the same ships there were mountains high of agricultural implements from Canadian-American manufacturers carried at a freight of about Â£1 per ton. This shows how our local manufacturers suffer in comparison with the manufacturers of America and Canada, where the Governments stand by them and subsidize shipping .companies in their interests. When the honorable member for Dampier spoke about this  natural protection, he might have told us those facts; and, as I have already said, he might have asked the importing companies bow much this natural protection really amounts to, instead of endeavouring to create the impression that the freights paid by them are enormous.I have here a photograph of a bill of lading from Melbourne to Buenos Aires by the Japanese steamer Luzon Maru, and it is a very interesting document to consider side by side with the statements of the honorable member for Dampier. This bill of lading shows that 101 packages, representing 49 tons 5 cwts., were carried at a freight of no less than Â£20 per ton. The date is January, 1918, during the period that the Canadian-American manufacturers were landing goods in Australia at 20s. per ton, as compared with an outward freight of Â£20. It may be said that this is ancient history, but I have an instance, within a month or two, of a consignment of 10 tons of one-way disc cultivators, an Australian invention well known to our farmers, being despatched from Melbourne to Buenos Aires in the Citta di Genova at a freight of Â£10 per ton. This competes with a freight from New York to Buenos Aires of less than Â£3 per ton; and it is manifest that if we value our export trade we must do as other countries do, and assist our manufacturers to hold their own.Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m.","In Committee of Ways and Means:","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[11]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Corner is that the duty on agricultural implements is passed on to the farmer. The whole history of fiscalism in this and every other country goes to demonstrate the very opposite. I am not going to quote interested bodies. I have done the honest thing by taking the price-lists. On 1st September, 1920, the Massey-Harris Company, an importing firm, quoted in their own price book the 6-ft. reaper and binder for delivery in 1921 at Â£125 each. On the 21st September, 1920, the McKay Harvester Company announced that they were making reapers and binders locally, and quoted the 6-ft. machine at Â£95 cash. On 21st February, 1921, the Massey-Harris Company issued a new price-list, in which they quoted the 6-ft. reaper and binder at Â£101 cash. There is a difference of Â£24. The only reason why they did that was because the implement was produced locally, and the local competition forced them to reduce their price to the primary producer by that amount. Nothing could persuade me that, but for the local competition in this article, the Australian farmer would not be still paying that extra Â£24. I cannot see how the production of the article locally can be to the detriment of the man on the land. If it were, I would not be advocating it, but the whole history of Protection goes to demonstrate that it is to his benefit, and not to his detriment.

There was a revenue duty of only 5 per cent, on reapers and binders, and a protective duty on reaper threshers and drills.","In Committee of Ways and Means:","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[23]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I may add that this is not the kind of Tariff I want. I want the New Protection, under which we could control local -prices, but, like other members of my party, I have to choose between this Tariff, which represents the Old Protection, and a Free Trade policy. The only figures that are of any value at all in connexion with this matter are to be found in the price lists, upon which the farmer would buy, and if the figures which I have are right, then those supplied by the honorable member for Dampier must be wrong. These are New Zealand prices under Free Trade conditions -Honorable members will see that, in the course of six years, the price went up nearly 130. per cent. If there was anything at all in the Free Trade doctrine, such an advance would have been impossible. If we were not able to contrast those figures with the Australian position under Protection, it might be contended that the increase was due to enhanced cost of production, higher wages, and dearer materials; but I have been able to make a comparison between New Zealand and Australian prices for the same class of implement. The following are the figures for Australia, under Protection -The highest quotation in Australia was Â£48 for a 4-furrow disc plough as compared with Â£72 10s. for the same class of implement in New Zealand, and I repeat that if my figures are right, then those supplied by the honorable member for Dampier are entirely, if unconsciously, misleading. I notice that he did not quote Argentine prices, although Argentine, like New Zealand, is a Free Trade country. In 1913, the 6-feet Sunshine harvesters were quoted at Â£8S in Australia, and Â£165 in the Argentine, and the 8-feet harvester, in Australia, Â£113; Argentine, Â£187. I come now right down to 1920. and I find that, in Australia, under Protection, the American 9-feet reaper thresher was priced at Â£250, while in the Argentine, under Free Trade, it was Â£380.","In Committee of Ways and Means:","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[26]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It depends on what the home market means, and the price ruling in it. The ruling price of wheat in Australia is worlds parity; in other words, the amount the farmer receives for the wheat consumed within Australia is no greater than the amount he receives for wheat sold overseas. I do not object to the Protectionist policy if it is applied all round, but what principle does it lay down? The principle of protecting our manufacturers and their workmen from the operation of worlds parity, the very law which honorable members insist upon the primary producer obeying. They demand that the primary producers wages shall be fixed, not at a special rate in Australia, but at what he can get for his produce in the markets of the world, less the highest ocean freights in the world.

My opinion is that it will increase the price of this requirement of the primary producer. In fact, that is the object of it.

I want to state here that if this National Parliament does not show a little more sympathy for the primary producer, there will be something doing before very long. The vote given only the other day upon the duty on wire netting was a distinct blow at every man and woman out-back. There are no- better citizens in Australia than those men and women, and what is their reward for going into the back country, and opening up new land? Their reward is to live under the worst conditions with the worst railway services, the worst postal and medical facilities, and the worst means of educating their children. They are asked to work the longest hours for the least return of any section of the community. Why should the best citizens of the country suffer the worst conditions? lt is up to this Parliament to ascertain the reason for this. If any proposal is on foot to cut down hours, and increase wages, let a start be made in the country districts. At least, let these improved conditions apply all round. The city end is not where a start should be made.The duties proposed in this schedule are not in the interest of the primary producers. The members of the Country party are not advocates for Free Trade, but their belief is that the existing duties on agricultural machinery are quite sufficient. At any rate, they have proved to be sufficient up to date, and our manufacturers have flourished under them. Not one honorable member has endeavoured to show that the local agricultural implement makers are losing ground. On the other hand, it is a well-known fact that their establishments are larger to-day than they have ever been, but it seems to me that the larger they grow the bigger is their appetite for protective duties.

If the duties are too high,- the Board, he says, will act as a brake upon the local manufacturers and will review the rates. I argue the matter from the other direction. If, after the passing of this Tariff, an Australian manufacturer can come forward and prove, by producing his books, that he is being unfairly and unjustly treated by the dumper overseas, I am prepared to give him a reasonable duty. But the local manufacturer, who has an obsolete plant, and who has not adopted up-to-date business methods in controlling his establishment, who gets a few members of Parliament together, and has a deputation to our genial friend, the Minister for Trade and Customs, to ask for an increase of duty, instead of seeking to place his business on a proper footing or obtaining an up-to-date plant, will have no support from me. That is a kind of Protection I will always fight against.

The statements of the last speaker (Mr. Stewart) were wide of the issue at present before the Committee, and, I think, have been fully answered by what has fallen from other speakers. I have already set out the view, which I hold very strongly, that the primary producer derives much general benefit from the establishment of industries in the country. For the honorable member for Wimmera and his party to say,  We believe in the protection of and development of Australian industries, and at the same time, in regard to the machinery and implements which the farmer requires, to object to any but duties which do not protect, and to strive for the highest possible duties on our primary products is illogical. I believe in Protection, but I believe in applying it all round. Where we can give the primary producer direct protection, I am in favour of doing so. On other occasions during the Tariff debate I have shown that the primary producer gets many indirect benefits from the establishment of local industry. For one thing, he is relieved of much of the burden of taxation which would fall on his shoulders were not the taxable area increased by the establishment of industries. The Argentine is pre-eminently a primary producing country, its secondary industries not being developed to any extent, and there the whole burden of taxation is thrown on the primary producer.","In Committee of Ways and Means:","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

421,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MASSY-GREENE, Walter","KNF","N/A","LP; NAT from 1917","N/A",9033,"- I have here set out the history of the development of these machines, and I shall quote some of it to let honorable members know what they, owe to the agricultural implement makers of this country and to the Australian workmen associated with them. The first successful stripper-harvester was invented in 1884, and patented in 18S5, by Australians. There had previously been attempts to devise a machine that would perform in one operation the whole work of taking off the grain and making it ready for market, but it was not till 1885 that a machine was produced in any country to fill these conditions. As the Australian stripper-harvester worked satisfactorily, it sold well when the growers realized its efficiency, and appreciated the immense reduction its use meant in the expense of harvesting. During the first fifteen years, comparatively slow progress was made, but the prejudices disappeared during that time. In 1900, the combined harvester, as it was then styled, was generally, if not universally, recognised to be the most efficient and economical machine for taking off the crop. Then the Americans took a hand. During 1900 and 1901 sample combined harvesters were purchased in Australia by the Massey-Harris Company and the International Harvester Company, both North American Combines. These machines were used as models for imitation, and both companies embarked in the manufacture of them on a large scale. They shipped considerable numbers of these imitations to Australia for sale. It was the only country using such machines. There was no demand for them in America at that time. Meanwhile, several Australian firms had gone into the manufacture of harvesters, but the wealth and weight of organization on the part of the American companies made the competition too. severe for them. Well-known makers, such as James Martin and Company, Gawler, South Australia; Nicholson and Morrow, Melbourne; and Henderson Brothers, of Corowa, and other makers,, were forced out of the harvester business. In the Australian combined harvester there were embraced some features that were in the original stripper invented by Ridley, of South Australia, about seventy years ago. The principal of these was the combination of a stripping comb and revolving beater, by which the ripe heads of grain were taken off the standing crop and threshed. During the past twenty years many experiments were made in various parts of the Commonwealth, with the object of developing machines which would do the same work in different ways. Among many abortive attempts, one change emerged, which met with a measure of acceptance. This was the adaptation of the binder knife and reel with the stripping comb to take off the heads, instead of doing the work with the comb and beaters. The list in the Commonwealth Patent Office shows that patent rights were taken out by the Australians referred to as follows:- No. 2202/04, J. L. Smith, North Melbourne, 24th December, 1904; No. 4394/05, Matthew Wm. Charlton, of Newport, Victoria; and Douglas East Chapman,, of Ascot Vale, Victoria, 19th October, 1905. Honorable members will notice that in this instance the Australian inventors were responsible for a further improvement in this particular type of machine. The patent rights which embodied the inventions of Charlton and Chapman were bought up by the Massey-Harris Company, who employed the inventors to construct a trial machine in Melbourne, which was duly tested and then taken to the works in Canada. Its manufacture was entered upon and under the name of the  Reaper Thresher  was offered for sale in Australia in 1911-12. The Australian manufacturers were actively working also, but not having the vast selling organizations of the American firms, they at first made small headway with this type of machine. But a novel and important improvement in the method of taking off the heads was invented and patented by Hedley Shepherd Taylor, of Henty, New South Wales (under patents dated 22nd October, 1913, and numbered 10989). While retaining the comb of the harvester and the knife of the binder, he dispensed with the binder reel. This reel, which swept back the ears of grain from the comb, was replaced by a double disc spiral, which forced the heads from the knife to the elevator. The elevator conveyed them to the threshing drum. Among many useful novelties on the machine, these formed the most striking departure from recognised practice. Mr. H. V. McKay, who was approached by Taylor, recognised the possibilities of the invention, and after securing the patent rights, he at once proceeded to develop the machine. It was placed in the harvest field, and proved a success. The marked advantage of the spiral conveyor, was specially manifest in  rescue work. In dealing with lodged, i.e., storm-laid crop, where tangled masses of ears and straw were flattened to the earth, this new machine achieved what seemed impossible. If they were not so fully attested, its performances would be incredible. Unseasonable storms visited the fertile wheat areas of New South Wales and South Australia. Coming just about harvest time, the rain and wind laid flat the heavy crop in many hundreds of fields. The grain appeared to be lost beyond any chance of recovery; in fact, in some cases, insurance was paid on the crops. The grain was retrieved, however, with little waste, if any. This new machine, equipped with a crop-lifting attachment designed and made : in the Sunshine works, was found equal to the task, and yields of 12 to 15 bags per acre were safely garnered in cases where the owners had given up hope of reaping even a bushel. It was in connexion with these disastrous storms that the New South Wales Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Dunn, was moved to make the doleful statement during last harvest season that 5,000,000 bushels of wheat had been lost. But for the work of the new machine this might have been verified, but wherever this machine was used it rescued the fallen grain, and the actual loss probably did not amount to 1,000,000 bushels.","In Committee of Ways and Means:","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

And, as recently as three weeks back, I was unable to ascertain that there was any material difference. I imagine that the sources which the honorable member for Dampier acknowledged were the same as those from which the Argus got information some time ago, to which I replied in the columns of that newspaper. To my communication the Argus had no other reply than to simply say that I was a bumptious individual. There has never been any answer to the reply which I sent to the Argus on that occasion. Why? They could not answer it, because the information given to the Argus from that particular source, directly or indirectly, was false information. It was information which it was perfectly easy for me, with the resources at my disposal, to show was false. I do not know whether the prices, as stated by the honorable member for Dampier, are accurate or not, but there is certainly no question at all as to the prices in Australia and in New Zealand at the time the Tariff was tabled. We had the prices then in our hands, and could compare them. There was no question then as to the position. As I have already stated, I have here a list of eighty different items, and in every case at that time the New Zealand price was higher than the Australian price. In some cases it was very much higher; in some cases it was only a few shillings higher; but in no case was it lower than the Australian price. In connexion with every one of these items, there was no duty on the article in New Zealand. There was a duty imposed on every one of them in Australia. It varied. In some cases it was 5 per cent. I speak of reapers, binders, and mowers. Oh hay rakes it was 10 per cent., on grain fertilizer drills it was 30 per cent., on spring tooth cultivators it was 25 per cent., on maize cultivators 25 per cent., on maize drills 30 per cent., on disc harrows, diamond harrows, spring tooth harrows, and on various kinds of ploughs, including gang ploughs, four-furrow ploughs, disc ploughs, and so on, there was a duty in Australia of 25 per cent. I do not propose to read the whole of this list of items to the Committee, as it is a very long one, but I shall quote a few of them to show that there is no question as to what the prices were at the time this Tariff was tabled.","In Committee of Ways and Means:","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/continue[17]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The honorable member for Dampier probably provided me with the best possible argument to show that the duty is not passed on. He said that the reason why, during this particular period, the foreign firms were able to sell their machines cheaper in Australia than in New Zealand; was that they had stocks in this country which they had brought in at lower prices. Consequently they were able to sell them at a lower price here. But was the price of the Australian manufacturer any higher upon that account ? He was manufacturing at the same time as these machines were being imported into New Zealand, and yet he was able to compel foreign manufacturers to accept a lower price for their machines.

There have been no profiteers like the exploiters of sewing machines in Australia in the last few years. The metalwork in the very best sewing machine, with all the inflated prices due to the war, is worth about Â£5, but with a little cabinetmaking thrown in they charge from Â£17 to Â£20 for it. If, thirty-five years ago, a duty had been placed on sewing machines in Victoria to encourage their local manufacture, as was then proposed, we should have been getting them for Â£10 or Â£12 each. As it is, they have this market on their own, and have exploited the people of Australia. We have had the values of these machines explained to us time after time by those associated with their manufacture, and we know that what I am saying is a fact. In those days it was not the  poor widow woman, but the poor seamstress that was pleaded for. The Free Traders pictured in harrowing terms the position of the poor seamstress in Australia, who had to work from the first thing in the morning till the last thing at night by candlelight, and the injustice of taxing the sewing machine by which she earned her living.","In Committee of Ways and Means:","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[13]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

There is not an article used in mining which has not shown a rise in price to the extent of at least 25 per cent. since 1914, whilst in some cases the price has increased ten or twelvefold.

If there were no men to put capital into mines, we should have no mining industry, and there would be no scope for miners to work.

The impression is conveyed that the duties contained in this schedule are paid by importers of machinery, but, as a matter of fact, a little while ago coal-cutting machines were placed by the Minister on the free list so far as the British preferential Tariff was concerned, and a 10 per cent. duty, imposed for the general Tariff. When we come to item 174 (Machine tools and. appliances as prescribed by departmental by-laws), I shall ask the Committee whether the Minister is to be given the power to place any item on the f ree list at his own sweet will. He recently regarded a tram rail as an appliance, which shows how elastic his conscience is in regard to such a matter. The man who is anxious to bore for oil or to prospect for gold in the . interior is called upon to pay from 271 to 40 per cent. duty on the machinery he requires, whereas a coal-cutting machine, employed in one of the most stable and profitable industries in Australia, is permitted to come in free or on payment of a 10per cent. duty under the general Tariff.. It would be extraordinary for honorable members to uphold such a policy whereby, the man who invests Â£10,000 ina copper mine, with the prospect df, perhaps, getting no return for his money, is to be obliged to pay from 27Â½ to 40 per cent. duty on the machinery he imports-: -","In Committee of Ways and Means:","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[18]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

535,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"GREGORY, Henry","KFE","Dampier","N/A","N/A",9044,".- Some time ago an embargo was placed on the export of metal, which had a serious effect upon the metal industry of Australia. After a lot of difficulty, we had the embargo removed, and I understood that there would be no further trouble. A little while ago, However, I received a letter from Western Australia about which I asked the Minister (Mr. Greene) a question, and instead of answering it forthwith, he asked me to give notice of it: I now enter my protest against an outside authority like the Australian Metal Exchange being given administrative control of the export of metals from this country. I do not know what powers this organization has been endowed with, but I draw the attention. of the Minister to the following complaint contained in a letter received by me from Messrs. Paterson& Company Limited, of Perth. They say -Some time ago we understood that metals, especially lead, could be snipped without a permit. . . . Last week we received an order for 2 tons from Java, and there was a boat going out the following day, but before we were able to ship we were asked for our permit, as the authorities had no advice of it being allowed to be exported. This meant that we lost the opportunity of shipping.Apparently they had not made application to the Australian Metal Exchange for a permit. I do not know under what authority the Minister insists - if he does insist - that any persons exporting metals from this country must obtain a permit and give full particulars in regard to the sale and the place of export. It is an extraordinary thing that exporters should have to give this small organization in Melbourne full information about the disposal of their products. I wish to know from the Minister if it is necessary, when metals are being sent out of the country, that full information about the transaction shall be given to the Australian Metal Exchange, and a permit obtained from that body. If so, by what authority does the Minister allow this organization to control exportation?","Export of Metals","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Therefore, I hare not had an opportunity to look into the facts. The position in regard to the exportation of metals is not exactly what the honorable member represented it to be. It is common knowledge that at the outbreak of the war Australia, in common with the rest of the world, was in the hands of a great German Combine so far as her base metal industry was concerned. Steps were taken to break down that Combine, and to deal with the difficulties which its existence had created. Now, although there is free exportation of metals, we are keeping a register - and shall do so for some time - of the movements of bur metals, so that we may know where they go, and what becomes of them. There is a possibility of other combinations being formed, and of our base metal industry again passing into: foreign hands.","Export of Metals","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

These permits are granted only by the Department over which I preside. They are granted on the condition that the exporters register the channel through which the metals are to pass out of Australia. So far as I know, we do not ask for particulars as to the price at which metals are sold, but we insist on knowing their destination. That is all the information that is required. As the Australian Metal Exchange was in existence, the Government thought that it would save expense in getting it to keep this registration instead of doing it ourselves. If the honorable member desires, I shall look into the matter further, and see whether, without great additional expense, the whole business can be kept in the hands of the Government.","Export of Metals","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
