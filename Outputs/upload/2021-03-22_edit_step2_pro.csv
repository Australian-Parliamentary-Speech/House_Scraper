4,0,0,0,1,1,"ODowd, Ken, MP",139441,"Flynn","LNP","N/A",2843," I present the 24th report of the Petitions Committee for the 46 parliament, comprising 30 petitions and 19 ministerial responses to petitions previously presented. I also present a corrigendum to report No. 22, to correct a typographical error.This week Im pleased to announce that the House petitions website has been updated. This update has increased the capacity of the e-petitions system to better handle peaks in user engagement and has improved accessibility and petitioning information more generally. Improvements include: easy English language to explain the petitioning process and rules for petitioning; symbols and imagery to increase accessibility in understanding the petitioning process; an updated and comprehensive frequently-asked-questions page; a streamlined process for creating paper e-petitions, with improved guidance at each step; and enhanced web design and navigational tools so that users can easily find what theyre looking for. The committee trusts that this update will assist citizens when engaging with the petitioning process, making it easier for them to sign, curate and learn about petitions.Thank you, Mr Speaker. I look forward to further updating the House on the work of the committee.The report read as follows—HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES PETITIONS COMMITTEEReport No. 2422 March 2021MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEEChair Mr Ken ODowd MPDeputy Chair Hon Justine Elliot MPMrs Bridget Archer MPMs Lisa Chesters MPMs Gladys Liu MPMr Julian Simmonds MPMr James Stevens MPMs Susan Templeman MPReport summarising the petitions and Ministerial responses being presented.The committee met in private session on 17 February and 17 March 20211.

8,0,0,0,1,1,"Haines, Helen, MP",282335,"Indi","IND","N/A",2871," I move:That this bill be now read a second time.Its a pleasure to introduce this bill to the House ahead of the next federal budget next sitting.Just like last year, Ill be reviewing those budget papers carefully to assess exactly what this government has committed for my electorate and for regional Australians at large.Contrary to what the government might think, regional Australians arent won over by glossy budget papers and keynote speeches with lots of hot air and no substance.Regional Australians want true investment in their potential.Theyre looking for governments with long-term plans backed by evidence of community need, not just announcements where nothing materialises.They want to know that those of us who are fortunate enough to represent them in this place care about their regions future, not their own political future at the next election.This bill does two things. First, it requires the Treasurer to publicly release and table a rural and regional Australia statement alongside every federal budget and Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook report.That statement must demonstrate that the government of the day is serious about supporting regional Australia, clearly setting out how government initiatives will directly benefit local economies, build the right infrastructure and boost social cohesion in the regions.This bill is not about motherhood statements; its about robust and reliable data that shows real community need and real impact.Thats why Ive made sure that this bill would require the government to prove the benefits of its initiatives that theyre bringing to the regions with robust and reliable data—data that shows that individual programs are securing a return on investment and that regional Australia is improving against objective economic and social indicators over time, how government initiatives are influencing mortality and morbidity rates, whether the government is really meeting its vision of an agricultural sector which exceeds $100 billion farmgate output by 2030 and whether its truly value for money, and data from the National Skills Commissioner on educational attainment and skills gaps.There is no one place for us to see and track progress and return on investment in regional Australia at large and compare our progress year by year.That begs the question: how will we ever get there if we dont know where we are and we dont know where were going?The second thing this bill does is require the government to develop and release a national white paper for rural and regional Australia within 24 months.That white paper must be aspirational, bipartisan, deeply consultative and long term.Its easy for this and any government to simply say its getting behind regional Australia. Well, the truth is that any politician can say that.But its another thing altogether to put pen to paper and set out a vision for regional Australia and, importantly, a time line to get us there—regions with fast, reliable and affordable NBN, free from mobile phone blackspots.Im talking about world-class public transport to metro areas and educational facilities that keep kids in the regions and not off to the cities after high school—educational facilities that bring kids from the cities into the regions—and regions with high-quality health care and mental health services, affordable and abundant housing and thriving economies that draw in city folk.Thats the kind of vision that regional Australians want from this government, and they want a clear road map to get them there.Recommendation 13 of the Regions at the ready report published by the Regional Australia Committee last parliament called on the government to initiate a white paper process for regional Australia as a matter of urgency.The government has sat on that report for over two years now and has refused to do anything at all about that recommendation.In fact, I waited for so long for action on that report that I had to work with Senate crossbench colleagues to pry the governments response to the report out of its hands through an order for the production of documents.And even then, weve heard crickets—nothing from the government.All those public hearings, all those submissions, all that good intention of people coming to the committee—for what?Regional Australians dont want another committee report recommending another go on the consultation and inquiry merry-go-round. They want action, and they want it now.This bill gives voice to regional Australians.A government that supports this bill is one than embraces transparency and accountability.A government that supports this bill is one that truly is committed to unleashing the potential pent up in our regions.Ill be watching the governments budget announcements for regional Australia and my electorate in May as I always do.Ill also be watching how the government responds to this bill, which would usher in greater transparency, data-driven decision-making and a real long-term vision for regional Australia—not just quick wins in budget line items.I commend the bill to the House and I cede the rest of my time for my member for Mayo.

10,0,0,0,1,1,"Sharkie, Rebekha, MP",265980,"Mayo","CA","N/A",2873," I am pleased to second the motion. The Charter of Budget Honesty Amendment (Rural and Regional Australia Statements) Bill 2021, introduced by the member for Indi, is incredibly significant, and Im really disappointed that we dont have any National Party MPs in this place to hear about this bill. They say that theyre fighting for regional Australia, and this is a bill that will very much support regional Australia because of its transparency.Regional Australia is a significant contributor to the Australian economy, accounting for approximately 40 per cent of our national economic output and employing approximately one-third of Australias workforce. I believe that its regional Australia thats holding up the nation. The traditional perspective of regional Australia often reflects a somewhat narrow view limited to just agriculture and mining. While these industries are critical—and they certainly are critical in my electorate—and while they make up a major proportion of the economic outputs in the regions, our regions are becoming more and more diverse, and I believe that many of the decisions in this place are very much east coast city centric. In my beautiful electorate of Mayo, our top five sectors are agriculture, forestry and fishing, construction, real estate services, and professional scientific and technical services. Employment in high-value services is increasing. And its not just restricted to my electorate; many people, because of telecommunication advancements, are able to work in the regions. However, while there is increasing diversity in economic opportunity, there are great challenges in the regions with respect to access to affordable health. Certainly, in parts of my electorate youre incredibly fortunate if you actually get a doctors appointment, and in other parts pensioners cant get bulk-billed. It is very, very difficult.The requirement for the Treasurer to publicly release and table a regional statement together with each budget and economic and fiscal outlook report is long overdue. Every single time we spend money in this place, we should be detailing to the Australian community exactly how that money will support regional Australia and its impact on regional Australia. A statement that requires an assessment of the impact of government decisions and initiatives on the economic, social and cultural environmental impacts in regional Australia is also long overdue.Lets talk about education. It is incredibly difficult for young people in the regions to get to university, and thats why we sought legislation in this place last year. That was very difficult, but it was about changing the statistics, which show that regional young people are far less likely to gain qualifications post year 12 despite a desire to do so. Its the tyranny of distance. When you look at education, when you look at health, when you look at a whole range of factors—aged care is another policy issue where it is incredibly difficult in regional Australia, yet the policy is very much designed for a metro space. I think that we need to do much, much more at every budget line to consider the impacts on regional Australia of how we spend money in this place.I commend the member for Indi for this bill. Again, Im incredibly disappointed there arent members of the National Party here to listen to this. If you truly are for regional Australia, you will support the member for Indi in this challenge. Lets get this bill through the parliament. The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.","Charter of Budget Honesty Amendment (Rural and Regional Australia Statements) Bill 2021","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms SHARKIE (Mayo) ","(10:10):"

12,0,0,0,1,1,"Wilkie, Andrew, MP","C2T","Clark","IND","N/A",2874," I move:That this bill be now read a second time.Last year Professor Graeme Samuel undertook an independent, once-in-a-decade review of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Act, the legislative framework that sets out how the natural environment is managed and protected in this county. His conclusion was that the laws are unfit for purpose, outdated and ineffective. In other words, Australias current environmental laws are failing to protect the places that matter and which we love.Regrettably this came as no surprise, because for years Australian scientists have been telling us our ecosystems—from rainforests to coral reefs, to deserts and even our kelp forests down in Tassie—are on the verge of collapse. Theres simply no doubt that Australias natural environment and iconic places are under increasing threat from deforestation, development and climate change, and that we have one of the highest extinction rates in the world, and that our weak environmental laws are adding to the problem.The sorry fact is that we cant trust this government to fix the problem, because time and time again it has shown its disdain for the environment. The government didnt even wait for Professor Samuels landmark review to be completed before it tried to weaken our laws further, and many in this place will remember September last year when the federal government pushed through a bill to give environmental approval powers to the states and territories with no safeguards, no oversight and no regulation.Shamefully most members of the House were prevented from speaking, and foreshadowed amendments were blocked without debate.Mind you, the government was already well and truly determined to advance its agenda of construction and destruction, as evidenced by the fact it was already discussing the idea of handing environmental approval powers to the states and territories with the WA Chamber of Minerals and Energy way back in 2019, well before Professor Samuel had even published his interim report.And now the government is pushing forward with an Environmental Assurance Commissioner, which has no power to investigate proponents, no power to compel provision of information and no power to actually fix anything. This toothless tiger wouldnt even have the power to investigate individual decisions related to projects, and it appears to have completely ignored Professor Samuels recommendation for an independent Office of Compliance and Enforcement.Its clear that reform is necessary. Indeed just last year the Australian National Audit Office found that the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environments administration of referrals, assessments and approvals of controlled actions under the EPBC Act are not effective, that reporting arrangements are not consistent with the Act and that outcomes are not being monitored.Remarkably the ANAO found that, of the approvals examined, almost 80 per cent contained conditions that were non-compliant with guidance or contained errors, significantly reducing the departments ability to monitor conditions or achieve the intended environmental outcome.Moreover there is no conflict of interest register for staff working on the assessment processes or within the compliance division. Theres no protection against bias, political interference or even corruption. This is a total failure of regulation, and yet the environment minister still wants to keep regulation in house.Thats why today Im introducing a bill which establishes a Commonwealth Environment Protection Authority. This EPA will be a completely independent body that depoliticises, streamlines and strengthens environmental regulation. And it will be structurally independent from the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment, a move which will bolster community confidence in the processes that are supposed to protect and conserve our natural environment.This bill ensures that the EPA will effectively and transparently exercise the administrative functions currently held by the Commonwealth concerning the EPBC Act, as well as any other federal legislation relating to the environment. This includes issuing approvals, granting permits, auditing environmental impact assessments, and monitoring post-approval impacts. The EPA will have the power to undertake both systemic and individual investigations into applications, environmental impact statements, or any other documents received in support of an application. Moreover the EPA will have the power to terminate an approval, or even issue a stop work order, in circumstances where serious environmental harm has been caused or is imminent.Importantly the EPA will also have a call-in power for monitoring, compliance and enforcement even when a state or territory bilateral agreement has been made.Moreover the EPA will be headed by an appropriately qualified CEO who is independently appointed for a fixed term, and supported by a newly established parliamentary joint committee on the environment and energy. And to avoid even a perception of bias, the senior staff will be prevented from having any potential conflicts of interest, including employment as a politician or lobbyist in the five years preceding appointment to the EPA.I call on both major parties to support this bill. Its practical, has community support, and will deliver real outcomes for our environment. This is not a contentious proposal. Regularly independent statutory watchdogs are created to oversee complex areas of policy, or where there is a risk of bias, corruption or conflicts of interest. Communications and media companies are overseen by the Australian Communications and Media Authority, consumer law is overseen by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission is charged with looking after markets and financial services. And Ive been working with my crossbench colleagues for years to establish an Independent Commission Against Corruption to clean up our political institutions and tackle corruption.So now, when were seeing the imminent collapse of precious ecosystems, when Australia is a world leader in extinctions and when were already facing unprecedented threats from climate change, a strong independent regulator is more important than ever. This is especially the case for Tasmania where the state government has recently passed the major projects bill, which allows it to fast-track dodgy projects and where, without a federal compliance body, the state government could ram through projects like Cambria Green, badly sited salmon farms, the Mount Wellington cable car, or obviously inappropriate developments in national parks. As our swift parrot population dwindles and our World Heritage places are threatened, an EPA is more important than ever for Tasmania.This bill is supported by the Places You Love Alliance, a group of key environmental groups which represent communities across the country. This includes groups like the World Wildlife Fund Australia, the Wilderness Society, Australian Conservation Foundation, Birdlife Australia, Humane Society International and Environmental Justice Australia. I thank the Alliance and the Environmental Defenders Office for their support and assistance on this bill. And I also single out Frances Medlock from my office who has worked tirelessly on the project.The fact is that, time and time again, governments have failed to ensure effective enforcement of our environmental laws. And time and time again this has been exposed, for example by the Australian National Audit Office, the Productivity Commission, independent reviews of the EPBC Act, and the Australian Panel of Experts of Environmental Law. Clearly we need to act. And just as clearly we need to act now.I commend this bill to the House and I invite the member for Melbourne, who is seconding the bill, to speak in my remaining time.

14,0,0,0,1,1,"Bandt, Adam, MP","M3C","Melbourne","AG","N/A",2876," I second the motion. The relentless destruction of Australias habitat is causing constant upgrading of the risk to our animals to endangered, critically endangered and extinct. Our iconic biodiversity is under greater threat today than at any time in human history. Australia has the highest rate of mammal extinction in the world. We are driving this destruction directly through developers, mining and state governments, like in my state of Victoria where were seeing the wilful destruction of the Djab Wurrung trees. Were also indirectly threatening every crevice of our vast lands and oceans by burning coal, oil and gas. Theres no creature or habitat that will be untouched by the climate crisis.In the 22 years that the EPBC Act has been in place, we can confirm that we cannot leave the protection of our habitat and endangered species in the hands of the establishment parties, because they take donations from developers, from coal, oil and gas companies, and from the businesses that profit from destruction. They cant be trusted to protect the places and the creatures that Australians love. They will bend the assessments to suit their donors and the proponents of projects. Im pleased that the member for Clark has brought this bill to the House, because the only solution to this ongoing corruption and devastation of our environment is the creation of an independent assessment process, which this bill proposes. This bill backs in the Greens long-held policy of independence in environmental assessment, and we do commend the bill to the House.I will give one example in my remaining time. Look at the Toondah wetlands in Queensland. Its a globally important wetland for birds that travel halfway around the world to eat and rest. Property developer and donor Walker Corporation wants to turn it into 3,000 apartments, a marina and a hotel. What did the previous environment minister, the member for Kooyong, do? He proposed to the Queensland minister that they redraw the boundary of the wetlands so that the donor can get what they want. Its this kind of behaviour that we need to stop.

The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.","Commonwealth Environment Protection Authority Bill 2021","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BANDT (Melbourne—Leader of the Australian Greens) ","(10:23):"

16,0,0,0,1,1,"Bandt, Adam, MP","M3C","Melbourne","AG","N/A",2877," I move:That this bill be now read a second time.We shouldnt have to introduce the Snowy Hydro Corporatisation Amendment (No New Fossil Fuels) Bill 2021 today, but we do because, in the middle of a climate emergency, the government has made it clear that it wants to use public money to make the climate crisis worse at the same time as slowing down investment in renewables in New South Wales. This bill will stop them. This bill will prohibit Snowy Hydro from developing, constructing or being involved in the development or construction of new fossil fuel-based electricity generation capacity, from acquiring, purchasing or otherwise investing in or being involved in acquiring, purchasing or investing in new fossil fuel-based electricity generation capacity and operating or being involved in the operation of new fossil fuel-based electricity generation capacity.This bill explicitly does not deal with the fossil fuel assets that Snowy Hydro already owns. We do have to deal with that and we know we need to wind down our existing fossil fuel generation capacity. The Greens have a clear position on this. The transition to 100 per cent renewables needs to be completed in the next decade if Australia is to do its fair share of limiting global heating to 1½ degrees Celsius. This bill does not seek to address the existing assets of Snowy Hydro but seeks to prevent the government from making the problem worse, because this government has made it clear that it intends to invest in new fossil fuel-based electricity generation in the middle of a climate emergency.The timing of this bill is critical. Minister Taylor, upon receipt of the report of the Liddell Taskforce, made clear that the private sector has until April to invest in 1,000 megawatts of new dispatchable capacity and that, if the private sector fails to deliver, he will proceed with building a new gas plant in the Hunter. I want to be clear. The government wants to use public money in the middle of a climate emergency to invest in a new gas-fired power station. No-one wants this gas plant. The Liddell Taskforce, which the minister set up to look into the closure of the Liddell coal-fired power station and which he relies on to justify this push to build a new coal-fired power station, did not recommend 1,000 megawatts of new capacity, as the minister continually claims. In fact, the study that the Energy Market Operator task force asked for said that the capacity gap in 2025 would be only 215 megawatts. Minister Taylor just made up this supposed 1,000-megawatt gap.Lets say, for the sake of the argument, that a gap exists, what has the private sector done between that announcement last year and now? Origin have announced a 700-megawatt battery at their Lake Macquarie site. Neoen have announced a 500-megawatt battery in the Central Tablelands. CEP.Energy have announced their intent to build a 1,200-megawatt battery at Kurri Kurri—the exact same site that Minister Taylor has proposed for his gas-fired power plant.Is that that going to stop Minister Taylor? No, it doesnt look like it. The minister has made it clear that hes not interested in dispatchable capacity unless it comes in the form of gas. All the rubbish from this government about being interested in technology and not taxes is just a hollow slogan, because when the sector steps up and says, We will make up for the shortfall in the form of renewables and storage, the minister says: Well, thats not good enough. Im going to make it gas and Im going to take money that could be going to schools and hospitals and instead use it to force investment in fossil fuels. Dont worry that RepuTex has found that its cheaper to replace Liddell with renewables and batteries than gas. Ignore the clear statements, as the minister does, from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the International Energy Agency that theres no more room in the carbon budget for new fossil fuel infrastructure. The minister is being reckless, both on the climate front and on the economic front.To be frank, it  sad that this bill needs to be introduced today. The public owns Snowy Hydro; we hold 100 per cent of the shares. The government has the power right now to tell Snowy Hydro to stop investing in new coal- and gas-fired power plants, and that would make this bill redundant. If Minister Taylor and Minister Birmingham wanted to, they could tell Snowy Hydro to invest in new batteries instead, or renewables in the Hunter and Latrobe valleys. But we have a government which is not interested in representing the will of the public—a government not interested in addressing the climate emergency and keeping Australians safe. Its not interested in representing the over 70 per cent of Australians who want us to be a global leader in climate action.What we have instead is a government that is interested in providing billions of dollars in subsidies for the fossil fuel industry and helping out those massive multinational companies like Chevron and ExxonMobil which offshore billions in profits while paying zero dollars in company tax. They make millions of dollars in donations to political parties and that might go some way to explaining why the minister is taking the stance that he is. And we have super-rich billionaires like Gina Rinehart, Clive Palmer and Rupert Murdoch, who think they can buy elections and make decisions about the future of Australia, instead of us the people, which may go some way to explaining why the minister is taking the stance that he is.Thats why we need this legislation. The government has proven itself completely incapable of addressing the climate emergency and dealing with public money responsibly, so it falls to this parliament to hold it accountable. We cannot let the government invest in new gas. We cannot let the government build new gas infrastructure. We know that we must bring down carbon pollution rapidly if were to have any hope of keeping a safe climate for all the people on this planet. This parliament must hold the government to that responsibility.I commend this bill to the House and I call on all members in this place to support it.

19,0,0,0,1,1,"Steggall, Zali, MP",175696,"Warringah","IND","N/A",2879," I second the Snowy Hydro Corporatisation Amendment (No New Fossil Fuels) Bill 2021. This bill will make a substantial amendment to the Snowy Hydro Corporatisation Act 1997. Snowy Hydro began in 1949 with the construction of the nation-building Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Scheme. It was a mammoth project that captured Australias imagination and showed what was possible when we put our brilliant engineering minds to the task. Snowy has provided much-needed energy to the cities and towns of the east coast of Australia; its part of our history.But since 1949, the remit and scope of the organisation has changed. Its now an end-to-end integrated energy provider. It now has several generation assets and offtake agreements, with multiple renewable projects on the east coast. On 14 September last year the energy minister told the Australian Press Club that, should the energy industry not fill the gap left by the closure of AGLs Liddell coal-fired power station, the Australian government would use Snowy Hydro to build a 1,000-megawatt gas generator at Kurri Kurri. Lets be very clear at the outset: new gas in the Hunter should not go ahead and its entirely unnecessary.In last years Integrated System Plan, the Australian Energy Market Operator made it clear that we may use existing gas assets more but that we would not need new gas assets. Batteries and pumped hydro would be sufficient as coal retires in the next decades. In last years Electricity statement of opportunities, AEMO also stated that the shortfall in New South Wales caused by the closure of Liddell was likely to be less than 200 megawatts by 2023-24. This was also before the CEP.Energy announcement on 5 February of a 1,200-megawatt battery at the very place that this gas generator was supposed to be: in Kurri Kurri. AGL, too, has lodged initial development documents for a new big battery of up to 500 megawatts to help offset the Liddell closure. So its clear that, where the electricity providers are heading, they are dealing with this gap and theyre dealing with it as the market dictates. The market is not saying new gas; the market is saying batteries.Since November 2020 an abundance of new battery projects has been proposed for Australia, totalling some 3,000 megawatts. It raises an interesting point. Why is the energy minister threatening to build a gas-fired generator when the market is choosing batteries? The market doesnt want to choose gas, because it knows its going to be a stranded asset down the line. So, why should we spend public money developing a gas generator? I can only presume that this is pure politics, because the government has made no secret of its desire to woo the people in the Hunter Valley with, I would suggest, a false promise of this gas generator. Its a doomed effort, and Im very cynical about the way the government and the minister are proposing to use a public asset, in the form of Snowy Hydro, to support what can only be seen as a political endeavour, not an endeavour for the public interest. This bill will make sure this never happens by mandating that Snowy Hydro and other group companies— (Time expired)Debate adjourned.","Snowy Hydro Corporatisation Amendment (No New Fossil Fuels) Bill 2021","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms STEGGALL (Warringah) ","(10:32):"
20,0,0,0,1,1,"Andrews, Kevin, MP","HK5","Menzies","LP","N/A",2880," I move:That this House:(1) notes that:(a) the Canadian House of Commons unanimously passed a resolution that, in the opinion of the House, the Peoples Republic of China has engaged in actions consistent with the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 260, commonly known as the Genocide Convention, including detention camps and measures intended to prevent births as it pertains to Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims;(b) the Parliament of the Kingdom of the Netherlands has passed a resolution stating that measures intended to prevent births and having punishment camps in China fell under United Nations Resolution 260;(c) the UK House of Lords has passed a resolution urging the government to uphold all undertakings in and international obligations arising from the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide;(d) the then US Secretary of State, Mr Mike Pompeo, issued a determination that Uyghur and other Turkic Muslims are being subjected to a genocide by the Government of the Peoples Republic of China, a position reinforced by his successor, Mr Antony Blinken;(e) a series of international reports, including by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights and the Newlines Institute for Strategy and Policy, have concluded that Uyghurs in Xinjiang have and are being forcibly held in re-education camps, subjected to torture, forced labour and coercive transfer to other regions; and(f) other ethnic and religious minorities are being persecuted by the Chinese Communist Party;(2) records its abhorrence that the Chinese Government continues to engage in serious and systematic breaches of the human rights of its peoples;(3) calls on the Government of China to respect and abide by universally acknowledged human rights for all its peoples;(4) urges the United Nations to investigate the breaches of human rights in China; and(5) encourages the Australian Government to continue to protest the ongoing abuse of human rights by the Chinese Government and to take appropriate measures to enforce laws against modern slavery and identify supply chains that use forced labour.The most egregious systematic abuse of human rights in the world is occurring in the Xinjiang Uighur autonomous region of western China. It has been occurring for several years. It involves the imprisonment, torture and enslavement of millions of ethnic Uighurs, who compose some 90 per cent of the population of the southern area of Xinjiang.The evidence for this conclusion is drawn clearly from a series of recent expert reports, including those cited in this motion; from internal statements and documents of Chinese officials; from analysis of Chinese statistics and data; and, significantly, from the eyewitness testimony of many people and the accounts provided to family and relatives. There is overwhelming evidence of the cruel, inhumane and brutal practices of the Chinese communist regime. Some of these practices extend beyond Xinjiang, but the sheer scale of restrictions on freedom, the mass internments and the programs of mass sterilisation and enforced labour elevate the activities in the region to new levels of human rights abuse.It is for these reasons that the parliaments of Canada and the Netherlands and the British House of Lords have adopted motions of condemnation. It is why US secretaries of state Mike Pompeo and Antony Blinken have denounced the policies and why many are asserting or questioning whether the CCPs program amounts to a contravention of the 1948 genocide convention. The official Chinese response to the widespread accusations is that there are no breaches of human rights and that the Uighurs are guilty of violent terrorism and separatism. But these unconvincing and self-serving responses conflict with the statements of Chinese officials and other objective evidence about the activities in Xinjiang.Most notorious are the repeated statements of the CCP secretary-general of Xinjiang, Chen Quanguo. In his 2016 policy agenda speech Chen described religious extremist thought and behaviour in Xinjiang as a malignant tumour and a communicable plague requiring more radical and invasive surgery. His remarks mirror repeated comments by Xi Jinping calling on the police and security forces to prepare for a smashing, obliterating offensive and giving directions to round up everyone who should be rounded up. In speeches and in government orders there are directions to eradicate tumours, wipe them out completely, destroy them root and branch, show absolutely no mercy and eliminate risks within risks, hidden dangers in hidden dangers.The result of this deliberate policy is the construction of more than 380 internment camps, described officially as concentrated transformation through education centres; the imprisonment of millions of Uighurs over the last few years; the mass video surveillance of the population; the widespread collection of biometric data; the killing, torture and rape of Uighurs; the enforced sterilisation of the population; and the widespread use of enforced labour. In 2020 there were eyewitness accounts and video evidence of Uighurs transported in batches across China to work in factories around the country. A document from academics at Chinas Nankai University reported that the labour transfers were also a long-term measure that not only reduces Uighur population density in Xinjiang, but also is an important method to influence, meld, and assimilate Uighur minorities. The writers recommended that the government expand the programs to other areas of China to meet labour demands. A documented report by ASPI found that Uighurs have been transported to factories in China, where they were forced to work. The report concluded that 83 foreign and Chinese companies, including many well-known brands, were benefiting from enforced labour. That is why this motion calls for, amongst other things, greater action to enforce laws against modern slavery and to identify supply chains that use forced labour.This is not a party political issue; it is an issue of basic human rights. This is a time when this parliament should speak with one voice. I cannot think of any member or senator who would vote against this motion. I encourage the parliament to uphold the rule of law and universal human rights and not to accept these brutal totalitarian practices of the Communist regime. And I respectfully urge this government to recognise that this is one of those occasions when a motion such as this ought to be allowed to a vote in both chambers. On that basis, I commend the motion to the House.","Human Rights in China","MOTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ANDREWS (Menzies) ","(10:36):"

I thank the member for Menzies for his motion and for his ongoing advocacy with regard to issues of human rights. It was only last week that he and I met here in parliament with a group of women from the Uighur community to discuss this very issue. These women have brought to us their personal impact of the human rights situation in Xinjiang, China, having family members who are currently detained in Chinas so-called re-education camps. One of the women spoke about the experience of her sister, who has been detained on allegations of financing terrorism. What was her crime? It was simple: the legal transfer of money to her parents in Australia facilitated through a state owned Chinese bank to assist them to purchase a home in Adelaide—a legitimate transaction that has resulted in her sister being arrested six years later. The womans sister is the mother of three young children and is being held without legal representation and without being presented with any evidence to substantiate the crime she is accused of. On top of this, families have very grave concerns about her wellbeing, given her declining health, due to issues pertaining to liver damage which she sustained during a previous period of detention.Like these women, there are many others around the world who are concerned about the welfare of their family members who have been detained in these camps. The human rights situation faced by Uighurs is dire, with reports by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International providing clear evidence of Chinas arbitrary detention and mistreatment of the Uighur population. Human Rights Watch notes that there are more than a million people detained in these camps, simply by virtue of their ethnicity and religion. The conditions in these camps are rife with torture and solitary confinement, and deprivation of food and sustenance is widespread. Throughout the Xinjiang region, the Uighur population has also been subjected to restrictions on movement, mass surveillance and significant limitations on their religious freedoms, in clear contravention of fundamental and universally accepted human rights.More recently the discrimination has taken another form, with reports indicating a high incidence of forced labour within the Muslim minority communities of China. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute has linked this to dozens of well-known Western countries. This is put into perspective in a report entitled Uighurs for sale, in which ASPI reports that, under conditions that strongly support forced labour, Uighurs are working in factories that are in the supply chains of at least 82 well-known global brands. The report goes on to estimate that, between 2017 and 2019, more than 80,000 Uighurs were transferred out of Xinjiang to work in factories, with some transferred directly from the re-education camps.To this end, I call on the Australian government to take urgent action as part of our commitment under the Modern Slavery Act. Australia must take appropriate measures to enforce the law against modern slavery and to be satisfied that Australian companies are importing goods from supply chains free of forced labour. I also call on the Australian government to explain what actions it has taken to address the situation in Xinjiang and to ensure the Uighur communities in Australia are adequately supported.What we are seeing unfold in Xinjiang, China is a serious campaign of repression. It is an urgent issue which requires our active attention and that of the international community. While Chinas economic growth is highly commendable and China is now rightly considered a global superpower, this should come with a global responsibility to show leadership, including in matters promoting human rights. Otherwise it will invite questions as to whether Chinas power is being projected for peaceful purposes or not.As members of the international community we have a moral responsibility, if not a legal responsibility, to do all we can to encourage countries to adhere to the international human rights obligations. As has been the case in Canada, the United States, Netherlands and the UK, Australia must show a similar commitment in holding China accountable for the serious and systematic breaches of the human rights of its people. Given our trade relationship with China, anything less could open us up to charges of hypocrisy.","Human Rights in China","MOTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr HAYES (Fowler—Chief Opposition Whip) ","(10:42):"
24,0,0,0,1,1,"OBrien, Ted, MP",138932,"Fairfax","LNP","N/A",2883," In Chinas north-west rise autonomous ion called Xinjiang. Xin translates into new and jiang translates into frontier. The name new frontier has an aspirational ring to it. But thats not how the world sees Xinjiang—especially for its Uighur people, an ethnic minority about whom thereve been deeply disturbing reports of enforced disappearances, mass detentions, systematic torture, abuse of women, pervasive surveillance and religious discrimination.The Australian government has already conveyed its concerns about the situation in Xinjiang to the Peoples Republic of China, including during Foreign Minister Marise Paynes last three meetings with her Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi. A nations foreign policy is an outward expression of its national identity, its values, its people and what they believe in. One of the things we believe in, as a liberal democracy, is universal human rights. And the breaches of human rights being reported out of Xinjiang are so egregious, so grave, that the House of Commons in Canada has passed a unanimous resolution calling them acts of genocide. However, the Chinese Communist Party denies these allegations. And herein lies our dilemma: unless we can draw more evidence-based conclusions, the world remains at an impasse. While a determination on the question of genocide is a matter for the courts, and a range of judicial and quasi-judicial systems exist to consider such crimes, the starting point has to be uncover what is actually going on. That requires unfettered access to Xinjiang, something the Chinese Communist Party is not allowing.Australia has raised its concerns during sessions of the United Nations Human Rights Council and the United Nations General Assembly. But still transparency is denied. Today I appeal to the Chinese Communist Party to reconsider its position and provide international observers, including the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, immediate and unfettered access. Whats more, I contend that doing so is in fact in Chinas interests. Since a nations foreign policy is an outward expression of its national identity, it is worth considering the situation in Xinjiang within the context of Chinas national identity.Chinas identity consists of two parts: the yin and yang, if you like, the positive and the negative, the pessimistic and the optimistic. Where the yin is a memory of historical trauma they refer to as the century of humiliation, the yang is an aspirational expression of national rejuvenation when China reclaimed what it perceived to be its rightful place as the worlds middle kingdom, with a clear line of sight between its past and its future, believing its history preordained its destiny. As the former middle kingdom under heaven, the Chinese remember themselves as not only possessing the greatest power and most advanced economy on earth but also the most culturally and morally superior civilisation. Let me underscore the words morally superior, because it is this part of Chinas national identity and this part of the China narrative that the situation in Xinjiang undermines.If indeed the accusations of abuses of the Uighur people are false, as the Chinese Communist Party claims, then it should have nothing to hide. It would be in its interests to provide the unfettered access to Xinjiang that the world needs. To do otherwise, to continue to refuse access, dilutes the moral authority to which China lays claim, undermining its national identity and compromising the vision of Xi Jinping of the Chinese dream of great rejuvenation. That is unless, of course, the allegations are true.","Human Rights in China","MOTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr TED OBRIEN (Fairfax) ","(10:47):"
25,0,0,0,1,1,"Freelander, Mike, MP",265979,"Macarthur","ALP","N/A",2884," I rise today to speak on the motion put forward by the member for Menzies and, in doing so, I want to thank him for bringing this very important matter before the House. Im very pleased to speak to the motion and vocalise my support here today for the Uighur people. I was pleased to join with my good friend and colleague the member for Makin just the other day to meet with them in front of parliament to discuss their concerns. They had made the trip to parliament to voice their concerns. Im very pleased that many of my colleagues on all sides of politics, including the member for Fowler, the member for Menzies and the member for Makin and others, support the Uighur nation and the Uighur people.As someone who is Jewish, I really do understand the terrible difficulties that are placed in front of the Uighur people. It does have echoes of Germany in the 1930s. I think it is very concerning. We as individuals elected to public office in a strong and vibrant democracy have a responsibility to stand against human rights violations wherever they occur, particularly now to the Uighur people in China.The Uighurs are a very important minority group who have been systematically denied their rights in northern China. Population estimates vary, but around 15 to 20 million Uighurs exist in China and there are many thousands of Uighurs who now reside in Australia. Many Australian Uighurs feel deeply concerned about the systematic abuses that their people and loved ones are facing in China, and I share their concern. I know many of my colleagues share these concerns. We believe that China has coped very well with the pandemic. Medically, they have done some remarkable things and I applaud them for that. But their policies of treatment of the Uighur people and the sinicisation in Xinjiang province is really distressing. The Uighurs report violations of international law, including of conventions which China as a state is party to. These are not the actions of a responsible global power. Its incumbent upon the Australian government to provide its assessment of whats happening in Xinjiang and how it characterises the human rights violations thatre taking place, based on all the information that is available to us and our agencies and to other countries. The government of Canada has been mentioned as one that shares these deep concerns about human rights abuses involving the Uighur people.The Australian government must also explain what actions it is taking to address the situation in Xinjiang and provide support for the Uighur communities in Australia and elsewhere. We owe it to our fellow human beings to not only stand in solidarity against such atrocities but do more than just mere words. As the honourable members motion indicates, a number of other national parliaments have already stood in solidarity with the Uighur people and its time that our parliament and the Australian government, in unity, did the same.This motion also identifies that Uighurs in Xinjiang have been and are being forcibly held in re-education camps, subject to torture, forced labour and coercive transfer to other regions. Women are being sexually assaulted, children are being denied education and the Uighur population is being denied appropriate health care. It is an atrocity. Over a million Uighurs have been detained in so-called re-education camps, subject to forced labour and denied any ability to practice their religion. Many people in groups have condemned these atrocities and many have described it as potential genocide, but at least in direct violation of the United Nations genocide convention.I have no hesitation to echo the sentiments of the member for Menzies and implore the United Nations to investigate these reports of human rights abuses. Australia, through its peacekeeping efforts within the United Nations and under its obligations as a responsible global citizen, has routinely stood against human rights violations in the past and must do so again. Atrocities such as Srebrenica genocide not too long ago were, unfortunately, met with too little and too slow a response from the international community at the time. I dont think its too outrageous a thing to say that the international community must thoroughly investigate these reports of human rights violations in China to ensure that history does not repeat itself. I thank the members for Menzies for bringing this important motion before the House and in doing so making it a priority for our national parliament.","Human Rights in China","MOTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr FREELANDER (Macarthur) ","(10:52):"
26,0,0,0,1,1,"Wilson, Tim, MP","IMW","Goldstein","LP","N/A",2885,"Mr TIM WILSON ( Goldstein ) ( 10:57 ): Its a privilege to be able to speak on this motion. I thank the member for Menzies for moving it. As we know, there have been mass human and cultural genocides throughout history, often targeted at minority groups within dominant cultural communities. Of course, with my own Armenian heritage, we have a legacy that our first Anzacs bore witness to on their arrival at Gallipoli. They saw the human consequences of the Armenian genocide. Representing the third largest Jewish community in Australia, in Goldstein, I am very familiar with the ongoing memory and legacy of the holocaust. We need to remember that remembering genocides is part of the journey of stopping them into the future.As I said right at the start, genocide doesnt just involve a human dimension, though that is critical, it can also involve a cultural dimension around erasing the memory, the traditions, the culture and the values that underpin societies. In Xinjiang the Chinese Community Party is engaging in a form of cultural genocide against the Uighur people. Its that simple.The vicious and inhumane tragedy occurring in that province due to the actions of CCP makes for difficult reading for anybody who is interested. An investigation by the associated press has revealed that the CCP is regularly subjecting hundreds of thousands of Uighur women to forced sterilisation and abortions to lose the next generation. A report by the Australian Institute of International Affairs, published last year, describes how the CCP is seeking to erode and redefine the culture of the Uighurs to erase their memory and traditions and what they can then hand on to future generations. This has involved the destruction of 16,000 mosques in Xinjiang since 2017. Another report by ASPI details how between 2017 and 2019 over 80,000 Uighurs were forcibly transferred to labour camps for ideological brainwashing on an industrial scale.The United Nations genocide convention establishes that genocide does not necessarily require the immediate mass destruction of a group. The elimination of a people can occur in a number of ways, including those documented in the growing volume of Xinjiang investigations and reports. What is critical is the intent about whether there is an action being taken to remove the memory, the legacy and the future of a people. To me, it is quite clear that it is the intent in the case of the Uighurs.The atrocities in Xinjiang are being implemented at the direction of the Chinese Communist Party with the specific intent of destroying the Uighurs separate cultural and political grouping within China. ASPI has described this as an agenda to render them subservient to the Chinese nation. These events serve as another reminder that, when political systems seek to enforce rather than earn their legitimacy, the end result will be a human tragedy and suffering for those today and, of course, for those in the future.The CCP asserts its legitimacy by claiming that a Han-centric unified China has existed continuously for 5,000 years with broad consent and cooperation. The CCP argues its responsibility is to continue this tradition to ensure stability and prosperity in China. Its something that many people would question, whether thats those of Tibet, the good people of Hong Kong or potentially other territories in the future. Its a narrative thats particularly difficult to reconcile with the vastly different lived experience of minority communities throughout China, and Xinjiang in particular. Xinjiang was first subject to Chinese political authority in the mid-18th century and has witnessed significant periods of independent self-government while under Chinese rule.The atrocities are incapable of respecting differences in spontaneous associations among free people, because they depend on the centricity of the state and lives of citizens in a rigid, national image imposed from above: a classic reminder of the horrors of communism, particularly centralised authority. Its the job of the people to conform, not for the government to reflect their people. What we see is the merciless indulgence of a political elite who consider the separate identity of the Uighurs as a threat to the Han-centric image of China. These events are not an anomaly. In Hong Kong we have seen the CCP build its sovereignty on oppression, rather than cooperation and consent, including through the flood of people. The CCPs response to protests against extradition laws has seen police violence, attacks on the media, the imprisonment of 47 democracy activists and, of course, the removal of local elections. Now, only people who are conforming to Beijings will are even allowed to stand for office.For the good of humanity, its the responsibility of free democracies and the international community to unreservedly call these events out and to call for an investigation, because free countries promote secure societies and human liberty as the biggest proponent of peace.","Human Rights in China","MOTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","N/A","N/A"
27,0,0,0,1,1,"Zappia, Tony, MP","HWB","Makin","ALP","N/A",2886," As the member for Macarthur noted last week, Uighur people from throughout Australia gathered on the lawns in front of Parliament House to draw attention to rising levels of concern about widespread human rights violations against Uighur people and other minority groups in China, particularly in the province of Xinjiang, otherwise referred to at times as the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, abbreviated as XUAR. A similar rally was held a couple of years ago. The violations against Uighur people and others include: (1) the detention and re-education centres of over one million people, where nonconforming detainees are reportedly subjected to beatings, rape, starvation and numerous other forms of torture—amongst those detained since 2016, 450 Uighur intellectuals have disappeared or are now imprisoned; (2) the forced removal of hundreds of thousands of children from their families, who are then placed in state run institutions; (3) the restriction of free movement, both within and outside of Xinjiang; (4) the intense surveillance of Uighurs through the use of thousands of facial recognition cameras and other surveillance tools; (5) the arrest and incarceration of Uighur people for the most trivial of reasons; (6) the destruction of cultural and religious buildings and institutions—it is estimated that 16,000 mosques, 65 per cent of the total, in XUAR have been destroyed or damaged mostly since 2017; (7) a widespread birth-control program targeting Uighur women; (8) allegations of organ harvesting and people in detention disappearing or suspiciously dying; and (9) the use of detainees as forced labour in Chinese factories.According to one report, researchers have verified over 380 detention centres across XUAR that were either newly built or significantly expanded, since 2017. There are between 1,300 and 1,400 extra judicial internment facilities, excluding prisons, in XUAR.China is a party to the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide; the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women; and the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. As a signatory to those international conventions, it has committed to honouring them and therefore has a universal obligation to do so. The claims of human rights abuse against Uighur people and other minorities have been debated in the Canadian House of Commons, the Netherlands parliament, and by the UK House of Lords, all of which have raised serious findings against China, including some labelling the human rights violations in Xinjiang as genocide. Over the years I have spoken to numerous Uighur people here in Australia, who tell me they can no longer contact family members in Xinjiang or that their family members are prevented from travelling or, even worse, that they have been detained. I have heard their stories, seen the worry and strain in their faces and, where possible, made representations to the foreign minister on their behalf. There have also been several well-regarded reports from credible organisations, including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the Newlines Institute. They have all raised serious and extensive breaches of human rights in Xinjiang. There is now compelling evidence that there is a strategy of wiping out Uighur identity, including culture, language, history, music, literature, and religion.As a signatory and founding member of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Australia should raise these allegations with China and within all other UN forums. If the accusations are untrue, China should allow the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights unrestricted access to Xinjiang so an independent investigation can be carried out. The Morrison government should, of course, be strongly backing that course of action. If China refuses to do so, it can only spell one thing—that they dont wish the matters to be properly investigated.Australia must stand up for human rights wherever there is a violation and abuse of people and work with international communities standing up for the people being oppressed, persecuted or abused. The Morrison government should also support Australias Uighur community, who understandably hold grave concerns about the well-being of loved ones and family in their homelands.

I believe this is a very significant motion in the context and history of our parliament as, today, members from all sides of the House are speaking out against the appalling systematic human rights abuses against Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims in China by the Chinese Communist Party in Xinjiang province. As a member of parliament who is part of an ethnic and religious minority, I think it is vital that our parliament is counted in condemning this wide-scale human rights abuse across the world. Im pleased that in my time in this place I have spoken against the persecutions of Christians in North Korea; Christians, Muslims, Yazidis and Kurds in the Middle East; and Christians and the Falun Gong by the Chinese Communist Party. Today I add my name to those speaking on the persecution of Uighurs by the Chinese Communist Party.Today the House of Representatives joins the Canadian House of Commons, the Netherlands parliament and the House of Lords in the United Kingdom in calling out and condemning the systemic human rights abuses committed against Uighurs and other ethnic minorities. We indicate our abhorrence at the continued actions of the Chinese Communist Party in engaging in these systemic human rights abuses. We call on that government to respect the human rights of all people and we call on the UN to investigate breaches of human rights in China. At the same time, we as a parliament acknowledge and encourage the Australian government to continue to protest the ongoing human rights abuses by China and to enforce modern slavery laws, which were piloted by this government against suppliers who use forced labour.As an Australian, I want to acknowledge the wonderful work of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, which has drawn these systemic human rights abuses to our attention. As James Leibold and Kelsey Munro wrote earlier this month:Under President Xi Jinping, the Chinese Communist Party has launched an extraordinary campaign in Chinas northwestern autonomous region of Xinjiang to forcefully integrate the indigenous Uyghur population into the Han majority, in violation of Chinas own constitution and international legal norms.As is now well documented, the CCPs crackdown in Xinjiang includes max extrajudicial detention of Uighurs and other ethnic minorities in hundreds of purpose-built interim camps; near ubiquitous surveillance; systematic destruction of Indigenous culture, language, religions and practices, including the demolition of mosques; forced birth-control, including sterilisation; psychological and physical torture, including sexual abuse; and forced labour and restrictions on the freedom of movement.In 2020, ASPI identified 27 factories in nine Chinese provinces using Uighur labour transferred from Xinjiang since 2017. Those factories claim to be part of the supply chains of 82 well-known global brands. And ASPI estimated between 2017 and 2019 at least 90,000 Uighurs were transferred out of Xinjiang and assigned to factories throughout the labour transfer programs under the Xinjiang aid policy. ASPIs work identified the need to do more to rid global supply chains of forced Uighur labour.I want to acknowledge the foreign minister, Senator Payne, who has consistently called out human rights abuses in Xinjiang and last month, in response to reports of rape of women in detention camps, said:These latest reports of systematic torture and abuse of women are deeply disturbing and raise serious questions regarding the treatment of Uyghurs and other religious and ethnic minorities in Xinjiang.We consider transparency to be of utmost importance and continue to urge China to allow international observers, including the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, to be given immediate, meaningful, and unfettered access to Xinjiang at the earliest opportunityOur country has consistently raised reports of arbitrary detention, restrictions on freedom of religion, pervasive surveillance and forced labour, both in the bilateral discussions weve had and also at the United Nations.I want to conclude my remaining time by acknowledging some comments of Ephraim Mirvis, who is the Chief Rabbi of the Commonwealth. As a Jewish Australian Im particularly proud, as is the member for Macarthur, that Jewish leaders around the world have called out the persecution of Uighurs. Rabbi Mirvis called for the urgent, independent and unfettered investigation into whats happening. Those responsible must be held to account, and Uighurs able to escape must be given asylum. He said this of their persecution:Can it be true that, in our modern, sophisticated world, men and women are still beaten if they refuse to renounce their faith? That women are forced to abort their unborn children and are then sterilised to prevent them from becoming pregnant again? That forced imprisonment, the separation of children from their parents and a culture of intimidation and fear have become the norm?Sadly, the weight of evidence of this persecution of the Uighur Muslim minority in China is overwhelming. Satellite images, leaked documents and survivor testimonies all paint a devastating picture affecting well over 1 million people, which, for the most part, the world continues to ignore.… … …I have been left feeling that any improvement in the desperate situation is impossible.The chief rabbi calls on us to make it not impossible, and this motion helps him do that.","Human Rights in China","MOTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr LEESER (Berowra) ","(11:07):"

We should because what we say in this place has meaning and real impact. As representatives in a democracy that comes with a responsibility. Alongside many of my colleagues I have and will again speak up against the persecution of the Uighurs in Xinjiang.Thank you to the member for Menzies for bringing this motion to the House. For our part, Labor has publicly and strongly condemned the human rights violations against the Uighurs and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. This includes the mass arbitrary detention of Uighurs, forced labour, forced sterilisation, sexual assault and restriction of movement in Xinjiang and across China. According to a recent report published by Newlines Institute for Strategy and Policy, between one million and two million people have been detained in extrajudicial internment camps across Xinjiang by the Chinese government since 2014. The report details allegations of psychological torture, cultural brainwashing, interrogations, indoctrination and forced sterilisation. People have been forced to renounce their culture and language. There have been mass forced labour schemes and family separation. Few people from the camps have been able to share their stories, but, of the stories that we have heard, of the few stories that have made the light of day, they are simply harrowing. Detainees in the camps are so deprived of their basic human needs that suicides have become so pervasive that theyve had to be forced to wear suicide safe uniforms. In February the BBC reported that women in the camps are systematically raped and subjected to sexually based torture. Women are forced by guards to assist in this abuse.In 2020 the Australian Strategic Policy Institute reported what it has described as the new phase of the Chinese governments ongoing repression of Uighurs, reporting that more than 80,000 Uighurs were transferred out of Xinjiang to work in factories across China between 2017 and 2019. Some of them were sent directly from the detention camps. ASPIs research identifies about 82 foreign and Chinese companies potentially directly or indirectly benefiting from this forced labour of Uighur workers outside Xinjiang through abusive labour transfer programs as recently as 2019.All of this horror is happening right now, as we speak these words. Parliaments and democratic nations—our friends like Canada, the UK and the Netherlands—have spoken out, passing resolutions that call out what is happening as consistent with United Nations General Assembly resolution 260. Former US secretary of state Mike Pompeo has determined the Uighur people are being subjected to genocide, and his successor, Antony Blinken, has supported that assessment.I asked our foreign minister: How does the Australian government characterise what is happening to the Uighur people in China? What assessments do our security and intelligences agencies make of the situation? I also asked the foreign minister: What action is the Australian government taking to address this situation? Are we working with our allies as much as we can—the UK, the US, Canada and others—who share our concern and commitment to human rights, coordinating with them on a plan to end this unacceptable situation? Are we doing everything we can to ensure that Australian businesses and consumers are not buying products made through the forced labour in these camps? Australia cannot sit back, watching on in horror, and still do nothing. This motion is a small but important part of the collective effort that we as a parliament have to make. The international community must take action, and this motion is part of that effort.","Human Rights in China","MOTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr KHALIL (Wills) ","(11:12):"
30,0,0,0,1,1,"Christensen, George, MP",230485,"Dawson","LNP","N/A",2890," The road to Auschwitz was paved with indifference, and if we remain indifferent to the Chinese Communist Partys treatment of ethnic and religious groups we will forever wear the shame of having stood by and watched when we could have acted. Chinas systematic genocide of Uighurs in East Turkestan cannot be ignored. It doesnt matter where you sit on the political spectrum; the acts perpetuated by the Chinese Communist Party against this group of people are objectively evil.I note that the Chinese Communist Party and its regime have strongly denied the reports of these re-education camps, and said that theyre anything but facilities to educate minorities on Chinese culture. Chinas foreign minister, Wang Yi, called reports of Uighur genocide rumour with ulterior motives and a complete lie. Im sure he missed the irony of his own words! There has been a rapid increase in the number and scale of these camps in the last five to 10 years amid claims that President Xi Jinping of China is ramping up the CCPs agenda against religious and ethnic minorities. The Chinese governments own statistics show that birth rates in the mostly Uighur regions of Hotan and Kashgar plunged by more than 60 per cent from 2015 to 2018.We know from various sources, including those who have been imprisoned in those camps, that horrendous atrocities are taking place. Uighurs are being displaced, imprisoned, indoctrinated, forced into labour, tortured, raped, sterilised and used for medical experiments, and are even having their organs harvested. This is genocide by definition—by the UNs own definition, in fact. On that note, if you ever feel useless in life remember that theres a thing called the United Nations. What these guys are actually for, if not to hold countries to account on human rights abuses, is anyones guess, because the human rights record of the CCP is absolutely shocking and the UN is doing nothing. The fact that this country is peppered with statues and portraits of Mao Zedong, who was responsible for the deaths of 50 million of his own people, indicates that that record isnt going to improve if the CCP are left to their own devices. Although the Uighurs are bearing the brunt of the Chinese Communist Partys disdain for ethnic minorities, the persecution also extends to anyone who believes in a higher power than the state in China.For decades, Christians in China have had to form underground churches to avoid persecution from the CCP. It was reported last year that the CCP was rolling out a policy of withdrawing government welfare from Christians unless they renounced their faith. In April 2020, all the officials from a town in the northern province of Jiangxi were ordered to remove crosses and other Christian items from the homes of Christian recipients of benefit payments and replace them with portraits of President Xi Jinping and Chairman Mao Zedong. Christians who objected had their payments stopped.A Christian in a Jiangxi village had Christian verses and a Christian calendar torn from their wall and replaced with a portrait by Mao by an official, who declared: Impoverished religious households cant receive money from the state for nothing. They must obey the Communist Party for the money they receive. A woman in her 80s, who attends a state registered church in Jiangxis Poyang County, stopped receiving her monthly welfare payment because she said, Thank God, when she collected her January payment. They expected me to praise the kindness of the Communist Party instead, she said. There are endless accounts of crosses being removed and replaced with images of Mao Zedong or Xi Jinping, of welfare payments being cancelled and of workers being demoted, harassed and receiving pay cuts.I could talk about Falun Dafa petitioners who have experienced severe persecution since 1999, when a rapid rise in its popularity prompted the CCP to ban anyone from practising it. In 1995 we know that the 11th Panchen Lama, who was six years old at the time, was kidnapped, along with his entire family, allegedly by CCP operators. Neither the Panchen Lama nor his family have been seen since.It is reported that the Chinese government has put Christians, Tibetans, Falun Dafa, Muslims, the Uighurs—you name the religion—into camps, tortured them and killed them. What can we do? The UN wont do anything. The CCPs actions are only getting worse. The CCP is guilty of crimes against humanity. The CCP is guilty of genocide. The CCP is now no better than, and should be considered, a transnational criminal organisation. We cant remain indifferent. We must keep talking about this. We must call the CCP out. We must unite across the political divide to condemn these horrid atrocities.","Human Rights in China","MOTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[9]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr CHRISTENSEN (Dawson) ","(11:17):"
31,0,0,0,1,1,"Stanley, Anne, MP",265990,"Werriwa","ALP","N/A",2891," On Friday I spoke to a distressed resident, an Australian Uighur who has not heard from their family for four years. They are desperate, anxious and cant sleep because of worry. In fact, they cant remember the last time that they had a good nights sleep. There has been no word from parents, siblings, partners and children. They are silent. Those here dont know whether theyre alive or dead. Friday wasnt the only time that Ive spoken to distressed family members whose families are in China. Im privileged to have a strong Uighur community in my electorate. They have raised their concerns and angst with me on many occasions.I acknowledge the motion from the member for Menzies and strongly condemn the human rights violations against Uighurs and other ethnic and religious minorities in Xinjiang province. The reports of mass arbitrary detention, forced labour, forced sterilisation, sexual assault and the restriction of movement should be condemned no matter where it occurs. The ABC reported that there are approximately 28 detention camps where human rights violations and deaths in custody are occurring. Almost a million Uighurs have been detained. The scale of this is almost incomprehensible from the safety here in Australia, but for the more than 3,000 Uighurs living here—many in my electorate—its a constant source of concern. Most Australian Uighurs know someone—a relative or friend—who has disappeared or has not been heard from for several years.Like many Australians, they came here as students to study and make a better life for themselves. They chose to stay in Australia and become Australian citizens because of the opportunities and the promise that Australia can offer. For some time it was also because they had a genuine fear for their lives if they returned to their homeland.Ive had many constituents come to see me or email my office about the events taking place in the region since the reports started to emerge. They explained that they fear for the safety of their loved ones, due to the rumours that they have been taken to prison. They are concerned by firsthand witness accounts, and reports from the media and intergovernmental agencies about the potential human rights violations by China in its treatment of its Uighur minority.I stand today to voice my concerns along with those of my constituents and many across the world. Australia has a long record of playing a leading role in international relations and defending human rights, especially in our region. Increasing reports are painting a worrying picture of the treatment of the Uighur people. The detention of Uighurs in the so-called re-education camps and the increasing rate at which those detention centres are being built continue to increase the worry. There are also reports of Chinese surveillance and intimidation of Uighurs abroad, including right here in Australia. Its important that Australian citizens, regardless of their background, do not feel pressure or intimidation from a foreign power. Condemnation of the Chinese government has been widespread. The United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination called on China to halt the practice of detaining individuals who have not lawfully been charged, tried and convicted of a criminal offence. As a member of the UNs Human Rights Council, we should be working in coordination with other members to pursue this issue and the Chinese government, so that all of us holding concerns are able to find comfort and so that those who are worried about their friends and family know they are safe and can talk to them.The US government and the parliaments of Canada and the Netherlands have labelled human rights violations in Xinjiang as genocide. The Human Rights Watch has also labelled the actions as crimes against humanity. Australia needs to be part of an effective multilateral response to this ongoing issue. Actions taken by the Chinese government are not the actions of a responsible global power. We should stand with the global community on this important and reprehensible situation in Xinjiang. No matter who is responsible for the human rights violations, Australia must always stand up for human rights and hold those responsible to account.I support the motion, and I will continue to condemn any breach of human rights in the past, present and future so that Australian Uighurs can find, and talk to, their missing loved ones and reconnect with their families.","Human Rights in China","MOTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[10]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms STANLEY (Werriwa—Opposition Whip) ","(11:22):"

Tajiudu Zhejiang Daxue zai Hangzhou wei yi nian.Deputy Speaker and others, I just mentioned that my name is Vince. I said good morning and that I speak a little Chinese but my wife speaks Chinese very well. I also mentioned that my wife, Peta, spent a year living in Hangzhou and going to university there. Peta, as a little girl, was fascinated by stories that her great-aunt would share with her about her travels around that ancient country some decades ago. That inspired Peta to study Chinese language, history and culture throughout primary school and into high school, and then she undertook a Bachelor of Asian Studies, majoring in Chinese at university, including a year in Hangzhou. Some of that fascination with Chinese culture really rubbed off on me, and, together weve spent some time in China, both in Hangzhou and also in Beijing, Shanghai and a number of other places. Its been wonderful to see China firsthand, meet some of the people and experience that culture. Thats why its also really important that we continue to do what we are doing and distinguish between Chinese people—including those who now call Australia home—and the Chinese Communist Party, who are the government in the Peoples Republic of China.Australia and Australians operate on some pretty simple principles. We absolutely believe in a fair go and in respect for our fellow country men and women. We respect the rule of law and, at the same time, we uphold absolutely the right, individually, to freedom. Against this, we must sadly juxtapose the treatment of Uighurs and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang province in north-west China. Australia remains deeply concerned by reports of forced disappearances, mass detention, forced labour, pervasive surveillance of Uighurs and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, and restrictions on freedom of religion and belief in China. Recent reports of systematic torture and abuse of women are, of course, deeply disturbing. We urge China to act consistently with its human rights obligations.It is morally right that we use our voices. I thank the member for Menzies and others in this place for, along with me, joining in and using our voices to absolutely object to these egregious human rights abuses. Access to the region continues to be restricted, making it difficult for Australia and other concerned nations to see whats happening on the ground for ourselves. But by bringing forward and debating this motion today in our federal parliament we are contributing to greater transparency as we continue to urge China to allow international observers, including the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, to be given immediate and unfettered access to Xinjiang. We will work closely with our key partners, including the UK and others, to advocate for this transparency and accountability. It is critical that China immediately facilitates these visits and ensures transparency and independence.The government has clearly conveyed the Australian governments concerns about the situation in Xinjiang to China. This includes through Minister Paynes last three meetings with her Chinese counterpart, state councillor Wang Yi. Australia will continue to raise our objections and call for independent investigations both here in Australia and with Beijing.Whilst the Chinese government continues to systematically breach the human rights of its own citizens, it greatly weakens its moral authority to engage as a respected global citizen. Through this motion, we record our abhorrence at these abuses of our fellow humans. We urge the UN to investigate these breaches of human rights and we commit to continuing our calls for the Chinese government to end these abuses. I call on the Chinese government to demonstrate respect for its own rich cultural history and to move back to a path of peaceful and prosperous engagement at home and, in this way, to also regain the moral authority to engage and to prosper globally.","Human Rights in China","MOTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[11]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr CONNELLY (Stirling) ","(11:27):"
33,0,0,0,1,1,"Bandt, Adam, MP","M3C","Melbourne","AG","N/A",2894," I want to start by telling the story of Mayila Yakufu. Her sister, Marhaba Salay, was here in parliament just last week, sharing the devastating story of what happened to Mayila. Mayila committed no crime. All she did was transfer funds to help her parents, who were buying a family home in Adelaide. That happened in 2013. Years later, the Chinese government has created charges stating that she was somehow financing terrorism. Since April 2019, she has been detained without legal representation or evidence of the crime that she has been accused of. Her family are incredibly concerned for her. From the very limited moments they have been able to contact her, they know that her health has suffered significantly from her confinement. Marhaba is also concerned about the consequences of speaking out here in Australia, seeking justice for her sister. Her family are concerned for her aunt and uncle, who have also been accused of the same crime. Many like Marhaba who are campaigning are also concerned for younger family members and that they may be removed from family care and placed in state facilities.Tragically, Mayilas story is just one instance in a much larger story of the cultural genocide that the Chinese government has been perpetrating against the Uighur people. The Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect has summarised the systematic campaign that has been undertaken, stating that a million Uighurs and other Muslim minorities have been detained in camps without formal charges or due process. The BBC has published evidence of widespread and systematic rape, sexual abuse and torture of ethnic minorities in detention facilities. Around a quarter of a million children in Xinjiang have lost parents to detention, with many children being placed in state run institutions. The Chinese government is also working to forcibly reduce birthrates amongst Uighur people and other Muslim populations, including through forced abortions and sterilisation. There has been systematic destruction of Uighur cultural heritage, including of cemeteries and pilgrimage sites, with an estimated 16,000 mosques destroyed or damaged. The global centre has concluded:The government of China is failing to uphold its responsibility to protect and is perpetrating possible crimes against humanity and genocide against Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities.The Australian Greens have been calling out the cultural genocide committed by the Chinese government for years, and we will continue to do so. The Chinese government should immediately halt its attack on human rights and it must immediately allow for United Nations and other independent international observers.And there is more that the Australian government should do as well. The Australian government should apply targeted sanctions against the officials who have perpetrated these violations of human rights. It should match the commitments by the US, UK and Canadian governments to ensure that companies within Australia are not benefiting from the forced labour of the Uighur people. It should work with other nations to insist that, at the very minimum, international human rights observers be allowed into Xinjiang.I want to take a moment to thank the Uighur campaigners who were here last week. To speak truth to power is hard of the best of times, but to do so when the threats against you, your family and those who you know are so close and so real is a testament to your courage. We affirm our solidarity with all the campaigners and activists, and with the Hong Kongers and members of the Tibetan community who are campaigning for human rights and democracy. You are showing tremendous courage in speaking up on these abuses, and the world cannot stand by.I think its also worth reflecting that there has been a lot of talk about the importance of standing on principles during the debate on this important motion. For many, many years in Australia, the Greens have been calling out human rights abuses by the Chinese government and by other governments. During the mining boom, when the money was flowing in, we were often lone voices in this place; neither of the establishment parties wanted to raise the issues that we were raising at the time. One might ask what changes have taken place in the US and elsewhere that mean some of these issues are now being brought to the parliament. But so far the flip-flopping of the Australian government over many years on human rights has had the consequence of undermining our international human rights advocacy. Were in a weaker position to demand that the Chinese government take action because we havent taken consistent action in the past.I hope that what were seeing now is the beginning of a firm position—that we will always stand up against human rights abuses, whoever commits them and in whatever part of the world.Debate adjourned.","Human Rights in China","MOTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[12]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BANDT (Melbourne—Leader of the Australian Greens) ","(11:32):"
34,0,0,0,1,1,"ONeil, Clare, MP",140590,"Hotham","ALP","N/A",2895," All of us in this parliament are aware of one of the tragic realities of life in Australia today: there are thousands upon thousands of women—women in the electorate of every single person in this chamber—who are victims of domestic violence and abuse by an intimate partner. This is a horrible problem; an awful sore that our country confronts. But for so many of the women who are in these situations, the worst part of what happens to them is not actually the violence and trauma they experience; it is the things that occur and are seen by their children.This is the subject of the Family Law Amendment (A Step Towards a Safer Family Law System) Bill 2020, a very important bill which I have the privilege of speaking about today. We know that today we have a family law system in Australia that allows for many situations where violent and abusive former partners have unsupervised access to their children, even when theres good evidence that those people present a real danger to those young people. This needs to change.I want to thank the member for Moreton, who is here with me in the chamber, for tabling this very important bill. This bill will make crucial changes. Sometimes in this parliament we can overcomplicate things. We think every problem needs billions of dollars put towards it to make any resolution. But one of the beauties of the bill before us is that its simple, its a bill that will cost nothing, its a bill that will save lives and its a bill that will better protect Australian children.The bill before us will do two things. Firstly, it will remove section 61DA of the Family Law Act, which provides the presumption of equally shared parental responsibility, to end the confusion that this section has occasioned since it was first understood. This confusion has led to the dangerous misconception that equally shared parental responsibility should automatically mean equal time with both parents, even in instances where one of the parents would represent a danger to the child. Secondly, it would remove section 65DAA of the act, which requires judges to navigate this very long and complicated pathway before being able to determine parenting arrangement; and inquiry after inquiry has told us that this section is routinely used by coercive and abusive partners to essentially punish the person who is a victim of that abuse.The very important context for the discussion we are having today is the existence of domestic violence and abuse in so many cases which come under the purview of the Family Law Act and what was previously the Family Court. According to the Australian Institute of Family Studies, somewhere between 70 and 85 per cent of family law matters involve allegations of violence and abuse. This makes this system incredibly dangerous for women and children in particular. It essentially puts victims on the back foot in parenting negotiations and creates ample opportunities for abusive partners to exercise control over the person they are victimising. We know that about 80 per cent of women who seek help for domestic abuse have experienced some type of coercive control.It is very timely for us to have this discussion in the chamber; its been just over a year since the tragic and absolutely horrific murder of Hannah Clarke and her three beautiful children in Brisbane. This example is one that we should look at and think about frequently when we are examining how to create a safe and open environment for women and children in our country. One of the things that tugs at my heartstrings when I hear of Hannah Clarkes case is knowing that she did all the right things. This is really the point today: the law and the system that surrounds these cases today are inadequate. They are inadequate in many cases, but perhaps nowhere more so than in the family law.I want to again credit the member for Moreton for taking up the mantle of this incredibly important issue. The family law should be there to protect Australians, not to be used as a weapon for further abuse; and the changes that are straightforward, practical, and inexpensive that are recommended to this house today have my full support.","Family Law Amendment (A Step Towards a Safer Family Law System) Bill 2020","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms ONEIL (Hotham) ","(11:37):"
35,0,0,0,1,1,"Joyce, Barnaby, MP","E5D","New England","Nats","N/A",2896," This is a vexed issue. The greatest amount of traffic in my office is pertinent to family law. I suppose I come to this debate with a slightly different perspective, and that is perspective predominantly, but not exclusively, of men who cant get access to their children and how this absolutely tears them to pieces. I believe it comes from a range of areas. The court doesnt have a presumption of equal share, it has a consideration of equal share; and a consideration of equal share in many instances, from what I have seen, works against the male partner. One marriage in three, unfortunately and tragically, falls apart. Of course many of those marriages have children; and where this is most prescient is with young children. The last thing anybody wants is that our children be used as weapons in the dissolution of relationships. But quite often, unfortunately, that becomes the case: where the vitriol of settlement comes into play, access to the children is used as a mechanism to hurt one partner or the other. And this is something that we have to fix up, because it is not the childs fault.Everybody in Australia, unless there is something demented about them, was completely and utterly devastated by the issues pertinent to Hannah Clarke. What we had there was obviously a disgusting criminal act. But, as hard as it is to say it, the vast majority of men who are trying to get access to children are not disgusting criminals; they are people dealing with a situation that is tearing them apart. I will relay one of the discussions that Ive had recently where the guy said, Im not an alcoholic. Im a hard worker. Ive never been violent. Ive never committed a crime. But every time I try to get access to my child its stymied. The process is such that I always feel my former partner has all the cards. Whether I turn up to pick them up and theyre not available that week, or whether were trying to negotiate without offending the children, without having an argument in front of the children—which is the last thing he wants. He finds this process is beyond his capacity.The constituency which I suppose I come into this chamber to represent—as you know I talk about the weatherboard and iron—are the poorer guys, because they dont have the money to go through the court system and properly represent themselves. So what we have is the clumsiness of self-litigation. As I always say, a person who self-represents has a fool as their client. The judge is not there to advise. The judge is there to judge. And this means that their position is even further diminished.Ill go on to other mechanisms which are used from time to time. Im not saying that this is always the case, but from time to time theyre used. Ive dealt with this in my office—such as the issue of AVOs. There are times when AVOs are absolutely an essential requirement—the person is violent. But sometimes they are used as a mechanism to create further isolation from the children. For an AVO I need to say, I feel scared by this person and thats a very hard thing for the police not to prove. Its how you feel. From time to time, not exclusively, I have also seen that.The reason I say this in closing is I bet you its the same case for so many offices. This issue is so pressing that it comes up day after day. I suppose it brings forward a lot of work that you, therefore, have to do and try to resolve. In offices were not judges.

37,0,0,0,1,1,"Albanese, Anthony, MP","R36","Grayndler","ALP","N/A",2901," Last week we saw the humiliation of a tired eight-year old government in the Senate—a government that is in constant chaos, a government without an agenda, a government thats suffering from the way in which it came to office in 2013, eight long years ago, when it ran a campaign against the then Labor government defined by what it was against. It failed to define itself in favour of a reform agenda for the country. After three prime ministers, multiple deputy prime ministers and dozens of ministers, this is a government that really is out of time and out of ideas.In the Senate last week, we saw the government introduce industrial relations legislation after an extensive consultation process between the trade union movement and employers that didnt reflect the basis of that negotiation. The government sought to entrench insecure work and make it harder for workers to get a pay rise. Instead, what they were left with was a single element which punishes casuals. Why have they done that?In Queensland, Mr Skene, a miner in Central Queensland, won a case before the courts which ruled that, indeed, he wasnt really a casual worker; he was a permanent worker because he was given shifts way in advance, 12 months in advance, of when he was working. It was just a device to deny him the same conditions as the workers he worked beside. Its been the subject of a very clear principle from this side of the House of same job, same pay. If youre doing the same work, side by side, you should receive the same pay and the same conditions. What this legislation seeks to do is contravene that and entrench the capacity of employers to define as casual those people whose employers are getting all the benefit of permanent work but are not giving those workers the proper conditions, like annual leave, sick leave and proper superannuation, that come with it. That is what the government is seeking to do. So much for the Gold Coast accountants in the Senate who don the high-vis vest and pretend that theyre workers, waiting for the big four accounting companies as they did before, like Senator Canavan.The fact is that the government did something else that went to the heart of their own lack of morality. They ripped out the wage theft provisions that were supported by everyone in the Senate and in the House of Representatives in an immature, vindictive act of spite. Even after the Prime Minister stood before this House and spoke about wage theft and how important it was, instead of having a separate bill before the House to deal with it, what they did was rip that out. We know wage theft is an incredible scourge that causes a great deal of hardship. It could have been so different if they actually had been constructive.The tragedy here is that, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the trade union movement and individual workers put aside a whole lot of the hard-fought conditions in order to keep businesses going, in order to be constructive. The model was there. And what was the payback for those workers? This tardy piece of cheap legislation to undermine wages and conditions, at a time when the Reserve Bank is making it very clear that it is the undermining of wages that is holding back our national economy. This farce should be voted against, and Labor will be doing just that.","Fair Work Amendment (Supporting Australias Jobs and Economic Recovery) Bill 2021","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ALBANESE (Grayndler—Leader of the Opposition) ","(11:48):"
38,0,0,0,1,1,"Burke, Tony, MP","DYW","Watson","ALP","N/A",2902," Eight long years and what have the government come back with? What we have in front of us now has nothing to do with the working group process that took place. What we have in front of us right now has nothing to do with anything about post-COVID reform, nothing at all. What we have in front of us is the same old ideological wish list that this government always believed in and just put in the back drawer for a long time.What was the point? Remember all the stories about the new accord and how the Prime Minister believed he was going to be the next Bob Hawke? They had the unions turn up in good faith, and people sat down and they had all the working group meetings. There was a walk-out during it, when different factions of the business community walked out when they got upset that there was an agreement between the ACTU and the BCA to get enterprise agreements going. But whenever there was a hint of consensus the government didnt want anything to do with that, and they ended up with a piece of legislation that had nothing at all to do with the working group process. Then, when the bill appeared, the bill in its first form had a wage cut that was available—the better off overall test gone—for the next two years, for agreements that would then last a further two years. That is four years where wage cuts were to be legitimised. That was the governments response when they decided to completely ignore the working group process.Now, after the process thats happened in the Senate, weve ended up with a bill that does two things: it promotes casualisation and it legitimises wage theft. Thats what weve got. Weve got in front of us right now legislation that is about two things. On the promoting of casualisation, an agreement came up last week between the ACTU and COSBOA, and amendments were moved. Those opposite should never come into this chamber again and pretend that they are friends of small business or pretend that in some way their approach to industrial relations is driven by a concern about small business. What they did last week—and if they vote for the bill in its current form in the division thats coming up, what theyre about to do now—is reject the requests of the small-business lobby on industrial relations. Thats exactly whats in front of them right now.We moved those amendments, and then the government decided, Nup, you cant have any of that, and then we successfully got some other sections out of the bill. Then an eight-year-old government did something that you would expect from an eight-year-old: they had a tantrum. They said, If youre not going to let us cut workers pay, then we wont criminalise wage theft. That was their decision: that, if they dont get to cut pay, they wont criminalise wage theft. For all the questions that have come across the chamber over the past more than 12 months—about 7-Eleven, about the hospitality industry, about retail, about example after example where people had their wages stolen—we were told, before the pandemic, that they would act on wage theft. It was announced on 18 February 2020 that the legislation to criminalise wage theft was coming in the coming weeks.What happened when they finally had the legislation before them in the Senate, which they had said they would bring in? They moved to delete it. They moved to delete their own section of the legislation, even though originally none of this other stuff was attached to it. They then became so committed to the cutting of wages, so committed to making sure people didnt have to know what was in their enterprise agreement when they were voting and so committed to eight-year greenfield agreements without a pay rise that they ended up saying, Well, if we cant have our toys, we wont act on wage theft.So Im moving amendments that bring those wage-theft provisions back into this bill. They do two things. They bring back those provisions, and they make sure that we act on the criminalisation of wage theft. I move the amendments that have been circulated in my name:[instead of Senate amendment (1 0 ):(1) Schedule 1, item 2, page 4 (line 9) to page 5 (line 18), omit section 15A, substitute:15A Meaning of casual employee(1) A person is a casual employee of an employer if the employer makes no firm advance commitment to continuing and indefinite work according to an agreed pattern of work for the person.(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), in determining whether the employer makes no firm advance commitment to continuing and indefinite work according to an agreed pattern of work for the person, regard must be had to the following considerations:(a) whether the employer can elect to offer work and whether the person can elect to accept or reject work;(b) whether the person will work only as required;(c) whether the employment is described as casual employment;(d) whether the person will be entitled to a casual loading or a specific rate of pay payable only to casual employees under the terms of a fair work instrument;(e) the pattern of hours that is worked, or scheduled by the employer to be worked, by the person.Note: Under Division 4A of Part 2 2, a casual employee who has worked for an employer for at least 12 months and has, during at least the last 6 months of that time, worked a regular pattern of hours on an ongoing basis may be entitled to be offered, or request, conversion to full time employment or part time employment.(3) To avoid doubt, regard may also be had to considerations other than those referred to in subsection (2).[instead of Senate amendment (11):(2) Schedule 1, item 3, page 12 (line 28) to page 13 (line 10), omit subsections 66M(1) and (2), substitute:Application of this section(1) This section applies to a dispute between an employer and employee about either or both of the following:(a) whether or not an employee is a casual employee as defined in section 15A;(b) the operation of this Division.(2) However, this section does not apply in relation to the dispute if:(a) a fair work instrument that applies to the employee includes a term that provides a procedure for dealing with the dispute;

41,0,0,0,1,1,"Bandt, Adam, MP","M3C","Melbourne","AG","N/A",2905," This government wants to make insecure work worse. We already know that insecure work in this country is at crisis point. Insecure work makes it harder to plan your life, because you dont know whether youre going to be working on any particular day or not. It can make it harder to plan a family. Weve heard from worker after worker in the inquiries in this place who say, I just didnt know whether I could start a family or get a house of my own, because I just wasnt guaranteed a job next year, next month or the day after next. It makes it really hard to do basic things that many of us used to take for granted, like get a roof over our heads.The cost of affording a house at the moment is through the roof. If you can find a place to rent near where you work, youre lucky. If you are looking for a place to buy, you know youll be priced out of the market because the government keeps giving billions of dollars a year in subsidies to people whove already got two, three or four houses. But, if you are looking for a place to buy, and you go to the bank manager to try and get a mortgage, if you are in a form of insecure work, it makes it that much harder.What is this government trying to do? Instead of outlawing insecure work and instead of saying, Insecure work is getting worse in this country, and weve got to tackle it, theyve brought a bill to this place that would help spread insecure work like wildfire. How would it do that? The bill that were being asked to agree to here, the Fair Work Amendment (Supporting Australias Jobs and Economic Recovery) Bill 2021, would basically give the employer the right to determine whether youre a casual or not and decide it even if youre not. In other words, you could be someone whos actually a part-time worker or even potentially a full-time worker, but, if the employer decides its in their interest to call you a casual, your opportunity to appeal against that is taken away. In other words, this is going to put a legal stamp on some widespread forms of insecure work and exploitation that exists in this country.The government, under pressure from the Greens, Labor—almost all of the Senate—and unions, was forced to gut some of the other terrible provisions from this bill. Those provisions would have allowed, for example, full-time workers and even part-time workers to be put on a new form of contract that we might as well effectively call permanent casual. Under the new form of contract that the government wanted to get through but was forced to back down on in this bill, youd have been guaranteed maybe only a minimum of 16 hours a week and your employer would have been able to move you up or down, so you would have had next to no certainty over your working life and it would have been the end of full-time, secure, ongoing employment as we know it. It would have introduced a new kind of contract into the Australian industrial relations system. Working together, working with the community, people across the political spectrum managed to get the government to ditch that, but this government is so petulant that it also said, If we cant have all the nasty things that weve been trying for years to get through and were now going to use the pandemic as an excuse to pursue, then were going to take even the good things, like cracking down on wage theft, out of the bill as well. So what are we left with in this bill? After the government dummy spits, were left with only a provision that will entrench insecure work in this country by allowing employers to say that youre a casual, even if youre not. If you want to go to court and complain about it, bad luck. If you want to go to the Fair Work Commission and complain about it, bad luck. This comes after we have seen, year after year after year, people come to this place saying, My life is getting harder because insecure work is getting worse in this country. We have an obligation in this place to stand up for decent work and decent conditions.The amendments being moved by the opposition are good amendments and will put back in some of the good bits that the government has taken out, but the provision that the government is asking us to sign up to is one that does nothing more than entrench insecure work in this country. We want to outlaw insecure work, so thats why the governments approach must be opposed.","Fair Work Amendment (Supporting Australias Jobs and Economic Recovery) Bill 2021","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BANDT (Melbourne—Leader of the Australian Greens) ","(11:59):"
42,0,0,0,1,1,"Albanese, Anthony, MP","R36","Grayndler","ALP","N/A",2906," I want to take the opportunity in this debate to talk about the real impact that this legislation, the Fair Work Amendment (Supporting Australia’s Jobs and Economic Recovery) Bill 2021, is having and the governments approach to industrial relations.The real impact hit home to me two weeks ago when I, along with the shadow minister and the member for Hotham, attended the McCormicks site in the member for Hothams electorate in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne. There we met with people on the picket line of the United Workers Union. There we met workers who have worked on that site for decades—workers who work day shift and night shift, largely from migrant backgrounds, who have come to Australia for a better life for themselves and their families. Do you know what? They have not had a pay increase for five years—in five years, not a dollar! They are working there to provide products that everyday Australians can enjoy. They produce the gravy that goes to KFC. They produce some of the sauces that go to McDonalds and Hungry Jacks. Those workers proudly produce a range of products in the member for Hothams electorate.These men and women are working hard each and every day, and their patience has run out. Its not surprising because the deal that the company has on the table is again for zero dollars, unless they give up more conditions as part of the changes that the company wants. Thats because the company knows that the government is on their side, not on the workers side. I was there with the member for Hotham and the shadow minister, the member for Watson, to say to those workers, We are on your side. I committed to those workers on that day that I would raise their issues in this parliament on their behalf. I make this pledge on behalf of the Australian Labor Party that we want to see wages increase for working people; that we understand that that is good for our economy; that we want more secure work, not less secure work, as is provided for in this legislation; that we do want to outlaw wage theft; and that we do want to address the existing power imbalance.But this government is pursuing this mean-spirited legislation that is bad not only for individual workers but for all workers. This government says that, if we address insecure work, its complicated to pay people the minimum wage of $19.84 an hour. I launched a report at the Labour Council of New South Wales last Friday. There, I met Mr Wong, a person who has worked on farms and who has come to Australia from the Mongolian province of China for a better life. He came here because he thought that Australia was the land of the fair go, where he would be treated decently. What we have in this country is people across a range of industries not even being paid the minimum wage. Thats not complicated. What a lost opportunity—an industrial relations omnibus bill which should have made work more secure and which should have provided for increased wages and increased good outcomes for business as well. We actually had last week an extraordinary press conference with Mr Strong from COSBOA and the Secretary of the ACTU, Sally McManus, saying we have agreed on whats good for small business and good for workers, yet this government rejects all of that for this narrow, mean-spirited, vindictive, childish, petulant legislation that is before us today.

48,0,0,0,1,1,"Chester, Darren, MP","IPZ","Gippsland","Nats","N/A",2913," I move:That the House concur with the resolution of the Senate.First of all, I recognise all serving members in this place and anyone viewing this debate at home today who put on the uniform of the Navy, the Army or the Air Force and, on behalf of the parliament, I extend to them a simple thank you for their service to our nation.The closing sentence of the veterans covenant, which passed with unanimous support in this House in 2019, says: For what they have done, this we will do. Its an obligation for those of us who have never put on the uniform to ensure, on behalf of a grateful nation, that the services and benefits provided to our serving community flow to them when they need them and as they need them after their period of service has concluded. I do hope that after today we will continue to move forward in a very bipartisan manner on an issue of public policy that has always enjoyed incredible support across the chamber.The government do understand the very strong feelings about this issue across the chamber and do not oppose a royal commission. We—and I think this parliament—have a proven track record of taking this issue seriously and we will now move to carefully consider the views of the parliament. This is a complex and sensitive issue of public policy where I believe its entirely reasonable to have different views on the potential solutions, but first of all we need to define the problem were talking about.As a father, as a member of parliament, as the representative of the seat of Gippsland and as a minister in the Commonwealth of Australia it appals me that more than 3,000 Australians take their own lives each year. Sadly, our veterans are not immune from that scourge. In the order of 35 to 40 veterans take their lives each year. No number of suicides is acceptable to me as a minister. No number of suicides is acceptable to the Australian public.I stress that todays discussion should not result in any politician or any political party trying to claim any win for themselves, because none of us will win until the number of suicides in our community is zero. This is not a competition about who cares the most, whos got the most compassion, because we all care and were all compassionate about this cause. But it is certainly a competition about how we develop the best possible policies to support our veterans and their families. We need to focus on developing policies which deliver support services that actually make a difference on the ground and prevent suicide in our community.I must stress that service in the Australian Defence Force is overwhelmingly a positive experience for the vast majority of individuals who serve. Ive had the opportunity over the past seven years to meet with many serving men and women, whether in training or on deployment, and the passion they have is hard to describe. They develop skills which set them up for life—teamwork, leadership, problem-solving, resilience, skills that make an enormous contribution to our community when they return to civilian life. But it is true that for some their service can have significant physical and mental health impacts. And I refer again to the veterans covenant, which won bipartisan support in this place: For what they have done, this we will do. That is our obligation to ensure we continue to provide the support services our veterans and their families need upon transition.To be fair, and I think those opposite would largely agree, there has been a lot of action taken over recent times to work in partnership with the ex-service community on practical solutions—for example, the response to the Bird inquiry, referring to the tragic loss of Jesse Bird, who took his own life many years ago. Again, that won the support of the House. A young soldier was seeking help, and the delays in receiving that help led to him taking his own life, with just $5 in the bank. The House and the Senate agreed on the introduction, for the first time, of a veteran interim payment to be made available to any veteran seeking support for mental health issues while the claim was being processed. That was a reform which came about through constructive dialogue across the chamber.The request for a royal commission that were talking about today is not a new request. Its not something that has sprung out of the blue; its been discussed for many years now. In fact, back in late 2019, I met with families of members who had taken their own lives, I met with veterans groups and I met across departmental boundaries to develop a model which I believe would overcome some of the shortcomings of a royal commission. And that was the introduction of our policy to provide a national commissioner with all the powers of a royal commissioner. That policy was developed over a period of months in late 2019 and 2020. It was well received at the time; it was well received by veterans organisations. The policy that the coalition has taken for the past 15 or 16 months now on the National Commissioner for Defence and Veteran Suicide Prevention is still, I believe, a very good public policy. Its been strongly supported by key veterans groups and mental health experts throughout Australia—and Ill get to that in just a moment. But the federal government does understand that some veterans and grieving families want both: they want a royal commission first and then a permanent national commissioner to provide enduring support. I think it is a complex issue that does require that enduring focus.For the record, the Prime Minister himself has never ruled out a royal commission. He has been directly engaged with me as we try to address these difficult public health issues around mental wellbeing and suicide. We have endeavoured to listen to the ex-service community and to introduce free mental health care for life for all veterans and their families. We expanded the Open Arms counselling service, including the provision of peer counsellors, to provide support for our veterans. We have, for the first time, funded psychiatric assistance dogs to support those veterans with mental health concerns and weve provided more than $230 million per year in mental wellbeing initiatives through the Department of Veterans Affairs. So we will continue to listen to ex-service organisations and listen to our own backbench, particularly the veterans in our backbench. We will listen across the chamber and across the parliament as we deal with this particularly complex and sensitive issue of suicide in the military community. While were having this conversation today, I must stress to anyone who is listening that the veterans counselling service, Open Arms, is available on 1800011046. Last year, during the peak of the pandemic, Open Arms received an incredible surge in calls from our veteran community and were able to cope with that additional demand quite admirably in the circumstances.From my personal perspective, as the minister, I have tried to unite the various veterans organisations, with varying degrees of success, I must say. It is a community which has very strong opinions, a great deal of passion, and a great deal of determination to achieve good things for veterans across the nation. I do know, as a member of parliament, that language does matter, and I know that my words did cause some concern to some veterans when I said two years ago that I didnt see the point of spending millions of dollars on lawyers at a royal commission when I could spend that same money as Minister for Veterans Affairs on medical specialists helping veterans. I was confident at that point that we could develop policies that would unite the veteran community, and I didnt mean to cause offence, but I do stress that I believe that a national commissioner for suicide prevention is good public policy and that that is still supported by key veterans groups and mental health experts.The reason I make that point is that we would seek to provide an enduring national commissioner who will have the power to summon witnesses, hold public hearings, take evidence on oath or affirmation, compel the production of documents or witness statements, and receive information and evidence in private. Unlike a royal commission, it would be an enduring body, rather than a point-in-time inquiry. It would also provide an opportunity for families, ADF members and others affected by suicide to tell their stories and help, at an independent level, at arms length from the Department of Veterans Affairs, to develop recommendations to improve our delivery in this regard. It has won the support of key mental health organisations and ex-service groups, such as RSL National, Soldier On, Suicide Prevention Australia, and the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists. They are all supportive of that position. But, as I said just a few moments ago, I do understand that some veterans and grieving families want both: a royal commission first and then a permanent national commissioner. I reiterate, for the record, that the Prime Minister himself has never ruled out a royal commission. He has been very supportive to me as I have sought to address these complex public health issues around mental wellbeing and suicide. We will continue to liaise across the chamber to deliver the results that the Australian people are demanding.I do offer, in that spirit of bipartisanship across the chamber, to the many members who are passionate about this issue and to the ex-service community itself a little bit of advice around how we take this debate forward. Our job is to make sure that we continue to give hope, not take hope way from those who may be struggling with their mental health. We do need to assure our veteran community, our serving men and women, and their families that there are pathways to good health and that this parliament stands united in supporting them to achieve that pathway. Our job is very much to give hope to them so that they can recover from their difficulties. We need to reassure our veteran community and their families that we are working in their interests and that help is available to them. As a critical point, we need to reassure our veterans and their families that we are capable of working in their interests together and that help is available to them in their community.We do know that early intervention on mental health issues is critically important to achieving the best possible outcome for the individual concerned. It is an enormous challenge to remove the stigma around mental health in this nation and to reassure our serving men and women that it is okay to seek help for mental health issues. You are not weak. You have not failed. It is okay to seek help and to reach out and get that help when you need it. Our challenge as a government—and, dare I say, the challenge for the opposition as well—is to make sure that, when people reach out for help, that help is available to them in their community in a timely way. That is an ongoing and difficult issue Im dealing with through the Department of Veterans Affairs, and I know the shadow minister is well aware of the challenge we are facing in terms of the increased demand for services, the increasing number of veterans coming forward who are eligible for benefits, and the need to get on top of the time taken for that process, which is becoming a great concern for me as minister. Were seeking to overcome that in partnership with the ex-services community. I stress again that its okay to seek help for mental health issues; youre not weak and you have not failed. Help is available to you across our nation. Again, for anyone who is struggling with their mental wellbeing, please be assured that free support is available on 1800 011 046 to the Open Arms team. And I want to thank the Open Arms team for their incredible capacity to listen to stories and to help people on their journey back to good health.In that same vein I need to thank my own staff in my ministerial office, who have been with me now for three years in this role, and also the staff at the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Department of Veterans Affairs is going through a massive transformation. In the order of $500 million in additional resources have been provided to try to transform DVA into an organisation that is fit for purpose for the next 100 years. It is an organisation exclusively established to support our veterans and their families across the Commonwealth of Australia. It is proudly led by a veteran herself in Ms Cosson, the secretary of our department. She is the first female secretary of that department and I believe she does an amazing job in seeking to develop public policies and to resolve difficult and challenging issues with the beneficial approach that we expect in managing some of these tough issues. I want to thank Secretary Cosson and her staff for their determination, their compassion and their resilience in delivering those outcomes across our veteran community. Im proud to work with them all.For the record: I commenced my comments here today by thanking our serving men and women for their service. The government understands the very strong feelings about this issue across the chamber and does not oppose a royal commission. We do have a proven track record of taking this issue very seriously and will now move to carefully consider the views of the parliament. I thank the House.","Defence Personnel: Suicide","RESOLUTIONS OF THE SENATE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr CHESTER (Gippsland—Deputy Leader of the House, Minister for Defence Personnel and Minister for Veterans Affairs) ","(12:26):"
49,0,0,0,1,1,"Albanese, Anthony, MP","R36","Grayndler","ALP","N/A",2917," Veteran suicide remains front and centre for far too many Australian families. Around 600 veterans have died at their own hand over the last two decades—600! And there has been an epidemic of at least 18 defence and veteran suicides over the last three months, nearly twice the figure of the previous three months. Two ex-service personnel took their own lives over three days in the first week of this month.This is a national calamity. Australian men and women who wear our uniform in our name deserve our respect and our support. This deserves the closest attention of the government. I think the minister is a good man who genuinely cares about veterans, as does the shadow minister. On this, though, I have sat down with veterans, including people like Heston Russell and Julie-Ann Finney, who I was with again today—Julie-Ann, of course, lost her son. They convinced me that a royal commission was the right thing to do. It was the first royal commission that I called for as the leader of the Labor Party, and I did not do so lightly. I sought, and will continue to seek, support from across this parliament for our position.Ill say, with respect to the minister, that he needs to do a bit better than just say he will carefully consider the views that are about to be passed unanimously by the Senate and the House of Representatives. What our veterans—every one of them—have fought for is our democracy and our way of life. This isnt a committee passing a motion; this is our national parliament. The Senate did it last week and the House of Representatives is going to do it today, the government has indicated. If thats not binding on the government then I dont know what is; I dont know why were here, frankly—all 225, or thereabouts, members and senators. Its not a talkfest. We make decisions to reflect national opinion—and national opinion says that we need a royal commission. That is what the families are saying. Thats what veterans are saying. We have had so many reviews, so many inquiries, but the situation has not got better.It is more than a year since the Prime Minister responded to our call for a royal commission by announcing a National Commissioner for Defence and Veteran Suicide Prevention, claiming at the time that it would be better than a royal commission. The Prime Minister said on the Today show on 5 February last year: I spoke to Julie-Ann Finney last night, whos been an advocate with this for many times, and she couldnt be more pleased that were taking this step. Its bigger and better than a royal commission, beyond what she had hoped for. We cant just look back. Weve got to look forward. I think weve come up with a better way that brings everybody together.Labor, at the time, indicated that we were prepared to examine this proposal, which we werent consulted on beforehand it must be said, and whether indeed it would have the powers of a royal commission and be appropriately structured and staffed to deliver the kind of results which I think we all would hope for. Everyone wants to see this scourge end. We can all accept that; this isnt a partisan issue. But the more we looked at it the more we agreed with people like Julie-Ann Finney that this simply wasnt enough, that this was a watered down version of a royal commission which would do little more than the work of a coroner—as important as that is—that it wouldnt have the potential with the resources youd normally see allocated to a royal commission, that it wouldnt have the independence, wide scope or terms of reference of a royal commission, that it wouldnt deliver a final list of recommendations that pressure is then placed on the government to implement. It is a completely untested model, which is why we need a royal commission first. And then perhaps this sort of model, as a long-term standing organisation, may well advance the cause which we all hope it would.But that doesnt mitigate the need for a royal commission; and thats why so many veterans and their families have actually said that, faced with the governments proposal or nothing at all, they would prefer nothing. Thats been the response in the inquiry that was established in the Senate. And people across the chamber who take these issues seriously, including the former veterans who grace us with their presence here in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, need to be listened to as well. I would have disagreements with Jacqui Lambie on some issues, but on standing up for veterans she is just so fair dinkum and so passionate. She deserves credit for continuing to advocate so unequivocally for a royal commission.And thats why the national commissioner legislation was defeated in the Senate last year. Its a big call to vote against that; its a call that we didnt make easily. Well, the government withdrew it because it didnt have support. But thats just a political manoeuvre, which is typical of this government, frankly—a political response to something that was an issue of substance. The fact is that the interim commissioner, also a friend of the current defence minister, is investigating the defence ministers own department. That doesnt give any faith to those who want to see real change. The interim commissioner actually invited veterans and families to a meeting in March and asked them to pay $100 for the privilege—just extraordinary! So, having delayed and ducked and weaved, it then launched its own preferred scheme in the face of the legitimate concerns that were put forward. Of course, the Daily Telegraph announced on its front page that it was a royal commission on the day of the Prime Ministers announcement. When we examined it, it simply wasnt there.The government is agreeing to this motion today. But you cant agree to a motion and say you oppose a royal commission; its weasel words. The time for politics is over. The House of Representatives will speak, as the Senate has spoken. It cant be resisted anymore. The government should be calling a royal commission today given they have known that this has been coming for a long period of time. You cant have the defence ministers friend investigating the ministers own department. We know that a similar thing happened with regard to Teddy Sheean and the VC. This is a tired eight-year-old government with an ear of tin sometimes and a heart of stone at others. It needs to actually listen and act. If it does that, it will be welcomed by us on this side of the chamber, by crossbenchers, by those people like Julie-Ann Finney and others who fought so hard for this royal commission.I also pay tribute to Shayne Neumann, our shadow minister, and others who helped to make this call and campaigned so strongly for it. This should be a moment of unity for the parliament but it has to be one that does not oppose the motion; it has to support the motion. Thats an important distinction and one the government should acknowledge and should commit to here today.","Defence Personnel: Suicide","RESOLUTIONS OF THE SENATE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ALBANESE (Grayndler—Leader of the Opposition) ","(12:41):"
50,0,0,0,1,1,"Pearce, Gavin, MP",282306,"Braddon","LP","N/A",2918," Im proud and honoured to speak in favour of this motion this morning. I do so not only as the member for Braddon but as an ex-serviceman. Id also like to welcome the families and the ex-service men and women that we have in the gallery today. You are very welcome here. I was just a young kid, 18 years old, true of eye and straight of limb—as they say—when I joined the Australian Army. I was a very different person 20 years later as a 38-year-old, somewhat worse for wear. But along the way, I had an incredible journey, an incredible life. I had a life that was filled with purpose, with teamwork, with mateship. Anyone whos ever served knows the military is a big family and we stick together more than most.However, the rigours of that service life have an effect. Its had an effect on me, not only physically but mentally. Ive said before in this place that I suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder and Im treated daily for that. I said when I mentioned it in this place that I didnt mention it for pity. I mentioned it to let all veterans know that, yes, you may suffer the same thing that I suffer but theres a light at the end of the tunnel, and you can get help. Help is there today and tomorrow, and itll always be there. We need as a collective to make sure that that help is always there and its always strong.The royal commission is going to be tough. It is going to have a very critical, tough look at a very tough subject. Its going to be tough on the families. Its going to be tough on the mates of those involved. Its going to be tough on units, on the chain of command and on families. I think during this process everyone involved is going to require support at the highest level. Theyre going to require that support on the ground as this royal commission is going on.When I was a digger, I used to pride myself on the fact that I was a soldiers soldier. I always stuck up for my diggers. I never left one behind. I maintain that today. As this royal commission goes about its very critical job that it has to do, I want to make sure that those diggers out there, those veterans out there, and those families that I talked about earlier are protected not just today, tomorrow, next year or at the completion of the royal commission. I want to make sure that there is help there every day for them. I think it behoves us all to ensure in a bipartisan way that that help is provided. I echo the words of the minister and his focus on that support.I also want it very clear to everybody involved how much emphasis I place on families. Families play an important part in the important transition process between defence and civilian life. Often—and I know this in my own case—if you suffer from one thing or another along the way from the rigours of service life youll strike out at the ones closest to you, your family. I see heads nodding. Ive seen this along my journey as well. People can take it out on their families. What invariably happens is the spouse packs up the children and leaves. Then theres another issue. Then the bills for the child support come. Then theres another financial issue. Then theres an alcohol issue or a drug issue. We start putting on weight and injuries that we picked up along the way in our service life get worse and are exacerbated by that. Depression sets in. No-ones there. The big family that we had as part of the military isnt there any longer. Why is it worth it? As far as Im concerned, that answers a lot of questions as to why we go through this. I know because Ive been through this. I want families protected in this. I want those kids to know exactly why mum or dad is feeling the pain that theyre feeling and maybe why they act the way that they do. I think families are important, and I want families looked at and supported throughout this entire process. I mean that so sincerely.Our ESOs, ex-service organisations, play a critical role not only in the transition process between defence and civilian life but also in encouraging people to take up a new regimen. Our diggers, at 7.20 every morning, get up and do PT. At 10 oclock they have morno. On Thursday afternoon, they have sport. They get used to that routine. Theyre fit and young. Theyve got their mates around them. When they leave, there are no mates, no PT, no routine, no structure and no support, apart from the supports that we as a government put in. Theyre incredibly important. Its important that not only that veteran is looked at but that veterans family unit is looked after. I want to see that happen from the get-go.Private enterprises and businesses play an important part as well. I think over the years what has evolved in the veteran community is a broken digger mentality, whereby, irrespective of whether there is any truth in it or not, some employers think that if they employ an ex-defence person then that person will come with baggage. But Im here to tell the story that employing a veteran is good for your business. Employing a veteran gives them a new purpose in life. We reconnect them with the purpose that they had. Their ultimate purpose in life was to defend their country and look after their mates. The sooner we can connect them to a new job, family and profession the better. A purpose is absolutely paramount and fundamental when it comes to reconnecting our veterans to their futures. If we dont connect them to a purpose, then weve failed them. To businesses out there: do the right thing and employ a veteran, because itll add to your bottom line—theyll do your business the world of good. They come with a set of skills that is unmatched: theyre confident, they have a mission focus, they can identify problems, they work well in big teams and small teams, and they wont stop until they get the job done. If an obstacle is put in front of a veteran, theyll look for a way around it. Theyll identify the problem, identify the route, move around it and continue on their mission, and thats what all businesses need. Businesses out there need to play a part in that transition process also.We sometimes do not have too much to do with our friends in the military, from time to time. Were not regular in our friendship groups. But, when you meet one of your mates who you knew 20 or 30 years ago who you served with, its like you havent been away. Its like you saw them yesterday. We need to work on a network by which we can reconnect our friends that we served with. I want them to also make new friends, because we need to take those veterans, their families and their friends on that journey. As far as Im concerned, this transition is absolutely paramount.Whilst I support the royal commission, the only reservation I have—and Ive alluded to it during my words this morning—is that I want something for our veterans tomorrow. With a royal commission, its going to take 18 months before we start to see any action. What happens to the digger thats contemplating that tomorrow, on the weekend or next month? All I say, in closing, is that, as well as this royal commission, I want something to protect our veterans and their families now.","Defence Personnel: Suicide","RESOLUTIONS OF THE SENATE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr PEARCE (Braddon) ","(12:52):"
51,0,0,0,1,1,"Neumann, Shayne, MP","HVO","Blair","ALP","N/A",2920," It is now clear there is overwhelming support for a royal commission into the scourge and tragedy of veteran suicide. The motion that came before the Senate, the resolution before the chamber today, will be passed without dissent. If our democracy means anything, the government should act upon these resolutions today and, without procrastination, call for a royal commission. It is what veterans and their families want. Its what hundreds of thousands of Australians want—they signed a petition to that effect. Its what many of the governments own MPs want.Today we saw a rally, small in number but strong in intensity and in deliberation, asking, urging and pleading for the government to do the right thing and call for a royal commission. I want to thank Heston Russell, Julie-Ann Finney and Karen Bird, who Ive spoken to many times. And I want to pay tribute to someone not on my side of politics but who I consider to be almost on my side of politics: Senator Jacqui Lambie. I think you have done a fantastic job, with the productive and constructive way youve interacted with our office. Your advocacy in this place is exemplary. Thank you very much, Jacqui. You have been fantastic to work with.We shouldnt have to get to a point where this resolution is before the chamber. The Prime Minister needs to do the right thing and give the grieving families of veterans the proper investigation, the royal commission, they want. The government have said they will carefully consider a resolution, but thats not good enough. The Leader of the Opposition said thats weasel words, and I agree. Its simply shifting responsibility. Its important for us to look at why were here today. Suicide amongst veterans has caused more death in ADF personnel who served in overseas operational service in the last 20 years. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare says there is one defence personnel or veteran suicide every 2½ weeks, although, anecdotally, advocates will tell you its more. There have been at least 18 defence and veteran suicides in 2021, over the past three months—nearly twice that of the previous three months. And the suicide death toll amongst veterans is 32.5 per cent higher in 2021 than it was in 2020. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare says that the suicide rate amongst serving defence personnel is less than half that of the wider Australian community. So somethings happening in the transition in how were treating veterans after theyve served our country.Like the Leader of the Opposition, I want to pay tribute to those on both sides of the chamber who have served and those who are continuing to serve in warlike situations and peacekeeping operations and around the country. But lest anyone think this is a male-only thing, I will say that it is not. That data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare shows that the rate of suicide amongst female veterans was 127 per cent higher than the rate of suicide amongst females in the general population. So theres a lot of work to be done.I pay tribute to the minister. Weve had a bipartisan and constructive relationship. It was challenging and difficult for Labor to get to a point where we felt that we had to depart from the government on the issue of the national commission. We listened to people like Julie-Ann, Heston, Karen Bird and others. We had those interviews. We had those meetings. We listened to their voices. And the government didnt consult—the minister didnt consult me—when they announced the national commission. But we did consult the government and say, If youre going to have a national commissioner, you want to make sure that that person is as independent as possible. We suggested something like a Federal Court judge or a Supreme Court judge—someone independent of the military.We were really shocked and disappointed with the government when they appointed someone who had been a friend of the defence minister for 20 years and a brigadier. We felt that that wouldnt create the independence needed. We did not want a friend of the minister to investigate this. We also felt very much that that role really was a glorified federal coroner. We really looked at it, particularly in view of this fact: that the person would be plonked in the Attorney-Generals Department and would be doing an interim review, within 12 months, of at least 400 suicides. Any coroner, anyone whos been involved in coronial inquests, will tell you that cant be done successfully or be given the kind of effort thats needed to actually examine what happened.So the government also didnt provide the independence, the resources or the scope. And of course the government says to us all the time that this is better than a royal commission. Well, its not. Its not the same, and its not better than a royal commission. Just because its permanent and enduring doesnt make it stronger or better—and its not. If you look at the way the government has seen that national commissioner operate, that person hasnt acted in a way that we expected they would. So we got to a point where we of course sent this national commissioner bill off to a Senate inquiry. The Senate inquiry saw many, many submissions, from RSLs around the country and from individuals, advocates and people involved in mental health issues, and the feedback overwhelmingly was to oppose the bill. We felt very much that we were fortified in coming to that position last year. The government knew they didnt have the numbers and pulled the bill in December last year. The minister said in an interview in January, I think it was, that they were going to bring the bill back on. They havent brought the bill back on, because its friendless, because no-one on the crossbench will support it. We wont support it either.So were left with—and this is what happened today—sending a message to the government that not just the community but the Senate and the House of Representatives and their own backbenches want a royal commission. If ever there was a moral authority for the government to listen to, its what the Senate, elected by the Australian people, and the House of Representatives, elected by the Australian people, have to say. There will be not one voice of dissent from those opposite. They will support it. So I say to the Prime Minister: dont shift, dont blame; take responsibility and call it today. And deal with the opposition and the crossbench, like Senator Lambie. Speak to her, speak to us, speak to the crossbench and make sure that this royal commission has the support of the whole of the House and the whole of the Senate. Listen to everyone. Have the meetings. Dont make the same mistake when you call the royal commission. Make sure the terms of reference are broad and cover a whole range of areas. Dont cut it off arbitrarily like the national commissioner role has done. Make sure it covers the whole suite, and look forward to where we can go. I say to the minister: please respond to the Productivity Commission report that came out in the middle of 2019. Only 25 of the recommendations in that voluminous report have been responded to. Can the minister please do that?I understand that theyve done things when it comes to mental health issues. But they are not even complying with the waiting times on processing. They have outsourced, labour hired and privatised the Department of Veterans Affairs to the point where the arbitrary cap on staffing has meant that people are in a position where they are frustrated, anxious, concerned and suffering from issues that relate to their mental health, because the Department of Veterans Affairs is not responding adequately to the processing. Theyve got middle-ranking public servants who should be there, but theyve labour hired and outsourced those people. We get it every Senate estimates; Senator Ayres asks question after question on this issue, at my request, and the government comes back with the same response. The secretary of the department, Liz Cosson—and I pay tribute to her—says the same thing again and again—that she wants to lift the staffing cap, but the government wont let her. So, Minister, win the battle in the cabinet. Make sure the resourcing is there for the department to deal with veterans in a professional, competent, caring and sensitive way. Thats the way you deal with the issues there.I say to the minister and the Prime Minister: listen to the Senate and the House of Representatives. Listen to the voices of people like Julie-Ann. Listen to the voice of Karen Bird. Listen to Heston and his mates. Do the right thing. Listen to Soldier On, who have come out in support of a royal commission. Listen to the RSLs in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, who all support a royal commission. Do the right thing, act on it and call for it today.","Defence Personnel: Suicide","RESOLUTIONS OF THE SENATE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr NEUMANN (Blair) ","(13:02):"

Im sorry for every mother that has had to bury their son, for every family member who has had to bury a loved one and for mates who are beside themselves. All I can say is: Im sorry.I have all this paper to say how I feel, but I cant even read it. I want to talk to you, Julie-Ann. Thats why were here. I cant imagine the turmoil your life has had to go through, from the loss of your son, to coming to Canberra to meet with everyone, to working with Jacqui Lambie, Heston, Gav, me and those across the floor and on this side. And I wish Karen was here too. I love Karen Bird. She is the mother of Jesse Bird, who I served with, who I had the pleasure of living with, deploying with and fighting with. I take his death on my shoulders as my responsibility, even though its not. The weight of the burden never goes away. The black hole in my heart, for my 10 mates who have died, is nowhere near the pain you must have been enduring this whole time. Im sorry youve had to come all this way to sit in the chamber and listen to us speak again. That would only make you relive all these harsh times. I just wanted to say that to you.I want to echo the words of my mate Gavin Pearce, the member for Braddon. We argued about who was going to go first because I feel physically ill. I hate having to relive, re-talk everything. There is no weight off the soldiers standing at this dispatch box at all. Every day we have to live with the loss of our mates. Every day we have to live with the loss of people who have served. You have to live with the loss of your son. I think Gav did a really good job with such a tough—not a tough motion to talk about, not a tough royal commission or national commission to talk about; its the talk about your loved ones. Its the talk about your friends. Its the talk about the member for Solomons mates. Its the talk about not just the people who we represent in our electorates but the people who in my case I call brothers, my mates thatve died—thats the bit.I wasnt a senior officer in the Defence Force. I wasnt even a corporal. I was a private soldier. Im not supposed to be in this place. My ilk dont come here. But I take my mates voices—and some of them not so good, some of them troubled. Im definitely not a saint either. Ive done a lot of dumb things in my life. Every day I hear more of people that I know, people of my level, at the private level, who have died at their own hand.When I was on operations in Afghanistan we accepted death. I didnt expect it or accept it when I came home. I didnt think that I would be going to funerals all the time. I didnt think that people who I called brother wouldnt reach out because their pain and the hole they were in was so dark. Weve been there. Ive been there. I spent years in that dark hole. My wife pulled me out of that hole, and some good friends gave me a good clip round the ear or a punch in the mouth. The hole was that dark that it felt like there was nothing else and thats why were in support.In my heart I think that—notwithstanding what were talking about—an ongoing national commissioner can work. I dont believe that any level of government has done enough to stop all the suicides. It doesnt matter what colour shirt you wear. I couldnt care less. I really believe that. I will work with anyone. I dont care. I talk with Jacqui on the phone. I dont want to bury any more people. I dont want any more mums, fathers, brothers, sons and daughters to bury their family members. I dont want to get a phone call at 1 am saying, Your mates died. I dont want to have to call my wife and say the same thing either. The effect doesnt ever stop and the pain never will. We—when I say we I am speaking of veterans on this side of the House—are in support, and some of them sit here with me today. Well support you. We will do what is right.I will also be in support of the national commissioner—not just the royal commission but both. I think that is good ongoing. I dont want to get into a political pointscoring thing. I think thats already kind of happened. I want to work with Shane, Darren, Stuey and Andrew. Im not calling them by their seats and this will probably get me in trouble later. I dont know where their seats are and, to be honest, I dont care. I want to work with everyone—and Luke, and the former Minister for Defence, Joel, whose son is still serving. We all want to get to the same area and sometimes our roads are not going in the right direction. But they should.On Wednesday or Thursday, when the motion was put into the Senate, I threw up. I threw up, not because I had to stand here and speak or because anyone was going to call me. It was because I just felt it all in my stomach and in my heart. I spoke with the PM, who, regardless of what anyone thinks, cares—he does. When I was in Townsville during the election campaign I got the phone call that Brad Carr had just died by suicide. I was standing next to the PM, and there were no cameras there—nothing. He put his arms around me and gave me a hug. He said: Its okay. You can go home. You dont need to do the rest of the day. But I didnt, because I wanted to come to this place to be able to stand with my colleagues—with people who I dont always agree with, like Jacqui—to do the right thing for our veterans, to make sure that they and their families are best supported in the electorate. I think that the family advocate, with Gwen Cherne, is a fantastic idea because its their voice that goes directly into changing how policy should be done.Im feeling a bit sick again, but I just wanted to say to you again, Julie-Ann, Karen Bird, Angela McKay and to everyone—the names just escape me—that Im sorry youve had to come all this way and Im sorry that this has happened. I support you and so do my colleagues. We support the motion; were not opposing it at all and now we just need to put the wheels in motion and get things moving. On behalf of all the veterans, thank you, and on behalf of all my mates, thank you. But Im sorry to all of them because we should not have to talk about suicides in our community. We will, and we must, do better.

I rise as the shadow defence minister and I havent been in the portfolio for long. Only a few weeks ago I met Julie-Ann Finney in my office. Many of you have met her and have known her longer than I have. That one meeting was all it took for me to understand not only the hurt, anguish and pain that she and many others like her have endured but also that it is critical that we move from the position of considering an independent commissioner to the position of considering a royal commission into veteran suicide. Nothing less will do. If you had any doubts, you need only listen to the member for Herbert, the member for Pearce or the member for Solomon. ADF personnel, who put themselves in harms way with their colleagues, troops and comrades, are telling us we need to do better.I believe the minister, who rose to speak on this today, has been doing the right thing. But the reality is that the bill before the Senate is not supported by the Senate. It is not seen as sufficient to truly and fundamentally examine the problems we are beset with in this area. As the member for Blair said, after leaving the Defence Force a person is nearly twice as likely to suicide than a person in the wider community. It is far more likely for a person to contemplate self-harm if they have left the Defence Force than it is for a person in the Defence Force. We need to get to the bottom of that. What is it that leads to this national tragedy, this national shame? Insufficient support? Our failure to provide assistance for the transition to a new life? A failure to find pathways into employment? Why are so many veterans homeless? So many veterans self-medicate, have family breakdowns and are not speaking to their family members because of the anguish, the hurt and the experiences they have confronted that we have not found a proper way to deal with.It seems clear that the entire parliament agrees that a royal commission is necessary. I assume that nobody will rise in this place today and speak against the need for a royal commission. So the one question remaining is: what will the government do about it? The passing of this motion is very important—the bipartisanship nature of it, as the member for Kennedy said, across the spectrum. But it will amount to nothing if the government doesnt announce a royal commission, doesnt publicly release draft terms of reference, doesnt foreshadow the time lines that are required for a new examination of this absolutely critical matter and doesnt make a commitment to responding properly and fairly to the recommendations of that royal commission.This is a remarkable debate, one of the best I think we have seen for some time in this place, so compellingly argued by, in particular, ADF personnel. I want to pay tribute to Senator Lambie, who has been advocating in the other place on this issue for many months, if not longer, as she does on many defence issues. If this motion is passed today, it will amount to nothing if the Prime Minister does not indicate a royal commission is imminent, the terms of reference and the time lines.","Defence Personnel: Suicide","RESOLUTIONS OF THE SENATE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[9]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR (Gorton) ","(13:24):"

Fundamentally, women are just asking to be treated as equals, as human beings. Enough is enough.This parliament must do better. We must lead to improve the culture of how women are treated in our workplaces, our communities and our homes. We need safe, appropriate workplace standards that protect women from intimidation, harassment and discrimination. On average, one woman per week is murdered by a current or former partner. One in three Australian women have experienced physical violence since the age of 15.

Its important because, even though multiple births account for only 1.5 per cent of births across Australia, the health risks for multiple births increase tenfold for both mothers and babies. The risk of preterm birth is 10 times higher for multiples, and the risk of postpartum depression is double for parents of multiples. The theme of Multiple Birth Awareness Week this year is Identical or fraternal? Testing for zygosity matters. I can tell you, on behalf of all the twin parents out there, its the No.1 question you get asked: Are they identical or fraternal? Australia, these guys are fraternal. The goal is to drive awareness around the misconception that, when it comes to determining zygosity of multiple-birth children, it relates to whether or not they look alike, but, actually, its about understanding tissue compatibility in organ transplantation and assessing disease risk.I never expected to be standing in front of the House with twins, and that is the experience of many twin parents out there. I just ran into a twin mum, coming into this place, who said, Is it the case that Centrelink and Medicare still do not consider twins to be a multiple birth? I said: Yes, that is the case. Centrelink and Medicare do not consider twins to be multiple births as it currently stands.

There wasnt a release of water because the current zeitgeist in many instances talks about drought and about how its going to stop raining and were only going to get minor rainfall events.

That is not everyones solution, but Bob has been steadfastly for over a decade supporting youth in his area. He paid an extraordinary price when he lost his son, who was working as a youth officer transporting some of these youth so they could be part of the program, in a head-on collision. The idea of Hard Yakka is to instil those key concepts into young men, and Bob does that so incredibly well. We all recognise here the importance in youth justice of better targeting those in the youth justice system to get employment, to facilitate better data sharing between the Commonwealth and the states and potentially to get earlier drug testing so we can identify addiction long before it becomes intractable.We can get this right, and Queensland need to lead the way because of our high levels of theft and vehicle theft that you knew well in your previous career, Deputy Speaker. We need to work together and in concert with the state government. Minister Leanne Linard has shown extraordinary ability and commitment to work with the Commonwealth to find solutions, and I look forward to that progressing. We need to inject additional resources, but the Commonwealth government must do it in concert with the states and not fragment the system. That can be done.

The 25twoZERO Movement aims to cut the number of suicides to zero. The initiative encourages widespread community engagement in physical activity to reduce levels of anxiety and promote wellbeing. The 25twoZERO Movement uses exercise as a common bond for all men and women to take part and make a difference. Team members sign up to walk, cycle, swim, do sit-ups, any form of exercise so long as it has a measurable goal of 2,520 to help people focus on the underlying importance of this movement.Mentoring Men is raising funds to provide more mentors to prevent men sliding into crisis. Seven hundred men have engaged with Mentoring Men services to date, with an increased demand for its program for the next 12 months. Mentoring Men provides free life mentoring programs for men in the community, and I feel privileged to be an ambassador for Mentoring Men.

For some, its meant safety, but, for the most vulnerable, it has meant being unable to get to safety. Amnesty Internationals Communities behind refugee sponsorship report contains some very important reflections on this challenge for all of us. Its a report that warrants very serious consideration by this government. Its a report that harnesses the goodwill of Australians to welcome refugees into their communities and volunteer their time and skills to support them. I acknowledge the work over a period of years by Amnesty International through its near neighbour campaign, led by my dear friend Shankar Kasynathan, in leading these conversations. I want to reflect on some of the words that are contained in this report and share them with this place, like Ali Al Battaat words when he says, Were creating a more diverse country and were adding to our community because refugees have and continue to contribute to Australia and its society. Philippa Mitt from Townsville said, Community sponsorship is a community based solution in Canada thats been proven to be true—327,000 refugees welcomed; a country strengthened. This report highlights significant deficiencies in the current governments program: its prohibitive cost and the cruel arithmetic that it takes places from a government sponsored program. I urge government members, as we think about how the world reopens, to consider this report and everything we can do to make it different for the most vulnerable.","Amnesty International","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/subdebate.1[13]/speech/talk.text/body/p","Mr GILES (Scullin) ","(13:48):"

Its important to be kind. I cant think of a kinder gesture than that of Wayne from the Frankston & District Basketball Association and all of the Frankston Blues who play in NBL1. When they heard about Darcy and how sad he was to not go to play basketball, they invited him to train them for the night. He went there and played with the players and talked to the coaches.

Its where friends and family come together. Its where a sense of community is formed, where fun is had, where memories are made, where hard times are shared and where hangovers are sometimes formed. But, even more importantly, its where people are employed.Tooheys Brewery in Lidcombe employs roughly 200 workers and contractors in Reid. Producing nearly 300 million litres of beer each year, it is one of the largest breweries in the state. Overall the brewing association contributes $900 million to the New South Wales economy every year and employs around 2,500 people across the state. Tooheys is also proud to be officially carbon neutral. Their work has resulted in a total offset of all carbon emissions produced by the brewery. COVID-19 has had a severe impact on the hospitality industry. As a result of lockdowns across the country, the Brewers Association member companies lost 44 million schooners in sales—an absolute tragedy. Even worse is all the staff who lost their jobs and the hit to our economy that it has caused.

Last year, we witnessed a tragic event in Tasmania when more than 450 whales were beached—subsequently and heartbreakingly dying.We need to better protect these beautiful and majestic creatures.

Their project will improve our ability to detect marine fauna, including our whales, and will ultimately lead to a sounder and more concerted effort to protect our Australian ocean fauna.Congratulations Joel, Vignesh and Vimana Tech for undertaking innovative work that will undoubtedly advance Australias environmental protection efforts.

The current system is busted. Its one of the most expensive in the world and its holding women back.Those on the other side often talk about Labors preoccupation with child care as some left-wing agenda. Dont take our word for it: just ask the Business Council of Australia, a group that has never been accused of having a left-wing agenda. The BCAs pre-budget submission, entitled Removing barriers to female workforce participation, said that Australias female workforce participation lags a full 10 percentage points below that of men and that 60 per cent of working women with a youngest child under six are working part time compared to eight per cent for men. They highlighted the effective tax rate of more than 100 per cent facing women who want to increase their hours. Their submission calls for an increase to childcare subsidy rates, smoothing the taper rates and abolishing the Prime Ministers annual subsidy caps. It says that there will be a $4 billion to $5 billion boost to productivity.This all sounds very familiar, doesnt it? I am so glad that the BCA is backing in Labors plan for cheaper child care.

88,0,0,0,1,1,"Morrison, Scott, MP","E3L","Cook","LP","N/A",2934," Australia is being tested once again. The east coast of Australia, predominantly New South Wales but, I stress, also South-East Queensland, has faced an extraordinary deluge over recent days. In many places, rains are expected for at least the next 24 to 48 hours, but I fear worse. In South-East Queensland there has been intense rainfall, with more than 300 SES requests for assistance over the 24 hours to this morning, with crews working through the night. The Bureau of Meteorology has issued a severe weather warning for western and southern Queensland from this afternoon, which could extend to the south-east coast tomorrow morning. A number of flood warnings remain in place for parts of the state also.Some parts of New South Wales are experiencing the worst flooding in over 50 years, and worse. From Penrith to the north of Port Macquarie, evacuation orders are in place for 28 areas, with a further 16 areas issued with an evacuation warning. In the Hawkesbury-Nepean Valley there has been record rainfall. On Saturday 500 gigalitres of water was released from Warragamba Dam. That is, to put it in perspective, the equivalent of releasing the capacity of the entire Sydney Harbour in 24 hours. The water flowed into the Nepean and Hawkesbury rivers, causing the Hawkesbury to rise to levels not seen since 1961. Major flood warnings are now current for the Colo River, the Hastings River, the Hawkesbury River, the Macleay River and Wollombi Brook.In northern New South Wales there are 35 communities isolated. Those communities include Taree, Bellingen, Wingham, Harrington and Laurieton. Across New South Wales 1,400 SES first responders have conducted over 700 flood rescues and responded to over 7,500 requests for assistance. This is very difficult and dangerous work. I want to acknowledge, pay tribute to and say thank you to, on behalf of all of us here in this place, our volunteers and the emergency services for their extraordinary efforts in responding to these terrible events.There is serious risk still ahead. Heavy rainfall is likely to continue up much of the eastern half of New South Wales and into southern Queensland today and tomorrow. Heavy falls will also develop over northern and central inland parts of New South Wales tomorrow, bringing the risk of flash and significant river flooding to several additional catchments. A different low-pressure system is expected to form off the southern New South Wales coast, bringing rainfall there also. Thankfully, the current forecast has conditions easing statewide from early Wednesday, but we will watch and see.I want to assure residents in all storm and flood affected areas that all parts of government are working closely together. Premier Berejiklian and I have been in regular contact over the weekend and indeed again today. Yesterday the director-general of Emergency Management Australia activated COMDISPLAN in anticipation of New South Wales requesting Australian government non-financial assistance. We are expecting a formal request from New South Wales for ADF support today; that is our expectation. We understand this is likely to be for recovery support and clean-up operations, including personnel, vehicles and machinery. The Premier and I were discussing that over the weekend. We have just been advised now, in discussions, of the potential for heavy-lift aerial support, but this is still to be scoped. This has been advised to Defence, and we will be following this up throughout the course of this day. At this point no formal requests have been made.The ADF is readying itself for this task that still lays ahead, particularly in the recovery phase. It is working closely with New South Wales emergency services to coordinate potential areas of assistance. The Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment and Disaster Recovery Allowance have been activated to support those who have been affected, suffering significant losses or serious injury or whose income has been affected. The Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment provides non-means-tested—I stress that—payments of $1,000 for eligible adults and $400 for eligible children.In affected communities Services Australia are deploying to provide on-the-ground assistance. Services Australia disaster assistance phone lines are open from 8 am to 8 pm. The number is: 18002266. Further details are available at the www.disasterassist.gov.au website. Payments for disaster recovery assistance were initiated yesterday by Services Australia. Thirty-four local government areas are now eligible for those payments, but I suspect there will be more.We stand ready to do more to provide whatever additional support is needed, in partnership with the New South Wales and Queensland governments as necessary. This is an ongoing situation that is evolving and is extremely dangerous. We are meeting regularly to be updated on the events and to direct our response. We are grateful that no lives have been lost so far. But weakened foundations for buildings, for roads and for trees all create risk, as do downed power lines and rising water levels. We ask all Australians in these affected areas to please use caution. Check in on your neighbours and those who you know are alone. Please heed the advice of authorities. Where there are orders to evacuate, please follow them.As is appropriate at this time many members are supporting their communities and are not here in this place. I know that the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Emergency Management, the Minister for Government Services and other ministers are reaching out and working closely with members, mayors, other agencies and communities, ensuring they receive every support.This will be a very difficult week for hundreds of thousands of Australians, if not more, as we face the immediacy of the floods. There will be many difficult months ahead as the clean up and recovery from this natural disaster gets underway.We have very competent agencies in our state governments. They are very good at dealing with these types of emergencies. They are doing a tremendous job right now. The Australian government is standing together with them in ensuring that they can be delivering in this most urgent of times. But, above all, we rely, as we have now for a long time, on Australians themselves. They have shown, as we have come together, we can get through these things when we work together, and that is what we will do in the hours, days, weeks and months ahead, responding to this disaster like those before it and then rebuilding and recovering afterwards.","Australian Floods","STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr MORRISON (Cook—Prime Minister and Minister for the Public Service) ","(14:00):"

Then came the fires, then the pandemic and now this flood. From Kempsey to Bulahdelah to Western Sydney to the Gold Coast, we know only too well the spectacle of sandbags being stacked in a race against time, boats making their way along submerged streets and families doing the swift, brutal arithmetic about what is important enough to take with them, how much space they have and how much time they have. Then there was that poor couple on their wedding day, watching on helplessly as their home literally washed away. Like the bushfires, the floods have had a terrible familiarity. But, as with the fires, we should be concerned that records are being broken. Some are records thatve stood untouched for longer than most of us have been alive. And its not over yet. The rain keeps coming, falling on to already waterlogged ground that cant take so much as another drop.We can always be confident that our national character will not be found wanting when it is put to the test. But it is being put to the test so often. Once again, were seeing how the worst of times bring out the best in our fellow Australians—neighbour helping neighbour, friend helping friend, stranger helping stranger. The spirit of community was summed up well by Emma-Jane Garrow, who is dealing with the flooding in Hawkesbury instead of setting up a 10-year-old daughters birthday party. As she told the Sydney Morning Herald blog this morning:Theres big community spirit and everyone is jumping in and helping out. We learn young around here how to help each other out.Im sure the member for Macquarie can back that up here today.Once again, we are seeing the selflessness of our emergency services workers and volunteers, with the SES working through the darkness, in wind and pouring rain, as the waters keep rising, putting themselves in harms way for the sake of their fellow Australians, rescuing people and keeping people informed. I join with the Prime Minister in saying: follow their advice. Work from home if you can. Weve got a lot better at that over the last year. Try to stay off the roads. Dont risk driving through floodwater. Even what looks like a shallow flow can be deceptive in its strength. Dont put yourself or others in danger. If youre asked to leave, please leave.Our hearts go out to everyone who has suffered. Our gratitude goes out to everyone who is making this situation better than it might have been.

Particularly I think of the member for Lindsay, the member for Cowper and the member for Lyne, who are in those communities at this time, and Im sure members from the opposition are as well. As I just indicated, the government has been mobilising support to those flood affected communities, and were receiving regular briefings on these matters, as we did across the weekend as the events escalated. And indeed they did escalate, from the time of early reports, when we were looking at flood levels reaching 2020 levels in the Hawkesbury-Nepean. We are now going back to 1961. As each update came in, the situation became more intense and more severe.But the response was equal to that task. I recall very vividly the planning that was done around a particular flood event in the Hawkesbury-Nepean that would see an evacuation centre established in Olympic Park and a very serious exercise undertaken by the New South Wales government to prepare for such an event. I hope that provides comfort and assurance to Australians that with these events, as difficult and as serious as they are, the agencies and authorities that are there to provide the responses in these circumstances are highly professional, theyre highly able and theyre well supported by strong leadership and strong resource support from all levels of government to ensure that we can keep Australians as safe as possible.We cant change the nature of these natural events, but we can ensure the best possible response. Today brave Australians—courageous Australians—are out there providing that support on the ground. The Australian Government Crisis Committee and the disaster recovery committee are meeting. Geoscience Australia is working in collaboration with the European mapping service, and they are distributing analytical spatial data. The Defence Force has commenced planning and assistance.Then there are the simple acts that are taking place in the flood affected areas, such as at Penrith Quarry Materials. The member for Lindsay relayed to me the story. It stepped up to deliver urgently needed sand to help keep up the supply for those sandbags. Locals are assisting SES personnel with filling those bags. Indeed, up on the Mid North Coast, the member for Cowper went on radio and said, We need some GPs at the local evacuation centre. Five answered the call almost immediately, then going on to visit other evacuation centres.If its flooded, forget it: thats the very clear message that this parliament is sending today.

On the Gold Coast and other parts of Queensland, on the North Coast and the Mid North Coast of New South Wales, and in the upper reaches of Sydney, there are issues with these once-in 50-year rainfall events. Communities all the way up to Brisbane and the Gold Coast are considered to be very much at risk at the moment. I appreciate that some members on both sides of the House are not here; their communities are inundated. We feel for them as they endeavour to lead and help their communities through this. I understand that they are in close contact with first responders. Our first responders are truly magnificent. They are always there in times of crisis.The member for Cowper and the member for Lyne are with their communities today. I and Minister Littleproud have been getting regular updates from both of them—as has the Prime Minister and, no doubt, members on the other side as well—in regard to the seriousness of these floods. The member for Cowper has been with his community every step of the way. He attended the evacuation centre in Port Macquarie, which is housing about 300 evacuees, and also the evacuation centre in Kempsey, which has 100 people who are very much needing that support right now. He helped improve the communications coordination for the hundreds of residents cut off on the north shore of the Hastings River in Port Macquarie. The ferry is unable to operate due to floodwaters.We know that the transport industry has been magnificent through COVID-19 and again has stepped up to this latest challenge. The Port Macquarie based transport company Jim Pearson Transport is currently ensuring freight gets to where it needs to be. Queensland freight is being rerouted via Grafton and the New England Highway as the Pacific Highway is blocked. B-doubles are being decoupled to enable them to take smaller alternative routes to get freight through, and that is so important.The member for Lyne has been getting regular updates. Having been isolated with his wife, Charlotte, on Saturday, he has been able to get out today to talk to the people and listen to them at Marine Rescue Camden Haven. The community evacuation centre at Laurieton United Services Club took in 300 on Saturday, 300 yesterday and 240 today. These are challenging times. In these moments of crisis, we see the very best of Australians—whether it be ordinary, everyday Australians who do wonderful and amazing things on behalf of others or whether it be our first responders, we thank them. We are certainly not through it yet, but I know theyll step up to the challenge again over coming days and weeks.","Australian Floods","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1[4]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr McCORMACK (Riverina—Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development and Leader of the Nationals) ","(14:20):"

Around 20,000 members of the member for Curtins electorate have graduated off JobKeeper. The member for Curtin, like those on this side of the House, stands for jobs, jobs and more jobs.The Australian economy is recovering strongly from the biggest economic shock since the Great Depression. In the December quarter we saw economic growth of 3.1 per cent. For the first time since records began we have seen two consecutive quarters of economic growth of more than three per cent. What was particularly pleasing about those growth numbers is that its the private sector that is helping to drive that recovery—household consumption is up, business investment is up, dwelling investment is up and motor vehicle sales are up. We have also seen the Morrison government and Australia maintain its AAA credit rating.When it comes to the labour market, we saw Chris Richardson, a noted economist, say of last weeks numbers that they were stunning job numbers, with the unemployment rate coming down to 5.8 per cent. We saw 88,700 new jobs created in the month of February. All of those jobs were full-time jobs. More than 80 per cent of those jobs went to women and more than 40 per cent of those jobs went to young people. We have seen a stunning performance, according to Chris Richardson, in our labour market.We know that there are sectors across the economy that continue to do it tough. Thats why were responding with targeted packages, like the $1.2 billion aviation and tourism package. We also have the tax cuts that continue to flow through. There is more than $9 billion already and there is $12 billion still to come. We have 340,000 training places. We have an extension of the instant asset write-off, which is helping to boost investment, and we have infrastructure projects—new projects and those that have been brought forward.I was asked if there are any alternative policies. We know that those opposite stand for one thing—higher taxes—because they took to the last election $387 billion of higher taxes on your superannuation, on your housing, on your investment and on your income. Theyve never seen a tax increase they havent loved and a spending promise that they havent liked. We on this side of the House stand for lower taxes. We on this side of the House stand for more jobs.

The question goes to a number of complex issues that have been a challenge for this country for a long time. However, what we are working on is the whole issue around land title and the various titles. This morning I had a discussion with the chair of the IBA and the Indigenous Land and Sea Corporation about optimising land assets to give Indigenous Australians an economic base, wealth creation opportunities, jobs, and also industries and businesses. If we consider landholdings of Indigenous Australians, they vary across state and territory jurisdictions. Whilst native title is a significant factor and 40 per cent of Australia is under native title, there are other agreements that prevail. For example, Ive been having detailed discussions with the Northern Territory land councils about the economic realisation of land assets that they hold, so that there is a wealth creation opportunity, and also for the provision of market gardens in Queensland, as you and I discussed in December last year, Member for Kennedy. So, in the work that were doing, including through the Closing the Gap strategy, we are tackling those very challenging issues of lower life expectancy, the out-of-home care challenges that prevail across this nation, and, more importantly, the way in which we have Indigenous Australians now co-designing their future so that its not left to bureaucracies. We will continue to do that work to make sure there is a difference. In my discussions with the mayors of the councils in Queensland, were looking at opportunities to create a better future.","Indigenous Australians","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1[8]/answer/talk.text/body/p","Mr WYATT (Hasluck—Minister for Indigenous Australians) ","(14:30):"

Theyre in their communities, supporting them and making sure that every effort is being made to get them through their hour of need. This is a very dynamic situation and one which is changing by the hour. The last brief that I had from the Bureau of Meteorology says that not only is it in the Gold Coast area in Queensland but it stretches out into south-west Queensland, north-west New South Wales, the Central West of New South Wales and, obviously, right along the New South Wales coast, effectively to the Victorian border. It will continue to unfold, and we will have to continue to be agile in making sure we support New South Wales in their hour of need. Theyve already made nearly 780 rescues. We just say to people: this is your opportunity to lead and to make sure you do not get yourself in a situation where you are calling on emergency services personnel to come and save you.We as a nation have worked to come together. There are 85 emergency services personnel from South Australia, Queensland and Victoria also now in New South Wales helping them, and their skill sets range from swiftwater rescue through to engineering and planning for the recovery. We will continue to work with them. Both Emergency Management Australia and the Australian Defence Force have liaison officers in the crisis centre to monitor the coordination and the scoping of what is needed in supporting the here and now, to determine whether or not there are any assets that are required from the federal government and to plan for the recovery, making sure that we are looking ahead to ensure that that recovery starts immediately after the water abates.Well continue to work with the New South Wales government and Resilience NSW, together with Shane Fitzsimmons, who is the commissioner, in making sure that every effort is made and every plan is enacted and ready to go so that the people in these communities can feel supported. Thats why yesterday we initiated our first relief payments under the disaster recovery payment agreement—$1,000 per adult and $400 per child. There is also 13 weeks of income support available for those individuals whose income has been impacted by this event. We are saying to people: please do not self-assess. This is your hour of need, and the Australian people will stand with you. Centrelink has a designated line open from 8 am to 8 pm every night specifically for you. This is there to help you. Please reach out. We will continue to support you as we work through this.We are now waiting, and we will continue to work with New South Wales on further support and relief and recovery. That will take place once the water abates and we can make assessments. We are working with New South Wales to ensure every effort will be made in terms of that relief and recovery moving forward.

Many of us in Queensland have very vivid memories of the dramatic floods a decade ago now. Many Queenslanders and Australians will recall the way in which the Australian Defence Force stepped up in the clean-up to provide support to those families, those businesses and those communities who were devastated by the floodwaters and the aftermath, and the Australian Defence Force is ready to do the same again now.We have worked very closely—as the Prime Minister has pointed out, he has spoken repeatedly with the New South Wales Premier—and will continue to work very closely with our state counterparts. The Australian Defence Force has performed an exceptional role for our country over the course of the last 12 months, in particular the beginning of last year where the Australian Defence Force stepped up to provide support to bushfire affected communities. They have done the same in relation to COVID. This very day there are 1,000 ADF personnel who are involved in Operation COVID-19 Assist. Those people join 15,000 of their colleagues who, over the period of the pandemic, have been able to provide support at various hotels, at roadblocks and in many parts of Indigenous Australia, to provide support to protect those communities. The Chief of the Defence Force will work very closely with his counterparts in the law enforcement area, in New South Wales and Queensland in particular, to make sure we can provide whatever support is requested. The Australian Defence Force brings with it a level of expertise renowned around the world and a spirit that helps rebuild communities. That is something of which we should be very proud.These communities have very difficult days ahead. As has been pointed out in this chamber before, we have seen the vision of cars being swept away. There is no piece of property that is worth rescuing at the moment or going into floodwaters to attempt to rescue, as much as you might want to. As much as you might think you can cross that flooded crossing, you cannot. Our plea to people in those flooded communities is to please look at the reality of the situation, to step back and to deal with what is an incredibly difficult situation. Listen to the authorities on the ground. I pay tribute to the emergency services workers. They serve our community 24/7, but in these very dark hours they provide significant support to communities.

I think the whole Houses thoughts and prayers are not just with the members constituents but with all those people really being affected by the terrible flooding. Suffice to say, the Morrison government is absolutely committed to supporting people impacted by these natural disasters, and Services Australia will play a key role supporting and providing services.Services Australia are now providing two relief payments for those impacted. Firstly, The Australian government disaster recovery payment, or the AGDRP, provides a one-off lump sum of $1,000 per adult for eligible adults and $400 for each eligible child under the age of 16. Secondly, the disaster recovery allowance, DRA, is a 13-week income support payment to assist individuals who can demonstrate theyve lost income as a result of the disaster. It is important for Australians to know that they dont need to go in to a service centre to receive support, noting that all Services Australia service centres are open—bar one at this stage, being Port Macquarie. Australians simply need to call 18002266. Lines will be open from 8 am until 8 pm. As at 2 pm today 9,200 people impacted have been calling through to those lines. Services Australia has almost 700 staff dedicated on to those phone lines to ensure Australians can get the assistance they need. Those lies will be open from 8 am until 8 pm and theyll be open seven days a week to ensure all Australians can get the services they need.Services Australia is also using the governments new payment platform to make these emergency payments, which means those eligible applicants will receive the money into their bank accounts within an hour in 95 per cent of the time. So call 18002266 and those eligible will be paid quickly. Likewise in all disasters, especially like those in Black Summer, the mobile service centres and mobile service teams of Services Australia are ready to deploy and pre-position when it is safe to do so to ensure that all Australians can access what they need. The mobile service centres, as many rural and regional members of the House would know, provide a full capability and full walk-in service centre.The House should also be aware that we have now paused all relevant debts for a six-month period in all of the declared LGAs through to 22 September. Australians dont need to do anything at all. That pause has already occurred. But Australians can always contact Services Australia should they wish to discuss any individual circumstances. Services Australia will also be providing social workers and other support and counselling as required. This is the key message for all Australians: 18002266 is the number to call for emergency payment assistance.","Australian Floods","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1[13]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ROBERT (Fadden—Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme and Minister for Government Services) ","(14:42):"

She absolutely exemplifies womens leadership and mentoring, both in her professional life and of course since coming to this place. Women are a huge part of our economic recovery coming out of COVID because more than three-quarters of the new full-time jobs are going to women. Over the course of their careers, women look for the right job at the right time, supported by quality child care, superannuation, equal pay and a supportive and respectful workplace leading to financial security and independence. Thats the key, because with financial security and independence come life choices, including moving to higher paid positions as we see the gender gap close under this government. New training so you can change vocation and follow your passion is something I have had a chance to see recently in rural Australia. That is training that is supporting women after a mid-career break so they dont lose their valuable knowledge and skills.The member is a passionate supporter of female economic empowerment. She hosts regular women-in-business meetings in her electorate. They are dynamic events, I know.We are committed to backing women like Linda Tassone in the electorate of Higgins. Linda runs Jeffreys Books, a business that originally started 60 years ago. In addition to Lindas landlord being very supportive with rent relief, Linda has used both JobKeeper and our cashflow boost to keep operating. We are also supporting businesses like Lindas in a variety of other ways, but especially through the 2020 Womens Economic Security Statement, which builds on the first 2018 statement and complements our JobMaker initiatives. Women are seizing the opportunities being presented and we are seeing that as such a major part of our economic recovery. We are determined to build on this initial progress because there is always more work to do, particularly because we know that womens economic security and independence can be a vital part of their personal security.We have continued the work of the Gillard government since 2013, committing more than $1 billion to reduce violence against women and their children. All of us have safe places within our electorates that women can turn to that provide them somewhere to go when they are faced with domestic violence. Those places can link them with the legal and support services they need. We often think we know the challenges that women face in these situations, but it can be hard to understand the vulnerability of being locked out of your home and your bank account and away from your family support networks. I caught up with Angela Lynch from the Womens Legal Service Queensland to gain an update on how local courts interact with victims of sexual violence. Im pleased that we were able to provide $130 million during COVID to support women in these precarious situations.","Women","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1[15]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms LEY (Farrer—Minister for the Environment) ","(14:46):"

The last year has been a challenge for the world and its been a challenge for Australians, and of course the last weekend in New South Wales has seen more hardships visited upon the public. But one important point of light in the midst of all of this is that today is a further day of zero cases of community transmission of COVID-19. That makes 50 days, or 62 per cent of days this calendar year, with no community transmission across Australia. That means that no lives have been lost in Australia to COVID-19 in 2021. Yet we know that, at the same time, the pandemic continues. Sadly, numbers have begun to increase again around the world, with over 399,000 cases yesterday and over 6,000 lives lost.Against that background, with the vaccination program we now see over 280,000 vaccinations completed, including over 58,000 vaccinations in aged care; 609 aged-care facilities around the country have first doses completed and 89 facilities around the country have second doses completed. Significantly, what we see today is that phase 1b, the rollout to over a thousand general practices, continues and expands. Around the country, Australians are being vaccinated in their general practices and this number will grow from over a thousand to over 4,000 before the end of April.I had the privilege of joining the National Health Co-op in Macquarie today. Lyn was vaccinated by her doctor, Joe. We saw the pride of a doctor in being able to administer the vaccine and the pride in the practice of being able to coordinate it—they were booking out over five weeks, which was a wonderful thing. There is the change, the transformation—that sense of hope and protection—that is occurring right across Australia.Now, as the vaccines come in and as supply is available, exactly as we said, on 22 March we would commence this phase of the vaccine program. We also saw the TGA approval over the course of the weekend for CSL to manufacture and produce in Australia: Australias sovereign vaccine manufacturing capability. Ultimately, this is about saving lives and protecting lives.

Today is the first day of 1b of the vaccine rollout. I want to reassure the people of regional Australia that this vaccine rollout is going to regional areas across the country at the same time as the city. It is a modest start, with 1,000 GP clinics starting this week. In the member for Mallees hometown of Mildura, the Ontario Medical Clinic has its supplies in place and will be starting on Wednesday. As the rollout continues, we will be building up to 4,000 GPs. We will also be rolling it out to pharmacies, Aboriginal controlled medical services, the Royal Flying Doctor Service and respiratory clinics. The rollout across regional Australia will be quite varied and unique to each town. Already there are some towns in Central Queensland that have been covered by the Queensland Department of Health.But a word of warning. Regional Australia has been probably the safest place on the planet for the last 14 months but people need to understand that, as the vaccine rollout continues and more people start to travel, many of those communities are quite vulnerable. They have higher levels of chronic illness and not as many intensive care units locally. With the rollout, as more people travel over the next 12 months, those regional communities need to make sure they take opportunity when it comes to their place because they will be vulnerable. One of the highlights of the last year—if there were highlights—is the fact that Australians have discovered regional areas. Some of those smaller, more isolated communities that arent used to having large numbers of visitors are being discovered by Australians as they discover the pleasures of small communities across regional Australia. The message is that this rollout is about demography, not geography. So when youre age group or particular group is ready to be vaccinated, the rollout in regional Australia is exactly the same as it is in the cities.","COVID-19: Vaccination","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1[19]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr COULTON (Parkes—Minister for Regional Health, Regional Communications and Local Government) ","(14:59):"

But I correct him: when the commissioner appeared before Senate estimates today he was asked, Did you brief the Prime Minister on the details of the dossier? and he said, My recollection was just a brief around the general details. He was then asked, Was he briefed on the nature of that allegation, that it was a sexual assault allegation? The commissioner responded, From memory, yes. So what weve had consistently from the opposition today is a whole range of assertions, misconstructions of things that have been said, for one simple purpose: to pursue the political objectives of the Leader of the Opposition. There is no genuine intent coming from the Labor leader about addressing the substance of these issues; they simply see this as an opportunity for political smear and scoring political points. That is the form and character of the Leader of the Opposition.Over the course of these many years, when former Prime Minister Julia Gillard put in place a very important bipartisan process to deal with the serious issue of protecting women against violence, that process was not only supported by the coalition but was picked up in government with successive action plans totalling more than $1 billion in support and that will continue. Almost half of that has come in just the last two years. Instead of engaging in the partisan contest of smear, where the Leader of the Opposition is seeking to take advantage of these issues, he should remember that the way we address the substance of issues of protecting women against violence is by doing it as Prime Minister Gillard intended: by doing it together. Its by working together, whether its the action plan agreed in this parliament, which has had bipartisan support, or by doing it with the state and territory governments, which draws those resources together.

And our government understands that the very best thing that we can do to drive our recovery from COVID-19 is to get the economic conditions right. Thats through things like: lowering taxes, providing incentives for investment, providing the instant access write-off, providing the research and development tax incentive, boosting support for apprentices and training, cutting regulation and red tape and, importantly, investing in the infrastructure that our regions need.So many of our successful businesses, particularly our food and beverage manufacturers, are located in regional towns right across Australia in very close proximity to our producers.

He knows that central to the success of those industries is a strong, reliable, affordable energy sector. He also knows that this is absolutely central to our recovery from the pandemic, to job creation and to investment in this great country. And I can confirm to the House that our plan on affordable, reliable energy is working. Weve seen 18 months of consecutive wholesale price reductions, with prices at their lowest levels for many, many years. Were backing Australian workers, were backing Australian industry in these energy-intensive industries, often export-oriented industries.The strength of our commitment was demonstrated just last week, when the Prime Minister secured the future of the Portland aluminium smelter and the 500 direct local jobs that will create, as well as the ongoing indirect jobs. This is great news for the workers, for the community and for the local businesses as well in that region. The importance of the smelter has been championed by the minister for trade over there, the local member, and of course someone who is also passionate about Australia as a strong trading nation and strong in export industries. The Portland smelter is Victorias biggest energy consumer and this deal will ensure not only that the future of the smelter is secured but the future of the Victorian grid is too, with the flexibility that this deal will provide.I was asked about alternative approaches. Well, we know that if it isnt to be the lower prices we all want to see it will higher prices. We know how much those opposite love a tax on energy, especially the member for McMahon, who replaced the member for Hindmarsh when he was sacked. How could we forget the member for McMahons love for taxes, whether its his retiree tax, his housing tax or his car tax? And he has gloated about his role in Labors carbon taxes. But while those opposite continue to fight their internal wars, were getting on with the job by providing jobs and opportunities for Australian workers.

190,0,0,0,1,1,"OBrien, Llew, MP",265991,"Wide Bay","LNP","N/A",2962," Its with some joy, but also some reluctance, that I make this speech about the motion to support a royal commission into veteran suicides. First and foremost, I absolutely commend the speakers, particularly the members who have served in the Defence Force and who spoke before me. I commend their passion and their commitment to this cause. But this is a job which, at the moment, is half done. We need to get this job completed and we need to have the Prime Minister and the executive establish this royal commission. We need to know the terms of reference. But I am encouraged about where we are so far.There is a problem. Its an obvious problem. Its a problem thats borne out by the statistics. It is the deep-rooted and long-term problem of suicides in the veteran community. The statistics speak for themselves. Veterans are twice as likely to take their own life once they leave the Defence Force after serving. These are things we need to act on quickly because there are people suffering now. People are watching us. People feel that the government and the system have let them down. They dont have the trust that they deserve. I believe that to restore that trust we need to apply the highest standard in a review of veteran suicide, and the highest standard that we have is a royal commission.Only somebody who has served in war or has served in the Defence Force can understand the pressures and the associated feelings that go with that. I certainly cant. I havent done either of those things, but, as a former police officer and first responder, I do have an understanding of service, I do have an understanding of post-traumatic stress disorder and I do have an understanding of suicide. The lead-up to suicide is a living nightmare. When it occurs it is a nightmare to respond to. For the family members who are left it is an ongoing nightmare. These are the reasons why I support this motion.We as an Australian people entered into a covenant with our veterans. As part of that covenant we pledged to give them the highest level of support and care post their giving their highest level of service to our nation. This is something that I take seriously. We need to look in a holistic way at how we can ensure that the welfare of our veterans is maintained.In this place I have spoken before about some of the areas where I think we can already make some positive changes. Ive spoken about the DFRDB fund. Ive spoken about occupational therapists. Occupational therapists working for Veterans Affairs are being paid, on average, half or a third of what occupational therapists are being paid in the NDIS. This is causing people to leave that sector.Ive spoken about this in the chamber and Ive spoken to the relevant people in government, but Im starting to feel like my pleas are falling on deaf ears. We come in here with all the will to improve the circumstances of our veterans but there are glaringly obvious things we can do immediately, like ensure those providing services to our veterans are being paid properly, and were not doing it. I make that call again. This is something that needs to be fixed.On Wednesday I informed the Prime Ministers office that I had formed a view and changed my position to support this motion and to support a royal commission into veteran suicide. The subsequent discussions were not easy. It shouldnt be so hard to do something that is so glaringly obvious and the right thing to do. It shouldnt be that hard. Im glad that the decision to establish a royal commission has been made by the Prime Minister.Australia has a long and proud history of commanding officers and soldiers looking after their men and their mates, not only in battle but afterwards. In this category I put a fellow called Harry Smith, a bloke who commanded his men at the Battle of Long Tan. He did a sterling job there. But some of the greatest contributions that he made were post his military service, when he continued to fight for their needs until he had a win. I put Heston Russell in that category, a man who looked after his men in battle but is making some of the greatest contributions to this nation post wearing a uniform.To Mrs Finney: when I met you the other day in Senator Lambies office, and you showed me the photo of your beautiful son, I told you that I would do my best. I give you a pledge that I will continue to do my best until this matter is completed.","Defence Personnel: Suicide","RESOLUTIONS OF THE SENATE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr LLEW OBRIEN (Wide Bay—Deputy Speaker) ","(15:28):"
191,0,0,0,1,1,"Swanson, Meryl, MP",264170,"Paterson","ALP","N/A",2963," Last Thursday the Senate passed a motion calling on the Morrison government to establish a royal commission into veteran suicide. The mental health of Australians who have served our country should be of paramount importance to us all. I commend those in this place and in the Senate who have championed their cause. The physical and mental health of veterans is an issue that is important to all of us but particularly to me, as my community is a defence community. Serving and former members of the Defence Force are important to our area—to the electorate of Paterson, to the Hunter, to Port Stephens.It is a disgrace that the coalition government has taken so long to recognise the price some veterans pay for their service. It is truly a national disgrace. We shouldnt have to fight those opposite on this issue; we just shouldnt. If ever there were anything deserving of the highest commission, a royal commission, it is this very topic. This is about our service men and women. This is about the trauma they are living with every single day and about our duty to help them recover both physically and mentally. Our service men and women deserve better than eight long years of neglect under this government, to be quite frank with you.Together with we can show the families—and I recognise Julie-Ann Finney, here in the gallery today, and those that have supported her—of those who have tragically taken their own lives that we will learn from past mistakes. Together, as a parliament, we can fix this. We must fix this. As the people who make the decisions to send our service personnel, our defence personnel, into harms way, we must make a decision to investigate this harm. No life should end prematurely. No veteran should feel alone and unwanted, yet this is clearly the situation many veterans find themselves in. We have a veteran suicide rate nearly twice that of the general population, and the problem is getting worse. Its critical now that we get to the bottom of these tragic deaths.My electorate is home to RAAF Base Williamtown, and not a day goes by that I dont think about every single family in my community who makes the personal sacrifice to service our country and keep us safe. I feel a great responsibility to ensure that every veteran in my community and every veteran that comes off that base is supported enough and respected enough to live a long and healthy life after that service. Meeting with veterans and hearing from veterans was one of the first things I did on being elected to this place in 2016, and I continue to support them and to advocate. The battle veterans face to have their voices heard, to have their claims taken seriously and acted on in a timely fashion, is very real, as Im sure every member of this place will know and attest. Veterans Affairs must be an agency that is resourced to deliver a high-quality service with fast turnaround. Delays and red tape often wear people down to the point of despair.I want to tell you about Barry, whos 72. He waited over a year for his extra disability allowance claim to be processed. Barry fought with Veterans Affairs for a year before finally reaching out to my office for support. Barry, like so many other veterans, doesnt understand why he is left to feel like a burden. Barry wasnt asking for much, just some support that hes due and that he deserves. At the height of his anxiety trying to resolve issues with Veterans Affairs, he was promised that he would receive a call back from Veterans Affairs representatives on numerous occasions and was told that a representative would check up with him weekly after he flagged his mental health concerns. Not a single call came from the department to Barry. Every week Barry was left to feel more and more alone. This is just devastating, and it speaks to a culture of an agency that is underfunded and understaffed from a government that just doesnt seem to care enough. I followed up with Barry after making representations on his behalf only to find out that the department had rejected his claim. I did encourage Barry to appeal the decision, but he said he just didnt have the energy. Imagine this from a man who had fought for his country. After waiting 12 months for a simple extra disability allowance claim, he was exhausted mentally and physically. Is it any wonder veterans are on the brink?Our veterans are dying at unprecedented rates, and we can do something about it if we have the will. We must have a royal commission. Today, veterans held a rally here at parliament to call for action on veteran suicide, and we cannot let this call be in vein. I commend any member brave enough to cross the floor on this issue today, because, when it comes to veteran suicide, you have to vote with your conscience. This issue is too important for party politics and too important for excuses. The time for humanity is now. It is clear that now there is overwhelming support for a royal commission into veteran suicide in the broader community. We shouldnt need to debate this issue. We shouldnt need to put our veterans through any more than they have already faced. We need a royal commission.","Defence Personnel: Suicide","RESOLUTIONS OF THE SENATE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms SWANSON (Paterson) ","(15:35):"
192,0,0,0,1,1,"Connelly, Vince, MP",282984,"Stirling","LP","N/A",2964," I begin by acknowledging all of the veterans in this place and also the families of veterans, including those who have died by suicide. I acknowledge the serving veterans in this place and in the house just down the corridor as well. I also congratulate those who have contributed to this debate today already. Ill pick on the member for Herbert for your deeply impassioned speech earlier. I know that this issue touches you personally in a very deep way and that youre a fierce advocate for veterans health and wellbeing. However, you did get something wrong that I need to pull you up on. You said during your speech that, because you were a digger and not an officer, you dont belong in this place, and I just wanted to say you are wrong. Youre very welcome in this place from all sides and very well respected.The member for Braddon also made some comments which I think we must all continue to reflect on as well. He said diggers are not all broken and we should have no perception that they lack great value. I have seen this in business where there are some people who are a little bit worried that, if they hire a veteran, the veteran might go postal, they might cook off in the workplace, they might lose their temper or experience some sort of mental health episode. I have got a great deal of experience in business. For the last 14 years I worked in mining and oil and gas in consulting and then as a full-time employee in a crisis management role. Ive seen so many veterans, alongside people who have served in our police forces and in our fire and emergency services, bring massive value. They bring solutions. They have skill sets and attitudes around discipline, leadership and integrity, and these are things that every workplace values. So I echo comments from the member from Braddon, who said that hiring a veteran is frankly good for your bottom line. Also, employing veterans is one of the ways that we can help people who have been through a unique work environment and a very challenging one to continue to contribute to society.A move towards wellbeing is incredibly welcome, not just in providing treatment services but also in looking at ways we can help veterans leverage their skills and attitudes in our community, both in work and in other voluntary capacities. Sadly, like everyone in this House, probably, and everyone across Australia, my family has also been directly touched by suicide, so I empathise with the sadness and the sorrow that accompanies every single suicide, including those of veterans. Thats why I remain, as do many others here, a passionate advocate of doing everything we can to support improved services in mental health right across the community, including for veterans and doing everything we can to prevent every suicide.I also want to speak on behalf of our Prime Minister. Many people are probably not aware, but, during the third week after the 2019 election, when I was almost brand new in this place, the PM invited me, other veterans, the Chief of Defence Force, the Minister for Health, the head of Open Arms and a range of other stakeholders to meet with him in private inside the cabinet room, which Im sure you dont normally get to see until much later than three weeks into a parliamentary career. The question was quite simple. The PM got us around the table and said, What more can we do for our veterans? So I would feel uncomfortable if anyone had a viewpoint that was other than that the PM is dedicated to supporting our veterans. That is why there has been a great deal of effort going into ways we can do that. Certainly we are not opposed to the initiation of a royal commission. I will echo what the member for Braddon said. I believe its incredibly important that, as well as the establishment of a royal commission, we also have what has been proposed in the form of a rolling royal commission. Many of the issues that we face will not yet have been uncovered, and we need to be both future-looking and looking at where we currently are and where we have come from, so I advocate for the importance of those two measures being conducted in parallel. We do need action right now. Indeed, the National Commissioner for Defence and Veteran Suicide Prevention is already up and running, and we need to make sure that we continue to lend our support to the national commissioner.We heard earlier from the member for Paterson, who made some commentary about a poor gentleman who faced some struggles when he presented to DVA, articulated his struggles and sought help. My wife was also an ex-serving Australian Army officer, and she went through a process that took five years. I can attest directly to the emotional strain that that places on an individual. Initially, her conditions were rejected by DVA. One of the reasons for one of the claims being rejected was that it was under the wrong act. As we all know, there are three acts that govern defence veterans, and they seem to be growing, as Senator Lambie has pointed out. But we do need to take up the recommendation that we simplify those acts of parliament, as well as continuing with practical reform. During that five-year journey through the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Veterans Review Board, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal my wife also said: Vinny, Im not going to the AAT. I cannot go through this anymore. I said: Leave it with me. Sign me off as your representative, and I continued the fight along with her.It is pleasing to see that there has been such an investment in improving DVA, because that is one of the steps that needs to occur. Of massive importance is that anyone who has pulled on a uniform and served a single day in full-time service is now entitled to lifetime care for mental health issues, as and when they may present. You dont need to do paperwork; you dont need to do anything. You can access that care straight up. I think that was an incredibly important step because I know that people had to fight to even be recognised as being able to access services. I think that is one of the most important things that has been done recently. I could talk about the dollar figures, but what I think is more important is that I have sat with the secretary to DVA, and she has undertaken—I believe, very genuinely—to continue the journey of continuous improvement, to make things faster and simpler and to be more effective in carrying out processes which support our veterans. That work needs to continue. The work of the national commissioner, as it deals in a private but also a very powerful way with veterans and their families, also needs to continue.In closing, I welcome all of the contributions that we have had today. I am pleased to have made my own contribution and to assert that I and this government will continue to do everything that we can and that we must to support veterans and their families.","Defence Personnel: Suicide","RESOLUTIONS OF THE SENATE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr CONNELLY (Stirling) ","(15:42):"
193,0,0,0,1,1,"Phillips, Fiona, MP",147140,"Gilmore","ALP","N/A",2966," I too would like to thank everybody who has contributed to this debate. This is a debate and an issue that crosses all political divides, and I want to thank all members who have spoken on this debate. The speeches that we have witnessed are some of the most remarkable speeches I have seen, and I really want to thank you all for that. I want to thank the community advocates—Julie-Ann Finney, veterans, everyone in the community—who has pushed for this for so long. Its been a bumpy road, a traumatic road, a rocky road, but to get to where we are today is one of the most pleasing things that I have seen in this parliament. Im standing here today because I know that it is absolutely critical that we do have that royal commission into veteran suicide. The delay and the uncertainty on this issue for so long are certainly impacting so many families, and local families in my electorate. The New South Wales South Coast has a big defence presence and we are very, very proud of it. We celebrate defence at every opportunity. Only two weeks ago, I helped to welcome in the new cadet officers at HMAS Creswell, a wonderful occasion and one I was proud to be a part of. We also commemorate and acknowledge the sacrifice of our defence personnel on solemn occasions, never forgetting those who have given their lives for us, so this is an issue that is close to everyones hearts.Labor has supported a royal commission into veteran suicide since 2019. Veterans want a royal commission, their families want a royal commission and advocates want a royal commission. Just this morning, I attended the rally out the front of Parliament House with veterans and their supporters to call for action. This morning we heard from Julie-Ann Finney, and I talked with veterans. They are very, very brave. They might not call themselves that but they are. They are heroes. They are there setting the standards for our future veterans. Their message is clear: the time is now and veterans have waited far too long.The rate of suicide among our veterans is nearly twice that of the general population. I was absolutely devastated to learn that, over the last three months alone, 18 defence personnel and veterans have taken their own lives. That is twice the number of the three months before. This is a problem that is getting worse, not better. Our veterans dedicate their lives to serving our country. They put their lives at risk to protect ours but, when they return, we just arent doing our bit to help and support them. We arent doing whats needed to help make sure they can transition back to civilian life. We are letting our veterans down and it is a national tragedy. The least that we can do is give veterans and their grieving families a voice through a full and open royal commission. I have heard from so many local veterans. They find it too difficult to talk to the Department of Veterans Affairs. They tell me how they have had to fight and struggle to get help, and many say they are lucky to have had advocates who can do this on their behalf. But what about those who dont? That just isnt good enough.I regularly attend events in my electorate that celebrate and commemorate our veterans and I talk regularly with veterans associations and advocates. Advocates on the New South Wales South Coast tell me they are completely overwhelmed with work. There is such high demand and they just cant keep up. These advocates are veterans themselves, volunteering and doing what they can to help others but struggling to get support. They, too, want to see a royal commission. Just last month, I attended an event to commemorate the 57th anniversary of the HMAS Voyager disaster. There I met a survivor who wanted to tell me his story and ask me to support a royal commission into veteran suicide. Everywhere I go, veterans, their families and their advocates tell me the same thing. People ringing my office or emailing me want a royal commission and they want it now.When the government has lost the trust of a community, there is only one way to get it back: transparency and a clear and unequivocal dedication to hearing the truth. Only a royal commission can do that. Only a royal commission will have the necessary resources to shine a light on this critical issue. Only a royal commission would have the independence needed to see real change. Only a royal commission can give families the closure, healing and justice they deserve. It will give them a voice. It will give their lost loved ones a voice. It will make sure that everyone in Australia knows their story and knows their heartache. The case is so clear. There is overwhelming support for a royal commission. We need to end the uncertainty, end the deferrals and get on with a royal commission now.

194,0,0,0,1,1,"Wallace, Andrew, MP",265967,"Fisher","LNP","N/A",2967," Like so many speakers who have gone before me, I want to acknowledge members of this House and, in the other place, Senator Lambie and other senators who have represented their country in uniform for the ADF. I have never served in the ADF, but I had the privilege of being the chair of the governments backbench committee into defence and veterans affairs and also Im the chair of the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I have a great and abiding respect for those men and women who have served our country in uniform in peacetime and in wartime. My grandfather served in the Navy in the Pacific. My dad was a nasho. I tried to join the Air Force as a young fellow, but they didnt want me. Im not quite sure what that says about them or me! Theres so much to say on this issue.I also want to acknowledge those present in the chamber who have also represented this country and Ms Finney, whos lost her son. Whilst I havent served in the military, I have been touched by the issue of suicide at a family level. It is heartbreaking, to say the least. This issue about whether we have a royal commission or we have the commission that is currently on the books before the parliament is one where reasonable minds will differ. I see the member for Solomon over there, and I thank him for his service. The member for Solomon and I have had very strong words on opposite sides of this viewpoint. I have spoken very strongly for the proposition of the continuation of the National Commissioner for Defence and Veteran Suicide Prevention. Im not here to say that Veterans Affairs is without blame or that it is a perfect organisation. I can name many people who I know have had the royal run-around from DVA. One in particular that comes to mind is Bernie Verwayen, who was serving on HMAS Voyager when she went down on that fateful night. Bernie had the right royal run-around from the Commonwealth for many decades. The fact that hes still with us today is testament to his strength of character.Another one is Kevin Beasley, who I have taken the fight for as a member. He is a constituent of mine, as is Bernie Vanwayen. In DVAs infinite wisdom they gave Kevin Beasley a set of teeth at the bottom but not at the top. I dont know what youre supposed to do with one half set of teeth. Ill continue to fight for Kevin on that issue.We know that veteran suicide is a real problem in this country, as it is in much of the western world. We know that since 2001 roughly 10 times the number of servicemen—because thats predominantly who it has been, although there have been a number of women as well who have taken their own lives—have taken their lives, compared with the number of men who were killed in Afghanistan in the same period. It is clear that there is something terribly, terribly wrong.Ive spoken a lot about this issue. I come at it from speaking with veterans. I dont have the intimate knowledge of having walked in your path so I acknowledge that. But what veterans tell me is that transition from military life to civilian life is very difficult for some. That loss of the sense of tribe, of purpose, is very difficult and for some it is unbearable. We know that the younger the person who leaves the ADF the greater they are at risk of harming themselves. We know that when men and women who are currently serving for the ADF have around approximately half the risk of suicide of the civilian population but when they leave that increases by 21 per cent compared to the civilian population. Its important to recognise that every single day five men and around three women take their own lives. And for every person who takes their life there are around about 24 people that attempt to. These are extraordinarily sobering figures.Its wrong to suggest that DVA is the enemy of veterans. I have had the privilege of going overseas and looking at other countries and the way that they look after their veterans. Ive been to Canada. Ive been to Sweden. Ive been to the UK. They have said to me that they look to Australia as being a leading light in the way that we look after veterans. Now, Im not saying its perfect. Im not suggesting that for a second. But this government spends $11.5 billion a year on veterans affairs.We are conscious that some, but not all, men and women struggle on this. I couldnt agree more with the views expressed by the member for Braddon, that one of the great difficulties we have in this discussion is that the more we talk about veteran suicide and veterans mental ill health then we run the risk of great problems for all veterans in getting jobs when they transition. I am a very firm believer that the best way to transition into civilian life is to find a good job. I understand that its good to talk about mental health but that its a double-edged sword, because the more we talk about veterans and mental ill health then the more we set up a misconception amongst employers and civilians that if you employ a veteran youre employing someone with bad or ill mental health, and nothing could be further from the truth.Ive been on the record as supporting the national commissioner. I still support the national commissioner. The national commissioner provides us with a path looking forward; a royal commission will look backward. Unfortunately, this issue, like many others in this place, has come down to politics. I think its sad, but I recognise that at all times we must keep the interests of veterans at the forefront of our minds.","Defence Personnel: Suicide","RESOLUTIONS OF THE SENATE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr WALLACE (Fisher) ","(15:56):"
195,0,0,0,1,1,"Snowdon, Warren, MP","IJ4","Lingiari","ALP","N/A",2969," Firstly, I acknowledge the contributions of all those who have spoken in this debate thus far and those to come—I will be listening to the member for Solomon in particular. I also want to acknowledge, of course, all of those in this parliament—in the Senate and the House of Representatives—who are veterans and thank them for their service. And I really want to acknowledge the contributions made today by the member for Braddon, in particular, and by the member for Herbert, and for the heartfelt ways in which they expressed their views. Most importantly, they made significant, informed and revealing speeches, not only about the issue but about themselves. For that I say thank you. They have given us an insight into their own lived experience and the experience of so many other men and women in uniform. I cant imagine the pain of Mrs Finney.But I stand here, proudly, as a former Minister for Defence Science and Personnel and as a former Minister for Veterans Affairs. I say that because I got to meet the most outstanding people in the Defence Force and in the veterans community. They were inspirational in almost every way. The sadness, to me, was always about, How the hell do we attempt to fix those who are broken? Significantly, I think we have collectively failed. I say that as a former minister; Im not saying this is the responsibility of any individual. But we have failed, collectively, and the evidence is there. The evidence is in what were seeing now in terms of suicide rates for veterans.As others have said, when theyre in uniform its half the suicide rate. When I was the minister we did a review of mental health in the Defence Force. It became very clear that when people were in uniform they were strong; they had their teammates and they were supported. That was part of the reason why we could say, proudly, that the impact on the mental health of our serving men and women was what it was. The member for Braddon pointed out that when he was in uniform its what he was doing every day and he had the surety of it all. The thing that vexed me most though was what happens. Remember, this was up to 2013, from about 2009 or 2010. So we were in the middle of the war in the Middle East and Afghanistan, we were seeing high levels of rotation, particularly of special forces people but also across the services, and what worried me then as it worries me now is what was the impact of those high levels of rotations on the mental health of those people once they separated from the Defence Force? No-ones been able to give us a solution. The separation, the leaving, for many—most—is not an issue. Theyre proud of their service, they wear it with pride, they value their team mates and they value what theyve achieved. But there are some who, when they leave, over a period of time become very troubled, and we havent been able to identify them before they take extreme measures.This is an issue which Im not sure we can comprehend properly. How do we do it? How do we get to everyone whos been in uniform and say, Were here to help you, even though we know there are some who, when they leave, say, We want nothing to do with you anymore. Theyve had enough. They dont want the uniform, they dont want to acknowledge you as our former comrades and they head bush or wherever they go. At some point things change, and weve lost them. Weve lost them from contact. We cant support them because we cant see them. Weve got to make sure we see them.I say to Liz Cosson and her team at the Department of Veterans Affairs: despite the brickbats you get, I totally value the work you do, your commitment and that of your teams, to the betterment of the veterans community and veterans—individuals and their families—a point which was most strongly made by the member for Braddon. We have an obligation. Once someone goes to Kapooka, puts on that uniform, were obligated to look after them for life. With that obligation comes an obligation to look after their families. It means post-service that obligation remains and thats the challenge. That is the challenge.I acknowledge the ministers contribution and that of the members for Blair for Gorton. I say to the minister: this royal commission is an opportunity. Its not an attack on you or an attack on the department. This is an opportunity to get things fixed. One of the inevitable results I see will be greater support for the department, for the work theyre doing and for the veterans community. We have the time to do this. It is the moment. There is bipartisan support—and the support in the Senate from Senator Lambies work has been outstanding—as others have said. But we can do this if were prepared to work together.I say to the Prime Minister: the second part of this motion today calls on the Morrison government to establish a royal commission into the rate of suicide among current and former serving Australian Defence Force personnel. To say you wont oppose it is one thing. What we need you to do, Prime Minister, is come into this parliament and say that youll sit down with the members of the Defence Force community, the veterans and the opposition to work out the terms of reference, the time scale for the royal commission and who the commissioner or commissioners might be. Lets do it. We can do it. We should do it. If we do that, well get the outcome that people are after. But when we stand here with sadness, when we lose someone—yesterday, a month ago, or in your case, Mrs Finney, years ago—we wreck the world. What do we do? We cant just say were sorry. And we are sorry. Weve got to do something about it and by doing something about it we have a legacy for your son. Thats what we have the responsibility to do in this place. And for those others who have sadly taken their lives, we have a responsibility to give them the legacy that is their due. Im confident that, given the will of the parliament and members of the parliament, the Prime Minister will see the importance of doing this, that it is the right thing to do and that now is the time to do it. I commend the motion and again say how outstanding this debate has been. I thank all members whove made a contribution. Im waiting fervently to hear the contribution from the member for Solomon. Thank you.","Defence Personnel: Suicide","RESOLUTIONS OF THE SENATE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr SNOWDON (Lingiari) ","(16:06):"
196,0,0,0,1,1,"Joyce, Barnaby, MP","E5D","New England","Nats","N/A",2970," It is no doubt a poignant day. I look behind me, and probably one of the strongest things that was said to me was, I cant go to the grave, because my sons only six feet away. What a terrible indictment. There is nothing that we can say that takes away the pain of people who have lost a son, a daughter, a father, an uncle—someone they love—for a reason they wish they had the opportunity to resolve. They wish they had an opportunity to go back and speak to that person. No doubt they go over it again and again in their minds thinking: Why didnt I pick up on that sign? Why didnt I realise it was going to go from an imminent threat to an actual threat, that something was going to happen? Why wasnt I there? And the answer is that you cant pick that and, unfortunately, youre probably looking at a problem that started years before the tragic event actually occurred.I want to compliment Heston Russell, whos also behind us, for the work hes done. He has been resilient, he has had resolve, he has walked up to the fray and starting with basically nothing, from a point of zero, has been able to drive an agenda. All we do in this chamber is create the numbers that resolve the problems of other people. Other people do the footwork. The footwork was done predominantly by those behind me and those representing the people behind me.I dont for one second pretend to the gallantry and the service of the member for Braddon, the member for Townsville or the Assistant Minister for Defence. For my small part, I was in the reserves and Im a member of the RSL. But my family has a very long history with the services. As Ive said a number of times, tragically my seven great-uncles were all killed—that meant issues pertinent to people who have served and basically at times the anger people have about being cast out. My father was repatriated after being smashed up, as he called it. For while a there, I used to argue with him over why he got so upset about a paltry change in his Vets Affairs payment. I dont know what it was—$30 or $40. And it wasnt worth anything; hed become a successful man. I couldnt work out why he would worry about it. But he would say, Give me back my leg and Ill give you back the money. He was just trying to square up with something in his life which he couldnt quite square up with. The story he always gave me was: You dont know what its like. After youve been smashed up and youve been through the repat hospital, youre sort of just kicked out onto the street. You wander around and try to find a home. You try to find someone to mix with. Your mates are still in the services. You go to places and you just become a kind of inconvenience to them, and you know it and you feel it. He said you feel like your physical ability has been taken away and your support structure has been taken away. I can only imagine that thats a minor form or a similar form to whats felt by so many people who come out of the services and, after doing so much for that nation, are trying to find that space where it all makes sense.For someone in the services, its not just that they offer their life in whatever form it is to their nation; they also step away from other opportunities which they would have had if theyd stayed at home. They might have married that girl who left. They might have been able to build up that business that never happened. They might have been able to be around their parents when they passed away. Their life would be different. Instead, they picked up the gauntlet and they did what our nation asked them to do. We all get very patriotic and jingoistic about it. They go out, seek out the enemy, kill or capture them, by day or by night, regardless of the season, weather or terrain. Out they go in whatever form that engagement and that process requires of them. And we go, Rah rah, isnt it wonderful. We wave the flag and turn up to the Anzac Day march, but after that most people go home and forget about it. And other people are left there, and for some theres that ticking time bomb. Theres that monkey that they just cant get rid of, and theres the issue that they cant resolve. What I hope, in the substance of this, we create the venue that fleshes that out and hopefully come to some form of process where we can deal with it in a better way. If it saves one life, it was worth it. If it saves one persons life, it was worth it! The big thing in trying to convey this in discussions with the Prime Minister and others—in the politest form—its not about what we want; its about what they want, because theyre the ones that are close to the pain and to the hurt and to the loss. We cant explain to them why our position is better than theirs. If this is what they want, then this is what you give them.Id like to also thank the other members of the defence committee, of which I am a member. Id like to also acknowledge the dignified way that the member for Braddon and others have pursued this. Theyre doing this to bring a resolution, not to bring accolades and laurels onto themselves. They want to bring about an outcome. They dont want to bring about something to go on a corflute or something to go in a brochure they send out to their electorate. They did it because they think its the right thing. I want to commend members of the opposition who have contributed. I know that the member for Hunter is very proud of his son.

That is it. What we have to offer them when they come home is basically the sandpit so that they land softly and so that they can progress back to civilians in such a form that theyre embraced, so that there is meaning, so that there is purpose, so that there is a sense of opportunity and so that there is a vision splendid that goes far beyond and for longer than the service they gave.

200,0,0,0,1,1,"Gosling, Luke, MP",245392,"Solomon","ALP","N/A",2972," I just want to start by saying that I commend the motion. I want to thank all those whove spoken on behalf of the motion—those present and from every side of politics who are speaking in support of a royal commission into veteran and defence personnel suicide. A Vietnam War veteran in my electorate said to me recently that a royal commission will be too late for so many of his mates and so many of his mates kids who also served, but it will be a life saver for so many others going forward.Whilst a lot of the conversations have been about contemporary veterans who have served since Vietnam, where the rates of suicide are so high, I think its important to remember Vietnam veterans and their families have a saying, Honour the dead, and fight like hell for the living. Its so important. They werent welcomed back like they should have been after serving our nation. A Vietnam veterans child is three times more likely to take their own lives. Thats significant. Its shocking. Its a national shame. I just want to thank all those people—that is, all those advocates and all of those members of ex-service organisations over the years that have given their heart and soul to keeping those Vietnam vets and the veterans that came after them—but also those that came before them, like the World War II veterans and the Korea veterans. This royal commission has been a long, long time coming.Its great that weve arrived at a place where the Senate has passed a motion that has come here to this place and has the support of so many, including those who have served but also those who havent served but that see, because they know their electorates, its well past time for us to have an arms length review of the veterans support system so that we can fix it and save the lives of our brothers and sisters—Australians. Another veteran mate of mine said that the core behaviour of an Australian soldier, sailor, airman or airwoman, is to win for our country, to serve our country and to protect our country and its interests. Its to fight, to win, to do the hard training and to put their lives on the line to win. So its with great pleasure that were at a point where were hoping the Prime Minister stands up and says, Australia will have a royal commission. We hope that happens today. It needs to, because the jobs on. And veterans around this country, and their families, are waiting to hear that he has heard the message from the federal parliament. As they wait, I want to pay respect to all those who have served, particularly those who have given all. And I pay my respects to the families. I pay my respects to all those who have been fighting, regardless of their politics.I think veteran Heston Russell said it very well this morning. Hes sitting up there in the gallery with his comrade, a comrade who has lost her son. Theyre sitting there together as comrades. I was so proud of them this morning. Im so proud of the fight they have put up. And they know that were not there yet. I want to thank the Leader of the Opposition for speaking so powerfully and consistently on this need. Im not politicising it, but I think its important to say what we stand for. Heston said that the royal commission is about three things: accountability, recognition and respect. Well, its time to be accountable to the countless people, Australian patriots, who have felt that they had no other option but to take their own lives. Its time to recognise that we have a big problem here and that we need a big action—for this royal commission to address it. And its time to show respect to those who have served this country and have felt let down, and to their loved ones—people like Julie-Ann Finney, who has represented all those mums and dads so well. Im so proud of you.Its clear that there is now overwhelming support for a royal commission into veteran suicides. Its what veterans and families want. Its what hundreds of thousands of Australians want. And its now not even an issue of what the governments own members or senators want, because theyre saying it clearly. So its time. Its time for that leadership. Its time for the Prime Minister to call this royal commission. That wont be the end of the work that we need to do. That work goes on every day. So, in finishing, I want to thank every single Australian out there who has worked to help our veterans and their families—because if it occurs today, if its called, it is thanks to you and your advocacy.

201,0,0,0,1,1,"Entsch, Warren, MP","7K6","Leichhardt","LNP","N/A",2973," I certainly rise this afternoon to support this motion seeking to establish a royal commission into veteran suicide. I absolutely support this motion. The sacrifice that these men and women make for our country is truly remarkable and in fact in many cases is the ultimate sacrifice. I proudly served in the Defence Force as well, with the Australian Air Force, between 1969 and 1978. It seems like a lifetime ago now. Many of my colleagues have served as well, a lot of them—I think all of them—much more recently than my service. And I have to say, my service was at a time when men like me certainly didnt talk about their feelings. You were told simply to suck it up. Thankfully, times have somewhat changed.I have to say, it was a time in my life that I am extremely proud of, and I have memories, particularly of mateship and camaraderie, that Ive never, ever been able to replicate in civilian life—ever. Theres something about the service there that doesnt exist anywhere else, in anything else you do. But what happens when that mateship isnt there anymore—that 24/7 support you get—and you find yourself back in a life that, often, you dont really recognise? Its an all-too-familiar story for many veterans when they return from active service. I say this very deliberately, because my time in the military was well before that of many of my colleagues—and its so great to have so many here; I think eight of us have served in the defence forces. Im the only Air Force guy and the rest of them are all Army, and we compete quite well in that area. Nevertheless I think its a record number—for many years—of people here who have served, and its great to have them here.Many veterans struggle to adjust to normal life. In my view theres a reason for this. Prior to my service we had Korea and Malaysia, and then during my time we had Vietnam. Most people called to serve did one rotation. They might have done six months. Some of them did two months. It was rarely more than that. The difference today is that we have people going over to some really inhospitable places and serving not one, not two, not three, not four but multiple rotations—six, seven, eight. The impact that has not only on themselves but on their lives and their families is quite profound. They come back home, and many of them—so many of them, I know, up in my region—are often unable to get their heads around trivial issues that society is consumed with, like social media, traffic congestion, petrol prices, who won the footy et cetera. They struggle to come back into that system—and how could they not? Many of them have witnessed firsthand the brutal horror of war. They feel out of sync with society. I have spoken to many friends who have said to me the hardest thing about war is coming home and struggling when they get here. Many of them have lost mates. Many of them have been wounded. Many of them have witnessed things that those back home could never even fathom. Sadly, many come home as broken people. Many come home as very different people.Theres absolutely no doubt in my mind that the current system has failed our returning Defence Force people. The conflicts at the time I served were very different to the conflicts of those that served in the Second World War, which were different to the conflicts of those that served in the First World War. Each one is very different. You cant model a service or a support—PTSD has only been recognised in more recent times—based on whats happened in the past; youve got to do it based on the present, and youve got to offer that support for them. The system has failed our returning defence personnel very badly, especially those who really need that extra help. It has also failed the families, who are at the front line when our personnel come home, in having to deal with people that they no longer really know. It becomes a real challenge.Youre going to ask the questions; its not rocket science. Why is it that ADF personnel have a suicide rate less than half the wider community rate while serving but nearly twice the general population rate once they leave the service? You dont have to be a rocket scientist to work these things out. There are certainly issues there. Over the past few decades, more ADF personnel have died after returning home than in actual conflict. These are alarming statistics, and we need to act on them. We expect our ADF personnel to travel to lands far away to protect us, our freedoms and our interests, but who protects them and their interests when they come home? Thats a good question to ask.As I said at the beginning, I absolutely support this motion. I also fully support giving the necessary powers and resources to the National Commissioner for Defence and Veteran Suicide Prevention to ensure a future ongoing body once the royal commission has been completed. But I think we do need a royal commission. It can be relatively short. It can be sharp. Its going to give us a lot of answers to questions that we need. We need to know those answers. We need to get this done, and we need to get it done sooner rather than later. We need to identify and work towards delivering real and effective solutions for veterans past, present and future as well as for their families. Dont forget families and loved ones in this. They are absolutely critical. Its incumbent on every single person in this House to support this motion and support those who would give their lives to protect our freedom and interests. Its about time we started protecting and helping them as well. Ill absolutely support it when it comes back.","Defence Personnel: Suicide","RESOLUTIONS OF THE SENATE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[9]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ENTSCH (Leichhardt) ","(16:33):"
202,0,0,0,1,1,"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP","8K6","Hunter","ALP","N/A",2975," I acknowledge all those who serve or have served, including those with us this afternoon, including the member for Braddon, who is still in the chamber. Of course, I too acknowledge Heston Russell, Julie-Ann Finney—who has had to leave us—and Sapper Tim Lowe, who have been maintaining a vigil in the Speakers gallery throughout the course of this debate. I also, too, as others have done, acknowledge Senator Jacqui Lambie, who has been on a real crusade with respect to veterans issues and in particular the atrocious level of veteran suicide. It reminds me never to get on the wrong side of Jacqui!A commissioning certificate hanging on the wall in my office reads as follows: I, Phillip Michael Jeffrey, Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia, pursuant to section 64 and 65 of the Constitution, hereby direct and appoint the Hon. Joel Fitzgibbon MP a member of the federal executive council to hold the office of Minister for Defence and to administer the Department of Defence and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Unsurprisingly, I occasionally pause to read and reflect on that certificate—what it means and what it meant to me. Unsurprisingly again, these private moments bring different emotions at different times. Sometimes its pride. Sometimes its regret. And sometimes it brings great sorrow. On days like today, its a mix of regret and sorrow. I regret I missed an opportunity to do more for our veterans, and I think we all take collective responsibility for that. I, of course, feel sorrow for those who have paid such a terrible price, whether its because theyve lost their lives in theatre or after serving theyve taken their lives or theyve suffered disability.I have sorrow for the families who have been affected by loss, disability or any consequence of the service of a loved one. The grief of parents who have suffered the loss of a child when wearing the Australian military uniform is unimaginable to those who havent experienced it. The member for New England and others have acknowledged the fact that I have a son who served. Even with that, I cannot imagine—and dont want to imagine—how terrible that must be. Next week Ill officially launch Hugh Poates account of the murder of his son, Robbie, and two other Australian soldiers in Afghanistan, and it will be a great honour to do so. Hughs account of that loss and the familys search for honesty, transparency and closure is a very, very powerful one indeed.Each year the government allocates $11.5 billion to the Department of Veterans Affairs. Some $230 million is dedicated to mental health. We may need to spend more; we may just need to spend better. I dont think any of us are sure. Certainly, we have to commit the resources necessary to fix this terrible problem we have, which is surely an embarrassment to our nation state. We should not lecture others in other countries about human rights and the extent to which they respect and protect their people while these numbers are so horrifying. Its time for a royal commission. Too often there are calls for a royal commission, and each of the causes is worthy, but we all know we cant have a royal commission into everything. Royal commissions must be reserved for the most serious of matters, the most complex matters, and those matters requiring interrogation of people under oath. A royal commission must be the foundation for the beginning of the journey—the beginning of fixing this problem. The proposition put forward by the government is a good one, too. We should have both. We should have the royal commission, helping us to learn about the mistakes, and we should have the commissioner taking us forward to oversee that we are doing the right thing and the only thing to do into the future.I began by reflecting on my time serving as defence minister. One emotion that never leaves me when reflecting on our commissioning certificate—the one thing that never changes—is my high regard and respect for all those who serve, particularly those who go beyond the wire. While my memories of being defence minister are mixed, one thing that left me with overwhelmingly positive memories was getting to know and understand those who do go beyond the wire—those who, when they go out, dont know whether theyre coming back and who know that they may never see their families again. Its a powerful thing to stand alongside those people in the theatre—not beyond the wire, in my case—and, although we dont fully understand, we better understand what they go through. I send them all a message with respect to the Brereton report. The Brereton report is a very, very serious one. Those who have acted unlawfully will need to be held to account. There can be no walking away from that. But there are enough of us here on both sides, I think, to allow me to say to the overwhelming majority that we have your back and that we all fully appreciate and understand and highlight the mitigating circumstances—the fact that we sent them to war without a plan to win and we sent them there under the command of others. We sent them to fight an enemy that neither fights to any rules nor serves in uniform while at the same time they were expected to comply with both domestic and international law, regulations and the like—the list is very long. We sent them to do all that without properly resourcing them. That is the truth of it. They didnt always have the medevacs they needed. They didnt always have the close air support they required. That is a terrible thing. And when we start to see those things flow from the Brereton report, all of us will have to be held to account. Those who served as defence minister, those who served in the National Security Committee of Cabinet, those who served as CDF and those who served as chiefs are all responsible. Many of us in this place, if not all of us in this place, will ensure that the fallout from the Brereton report is not something that will just fall on them but will fall on all those who were responsible in some way, in any way, for a culture that developed in Afghanistan and all the consequences that flowed from it. The most important point is that we need to stand behind our men and women in the Australian uniform.","Defence Personnel: Suicide","RESOLUTIONS OF THE SENATE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[10]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr FITZGIBBON (Hunter) ","(16:41):"
203,0,0,0,1,1,"Keogh, Matt, MP",249147,"Burt","ALP","N/A",2976," I stand here today with all the veterans and defence families who came to Canberra this morning. We need a royal commission into veteran suicide. Its what veterans and their families want, its what thousands of Australians want and its what a number of the governments own MPs as well as those on our side of the House want. Today veterans held a rally here at Parliament House to call for action, so the message is loud and clear: with a veteran suicide rate nearly twice that of the general population, we need to get to the bottom of what is behind these tragic deaths.The Prime Minister needs to do the right thing and give these grieving families of veterans the royal commission that they not only deserve but that all of our current serving personnel also need. It is a national tragedy that more veterans have taken their lives than we actually lost in our conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clearly, this is not an issue that will go away either. I would like to pay tribute to the extraordinary courage of women like Julie-Ann Finney, who I had the pleasure of meeting this morning. She has campaigned on behalf not only of her late son but of families who have lost their loved ones through veteran suicide all across Australia. On their behalf, she has shown resilience, she has shown courage, and I respect and applaud her today. I also had the honour of meeting with a number of veterans this morning who have lost mates and who continue to carry heavy burdens themselves but who also continue to fight not just here but across Australia to make sure that this royal commission that is so desperately needed is actually instituted by this government. We in Labor called for a royal commission into veteran suicide because we had listened to families of veterans and we responded. Thats not to say that we dont need the commission that the government has also established but it cant do its work alone. It needs to see a royal commission first.These suicide figures are double the rate of the normal population. Losing more people from the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts once theyve returned home than we lost in the field are figures that we cant ignore. Theyre not figures that we can turn our faces away from, that we can let go unanswered. They should be a glaring light to government, to all of us in in parliament, that there is a fundamental problem that needs to be addressed and not just for any sector of our community but for a segment of our community who take on our challenges as a nation and fight on our behalf, who go into the ultimate of harms way. Those who I have had the honour of standing with, as the member for Hunter just said, behind the wire, I know, had to go beyond the wire in the work that they did on behalf of our nation.Lets also remember the critical role of family members in supporting our current and ex-serving defence personnel. Its not often acknowledged or appreciated as much as it should be. When a person serves in the ADF, their family serves with them. Military families make many sacrifices. We know that many service men and women are deployed internationally for many months, or nearly a year at a time, with this separation causing emotional stress for those deployed as well as for their partners and children remaining here in Australia. And when personnel are not deployed, theyre on regular re-postings to different bases around the country, many just this year having to spend over a year away from families who they had left in a different state to where they are currently posted.Posted service, particularly in the circumstances where someone is medically discharged as well, can have a significant and ongoing impact. Indeed, when we consider it, what were seeing in the suicide emergency being confronted right now is really a result of injuries upon returning from service. These are not obvious injuries, like loss of a limb, but they are clearly deadly injuries being inflicted on our veterans through their service. When someone is medically discharged it is often the family who becomes their carers. It is the family who helps and supports them. It is often the family who can identify the first signs of mental illness and its also the family who can recognise the signs and symptoms of poor physical health. But they also need support.For too long now there has been stigma around mental illness and suicide, particularly for our ex-service and, indeed, serving personnel. This has meant that many veterans have been reluctant to come forward and ask for the help that they need, leaving them feeling isolated and alone. A particular friend of mine—a former colleague—was partner to a serviceman who fought in Iraq. The mental health trauma that he was suffering upon his return from deployment to Iraq ultimately led to the end of their relationship. It was a very sad circumstance, because from where he stood he didnt feel that he could go and ask for support. He didnt want to go and ask for support; he thought it was a sign of weakness to ask for that support. Overcoming stigma is integral to ensuring that those suffering know they can talk about how theyre feeling, to prevent tragedies from occurring. Of course, thats always easier said than done. Its for all of these reasons that we need to see a royal commission into veteran suicide now, and why we support this motion calling on the government to bring that about as soon as possible.","Defence Personnel: Suicide","RESOLUTIONS OF THE SENATE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[11]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr KEOGH (Burt) ","(16:51):"
204,0,0,0,1,1,"Mitchell, Rob, MP","M3E","McEwen","ALP","N/A",2978," I was sitting here and looking through my phone just before I was called. I was reading Save Our Services Australia, which is a local organisation run by Jeb Summers for veterans and first responders. Many of the issues that our veterans face are the same thing that our first responders face. I read something there and thought it was probably the most apt thing Ive read, that its not the person with PTSD who is refusing to let go of the past but its the past thats refusing to let go of the person.I think thats one of the things Ive heard over this time in meeting with veterans organisations and with veterans. They arent just young blokes like those who are nice and fit, healthy and young. Its even when I sit back with a few of the old boys who I meet with—the Vietnam vets. These things dont go away. I think about when my grandfather was discharged after World War II after spending time at Tobruk and in the Middle East, and then in Papua New Guinea. He was discharged with what was called shell shock. Shell shock is just another name for PTSD—we just didnt acknowledge it then. He was one of those World War II vets who we punished throughout their lives and just said to them: Toughen up, harden up and suck it up. Be a man and cop it on the chin.Really, its a shame that has happened over a long period of time. What I think is so important now is that the door has been opened and we have the conversations. It doesnt matter which side of the parliament we sit on, we should all agree that we owe our veterans, at the bare minimum, the respect to listen to them, to understand them and to give them what is needed.When I look through Facebook pages such as Save Our Services and the likes the thing that keeps coming up day after day is another veteran lost, another brother gone, another sister gone. Another family thats going to live with a scar that goes for the rest of their lives and thats knowing that theyve lost their loved one, who was prepared to stand up in the name of our country and do the service that we asked them to do. We ask them to do that. This is the thing. Its people that sit in here that make the decision, when we send men and women off into harms way. Sure, theyre super trained. Having spent time in the Middle East and the likes you realise just how wonderful these men and women are. But if were going to make the decision to send them into places—theatres of war—where theyre going to put their lives on the line then the very least we can do when they get back is tell them, Weve got your back and do the right thing by them—not by us, not by anyone else, but by them.The royal commission is something that theyve called for. They want it because theyre hurting. The Prime Minister said that the commissioner would be a bigger and better form than a royal commission. No-one believed that, because its not right. We know that a royal commission is the most important thing that we can do for our vets. To the families that have lost loved ones nothing is going to return their sons and daughters, but at least we should be able to sit here hand on heart and say, Yes, weve done the right thing, because we owe it to them. In every single aspect we owe it to them. We train them. We send then off. We bring them home. We should do the right thing.The most consistent thing Ive heard in terms of issues when people come back from service or when they discharge from our armed forces are the problems of dealing with DVA. Let me tell you, having involvement through the stuff on Defence abuse I learnt very quickly just how bad DVA can be. And thats not to say everyone in DVA, but by jeez the way that they have done things to veterans—put them through extra mental pressure and torment just to save their own backsides—is almost second to none. When the member for Lingiari was minister I think I might have given even him a shock with the language I used when I was talking about DVA because of what they were doing to servicemen and servicewomen who had been abused. That is one part of the issue.The main issue that remains steadfast is the need for a royal commission and the need for us in here to combine together to do the right thing by our veterans and deliver it. If we in this place are prepared to send men and women to war then weve got to be prepared to do the right thing. If were prepared to listen to them, hear their stories and stand up and support them, then support them when they come home. Give them and their families the respect that they deserve and have earned. We make them put on a uniform. We make them go places. The least we can do is listen to their concerns. There should be no obfuscation about this at all. Theres no, Yes, we wont oppose a motion. Be buggered—we should be up here saying, We will be doing this.I think the right and honourable thing to do would be for the Prime Minister to come in now, stand here, look you fellows in the eye and say: Yes, its happening. Were going to do it now. Were going to do it properly. Were not going to muck around with it. Were going to make sure that you have input into ensuring that the questions that are asked are the questions you need answered. Anything short of that is appalling.There are many veterans out there who will be listening to this, because I know from every conversation Ive had, over the last few weeks particularly, that this is first and foremost on their minds. I think every speaker has gone through the facts of the people weve lost through suicide, but lets also think about the people that are back who are carrying the scars and the pain in their hearts. They might not be physical. You might not be able to see what people are going through. Quite often its the strongest people we know who are the ones prepared to be out there helping others when they themselves are suffering. Through any form of disaster Ive seen, through bushfires et cetera, its the same thing: the people stand up, they are trying to help, but you know that, deep down, they are hurting. Theyre the ones that go home and cant concentrate on thinking. They cant sleep, cant eat properly and cant function properly because of the pain theyre carrying. For Gods sake, lets do the right thing and do it now. This should be passed today. We should have a commitment that it will be done. First and foremost, the Prime Minister should look you guys in the eye and tell you its going to happen. Thats what Ill be hoping for and thats what I hope every member in this place will stand up and do. I know its not a partisan issue, not a party issue. I dont like to say nice things about government members, but Ive got a few mates on that side and I know how much they support it. I know they want to get it done. Its now a question of getting it done sooner rather than later. With that, I wish this speedy passage. I hope it gets done and I hope that, next time, I can look you guys in the eye and say: Yep, weve got it. Well done, you men.","Defence Personnel: Suicide","RESOLUTIONS OF THE SENATE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[12]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ROB MITCHELL (McEwen—Second Deputy Speaker) ","(16:57):"
205,0,0,0,1,1,"Wilkie, Andrew, MP","C2T","Clark","IND","N/A",2980," Its obviously very disappointing—and, in fact, for many veterans and their loved ones it has been very distressing—that it has taken so long to get to the stage of having a royal commission into veteran suicide and serving members as well. Its even more disappointing when we boil this down and realise that we have only reached this point because of the numbers in the House. The motion only passed the other place because the numbers were there to push it through the other place. Were only going to ultimately vote in favour of this motion here in the House because the government has lost the numbers on this matter. Thats the reality of it, and thats very disappointing. It calls into question whether the government collectively has its heart in having a royal commission and whether there will in fact be a royal commission. The alternative is that we all come in here and wring our hands and give great speeches and say all the right things and give veterans and serving members, and their loved ones, false hope.We must not give serving members, veterans and their loved ones false hope. It is important for the government and the Prime Minister personally to very quickly—today ideally but in days at most—move to give certainty to this motion, either here or in front of cameras or in front of a group of veterans, to say that the government will act on this motion, that the government will organise for a royal commission to be held into serving member and veteran suicides. The government should very promptly appoint an eminent person to be the head of that royal commission—and not an ex-senior defence officer, because anyone who has served in the ADF will be to some degree conflicted or at least at risk of being seen to be conflicted. So it must be an eminent person, someone untarnished by the practices in the ADF, the DVA and elsewhere that have got to us this stage. And that commissioner must have the broadest terms of reference to go down rabbit holes, to chase leads and to hold people to account. Ultimately thats what we need to see here—not just to make bland planned findings but to hold people to account so they can explain themselves and say why, in 2021, we still have such a horrific rate of suicides among serving members and veterans. And then we need hard recommendations from that royal commission, and the government needs to act on those recommendations. Sadly, this country has a woeful track record of actually acting on the recommendations of royal commissions. So I say again: lets not give serving members and veterans, and their loved ones, false hope. Theyre listening to this right now and many of them are thinking that we are voting for a royal commission. Well, no, were not. Were not establishing a royal commission. That job is still for the government to deliver on. So, lets hope they do.Part and parcel of this—and many of my honourable colleagues have spoken on this point already—is to fix DVA and to fix that whole network of organisations and services that will support our veterans and our serving members. Im not going to criticise individual officers in DVA. There are a lot of good people in DVA. In fact, my late father was treated very well by DVA. I am treated very well by DVA, because Im in fact covered for a number of conditions under the Veterans Entitlement Act. I have no complaints personally. But, still close to home, my brother, a Vietnam veteran, was treated appallingly by DVA, and there are so many people in in the community right now who are being treated appallingly by DVA. Lets clean up the mishmash of legislation—the VEA, the DRCA, MRCA, CRCA—RRCA? I dont know—I dont know whats next. Were running out of letters to have more erkas. Lets clean up the legislation, and lets give DVA the resources it needs. And lets put some flexibility into the system. Lets not have a repeat of an episode that occurred quite recently with one of my constituents, who was getting tens of thousands of dollars of support from DVA for a range of ailments but just wanted one little thing that was just going to cost a couple of hundred bucks, because thats actually what he needed, and the system said no, because the rules did not allow it.Its actually easy to send people to war. Well, even if they dont go to war, its actually easy to have a standing defence force. Its easy to have people in uniform within Australia. Its easy to have them in training in Australia. Its not that difficult to deploy them on humanitarian missions, peacekeeping missions, peace-making missions or offensive operations. Whats hard—and what this motion goes to, in essence—is looking after those people, perhaps while theyve still got their uniform on or often after theyve taken their uniform off. As one of my honourable colleagues said in here, in the example they gave, once someone goes to Kapooka, to the recruit training centre, or to any number of other training institutions, including the Reserve—once they sign on the dotted line and put that uniform on—theyve made a very powerful commitment to this country and to the government of the day. Theyve made a commitment that they will, in extremis, fight for and die for this country.Well, its a two-way deal, and we have an obligation to those people, while theyre in uniform and until their end of days, if theyve been injured or hurt in some way—we have just as much an obligation—to care for them as much as we can. And as we now understand so much better in this country, we have not been caring for a lot of them as well as we could. How else to explain that the rate of suicide amongst serving members is markedly lower than the national average and thumpingly high once they take their uniform off? So the real challenge is after they serve. This is personal for me, because, as a representative of Tasmania, Im very mindful that the recruitment or enlistment into the ADF is markedly higher, on a pro rata basis, among Tasmanians. And its reasonable to assume that the downsides of service are markedly more prevalent in Tasmania. I suspect that I speak for all members here when I recount that so many people have come to see us since we were elected to public office. Often its veterans, but do you know whats more upsetting? Its when the loved ones of veterans come and talk to us—the mum, the dad, the sibling or the friend, who are beside themselves with worry about what has become of their loved one, or the fact that they have suicided or have just disappeared, literally gone bush. Who is looking out for them?Ill wrap up by saying that theres nothing hard about this. Theres nothing hard about having a royal commission. Sure, we shouldnt have a royal commission at the drop of a hat. But we must have royal commissions for the most significant and serious matters. By any definition, the alarming rate of suicide among serving members and veterans is as serious a matter as could possibly be contemplated by the members of this House and by the government of the day. I say to the Prime Minister: dont just wave this motion through. If you do that, youll be giving false hope to so many people in this country—people who are listening to us or watching us tonight on their iPad or on their computer. They are hearing us say that there will be a royal commission, yet the government has not agreed to a royal commission.Lets end the uncertainty. Through you, Deputy Speaker, I say to the Prime Minister, to the minister and to the government: end the uncertainty and say something tonight before we rise or first thing tomorrow in front of the cameras or as soon as the parliament sits at midday tomorrow. Let someone like the PM come in here and say: We hear you. What we said last night wasnt hollow. Our hand wringing wasnt theatre. There will be a royal commission with an eminent royal commissioner and with powerful terms of reference. We will act on the recommendations and we will find the money to deliver, because our veterans and those still in uniform and all those who love them—many of whom have lost loved ones—deserve nothing less.","Defence Personnel: Suicide","RESOLUTIONS OF THE SENATE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[13]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr WILKIE (Clark) ","(17:06):"
206,0,0,0,1,1,"Katter, Bob, MP","HX4","Kennedy","KAP","N/A",2982," The member for Braddon spoke earlier today. I thought he was spot on, as was my learned colleague in front of me here, the member from Tasmania. One of the other speakers said, Help is there—great help. Honestly, how can you say that? There have been 26 suicides in 11 weeks. That must be great help! I would hate to think what could happen if we didnt have that help. But that is not the nature of the problem. In fact, I went to great lengths to listen to a program—I cant remember now whether it was 60 Minutes or Four Corners. I think both of them did something on a suicide or on suicides. In both those cases, it was my own personal experience that people are sailing along alright when they get out and then they hit an anxiety period. Then they go and see the DVA and fall off the cliff. Whether or not thats related to them going to see the DVA, the time frame is most certainly straight after they go to see the DVA. Thats not so in all cases, but it is in the cases that I have had experience with.The member for Braddon said that you got your identity and it was your family. We had over a thousand people attend the meetings. I pleaded with Jacqui Lambie to come north and she came with Heston Russell in tow—two very great Australians—and they drew well over a thousand people to the fortress city of Townsville. I deeply regretted that people from the government werent there. The member for Braddon said, I had a family, I had an identity, and I had an income. That was what I took down and memorised and tattooed in my brain from listening to over a thousand people express their opinions to Jacqui, to Heston, and, to a lesser degree, to me. You lose all three. When you say family, as my great and wonderful colleague put it so well here, the Army is your family. You sleep with your rifle and you sleep with your mates out in the middle of nowhere. Though I didnt actually see combat, we were on 24 hour call-up to go and fight in Indonesia. The battalion was rated F1, ready for combat. I dont know about other people, but I was scared silly about going into combat. I went and saw my Uncle Allan, who fought at Aitape, and my Uncle Billy, who fought at Milne Bay, and I had long yarns with both of them. I was very, very scared, and I think that would be true of so many other people. When you leave the Army, you lose your income, you lose your identity and you lose the family that youve spent most of your time with. Its not actually your wife and your kids; its your mates from your section or your platoon or your company. You lose all three.When the Broncos rugby league team was forming, Bernie Power said, They take these young boys in and then they just throw them away when theyre no good anymore to the team. He said, We have a program that puts them back into society as good, active people, with some money in their pocket and some businesses that they own or have big shares in. The thing he most wanted to impress upon me was not that they were going to have a great rugby league team out of Brisbane, out of Queensland, but that they were going to look after the boys when they finished their rugby league career. All my life, Ive been a player or an official in the rugby league, and I love the game. Bruno Cullen, when he took over the Broncos, as recently as three months ago was saying how well that program is still working—of transitioning them into businesses of their own and into semi-jobs of their own that they control. Theres a pathway out. I remember when my son lost his contract with the Cowboys, five of them all lost their contracts with the NRL clubs at the same time. One went onto the hooch and one sat in front of the television, staring through it for most of the next year. Their whole lives collapsed. My son got through it alright, but others didnt, and its infinitely worse for these people coming out of the Army.One of the speakers said that the DVA gives them great help. Im sorry but thats not my experience. In fact, my experience is just the opposite. If they go to DVA, then weve really got serious trouble. What really jarred me—I was campaigning down at the pub at Bushland Beach. I represent probably more retired veterans than anyone else in this place because Ive got the northern beaches area of Townsville, where a lot of people retire to, and I represent the Atherton tablelands, one of the most beautiful parts of Australia, where a hell of a lot of them retire to. I was at the Bushland Beach pub and I ran into eight people there that night that had attempted suicide or whose closest friend or husband or wife had attempted suicide. I was quite staggered by it. They were so passionate about it. Then, a week later, I was up in the Atherton tablelands and there were two blokes there. John Hardie, whos got an OBE and is president of the conscripts association of Queensland—I forget the name of the organisation. John was there, and I winked at him, and he nodded his head, meaning: Yes, Im keeping an eye on both of them. Theyre in serious trouble, both of them. One was a captain in the Army, a very young bloke, and the other was a corporal that had come out. In two weeks at two hotels I ran into these people. That will give you some idea.Im not trying to have a go at the government. I think every speaker here today has tried to be nonpolitical, but you are the government. There have been 26 suicides in 11 weeks. I am not filled with any sense that there is a serious problem out there. I dont know about other people, but Im going to bed at night and Im feeling comfortable about this. I wore the uniform for eight years on and off. I was in the militia, and we were on a war footing. We were at war with Indonesia at the time and then, later on, with Vietnam. We were rated F1. It was an entirely different militia then to what you see today I can assure you. Over a thousand people attend those meetings and only three voted against an inquiry. The three of them—well, two of them were on the payroll from the government, and I suspect the other one probably was as well.Tim White must be singled out. Tim carries around—I hope he doesnt mind me saying this without his permission—a photograph in his shirt of his old patrol. I think there were 10 in the patrol. I might be wrong with the exact figures, but: two are still alive and well, two are in jail, two are hopeless alcoholics and the rest of them did away with themselves.Tim takes his old buddy-buddy mates from the army out bush to look after First Australians. If Im not sleeping well at night, its because of the other problem I have, about First Australians. They are the other of the two groups of people who hold world-record suicide rates. I dont think, in either case, the government is coming to grips with this at all. If the Broncos rugby league team can do it, surely the government of Australia can do it. The Broncos go out there and bleed for Brisbane. These people go out there and bleed for Australia—and they seriously bleed.I dont know whether the minister is a good or bad minister, but weve asking him to come up and visit the fortress city—if you want to know where the eye of the storm is—for nearly six weeks now. I remember former Minister for Mines and Energy, Ron Camm. We had a meeting at Greenvale, a big mining town, and there was a strike on. They were mostly striking in protest against the state government. Of course, who was the No. 2 in the state government: Ron Camm. I said, Mate, were going to blow town. He said, No, we dont blow town. If theres a problem, thats where you go.

207,0,0,0,1,1,"Bandt, Adam, MP","M3C","Melbourne","AG","N/A",2984," I rise to make a few brief remarks about this very important motion. I support this. The Greens supported the motion when it was moved by Senator Lambie in the Senate. Im glad that this motion is now going through, it seems, with the support of everyone in this House. There will need to be action. Ill talk about that in a moment.Its critical to support this royal commission call, and its something that weve supported for some time. We might have differences and discussions in this place—the Greens will often be critical—on decisions that the government makes to engage in conflict or to send troops to war. Weve brought, to this place, a number of bills to reform that. And we have the debates here when we can about the decisions that the Australian government have made—many of which have been very bad decisions that have put people in harms way unnecessarily often with long-lasting consequences. But none of that should affect the support that is provided to the people who do go and serve. Weve always been very steadfast in making the point that, while these conflicts are ongoing, the criticisms that are made are criticisms of the government and are not criticisms of the people who serve on behalf of all of us—every one of us in this parliament. But thats got to extend also to when veterans return. This has become crystal clear over the time that Ive been in this place. I have engaged with good organisations in my electorate that I want to particularly mention, including groups like the Flemington/Kensington RSL, who have taken on the RSL. People may have certain views about RSLs and what RSLs used to be like, but these are young veterans. The average age of these veterans is probably in the 30s. They have taken over and revitalised their RSL in large part—theyve told me from the time that Ive spent there talking to them and talking to the members there I know—because it is so critical to the welfare of service people who have returned.One of the things that has become crystal clear is that really—and I agree with the way the member for Kennedy put it before, this is an area where the government has dropped the ball. Theyre very keen to invest in other areas of Defence spending, and theyre very keen to talk about commitments to sending troops off to fight, but less so about the services and supports that are provided afterwards.The veteran community have been very clear that theres something that all Australians should agree on, which is that the level of suicides is completely unacceptable. Weve heard that message from veterans and their families, and we in the Greens agree. The question is: what can be done about it? The call that has come from the community, families who have lost loved ones and associations is that we need a royal commission. The government came here previously with something that tried to walk, talk and quack like a royal commission but was not a royal commission.The proposal that had been put forward previously by the government for a commissioner was met with some pretty strong resistance from the veteran community, and rightly so, because they told us that it could and would have had the effect that the people who have been left behind and veterans themselves would go through the traumatic process—and, in some instances, the retraumatizing process—of telling their stories only to find out that they were talking to someone who didnt have the power to do the investigation required and make the recommendations needed. So they said very clearly: That is not good enough. What we need is a proper royal commission. That was the view of the people I talked to on the ground, and that is why the Greens argued at the time that that bill was not enough and instead what was needed was a royal commission.I am glad that Senator Lambie brought the motion to the Senate. Were debating it here today. Im pleased that the government has given us a significant amount of time to debate it here. Its testament to what happens in this place when you have procedures that allow people who arent being heard to bring their concerns to parliament. This motion passed the Senate and is now here, and the government has said its important enough for us to have a long debate about it. If it werent for the capacity of other voices to bring these things to the parliament, the government may not be facing this at all—the government may not be having to deal with the fact that it isnt just one odd voice in parliament but a really strong push coming from the whole community. I think thats worth remembering in this place.Often there are proposals in this place to streamline things and not take up as much time as we need to talk about these things, and the government just says, Lets get on with government business. It was not the government that brought this issue to the parliament. It is the government that has allowed us to have the debate today, but it was not the government who brought this to the parliament. For most of the day the government has allowed debate on this critical matter, which is literally a matter of life and death. Now it is up to the government to act. It would be incredibly disappointing if, after this, we move on to the next thing and leave the community with the impression that somehow weve resolved to proceed with a royal commission, because the government hasnt yet agreed to that. The government has not agreed to that. The government should agree to that. Just as it has sat, listened and understood that there is a growing groundswell of voices to make a royal commission a reality, now it needs to act on it.It is the government that has the power and the capacity to call a royal commission. The government should do that because the government should remember the path that the banking royal commission followed before the government had to call it. The Senate moved motions that came here. The government realised it had to get on with it. Not only that but bills were brought into the Senate to say to the government, If youre not going to do it, were going to make you do it and were going to set up a parliamentary commission of inquiry. That got support there as well. Eventually the pressure became so overwhelming that the government realised, Well, hang on, if theres actually such widespread support in the parliament, wed better get on and do it ourselves. Thats what the government should do this time. If it doesnt do that, this will happen again. If the government follows the path of the banking royal commission, then it is going to be dragged kicking and screaming to do that.I would say: dont put veterans and their families through months and months and months of making us come back here to do this again and again and again. Just accept the will of this place, as expressed by a motion passed by both houses of parliament, for a royal commission. Just accept it and do it. The flipside is: why would you drag it out for longer, knowing the harm and the stress that thats going to cause? To the government: you dont need to do it, and you shouldnt do it. You should just accept that it is very rare that the House and the Senate concur in something that is not government sponsored but brought to this place by other voices, and that when that happens it usually results in change.The question for the government is: are you going to be dragged kicking and screaming to that change or are you going to get out ahead of it and just call for the royal commission? I would urge the government to say, Having let this debate have the time it deserves, knowing that this motion is now going to be passed, that both houses of parliament are going to concur in it, we will now move to do something about it. If you dont, if you dont do it in a timely manner and if you put veterans and their families through more stress, expect that this will happen again and again and again until you finally do it.","Defence Personnel: Suicide","RESOLUTIONS OF THE SENATE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[15]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BANDT (Melbourne—Leader of the Australian Greens) ","(17:26):"
208,0,0,0,1,1,"Georganas, Steve, MP","DZY","Adelaide","ALP","N/A",2986," I, too, rise to speak on this very important motion thats been referred to us from the Senate. I have spoken on this issue a number of times in this House, and, along with a number of my colleagues from the crossbench, from this side and from the Senate, I have been saying that I cannot understand for the life of me why, with a growing number of suicides, with the epidemic of veteran suicide, this government hasnt acted on calls for a royal commission into this particular issue. Im glad that this motion has been sent here to us to debate, but it is just that—a motion. Without the government acting, it will remain just that. We need the government to establish a royal commission into the rate of suicide of veterans and people serving in the Australian defence forces.Id like to start off by paying tribute to Julie-Ann Finney, who is a constituent of mine in the electorate of Adelaide. Shes been a tireless worker on the front line, trying to get focus on this issue. Without the outstanding work by her and others, we might not be here today discussing it. There is also Angela McKay, in my electorate, who lost a son to suicide as well. It must be horrific to know that something within service in the Defence Force brought someone to that point. You can just imagine how these motherrs feel.I think this government owes it to those mothers who have lost sons and daughters to suicide to get to the bottom of it, and the only way we can get to the bottom of it is through a royal commission. Sure, its great to establish a commissioner, but the commissioner will not have the same abilities and powers as a royal commission. The whole idea of the commissioner is to look at ongoing issues, to develop a whole range of things. But you need a royal commission to get to the underlying facts of why this is taking place. Then you fix it with legislation or through regulations, and then you have a commission that works under the recommendations that have been given by that royal commission.As we heard the member for Melbourne say, we send these people to combat areas. Governments of either persuasion—both sides have done it—have declared that we are going into Iraq or Afghanistan, and we owe it to those people we send there that we keep them as safe as possible. I know our defence forces are doing a great amount of work. They are total professionals. But we also have a duty as a government to look after them when they come home.I visited Afghanistan on one of the Defence programs in, I think, 2011. They flew us out from Kandahar to Tarin Kowt, which was front line basically. In Tarin Kowt we had a briefing. At that point, one of our Defence Force personnel had been blown up by a suicide bomber in Tarin Kowt. They briefed us on the situation, what took place. One of the Defence personnel there was a young person, about 25 or 26. His job was to do the investigation of that particular incident. He explained to us how, after the bombing, their priority was to try and do everything they could to save the Australian soldier. But then his job was to put the pieces together and work out who, what, why. He explained to us how they started picking up body parts and putting the body back together to see who it was or what it was, and they discovered it was a young boy—the suicide bomber—who would have been no older than 14. This young Australian soldier explained to me how he had to pick up the head, the arms, the body parts and put them together on the table so they could examine them. He was being released to come back to Australia in approximately a months time, he told me. For the life of me, I thought: when he does come back, after what hes been through, what would he do on the weekends with his mates who perhaps would have no idea of what he was doing over there? Talk about football? Go for a beer at the pub? You can imagine the support that these people need. Thered be hundreds like this young man that I spoke to in Afghanistan in Tarin Kowt in 2011.So we need a royal commission. We need this royal commission to see what is causing men and women to suicide after theyve served in the Defence Force or while they are in the Defence Force. Ive got to say if this was another type of epidemic in another industry, in another type of situation, there would be an uproar by the public, demanding that people receive the services that they require, the help that they require to ensure that this stops. Our service men and women deserve better. Their families deserve better. People in my electorate like Julie-Ann Finney and Angela McKay, who both lost sons under these dreadful conditions, have been calling and shouting for a royal commission. They deserve better, and we owe it to them. Our service men and women put their lives at risk every single day for us so we can live the lives that we live—free, in a good democracy, able to speak out and do as we basically please within the law. These people protect that for us. It is one of the greatest honours to protect the pillars of our democracy, and thats what they did. Julie-Ann Finneys son and Angela McKays son were deployed to all different places around the world to protect the foundations of our democracy, and we owe it to them to ensure that we get to the bottom of why this is occurring.We heard the government announce a new role, the National Commissioner for Defence and Veteran Suicide Prevention, but Ive got to say that is inadequate. That is inadequate. You need the royal commission to do the review, to look at what is causing this, to get into the intricate details. We on this side have repeatedly stated that we would prefer a royal commission into veteran suicide. The commissioner may assist, but you need to get to all the details. As I said, this is because an investigation by a royal commission will have better powers. It will have better funding. It will result in clear-cut recommendations that can then be implemented. It would be more thorough and thered be more accountability. We dont need a royal commission five years down the track or next year or the year after. We need a royal commission now.Im very pleased that were debating this motion, but, as I said, without the Prime Minister coming out and calling for a royal commission this will remain nothing but a motion that has just passed the House of Representatives. Im so pleased that members on the other side are starting to see how important this is. We heard that there are members who may cross the floor, and rightly so they should, because this is not a political issue. This is not about Labor or Liberal or Greens or Independents or Callithumpians. This is about the defence forces of our nation that protect us every day and protect the pillars of our democracy.","Defence Personnel: Suicide","RESOLUTIONS OF THE SENATE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[16]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr GEORGANAS (Adelaide) ","(17:36):"

Its not enough, Minister, that you say that youll carefully consider the vote of the parliament, the vote of the House and the vote of the Senate. Its not enough.

But I did want to add my voice to the many whove spoken in favour of a royal commission into the issue of veteran suicides. The number of veterans who have written to me on this issue is astonishing. A man who wrote to me on Saturday night said, As a veteran who served 30 years and did tours of Somalia, Afghanistan, two in Iraq, one in East Timor and one in Timor-Leste, I would like to thank the Senate for voting to have a royal commission into veteran and serving ADF member suicides. I have suffered from PTSD since 1994 and recently it became the catalyst for my medical retirement from the workforce. I implore my local federal members and the Senate to vote for a royal commission. As other members have noted, members of the military are half as likely to take their own lives as members of the general community but veterans are twice as likely to take their own lives. We have lost many more veterans to suicide than we have lost serving ADF personnel on the battlefield. I am yet to receive a single piece of correspondence—a single letter, a single telephone call—from anyone opposing a royal commission. I want to be able to look veterans in the eye and say that I supported a royal commission.

211,0,0,0,1,1,"Thistlethwaite, Matt, MP",182468,"Kingsford Smith","ALP","N/A",2989," I move the amendment in my name on behalf of the shadow Treasurer:That all words after That be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes:(1) one trillion dollars of debt will be accrued but there is not enough to show for it;(2) too many Australians will be left behind when the Government cut Jobkeeper at the end of March;(3) two million Australians are still looking for work or more work;(4) important policy areas such as child care and social housing remain unaddressed by the Government;(5) the Governments response to the crisis in aged care is inadequate; and(6) the Governments budget is riddled with rorts at the expense of a proper vision for the country.In just about every single economic measure that there is, Australia has gone backwards under this government—in almost every single economic measure. They are worse now than when they were elected in 2013. Wages growth, the principal important factor in ensuring that Australians keep pace with the cost of living, has gone backwards dramatically under this government. And they have no plan whatsoever to stimulate wages in this country and ensure that the average hardworking Australian can keep pace with the cost of living. In fact, theyve made it worse by putting in place policies that actively discourage wages growth, such as cuts to penalty rates that they championed some years ago in the hospitality and service sectors that are now bearing fruit and seeing workers in those industries take home less pay for working on weekends and doing shifts than they did when those penalty rates were still in place.So Australians are falling further behind in their family incomes under this government. Yet, at the same time, the level of household debt in Australia has been increasing, and Australia is now one of the most unaffordable countries in the world when it comes to household debt, principally because, once again, housing affordability has got worse. And yet again in Australia, particularly in capital cities, house prices are like a runaway train, out of control. Do you think this government is interested in ensuring that younger Australians have the support they need to get into the housing market? Not on your life. Australians are going backwards when it comes to housing affordability and household debt under this government.The productivity of our economy, the amount of income we generate per worker in this country, has been falling under this government. Thats a significant achievement, I must say! Ever since records have been kept of labour productivity in Australia, theres always been growth. Generally we used to just argue over the level of that growth, not over the fact that its going backwards and declining, that there is no productivity. In fact, theres now the opposite, and that is that Australians are generating less income per employee than they had under the Labor government. So Ive got to give it to them: theyve set a record, this government—the first time in Australias history that labour productivity has actually gone backwards, under their watch. Its certainly nothing to be proud of.Wealth inequality has been increasing under this government. We see that not only in the figures but also in the policies of this government, which do nothing to ensure that theres a fairer distribution of income in this country. And the government is now planning another stage of income tax cuts, which overwhelmingly benefit the most wealthy Australians and those who are on incomes above $200,000 a year.But it gets worse. The policies that this government has put in place to deal with COVID and to try and assist workers to ensure that they stay in employment—as the member for Fenner has pointed out on several occasions and has done great work in researching—have actually entrenched this inequality that we have in wealth in Australia, by providing government support through the JobKeeper allowance to some of the most wealthy Australians, who then thumb their nose at the Australian worker and the Australian taxpayer by refusing to pay it back when they make a massive profit and distribute it as dividends and executive bonuses. I mean, you cannot make this stuff up! There are Australian workers that are struggling to make ends meet. There are many Australian small businesses that arent going to survive at the end of this month. We know that. Theyre going to hit the wall. When JobKeeper ends, small Australian businesses are going to end, and so are the jobs that are associated with those small businesses. But this government isnt interested in looking at supporting those businesses beyond the end of March. This government isnt interested in asking the likes of Harvey Norman, who made a half-a-billion-dollar profit over the first half of the financial year, or Premier Investments, which made a profit—they were happy to take a government subsidy from the taxpayer. They pocketed JobKeeper and are refusing to pay it back. Yet struggling Australian small businesses, whose owners have generally mortgaged their homes to make sure they can survive, will go to the wall. They will go to the wall because the government is not interested in helping them one bit but wont ask Harvey Norman to pay back the $22 million in JobKeeper that they pocketed while they still made a half-a-billion-dollar profit and managed to do a distribution to shareholders. It says everything about this government, and that is why wealth inequality is getting worse under this government.In the area of our environment, climate change, trying to put in place measures to protect our kids future, youd have to think that one of the most fundamental responsibilities we have in this place is to protect the next generation of Australians from a phenomenon that is affecting the universe, and the world, that we know is going to occur and that every single scientist worth their salt says is occurring. But not under this government. If you look at the department of energys website and its quarterly reports on carbon emissions, you will see that carbon emissions in this country, on an annual basis, have been increasing under this government. Our environment has been getting dirtier. Our environment has been getting more pollution that is going to leave an unsafe environment for our kids. In fact, its well known that Australia ranks 54th of 61 countries on the global climate performance index in 2021. That is an absolute disgrace.We were actually reducing our carbon emissions in this country. When Labor was in government we put a price on carbon emissions. And guess what? They started to fall; the policy actually worked. Yet we became the only country in the world that said: Weve got a successful policy thats reducing carbon emissions. Lets get rid of it so the big polluters can start polluting again and we hand an unsafe environment on to our kids. What country does that to its citizens? What country does that and leaves that sort of future for its children? Ill tell you what country does that: a country run by the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government. Thats exactly what they did. They removed the price on carbon emissions and—guess what?—carbon emissions have been going up again. I will admit that emissions have fallen over the past 12 months, but thats because of COVID. Its got nothing to do with this governments policies at all. Because of COVID, Australians werent driving on the road as much, they werent consuming as much electricity, and export industries shut down for a period and our carbon emissions decreased. It had nothing to do with this governments policies.When it comes to hospital waiting lists—a fundamental policy that people expect from their governments is one providing adequate healthcare services—theyre getting worse under this government. We all saw that the government tried a GP tax in 2014. Hospital waiting lists are now blowing out.If you want an indictment of this government, look no further than aged care. The title of the interim report of the aged care royal commission is one word, Neglect. It says everything about this government. Its a perfect description of this governments approach to aged care—neglect. We know that there are now over 100,000 elderly Australians in this country waiting for an aged-care package. The majority of them are waiting for a level 4 package, one of the more serious levels of aged-care package. Thank you to all those hardworking elderly Australians who served our nation in wars and who built this country. What are we going to do for you? Were going to cut funding for aged care. Liberal policies are going to mean that were going to take nurses out of nursing homes so theres no requirement anymore for a nursing home to have a nurse on duty. The standard of care is going to fall. Were going to put 100,000 Australians on a waiting list and—guess what?—28,000 of them have died waiting for an aged-care package under this government over the last two years. Thank you to elderly Australians from the Morrison government!When it comes to the National Broadband Network, Australia has become an absolute joke. Only this government could come up with a policy whereby it could say: Were going to stop Labors fibre-to-the-premises policy and were going to come up with a policy that is inferior and doesnt provide the same download speed—that is, fibre to the node or fibre to the kerb—and then well use copper for the rest of the connection. Copper is an outdated technology, and were going to make sure that this not only results in an inferior technology but costs the nation more. Guess what? In a few years time, well have to go back and reinstall new technology, because it will be outdated, at an even greater cost to the Australian taxpayer. Only a coalition government, only the geniuses on that side of the parliament, could come up with a policy whereby you institute an inferior technology that costs more than the original plan. That is what has happened under the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government. Whats the result? Again, Australia goes backwards. We are now 61st in the world when it comes to average download speeds for households and businesses. I think there are only three nations in the OECD behind us. What a remarkable achievement for this government to have Australia fall to 61st in the world for average download speeds!When it comes to investment in research and development and trying to build for the future, again this government ensures that Australia goes backwards. In 2013, Australia invested 2.1 per cent of GDP in research and development. Whats the figure now? Its 1.79 per cent. Weve gone backwards under this government. The result is that business investment in Australia under the coalition government—believe it or not—has fallen. Its fallen quite dramatically. Australian businesses arent investing anymore because theres no support, theres no government plan and theres no map for the future from this government about how you stimulate research and development in emerging industries and produce that incentive for businesses to invest. Its simply not there.We now have a working poor in this country. Theyre working in insecure employment and worried about whether or not theyre going to have a job next week. Theyre without the necessary conditions and necessary supports to maintain a liveable lifestyle.That is the reality of life under this coalition government. In every single measure, whether its wages growth, productivity, business investment, household debt, housing affordability, wealth inequality, climate change, hospital waiting lists, aged care, the National Broadband Network, investment in research and development or security of work, Australia has gone backwards under the Morrison government. That is a damning indictment of the government and their approach to supporting the Australian people.","Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2020-2021, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2020-2021","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr THISTLETHWAITE (Kingsford Smith) ","(17:49):"

216,0,0,0,1,1,"Simmonds, Julian, MP",282983,"Ryan","LNP","N/A",2992," It was interesting to hear the contribution of the member for Kingsford Smith to the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2020-2021 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2020-2021. Im obviously strongly in favour of the substantive bill before us. Its such a shame that, after everything that Australia and Australians have been through over the last 18 months with COVID-19, still we see Labor MPs, like the member for Kingsford Smith, come into this chamber and resort to the politics of envy and to cheap political points about class warfare, when Australia has achieved so much together over the last 12 months. I do not understand why Labor MPs cant get on board with Team Australia.The member for Kingsford Smith spoke about JobKeeper and the JobKeeper program as a negative. Its extraordinary! It has kept hundreds of thousands of people in jobs. It has allowed the economy to come back to such an extent that there are now more jobs in Australia than there were before the COVID-19 pandemic. Still, Labor MPs find a way not to be on Team Australia, not to support Australians and not to congratulate them for what they have achieved in keeping their small businesses and their businesses together and in keeping their employees connected to businesses. They find a way to make it about partisan politics, and its just such a shame. The member for Kingsford Smith even had the audacity to come into this place and talk about insecure work and try and blame that on some fault of the government. First, they like to pretend that COVID-19 didnt even happen, because it doesnt suit their political narrative, but, second, we had an industrial relations reform package of bills in this place not so long ago which included a better pathway for casuals to get into long-term, secure employment, and what did Labor MPs do, including the member for Kingsford Smith? They voted against it; they didnt support it. They didnt support the whole package because they wanted to play partisan politics with something that had been negotiated with both business groups and the unions in order to provide more employment for all Australians coming out of COVID-19. That just shows you everything you need to know about how the Labor Party views Australia coming out of COVID-19. They view it as a political partisan game-playing exercise. We on this side of the chamber view it as an opportunity to push Australians forward, create more jobs, help people into secure employment and help them provide the opportunities and certainty for their families which have been missing over the last 18 months during the COVID pandemic.I digress a little bit from what I intended to speak about today, because, substantively, the appropriation bills are some of the most important mechanisms that we have to deliver for our electorates. I have to say that it is a privilege every single day to come into this place and represent my electorate of Ryan. I was born there. Ive lived my entire life there. I was raised there and educated there—the whole kit and caboodle. I now raise my young family there, and I make that point simply to emphasise how much of a privilege I know that it is to represent the people of Ryan and how dedicated I am to delivering for them. There are so many things that I know our area needs and that I have committed to deliver, and I wake up every single day and work to tick them off my list.Before I move on to the local commitments that the appropriation bills are allowing us to deliver, I want to talk about what is pressing in the electorate of Ryan at the moment, and that is the vaccine rollout. Its being embraced by local residents. I had the pleasure of sending out information just last week as we moved to the 1b stage of the vaccine rollout and of talking to the residents of Ryan about the nine GP clinics that are already signed up to deliver the vaccine. They include Kenmore respiratory clinic, the SmartClinics Walton Bridge at The Gap, the Ferny Grove Family Practice, the Bardon Rainworth Medical Centre, the Keperra Family Practice, the Brookside Family Clinic, Myhealth Toowong, the Fiveways Surgery at Taringa and the Bellbowrie Medical Centre.I want to encourage Ryan residents to be patient. I know how enthusiastic they are to get the vaccine. These GP clinics are working very, very hard to make sure that they take bookings and schedule people going forward. There will be more vaccines to roll out, so dont stress if you dont get a booking straightaway. There are plenty more vaccines coming from our locally manufactured vaccine stock, which is something only a very few number of countries in the world have been able to achieve. Weve been able to achieve that in Australia because of the foresight of the Prime Minister and the leadership team in making sure we secured local production of the AstraZeneca vaccine at CSL. This has been so important and will continue to be so important for our rollout.So please be patient if you cant get in straightaway. Be friendly and kind to the staff at those GP clinics because theyre going to have more vaccine rolling out. And there are going to be more GP clinics joining the rollout as well, so there will be the opportunity for everyone to get the vaccine. But Im so pleased that Im standing up here in this place talking to Ryan residents about having patience in getting the vaccine rather than the other way around and having to encourage people to get it. I know that my electorate has seized the opportunity to get the vaccine as a way forward and a path back to normality, so that we can get back to doing the things that we love in Australia.I want to focus specifically on the local commitments Ive made to the people of Ryan which the appropriations bill will allow us to achieve. One of the most significant of these was to fix local roads. I am conscious of the frustration of Ryan residents as they spend time stuck in congestion each and every day—the fact that they want to get home to their families sooner and safer. I am dedicated to making this happen. Theres no silver bullet. We live in a beautiful part of Brisbane—a beautiful part of the world. As the member for Brisbane knows with his area, when you have a beautiful part of the world more and more people want to move there. They want to live there and we dont want to stop those families from doing that, but as we get that growth we have to cater for it with appropriate infrastructure. Thats what Ive dedicated myself to doing.One of the bottlenecks that were tackling is the Indooroopilly roundabout. During the last election I secured $50 million in federal funding to fix this well-known choke point. I am happy to say that Im working with the Brisbane City Council, which has matched this funding—thats very exciting. We have got straight on with the job since the election. We went to public consultation on two draft designs that were being proposed by Brisbane City Council. There was an overwhelming response from local residents for the overpass option. Thank you so much to all the local residents who participated in that consultation process. Obviously, that option was chosen because it was the overwhelming option.The detailed design and planning work is now almost complete. I see surveyors on the Indooroopilly roundabout site all the time as they work to finalise that design. It wont be too long until we see a shovel in the ground this year. This has been a project that has taken a considerable amount of time. I reckon I was involved back in 2010 or 2011; I stood on the roundabout with then Lord Mayor Campbell Newman to talk about how the council wanted to purchase this particular site in order to enable the upgrade to occur. But it was only on being elected to federal parliament as part of the Morrison governments team that I was able to secure the $50 million in federal funding that allowed this project to actually get underway. Now were going to see shovels in the ground later this year.I really want to thank Lord Mayor Adrian Schrinner and the Brisbane City Council for acting so swiftly, because they too are seized by the importance of tackling traffic congestion in our local area. Id like to say that all levels of government are seized by that opportunity but they are not. Unfortunately, the Labor state government continues to obfuscate, delay and stall our very dedicated efforts to fix local traffic congestion in the Ryan electorate, including in the western suburbs. The bottleneck just down the road, on Moggill Road at the Kenmore roundabout, is unfortunately another story entirely. During the last federal election, again I was successful in fighting for and securing funding of $12.5 million for this much-needed project. It was then a long and gruelling local campaign, along with Dr Christian Rowan, who is the state member for Moggill—the LNP state member, I might add—to drag the state Labor government, kicking and screaming, to match that funding. They finally did that in September 2019. Since then, we have unfortunately heard crickets. Weve been persistently lobbying them to get on with the job. Finally, now in 2021—another 18 months later—theyve managed to release some draft plans for consultation. Again, I really want to encourage all local residents, because they know their suburbs the best. I grew up at Moggill—my family is still there, and I know what it is to drive through that roundabout every day. The residents are the ones with the local knowledge, so I really urge you to give your feedback to the TMR officials, who are leading that consultation process, and myself, so that I can fight to ensure that we get the best outcome out of this $25 million upgrade. We fought for the funding for so long. The consultation is currently open, so please be part of that.Another example of where the state Labor government have been, unfortunately, dragging their feet is with the funding that the federal government has provided as part of the appropriation bills—that is, the $10 million to do a scoping study to upgrade the Metroad 5. This is something that is dear to the member for Brisbanes heart, as well as mine. The member for Dickson is also keen on this. The three of us, along with the member for Petrie, are all seizing on the importance of upgrading the Metroad 5. It is a very, very difficult and congested road to navigate for everyone from Bardon, in my electorate, and in Ashgrove, in the member for Brisbanes electorate, to right along that corridor. The federal government put $10 million on the table to find out what it would cost and what a larger upgrade would achieve. We would love to see something come out of that planning study from the state government so that we can help ensure that we fight for that funding. Youve got at least four federal MPs who are very keen to fight for an upgrade and funding for Metroad 5. It would be great for the state government to get off their hands and use that $10 million that has been provided to them from the federal government to present us with some options we can fight for on behalf of local residents.I am pleased to say, because the Morrison government has made another commitment of $112 million to duplicate the Centenary Bridge, the work is progressing on that with the state government. I will certainly do everything in my power to make sure that we hold them to account. All of those funding commitments—the $112 for the Centenary Bridge; the $10 million for the Metroad 5; the $12.5 million for Kenmore and the $50 million for Indooroopilly—add up to hundreds of millions of dollars that I have fought for and have secured and that the Morrison government has provided in just the last few years, since I was elected in 2019. It shows what can be achieved when local members work together. Im proud to say that I worked together with my LNP colleagues at the state and local government level to help fix local roads and help reduce congestion for local residents.Were also contributing to a significant project: the Gresham Street upgrade. To all those residents in The Gap, dont worry. Although a lot of that previous funding has gone to the western suburbs corridor, there is plenty of funding for residents at The Gap and elsewhere in the electorate, including for the Gresham Street Bridge. I know that community has been waiting on that for a long time. The Brisbane City Council is getting it underway, because of funding from the federal government. And were fixing other black spots like that, at the entrance of St Lucia, which is a key local safety upgrade.While I still have time I want to mention that the electorate of Ryan is home to the Gallipoli Barracks in Enoggera, so we have a fantastic veteran community. Many soldiers, after they retire from the forces, continue to call the local electorate of Ryan their home, and our community is all the better for it. Im always conscious of delivering funding and services for our veteran community. That includes significant funding that has come from the Morrison government saluting their service grants. One, in particular, has funded a project for the Royal Australian Regiment Corp to assist and restore the forecourt of the Contemplation Building and the RARC National Memorial Walk, which is a very, very important project.Another for the Moggill Historical Society has been used to publish important biographies of those locals who served in the Second World War. Ive spoken to them about that and seen some of their fantastic historical work that they are undertaking. Its great to see that preserved in print for the long term.Weve also got $100,000 in federal funding from the recent budget and appropriations bills that is going to go to a brand-new Australian cadet unit, the first ever at Brookfield, which is being supported by the fantastic team at the Kenmore Moggill RSL. I was very pleased to get behind this project and secure this funding. The values that a cadet unit instils in our young Australians are so very important in this world, where you can otherwise get lost in social media and a very selfish society from time to time. The commitment to serve that the cadet unit instils in our young women and men is to be applauded. Im very pleased to support it and these appropriations bills more generally.","Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2020-2021, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2020-2021","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr SIMMONDS (Ryan) ","(18:05):"
217,0,0,0,1,1,"Hayes, Chris, MP","ECV","Fowler","ALP","N/A",2996," Id also like to make a contribution to this cognate debate today on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2020-2021 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2020-2021. Have we ever seen a government that has spent so much to achieve so little? At a time when people are grappling with the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, Australians need and deserve more—far more than what theyre getting from this government. People need a vision for the future, a vision for jobs and a plan to kickstart our economy and get us through this recession. However, what were seeing beyond this governments spin, photo opportunities and headlines is a trillion dollars of debt and not much to show for it.Madam Deputy Speaker Vamvakinou, I invite you to have a think. When was the last time you heard those opposite say anything about debt and deficit? It seems to have gone off the agenda, and it will be off the agenda for the next 30 years. Thats not to say that investing was not the right thing to do, but when Labor had to invest during the global financial crisis what was the position on that side? The position was, Lets wait to see how bad it gets. Those were almost the exact words of the then shadow Treasurer. They werent going to expend on it. Then they spent the next seven years talking about debt and deficit. Those opposite should wake up and think about the country for a change as opposed to their own political skins.The reality is that there are too many Australians being left behind. Theyre being left behind by the cuts to JobSeeker that the government plans to make at the end of the month. We will have one million Australians still looking for work. We are seeing a failure in business to invest, with business confidence being shaken, and a failure to invest in actual job creation programs and the creation of aged-care and childcare opportunities. What is really important in a situation like this is investment in social housing. This is what the nation needs—a government that understands community, but more importantly a government that puts the needs of the community ahead of its own political welfare, a government that is focused on the national interest and a government that understands that lives and livelihoods have, quite frankly, been destroyed through this pandemic.What the nation doesnt need is a government that has been riddled with—I hesitate to use the term corruption, but think of the safer community grants, the sports grants, and the distribution of some of those community grants all being linked to either marginal seats or seats which are being targeted. Many on this side have thought, That should be one of the reasons we should have a national integrity system—one which has been talked about by this side and by the Independents. We understand there is some report floating around, but it hasnt reached reality yet. This is what has occurred in terms of the distribution of grants. Im not going to go out and point the finger over issues of corruption, but where were disputing public money it must be done in a fair and transparent way. Time and time again we have seen people try to justify the distribution of this money, saying it was very much needed in those marginal Liberal seats. Lets bring on a national integrity system, for the benefit of the public, to ensure that their money is being spent well.We have a government that, quite frankly, has missed an opportunity to help rebuild this economy and develop a plan for the future of our country that delivers stronger, fairer, more-secure jobs and one that is focused on the future of all Australians—an inclusive future for Australians. It is beyond doubt that our economy was struggling before the pandemic. We had casualisation of the workforce, underemployment was at a record high, we had stagnant wages and we had slow growth and low business investment. They were the economic indicators before the pandemic. It shows that theres a long way to go. Obviously the government didnt bring about the pandemic, and I stand by the comments Ive made before: I think the government has handled the pandemic well. Im not quite as sure about the rollout of the vaccines, but it has handled the pandemic in a very responsible way. That doesnt take away from the fact that the government has got to address those economic indicators that, as I just suggested, were in operation prior to the impact of this pandemic.Rather than addressing the systematic problems that we have and that have only been heightened by the pandemic, this government has introduced short-term policy that gets it through to the next election rather than policy that is of long-term transformational benefit to the economy and to the nation. With the support due to stop at the end of this month, it is vital that the government put in place a plan to tackle the current jobs crisis, particularly for the two million Australians who are searching for work or for additional hours. Treasury estimates that 100,000 Australians may lose their jobs when JobKeeper is abolished. To put that in perspective, in my electorate alone it is estimated that 2,300 businesses will be directly affected. That accounts for more then 7,000 workers who will be impacted. Further, recently released data reveals that Fowler will be the third-worst affected area in the nation under the Morrison governments proposed cuts to job support.The end of JobSeeker payments will see a devastating impact on my community, which is already over-represented in disadvantage. As Ive spoken about many times in this House, Fowler is, regrettably, one of the most disadvantage-affected electorates, certainly based on the ABS statistics, when applying the Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas data. While Im very proud of my community—the colour and the vibrancy that its diversity delivers—sadly, my community is not wealthy. We are over-represented in disadvantage. To put a figure on it, for those opposite, the average household income in my community is just a little over $60,000—that is household income. So, withdrawing the JobSeeker payments, the coronavirus supplement and JobKeeper directly impacts in such a vicious way in my community. The last months data that was released by the Department of Social Services also details the added strain that the removal of JobKeeper payments will have on my community. The Guardian Australia found that the hardest-hit areas will be the working-class suburbs and regional communities. In that analysis, Fowler was ranked as the third-most affected area, losing up to $3½ million per fortnight.For many, this support has been a lifeline. The removal of the remaining coronavirus supplement at the end of the month will only further add to the hardship. The removal of support at such a critical time for Australians is, quite frankly, a national shame. We have people who are struggling to keep a roof over their head and put basic food on the table, and yet weve got a government that thinks an increase of $50 a fortnight to the Newstart rate simply does the job. Well, I tell those opposite that this increase is not sufficient and it is an insult to those people who are facing the difficulty of getting by on a day-to-day basis.The government also fails to provide adequate support for families struggling with the cost of child care. Australians are paying some of the highest childcare fees in the world at the moment, with childcare fees increasing by 35 per cent under this governments watch. Unfortunately, this has resulted in many families having to choose between working for nothing and staying at home. Families are being locked out of the system because they simply cant afford it. The issue is raised regularly with me—and with probably every member here—by local parents. Making child care more affordable is not only important for families but also important and good for our economy. It is for this reason that Labor, business economists and experts have all been calling for urgent childcare reform. This reform is important now more than ever as we work our way out of the pandemic, with many parents having to adjust to reduced income and stressed employment opportunities.Lets not forget the governments involvement in the current aged-care crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic has certainly exposed vulnerabilities in our aged-care system, where we have regrettably seen more than 670 tragic deaths. Remember what the interim report from the aged-care royal commission was called, the royal commission that the government was taken, kicking and screaming, to hold. The interim report was titled Neglect. The final report, only recently handed down by the commission, which made 148 recommendations, has found that our system of aged care fails to meet the needs of the most vulnerable elderly Australians. The commission has also expressed the need for fundamental change in our aged-care sector. While its pleasing that the government actually did make an immediate response and injected money into the system as a consequence of the recommendations, we must remember that this is the same government, the same mob, who, over the last eight years, relentlessly attacked the aged-care sector, making several significant cuts, leaving the aged-care system in crisis. It was the Liberal government that ignored the warnings of over 20 major reports and proceeded to rip $1.7 billion out of aged care simply to prop up failing budgets. Too many Australians have suffered after years of neglect. It must be getting hard to put trust in the government that says its going to fix aged care but has taken step upon step along the way to do the exact opposite. What should be bipartisan here is that our elderly and vulnerable must be afforded the respect, care and dignity that they deserve and a system that caters for that.I often speak about homelessness and housing affordability across the nation, particularly in my area. In my area, it is certainly something where we have, as I said earlier, an overrepresentation of disadvantage. Notably, we are one of the highest recipients of refugees in the nation. Research conducted by the University of New South Wales under the Everybodys Home campaign shows that 44 per cent of households in Fowler are living with rental stress. The research found that there are also 1,700 people experiencing homelessness in Fowler and an additional 5½ thousand social housing properties are in critical shortfall. That has young people couch surfing, people living in cars and all that sort of thing. And this is happening under our watch in a modern society. The pandemic has only exacerbated the issue in my community and indeed across the nation but, unfortunately, this area doesnt seem to be deserving of the attention of those opposite. To this end, Id like to thank the incredible organisations that work so hard to help people in such desperate need. One of those is Tracy Phillips and Bonnie Support Services, which has seen increased demand during the pandemic for emergency accommodation, largely stemming from domestic violence matters, which unfortunately escalated during the pandemic. We also take the opportunity to call on the government to invest in social housing, which we know on this side can be a powerhouse for lifting the economic growth and the creation of jobs in the country.","Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2020-2021, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2020-2021","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr HAYES (Fowler—Chief Opposition Whip) ","(18:20):"
218,0,0,0,1,1,"Bell, Angie, MP",282981,"Moncrieff","LNP","N/A",2999," I find it very interesting that the member for Fowler took this opportunity in this debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2020-2021 to bring up Labors response to the GFC, allowing me to actually highlight or at least look at the differences between how Labor responded to a crisis and how the LNP government responded to a crisis. We all remember that what we got under the Labor government was the pink batts debacle. That was pretty much the response from those on the other side. I like the member for Fowler. Its great to see the member for Fowler here in the House. I respect the member very much and its good to see you well again, Member for Fowler. Hes a terrific fellow and I enjoy his company but on this particular thing we disagree. Our government actually invested $250 billion in jobs and here we are, 11 months later, with an unemployment rate that is at 5.8 per cent. I think that that money was well worth it. The debt that we currently face was necessary to keep our country going, and thats what our government has done—kept our country going. The member for Fowler talked about a short-term policy for a short-term what, crisis? Indeed, JobKeeper, as we know, was a short-term policy arrangement in response to twin crises—the economic and health crises that we have been facing—and it is our government, the Morrison government, that has held together businesses, certainly in my electorate of Moncrieff.This debate on the appropriations bill gives me the opportunity to talk about some of those programs that I wouldnt otherwise get to talk about that are underway on the Gold Coast. So I will take this opportunity to tell Australians, including those in my electorate, the sorts of things that weve been doing. I will start with the obvious one—that is, of course, tourism on the Gold Coast, which was about a $5 billion industry across the Gold Coast and provided one in six jobs before coronavirus hit. The Moncrieff tourism businesses and the many businesses that benefit from the tourists spend have made it clear to the government over the last five or six weeks that the best assistance they could have would be tourists back through their doors, and thats what we delivered with the $1.2 billion tourism package announced just last week. It may have been the week before—the weeks are blending into each other here this month. We announced that when we were up at Currumbin sanctuary up on the Gold Coast, where we outlined the support package for tourism businesses to get tourists back through the doors—that was around about 800,000 tickets at half price that the government is supporting to help the tourism sector get on its feet.The Gold Coast has been dramatically affected by that announcement. We have already seen uplift. We have seen the Gold Coast and Cairns neck and neck for the most googled destination across the country, and there were 14 other destinations that were also supported through that package. Our economy has recovered 85 per cent of its fall from COVID-19, but many are still doing it tough, and we know that those tourism and events operators, particularly on the Gold Coast, are doing it tough. Things are a little bit easier now that some of the measures put in place by the state government have been lifted and we have a little bit more certainty around the borders. Of course, thats the certainty that we need with this tourism and aviation package. We managed, as I said, to get the unemployment rate back to five per cent. That meant, in February, there were 88,700 new jobs. That puts us back to the figure that we were at 11 months ago, which is that 13 million Australians are now in jobs. Thats definitely something to be celebrated—an absolutely fantastic result for our economy.Getting back to the tourism package: as I said, there were 800,000 half-priced airline tickets. There were some changes to affordable loans for small to medium enterprises. There are about 32,000 small businesses in my electorate alone. Many of them rely on the tourism sector—the cafes, the restaurants, the accommodation providers. Many tourism operators, mum-and-dad businesses that we have been supporting through JobKeeper, will now have people coming through their front doors and booking tours, which is fantastic news.This direct support is to keep planes flying and airline workers in their jobs. The Morrison government is backing Gold Coast tourism businesses by getting tourists back on the planes, with tickets discounted by 50 per cent, and knocking on the front doors of the tourism operators. The half-priced tickets will be available on airline websites from 1 April. Its very exciting to get those bookings online so that we can have more people travelling around the country to those 15 destinations.This support package includes new international aviation support to help Australias two international passenger airlines. Without airlines we dont have a tourism sector, so Im sure everybody in this chamber would agree thats a very important measure. That will maintain more than 8,000 core international aviation jobs. Its very important that we keep those jobs in place so that we can fly around the country and, when the international borders open up, we can fly around the world. So support for regular passenger airports to meet their domestic security screening costs is really important.A new Aviation Services Assistance Support Program will help ground-handling companies meet the costs of mandatory training, certification and accreditation to ensure they maintain their workforces so they can stand them back up when the market expands again and the borders open up. The domestic aviation security screening charges rebate will be reinstated for more than 50 regular passenger airports. Thats 50 airports around the country that are so important to jobs and so important not just to domestic tourism but to international tourism as well, when that comes back.Many businesses in Moncrieff have graduated from the JobKeeper program. At its peak, I had 10,500 businesses on JobKeeper in Moncrieff, and most of my colleagues seem to have around 5,000 businesses in their electorates on JobKeeper. In Moncrieff it was quite a large number, about 30 per cent of all businesses across my electorate. So JobKeeper has been very important to the local economy on the central Gold Coast, and businesses thank me. Every time I go to an event in my electorate—a chamber event, a tourism event, a timeshare event—people thank the federal government publicly for what we have done to keep their businesses running. Some businesses still need that bridge, so we are backing businesses that are prepared to back themselves. Thats what we do on the Gold Coast. With the SME Recovery Loan Scheme, businesses can borrow money—some skin in the game. Thats what we do on the Gold Coast; the entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well. The government will expand and extend its SME loan guarantee scheme as part of its commitment to support up to $40 billion in lending to small and medium enterprises. Under the existing scheme more than 35,000 loans, worth more than $3 billion, have already been provided to SMEs, helping thousands of small businesses get to the other side of this pandemic. And thats whats important—that bridge to the other side. Were coming out of that now, with the unemployment rate having dropped down to 5.8 per cent and more people in jobs in February. The SME Recovery Loan Scheme will also now provide an increased government guarantee, increasing from the current 50-50 split between the government and the banks to an 80-20 split. This will encourage more banks to support small business, and demonstrates the governments commitment to back those businesses that are prepared to back themselves.The expanded scheme will also increase the size of eligible loans. They will increase from $1 million, under the current scheme, to $5 million. That will allow businesses to borrow more money. Businesses with a higher turnover will also benefit under the expanded scheme, with the maximum eligible turnover increased from $50 million to $250 million. So were expanding those measures as JobKeeper steps down, as it inevitably must.Maximum loan terms under the expanded scheme will also increase from five years to 10 years, providing businesses and lenders with greater flexibility. The expanded scheme will also allow lenders to offer borrowers a repayment holiday of up to 24 months. Again, that is to help businesses in that period so they can build their business, get back on their feet and move forward to the very bright future we have for our economy in this country.Importantly, the scheme will enable eligible businesses to refinance their existing loans, which is a new measure weve added. This will allow SMEs to access the more concessional interest rates available under the program and to better manage their cash flow through an extended loan term and lower combined repayments. So the Morrison government really does know how to support businesses to protect and create jobs, and that stands in that 5.8 per cent unemployment figure. That is what the government is being judged on by the Australian people and that is what we have delivered just this month.Also, the Morrison governments boosting apprenticeships subsidy is being expanded. It has already helped create 100,000 new apprenticeships in only five months. Im pleased to report to the House that 900 of those are in Moncrieff. Its very exciting for the good people of Moncrieff to know that there have been 100,000 new apprenticeships in just the past five months. The government is removing the cap on places, providing a full 12 months of support for employers who engage an apprentice or a trainee between 5 October 2020 and 30 September 2021. The governments investment in the program is $2.4 billion, which is quite a large investment in that program.The program expansion will support hundreds more apprenticeships in Moncrieff, and I look forward to seeing those apprentices around my electorate. I know we need more apprentice motor mechanics, so I will do a bit of a shout-out to those young people in Moncrieff looking for an apprenticeship. There are opportunities all over Moncrieff for motor mechanics. I encourage them to retrain now. Its a great time to move into an apprenticeship. A good example of the success of the boosting apprenticeships subsidy is Patriot Campers in Molendinar in my electorate. They have added two apprentices.The upskilled educated workforce Australia needs comes from STEM opportunities for Australian women. Up to 600 Australian women will be encouraged to study science, technology, engineering and maths while theyre working, as part of the expansion of the Morrison governments Women in STEM Cadetships and Advanced Apprenticeships Program. There are many programs that the Australian people havent heard about. Mainly we hear about JobKeeper, JobSeeker, the supplement, JobMaker and JobTrainer. We dont hear about some of these other programs the government has in place, particularly this one. A total of 37 STEM courses were approved in the recent application round, including an associate degree of engineering; a diploma of applied data science; an advanced diploma of cybersecurity, which is a very relevant one; a diploma of science; and an associate degree in agribusiness, which is really important for the regions.We have very many businesswomen in Moncrieff. Early Risers comes to mind. Thats an organisation in Moncrieff that has been engaging with me regarding the Boosting Female Founders Initiative. I was at a breakfast function close to International Womens Day. There were very many women there very excited about the Boosting Female Founders Initiative. The Morrison government is supporting entrepreneurial women to build their businesses, to take on global markets and to create local jobs—and we want to see local jobs—with the opening of a new $11.6 million funding round for the initiative. I encourage women to take up this opportunity. Grants of between $25,000 and $400,000 are available to Australian startup businesses that are majority owned and led by women. This is $52.2 million of competitive grant funding, plus $1.8 million in mentoring services.With many different programs at the federal level, constituents rightly wish to know how that translates to their local area. There are very many good examples of the Morrison government delivering for the good people of Moncrieff. There are too many to mention them all, but they include school programs. I have very many beautiful schools in Moncrieff, and I enjoy going to visit all of them. We also have local community fund grants that have been delivered to very many organisations across Moncrieff. I thank the community for the good work that they do to build stronger communities and for sticking together during this COVID-19 health and economic crisis that we have all been through and for the great work that those organisations do to hold everything together across the community. Its very much appreciated.","Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2020-2021, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2020-2021","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms BELL (Moncrieff) ","(18:35):"
219,0,0,0,1,1,"Aly, Anne, MP",13050,"Cowan","ALP","N/A",3002," Once again I get to stand up and talk about my home state of WA. Often when I speak of WA I like to remind people that WA does not stand for wait awhile but in fact stands for way ahead. After the resounding win by the McGowan government in the WA state election Im beginning to think that those on the other side think WA stands for Where are ya? Get it?Im not one to overegg the results of the state election, and I said so on the night of the state election as well. But I do believe its a resounding success that, as I mentioned, the Mark McGowan government has basically decimated the WA Liberals, who now hold just two seats. Its an unprecedented success and, I might add also, a very well-earned success by the McGowan government. I do think that the results of the WA state election should, at the very least, be a wake-up call that voters in WA cant and will not be taken for granted by the federal Liberal-National government.It has been 22 months since the Prime Minister stepped foot in Western Australia, and that goes well beyond the duration of WAs closed border regime. There is absolutely no excuse for it. There is no excuse for it because the Leader of the Opposition, Anthony Albanese, managed to visit Western Australia during the state election campaign, but the Prime Minister was nowhere to be seen. While I was out there speaking to people during the election campaign and doing my regular weekly meetings in parks around Cowan, it was noticed. It was noticed by a lot of people in Western Australia, who felt that the Prime Minister had left Western Australia behind and completely forgotten about Western Australians. Premier Mark McGowan even publicly invited the Prime Minister to visit, and yet the Prime Minister did not take up that invitation. He did not visit Western Australia during the state election and, as I mentioned, hasnt even bothered to set foot in Western Australia for 22 months. Twenty-two months—its crazy, right?As many in my home state of Western Australia are well aware, we are currently looking at and waiting for the government to make a long overdue decision on the full-cycle docking submarine maintenance program. This is a very big talking point in Western Australia, as you would know, Deputy Speaker Goodenough, coming from Western Australia yourself. The decision on the submarine maintenance program was scheduled to be announced early last year, but we are yet to hear from the government or the Prime Minister about what that decision will be. Its a year later, and Western Australians are still waiting. We dont even have a basic time line so that we know when we could even expect a decision. Now were being told that there are suggestions coming from the government that the decision will be pushed back until the next federal election. So, Western Australians, you can wait a while longer. Premier McGowan put it this way. He said, It is incomprehensible—that was the word he used—that the Commonwealth government continues to delay this decision. Western Australians are waiting. Theyre waiting for their jobs to start. Theyre waiting for a program to start thats going to bring investment to Western Australia. Western Australia is the best placed state to undertake the full docking submarine maintenance program given that the submarine fleet is already based in Western Australia. We have the workforce and the industry expertise to do that work. Its a no-brainer. It is absolutely a no brainer that Western Australia should be doing this work, that the contract should be awarded to Western Australians creating Western Australian jobs. The delays are particularly disappointing given that the minister responsible, Senator Reynolds, is from Western Australia. In fact, many of the senior people in this government are from Western Australia but seem to be letting WA down time and time again with their indecision and their inability or unwillingness to stand up for their own home state.We saw that most recently with the backing by this government of Clive Palmers contest over the opening of the WA border. One of the reasons that Labor was re-elected at the state level, and with such an unprecedented level of success in the recent state election, is that people in WA knew and understood exactly what this government was doing when it backed in Clive Palmers High Court challenge of the WA state border. The voters in Western Australia wont quickly forget this. I know that members of the government like to downplay their support for Clive Palmer and the push to open the borders. They want us to forget that embarrassing moment in time but Western Australians wont forget. They wont forget that this Prime Minister defended—defended—the Commonwealths decision to join Mr Palmers action. They actively joined the action by Clive Palmer to bring down the WA border. At the time the Prime Minister said:… it is highly likely that the constitutional position that is being reviewed in this case will not fall in the Western Australian Governments favour.Well, luckily Mark McGowan didnt listen to the Prime Minister and continued the fight against Clive Palmer, who was backed by the Prime Minister and backed by the Attorney-General.A few weeks ago the High Court published its reasons for its decision to allow Western Australias hard border to remain. It found that Western Australias border was justified to prevent a potentially catastrophic event. Every single Western Australian is grateful. Those who visit our great state are in awe of the fact that we have come through this pandemic relatively unscathed due to the actions, the strength and the determination of our Premier and of our state Labor team.What did the Prime Minister do when Labor resoundingly won the WA state election, decimating the WA Liberal Party to just two sitting members? I am not here to gloat about that. I do feel for those people who have lost their seats, and I have said so publicly. However, the hubris of this Prime Minister claiming responsibility for it, claiming that the WA state Labor governments success was because of him, I find quite astounding really. Its quite laughable, isnt it, that the Prime Minister should claim that the win by Mark McGowan and the WA state Labor team was all because of him? Ive got to tell you, Deputy Speaker, many Western Australians actually agreed with him. The ones that I have spoken to have agreed, arguing that it was in fact the very fact that the Prime Minister stayed away from WA that helped the Labor victory. Its quite an extraordinary thing for the Prime Minister to claim that a victory by a WA state Labor government is all because of his actions.In the short time I have left, I do want to talk about the looming end to JobKeeper. In just a few days, JobKeeper will cease. Ive been contacted by several small businesses. Its the small and medium-sized enterprises that are particularly worried and concerned about the looming cliff they face when JobKeeper ends. These are businesses that have really been left behind. JobKeeper allowed them to continue to just keep treading water or to just keep their heads above water over this period. Because of the end of JobKeeper, they are now facing the very real impact and the real prospect of having to close their doors entirely and let go of employees that theyve had for years—some for a couple of decades. Along with the end of JobKeeper, were going to see a huge rise in unemployment as these jobs go, particularly, as I mentioned, in small and medium-sized enterprises. For example, Ive got tourism operators and travel agents in my electorate who were already left behind, quite frankly, by this government and who are now feeling the sting of this governments actions even more acutely. They are not looking forward to next month. People on JobSeeker are also not looking forward to next month. In WA, weve got rising rents. Prior to COVID, in the outer suburbs particularly, we already had higher rents, lower house prices and a really high level of mortgage stress, as well as unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, in suburbs like Wanneroo and Girraween.Western Australia has come out of this largely unscathed, and weve done extremely well economically. But there are industries and small businesses in Western Australia that have relied on JobKeeper, and there are individuals who have needed to, and will continue to need to, rely on JobSeeker. After JobKeeper ends and when JobSeeker goes back to what it was prior to the pandemic with the paltry addition of $3.50 a day, these people are going to be left on the scrap heap, particularly women over the age of 50 who have lost their jobs. Some of them have worked for two to three decades at the same firm or the same small business. Having lost their jobs, they are facing a very bleak future. They are unable to find work. There are no incentives for other companies to hire them. They know that they have talent, skills and experience, but they are desperately wondering whats going to happen to them when JobSeeker and JobKeeper end—when JobKeeper is ripped away from all of these businesses and they have to close their doors, when people have to start repaying their mortgages, and when the moratorium on rent is removed. The real pain of this pandemic, apart from the physical and health pain, is really going to be felt economically over the next few months, as this artificial bubble that we have bursts. I dont really see a vision from this government of how theyre going to help all of those Australians who are going to be left in a dire situation come the end of JobKeeper and the JobSeeker supplement. I really dont see anything thats going to give any hope for the future to those women over 50 who are facing unemployment and those small family businesses owners who have poured their heart and soul into their businesses and will have to close their doors. Caterers, tourism operators, small business operators, and small to medium-sized restaurants and cafes: all of them are going to have to close their doors after JobKeeper has been ripped out. What an insult to them, when they read that some of the big businesses have had millions and millions of dollars worth of JobKeeper and paid that out in bonuses. The response from this government has been, Well, good on them!I love my state of Western Australia, as I know you do, Mr Deputy Speaker Goodenough. We arent wait a while; we are way ahead and we will continue to be, with the strong local leadership of the Mark McGowan government. But Western Australians dont deserve to be left behind by this government, and theyll remember that. Theyll remember what this government and this Prime Minister didnt do for them come the next election.","Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2020-2021, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2020-2021","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr ALY (Cowan) ","(18:50):"
220,0,0,0,1,1,"Stevens, James, MP",176304,"Sturt","LP","N/A",3005," I rise to speak in support of Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2020-2021. Id like to start by reflecting on some of the macro commitments made through these appropriations to our economy more broadly and then perhaps zip down into some of the projects that I am very proud to be working on with cabinet colleagues of mine in the Morrison government to deliver in my electorate of Sturt.Firstly, a lot of speakers, including the previous speaker, have been talking about some of the programs that have been put in place as part of the economic response needed to the coronavirus pandemic that struck this country a little over 12 months ago. In particular, of course, there were the JobKeeper and the JobSeeker policies and the other supplementary payments that were made—other economic support payments, like what we did in child care and in so many different areas where we needed to undertake a significant economic response to the economic challenges of ensuring that we protected the health of Australians. Unfortunately, that meant needing to make some difficult but important decisions to hibernate elements of our economy whilst we protected all Australians, but particularly vulnerable Australians, from the risk of the coronavirus pandemic taking off in this country like it did in so many other parts of the world—in fact, in almost every other part of the world.For everything else said about this time in history, it will be remembered for decades and centuries to come. I think about the performance of this country—not just of the government but of the people of Australia—in protecting our health and the risks by all coming together and accepting the very significant and difficult decisions that needed to be made in order to protect our health. There was the economic impact of that and the fact that everyone needed to work together to agree to follow the directions of Commonwealth, state and territory agencies and the fact that almost all Australians—and in my state of South Australia I would say it was every South Australian—understood and supported this, and came together in this time of crisis. It saw some of the greatest elements of the Australian character on display.Obviously, though, in doing so, at the Commonwealth level we needed to undertake a very significant economic response to ensure that we were supporting the people, businesses and families of Australia. Many of them were put under enormous economic stress and hardship, with many businesses at risk of closing permanently and many employees at risk of being told by their employer, The situation is unpredictable and dire and I have no confidence in the future so I have to make the decision to lay you off; theres too much uncertainty for us and were making that decision now. I think that the JobKeeper program, announced soon after the early responses, such as the closing of the international border, that were made in March last year, will go down as one of the greatest examples of protecting jobs in the history of this country—and of any country, frankly. It compares as an exemplar against the types of responses put in place around the world and in previous examples, where governments havent taken action to put a floor underneath jobs, effectively saying to businesses, Were taking your payroll onto our balance sheet. To have the cooperation of the employer class with the employees of Australia so that program could be rolled out is one of the great stories of economic salvation and it has driven economic success.We only need to look at the unemployment statistics released by the ABS last week to see, beyond our wildest dreams, how amazing the rebound has been for employment, particularly for some categories that we had the highest concern about—female employees, who were disproportionately affected by some of those economic shutdowns, and young people. And of course in this budget weve had some very specific measures to support young people back into the employment market. We know from the experience of previous recessions, particularly Labors recession—the Keating recession—that young people, when theyre unemployed, can take the longest to get back into employment, as well as some of the social challenges and the dislocation from a future that entrenched, long-term unemployment brings for young people. Avoiding that is something we saw as one of the highest priorities.Im very proud to be part of a government that has done this. In my electorate, for example, around 3,200 businesses and organisations accessed the JobKeeper program, and obviously there was the JobSeeker increase and the supplementary payments that were put in place—the $750 one and the $250 one. More than 40,000 people in my electorate were eligible to access these payments in their first rounds and a little over 30,000 people in the subsequent rounds. Most electorates would have very similar statistics, as all our electorates have about the same number of electors. There was no part of the country that was particularly less affected or more affected by these economic decisions. So I suspect that every member of this House has similar stories of what a spectacular amount of support was put in place, at that level of percentage of people who accessed support, thanks to the decisions we made.In these appropriations we have some important industry commitments. In particular, as a South Australian Im very passionate about what were doing in defence industry. Weve of course got the programs for the submarines and the frigates, which are both thankfully being constructed in Adelaide. Weve got the Osborne South shipyard. I had the pleasure of being out there for BAEs first cutting of prototype steel, just before Christmas. That shipyard is an unbelievable asset that is being built by Australian naval infrastructure by the government to build nine frigates, and we intend many more surface vessels into the future. Amazingly, that will be dwarfed by the Osborne North shipyard, which is in the early stages of construction now, where the 12 Attack-class submarines will be built for the Royal Australian Navy—tens of billions of dollars of economic activity in my home state, creating thousands and thousands of new jobs for decades to come.With those two programs, along with other investments in defence industry that are happening at the Edinburgh RAAF base—and of course weve got the Woomera test range in South Australia—we are the defence state; we are the defence industry state. This is the government that is making enormous commitments to the future of defence industry across the country, particularly in my home state of South Australia and my home city of Adelaide.Allied to defence, of course, are industries like the space sector and the cyber sector. Im very proud that Adelaide was chosen to be the home of the Australian Space Agency. That agency is now open and operating at the Lot Fourteen site, the old Royal Adelaide Hospital site, just on the boundary of my electorate of Sturt. Whilst we appreciate that Commonwealth commitment, which is about a $40 million commitment across the establishment and recurrent expenditure in the first years of that agency, the most important thing about it is that Adelaide is going to be the natural home for space industry development in this country. It is an industry that has infinite capability here and across the planet as a growth industry. It will be tens of billions of dollars and tens of thousands of jobs. And I have to confess that I hope the lions share of those jobs are in my home city of Adelaide. Many of the people who are already working in that sector live in my electorate of Sturt.Were also funding the Cooperative Research Centre for Smart Satellite Technologies and Analytics, which is an industry partnership with the University of South Australia. This is a $250 million program across the various private sector, government and tertiary institutions that are involved in that collaboration. The smart satellite CRC project will see enormous additional industry development in the satellite and general space sectors in South Australia, and in cybersecurity.In cybersecurity there are enormous investments being made, again, in Adelaide. Weve got the A3C, the Australian Cyber Collaboration Centre, which happens to be also located just adjacent to my electorate, at Lot Fourteen precinct. Theyve got an impressive cyber range, which I think is certainly the largest in the country and probably the largest in the Southern Hemisphere. These are all really exciting examples of the future that my electorate of Sturt, the city of Adelaide and our nation has in these vital future industries. These are the growth driver industries: the defence industry, the space industry, the cyber industry and the creative industries. No-one would say theres not a huge future for these industries to grow employment opportunities into the future, and Im very grateful for the decisions, the policies and the investments in this budget that are going into those industry sectors. Of course, weve got other industry investment through the Modern Manufacturing Fund, which picks up on some of those that Ive mentioned already, like defence and space, but also med tech, agriculture, so on and so forth. I hope to see some of that expenditure come to my electorate.In the final few minutes, I just want to quickly touch on a few local projects. Im very grateful to have three urban congestion-busting infrastructure projects in my electorate of Sturt, including the Magill Road and Portrush Road intersection upgrade and the Glen Osmond Road and Fullarton Road intersection upgrade. The third is actually on my boundary with the seats of Boothby and Adelaide. These are all bottlenecks and theyre all excellent examples of two great governments—the state and federal Liberal governments—working together to deliver practical benefits to the lives of the people of Sturt and the people of Australia.The Magill and Portrush one, in particular, which is the largest at $98 million—a joint fifty-fifty investment between the Commonwealth government and the state government—is right in the heart of my electorate. In all the data, that is seen as one of the great bottlenecks in metropolitan Adelaide, with 65,000 vehicles travelling through it each and every day. Portrush Road is, of course, Highway 1. Weve got lots of heavy freight that comes through my electorate. Weve got schools all along the route. Weve got, of course, commuter traffic. The Magill Road, which is the other road at the intersection, carries a lot of cement from the quarry in the Adelaide Hills, as well, of course, as commuter traffic. So that one in particular Im very excited about. I know that in the next couple of weeks were going to be on-site announcing a successful tenderer. That project is well underway already, but it will be exciting to see some of the early outcomes of that project, which is really going to transform the traffic flow and the experience of families and businesses in that area.Im also very proud of the money were committing to the Magill Village Project, and I was very pleased to hear today that the state government, through their stimulus fund, are providing the final funds to complete the entirety of that project. Thats a great local project for the people along Magill Road, through Magill, Tranmere, Kensington Gardens, Kensington Park and right down to near my electorate office at St Morris. Its going to be great to have the Magill Village. Weve already undergrounded the powerlines there, but the streetscaping, the tree planting and the traffic softening is going to make that a really vibrant place for families to go and get a coffee, to enjoy pre- and post-recreation activities. Its going to be a great boost to the small businesses and the economy of that area. I cant wait to see that project, hopefully in the next 12 months, come into fruition.For the Max Amber Sportsfield, where weve committed $5 million towards the $10 million project, jointly with the Campbelltown council, demolition has occurred on the old clubrooms there. That, again, is going to be a fantastic outcome for local sporting infrastructure. Were going to see an excellent facility for the existing football and cricket clubs, but were creating a new netball club, which Im really excited about. Of course, the facility is going to have appropriate female change rooms—not just for the new netball club; for womens cricket and football were going to have the sort of facility that female participants deserve. Its also going to see an excellent upgrade to an important piece of local sporting infrastructure there at Max Amber.The final one I want to mention is the Kensington Gardens Reserve, where weve put $3 million. Again, just recently, the state has tipped in a bit extra on top of what weve put in—the Burnside council. That is going to be a great environmental outcome for that site. Were getting rid of the dangerous polluted duck pond and creating a nice wetland instead that wont need to be fenced off as children wont be at risk of drowning anymore. It happens to have a unique connection, given that its adjacent to the Kensington District Cricket Club, famous, of course, for being Sir Donald Bradmans cricket club and being near the home that he lived in for so many decades in the heart of my electorate. Thats an exciting project that, again, is underway.These projects are all being funded in this budget because were committed to investing in local community infrastructure, local sporting infrastructure, local public amenity, and making sure that our neighbourhoods are safe and secure. Im so grateful to the Treasurer and the Morrison government for what were investing in my electorate of Sturt. I look forward to fighting for more funding in the future, and I know that people in my electorate are very grateful for what this budget is doing for them.","Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2020-2021, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2020-2021","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr STEVENS (Sturt) ","(19:05):"

I also support the amendments moved by the member for Kingsford Smith. I had hoped to speak this afternoon more on the resources portfolio, but Im going to spend a few moments reflecting on some of the reports weve seen in the media, just a couple of hours ago.After reports today of further debasement in this parliament of the women in this place and the workplace itself, I would not be surprised, quite honestly, if the women who work here, and particularly the staff, simply walk off the job and leave the men to the revolting mess of their own creation. What weve seen today in news reports is behaviour that beggars belief. Its disgusting. Were all tarnished by this behaviour—all the very decent, hardworking, honest, good people who are elected here or who work here, whether they be our staff, as members and senators, or the support staff that make sure we can do our job. We all, because we work here in what should be a magnificent place, are tarnished by the behaviour that weve seen reported in previous weeks and again tonight. Its a shocking indictment on this place. As I said, were all tarnished by this vile behaviour, and perhaps we should be. Weve allowed this behaviour to go on for decades—not, perhaps, the individuals in this chamber right now, who havent all been here this long. But a culture has been allowed to pervade, and erupt in, this building which has seen the most vile, debased acts of the utmost arrogance and the utmost entitlement—acts of disrespect towards women and disrespect towards fellow humans in treating a workplace in this manner.Who would blame female staff in this place if they just walked out tomorrow and took some action to demonstrate just how debased this workplace has, clearly, become and the way some people choose to treat it? I know everyone in this chamber today would agree with me that what we have seen in news reports tonight is just the most horrific thing you could imagine. We all now get to walk around our offices and think: I wonder what happened before I got this office. What did happen in here? There might be a few red wine stains from time to time that are cleaned up well, but now we know there is much more going on than I ever imagined. Ive worked here for five years, and, before I was elected, I worked here as well. That this kind of thing was happening never entered my imagination. Call me naïve, and I probably am, but what I would say to the female staff and to all the staff is that Im sorry. To all the good, decent, hardworking people who are committed to their parties, to the policies we talk of and to the arguments we have civilly in this place, Im sorry for what youre all going through. I feel exhausted. Im sure many feel exhausted by it—obviously not as exhausted as the victims of sexual violence and domestic violence right across this nation. To all the women in this place who will be feeling even worse tonight than they would have felt just last week, I want to reassure you all that, as an elected member of parliament, all my colleagues and I are thinking of you finding yourselves in a vulnerable situation that we really would never want to see again.We all talk about this being a moment in time where the culture of this place may change. One hopes that if the culture of this place changes we can do some very good things right across the country where the systemic abuse of women and domestic violence can come to an end. If it cant start here and be successful here, I guess there is little hope for it happening across the nation. The people that work here, those that are elected here, are those elected leaders of the nation, and a lot of people who work here want to be elected as leaders of the nation. If this behaviour is to continue or to be seen again, what hope have we got for the nation that we seek to lead—if we cannot behave properly and with respect to every human that works in this place. To all the women and to all the good, honest men who are working hard to fix this as well: I thank you for your commitment, for sticking with us and for sticking with your work through this place. But, to be honest, if you did walk off the job tomorrow I certainly wouldnt blame you one little bit.As I said before, I came here tonight to speak about the resources industry. I was very proud to take on the resources portfolio in addition to the trade portfolio on behalf of the federal Labor opposition. I look forward to working with it into the future. I want to recognise my immediate predecessors in the resources role, the member for Chifley and the member for Hunter—both strong, energetic and practical supporters of a strong Australian mineral resources sector.I acknowledge the member for Burt, another proud Western Australian. As a proud Western Australian, Ive seen firsthand the impact a strong, successful—pardon me, and the chair and the member for OConnor is here as well—mining and resources industry can have on this country, which now accounts for half of Australias total exports and directly employs more than a quarter of a million people, many of them in regional areas.I suppose many of us in Western Australia sound a bit like a broken record when we describe the resources industry, but it is the engine room of the nations economy. I repeat it so often because its absolutely true. In my additional role as shadow minister for trade, as well as being the representative for an electorate known for its heavy industry, Ive been fortunate enough to witness some of Australias huge nation-building projects in the making. This includes the INPEX Ichthys LNG Project in Broome and its main facility in Darwin, Woodsides North West Shelf Project in Karratha and more recently the Pluto gas project in Dampier, Chevrons Gorgon Project on Barrow Island and, of course, the Wheatstone LNG project in Onslow. There are so many others that have made great job-creating contributions to this nation and that keep on keeping on.Its important that every Australian understands the value of the sector, not just to the broader Australian economy but to the hip pockets of the hundreds of thousands of workers across the country, and of course their families. When youre in the resources sector and youre a fly-in fly-out worker, which is often the case, your whole family is involved in that job because the worker isnt always there, so the family takes on an additional burden during those weeks away.My links with the mining industry began long before I was born. Its a history that I had some time to reflect on during a recent trip to Kalgoorlie in my new role as the shadow minister for resources. Its a family story. In the 1890s, following the sudden death of his wife, my great-great-grandfather Eli Pizer packed up four of his children and his life in Melbourne to join the luck of the gold rush in Kalgoorlie. Eli Pizer wasnt a miner, but he started a hansom cab service to move the lucky and the luckless around that great booming town. One of his sons, Thomas, my great grandfather, went on to provide the critical service of running the Clydesdale horses that hauled kegs of beer to the hotels that shot up during the greatest gold rush Australia has seen. These days if you go to Kalgoorlie—I know the member for OConnor represents the area—you will know, by the magnitude of the Super Pit goldmine and all the other activities there on the eastern border, that it feels like that rush never ended and will continue for some time.While I was there I went to the Kalgoorlie cemetery. After a bit of searching I found and visited the grave of my pioneering relative Eli Pizer and reflected on his story, which is a story shared by many Western Australians whose forebears left Melbourne and Victoria. They came from the goldfields of Victoria to the goldfields of Western Australia. Indeed, it was those Victorians that we can blame, or thank, for our Federation, because we know they changed the votes quite substantially. As a person whos very pleased that Western Australia is part of the Federation, I will always support it. That time and the contribution of the gold rush to the Federation was—Debate interrupted.","Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2020-2021, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2020-2021","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms MADELEINE KING (Brand) ","(19:20):"

Its the workplace of the minister and the shadow minister at the table and its the workplace of thousands of people, both men and women. But its also much more than a workplace. Its where schoolchildren come to learn about democracy and leadership. Its where my grade 6 niece came last week with her class, and where there are so many faces of young women just so excited and amazed that they could be here in the federal parliament. Its a place where people from all over Australia come to visit because its the home of government. We ask those visitors to show respect for parliamentary procedures, for the artwork, for the displays and for the magnificence of this building. Its a building that is open and welcomes Australians from right across our country, young and old, and visitors from overseas, because it represents our democracy.Our democracy is one that we are supposed to say and believe is for the people, by the people and of the people. Everything about this place, the way we behave in it and what we do in it, should represent and illuminate how precious democracy is. Yet, over the last few weeks, probably longer, people across Australia have come to see this building as a place where a young, vulnerable woman was raped and then was made to feel that she had to choose between justice and her job, where she was made to feel that the only reason her employers—the Liberal government—cared about what happened to her was because of the political implications, where she was called a lying cow. Theyve come to see this parliament as a place where the Prime Minister of Australia cant go out the front to listen to thousands and thousands of women rallying for their voices to be heard but says they can come to him—three or four of them—because hes busy or, perhaps, as one of the Liberal members suggested on the weekend, because all of those singing women were a security threat.But now, following a story on Channel 10 news just a few hours ago that made me feel sick and disgusted and so very, very sad and angry all at the same time, this building is a place, under this Prime Minister and this government, where it is, to quote Tom—the whistleblower featured on Channel 10 tonight—a culture of men who think they can do whatever they want, and has been so for years. How could anyone watch a video, no matter how pixelated, of a desk at their workplace being masturbated on and hear that that video was shared around and not feel sick to their stomach, let alone hear that it was deliberately done to a female MPs desk in some disgusting act of power and defilement because, be under no illusions, thats what it was—an act of power and defilement. That is not what the Australian parliament should be known for.I heard the Australian parliament described on our national broadcasters news tonight as a workplace culture of national shame and I was physically distressed to think that that is not just my workplace and our workplace but the home of Australias democracy. No Australian government, no matter whether it be Liberal or Labor, should be known as the government that tolerates a culture where that is happening within its ranks. Its a workplace. You dont have sex at a workplace unless its a brothel. Parliament House is not a brothel, yet we heard on the news tonight an allegation that thats exactly how a Liberal MP has treated it.I expect we will hear the Prime Minister at some point, probably tomorrow, in full high dudgeon about this. He will talk about how hes revolted by it and the acts of Liberal staff and about how hes going to clean up this place, but words of disgust are not enough anymore. We need to have a government that hears and listens and truly takes responsibility for the culture that it presides over. It is a dangerously bad culture. On Channel 10 tonight, Tom proposed that it needs to start with the removal of this toxic, powerful, privileged boys club that does what it wants, when it wants, where it wants.

I wish them all the best and look forward to working with them—as I have done with retiring member Peter Watson. I consider Peter a friend and I wish him and Di all the best. I believe they have bought a campervan and are planning to travel around Australia—a well-earned break for Peter, who has served the community of Albany since 2001. All of us here are politicians, were professionals, and when you see someone like Peter hanging onto a seat by 50 votes at one election and by 65 at the next, you have to take your hat off to the work that he did. I also want to mention Mick Murray, who served the Collie-Preston community for a similar number of years and hung on in some pretty tight elections. Mick was much loved and respected by his community and I wish him all the best.I also want to mention some of the outgoing members. Kyran ODonnell was the member for Kalgoorlie. Kyrans personal vote held up very well. He had a swing of minus three per cent, which was far and away one of the better achievements of our sitting members. Kyran did a great job in Kalgoorlie for the four years he was there. I was very pleased to work with Kyran over that period of time and I wish him all the best for the future. Terry Redman, the outgoing member for Warren-Blackwood, is one of the most decent human beings youll meet in this game. Terry served with distinction as the member for Blackwood, and as Leader of the Nationals at one point. He was minister of several portfolios throughout his career. I wish him all the best. The people who retained their seats across my electorate include Peter Rundle, my next-door neighbour at Katanning—Pete did very well; there was a small swing against him in the seat of Roe—and Mia Davies, who held the very safe seat of Central Wheatbelt. I look forward to working with those members across my electorate.I believe that the unsung heroes of our democracy are those people who put up their hand to run in seats that we euphemistically refer to as difficult to win—and never more so than in the election weve just faced! Marie ODea is a very dear friend of mine from my Muresk days. Marie is a great community person who serves on the Shire of Plantagenet and many other community organisations. Marie put up her hand quite late in the picture in a seat that was held by Terry Redman but ultimately won by the Labor Party. She did a great job and was a great credit to the party and to herself. Im very heartened to hear that she will stay involved with the party and get involved in some of the policy platforms because we need great people like Marie ODea involved going forward.Scott Leary, in the seat of Albany, was I think the only Liberal to have a swing towards him—a very small swing of 0.8 per cent. It was a fantastic achievement. He worked very hard. Scott has indicated that hes keen to go again. Its all about being in the cycle at the right time, so all the best to Scott.David Dwyer worked extraordinarily hard in the seat of Roe. Its a huge seat by state standards. He travelled from Esperance throughout the electorate over a long period of time. Obviously the result that we were looking for wasnt there, but he worked very hard.Rob Forster also worked very hard in Central Wheatbelt. Jane Goff in Collie-Preston had a very ordinary sandwich served up to her with the energy policy effectively closing down the town of Collie. I wish all of those candidates the best. I thank them for their service to not only the party but democracy.

225,0,0,0,1,1,"Keogh, Matt, MP",249147,"Burt","ALP","N/A",3014," Im a bloke—and a white bloke at that—so in making this speech tonight I am wading into territory that some men dare not tread. The point I wish to address tonight though is culture. The nub of it is this: we can have all the new well-intended institutions in the world but none of them in and of themselves will change any of the things that were concerned about with behaviour in this building or by politicians and staff, let alone in any other workplace for that matter, if we dont change the culture.Prior to the honour of being elected to this place I worked for a decade as a lawyer. I worked in the private sector and in the public sector. I worked in a tiny firm and one of the worlds biggest firms. It is certainly the case that junior lawyers, mainly women, have been harassed, sexually harassed, bullied and worse in the workplace—often by colleagues or their superiors—and have not taken any action about it because they feared for their careers. Im not so naive to think that these issues have been resolved in the legal profession or in any other sectors, but in the non-political sectors action has been taken. Admittedly, some of this was driven by lawsuits, which has focused the minds of HR departments into mandating appropriate training.To date the discussions here, however, have focused on the establishment of inquiries and new independent structures to enable better reporting of offending and inappropriate behaviour. My first response to this was frustration. Not only is there already an independent body established to deal with matters such as those alleged by Ms Higgins—the police—but also it has specialist units to assist victims in making formal statements, to refer them for support and to proceed to prosecutions. While such units could be improved, they do already exist. So what would establishing a new body achieve if people arent prepared to use what is already there?The fundamental issue here is the need for cultural change as well, because, if you are a staffer with political ambition or one who would just like to make the jump from electorate officer to ministerial staffer, you dont want to be seen to rock the boat, cause political embarrassment or get caught up in legal cases. If you are an MP with some staff who have an issue with you or an MP with staff who have issues between themselves, you dont want that exploding into the light of day. If you are an MP who is being harassed by staff, a party official or another MP, you certainly dont want to be perceived as weak.Our political culture in Australia militates against encouraging staff or MPs to come forward, to take appropriate action against perpetrators and to stand up and say some behaviour is just not acceptable. So what truly needs to change, in addition to inquiries, new structures and bodies, is culture. We need a political culture that says that, if you are an MP or staffer who is the victim of inappropriate behaviour, harassment, sexual harassment or assault, not only will you be believed but you will be supported. We need a culture where victims feel that the powers that be will be on their side and they wont suffer negative employment and career repercussions.Cultural change is much harder than just creating new bodies. Cultural change requires training, retraining, better preselection and hiring practices, and commitment by those at the top not just in words but in observable action in dealing with matters appropriately when they are raised, believing victims, making appropriate inquiries, taking properly into account the victims wishes while also not letting offending go undealt with, and weeding out anyone who allows for a boys club that does what it wants where it wants and when it wants.Right now, however, almost the opposite happens. MPs and their staff come from all different backgrounds. Some have managed large organisations. Some have directly managed staff in their past—some on their own and others with the support of large HR departments. Some MPs—some of the best, some less reconstructed—come here with no experience of managing staff and with no prior training on appropriate behaviours and how to deal with and respond to allegations. Yet there is no training provided to MPs on induction and no ongoing training on these issues and there is no training required of staff who supervise others. I dont have a silver bullet for cultural change. If there were one, nobody would be buying the hundreds of books out there on the topic. If we did have a silver bullet for it, there would be no family and domestic violence, no racism and no discrimination. But politics must be about what is needed, not just what is easy.In this way, it is good to see that the new ALP national policy for sexual harassment prevention and response includes a requirement for training for MPs, elected officials and staff as well as a register of who has received it. The House and Senate would be well advised to incorporate this into formal MP and senator induction processes. Yes, changing this culture across politics will require a fundamental rethink of how parties, politics and the parliament fundamentally operate, but for the sake of our nation and the lives of those involved in its politics we must do it.","Members of Parliament: Staff","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/subdebate.1[3]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr KEOGH (Burt) ","(19:40):"
226,0,0,0,1,1,"Allen, Katrina, MP",282986,"Higgins","LP","N/A",3015," COVID has been brutal, but we have responded in a uniquely Australian way. The Morrison governments response has been evidence based and expert informed, and it has engaged with the public to ensure that they respect the decisions that have been made on their behalf. It communicated honestly and clearly about COVID in 2020. By building that trust and acting on evidence and expert informed advice, Australians themselves have acted in a way that has helped keep all of us safe. That has helped us to be the envy of the world when it comes to our COVID response.It is this approach that continues now as we move into that all-important stage of the COVID vaccine rollout. Our government will continue to be open and transparent about risks and benefits so that the public continue to trust and respect our public health advice. That advice today is that it is the start of phase 1b. If you are eligible for phase 1b, please dont hesitate to vaccinate. Today is an important day in our vaccine rollout. It begins with the general population, now including those who are over the age of 70 years of age, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged over 55 years, an increased group of health workers, people with a disability and people with specific medical conditionsGeneral practices will play a major role in this phase which is ensuring Australians who seek to be vaccinated have access to safe and free COVID-19 vaccines. More than 1,000 general practices will join the COVID-19 vaccination program, with this set to increase to over 4,000 by the end of April. Weve heard many times before that this is one of the biggest public health initiatives taken in this country in living memory. Individual general practices have been assigned a dose allocation based on geographic distribution and density of phase 1b priority population in the area, along with the standard whole-patient equivalent. GPs will progressively release appointments, so it is important to be patient as we start this new phase, 1b. Everyone in 1b will get the opportunity to be vaccinated in coming weeks, but it will take time for this to scale up.Let me be clear: on the basis of medical advice renewed again today from the Therapeutic Goods Administration, the Chief Medical Officer and the Australian technical advisory group, the minister for health, Greg Hunt, and the government have strong, clear and unequivocal support for the continued rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine. The European Medicines Agency completed a preliminary review on 18 March of reports of some clotting events following people receiving the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. They have concluded that the benefits of vaccination using the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine continue to outweigh any risk of side effects.In fact, today our very own TGA has approved the AstraZeneca vaccine to be manufactured right here in Australia. This is a critical and very exciting milestone in Australias response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Its important because CSL, located in my home state of Victoria, in Melbourne, will manufacture 50 million doses. This is important because it will enable us to produce one million doses per week locally. We no longer need to rely on our vaccine supply chain or to have the sovereign risk of waiting for supplies from overseas.In preparation for phase 1b, I encourage Australians to go to the health.gov.au website and use the eligibility checker so they can find out which phase of the rollout they are in. If you are eligible, youll be able to view vaccination clinics and book an appointment online or by phone on the national coronavirus and COVID-19 vaccination helpline at 1800020080. If you are not eligible, youll be able to register your interest so that you can be notified when youre able to book. With over six million Australians in this phase of 1b it is vital that all Australians remain patient. And, please, be polite to our frontline workers and receptionists.I know that in my seat of Higgins there has been great enthusiasm for the rollout of 1b, and I can reassure people that no-one will miss out on their opportunity to access a safe and free COVID vaccine in Australia. It wont matter if they live in a city or a country town, or in a very remote area—or, indeed, in Higgins; every Australian will have the opportunity. Our government is backing this up with 100 Aboriginal health services and 130 Commonwealth operated and GP led respiratory clinics. This will help ensure that all Australians can have a safe and effective vaccine. When it comes to your turn to be vaccinated, please dont hesitate to do so.","COVID-19: Vaccination","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/subdebate.1[4]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr ALLEN (Higgins) ","(19:45):"
227,0,0,0,1,1,"Khalil, Peter, MP",101351,"Wills","ALP","N/A",3016," I am saddened to have to rise again in this chamber to speak on the atrocities that are occurring in Myanmar. Every day there is a new number of lives lost. At least 249 people have been ruthlessly killed for standing up for their democracy since the military took power in a coup on 1 February. Just this last weekend, protesters in some 20 places across the country staged candlelit night-time protests. They chanted: Failure of the military regime: our cause, our cause. Federal democracy: our cause, our cause. Just as the sky was beginning to brighten, screams were heard, with people shouting, Sniper! Sniper! before another man was shot in the head and died. He joins a 16-year-old girl who was at a friends home just last week and was also shot by a sniper. I dont know their names, but if I did I would say their names in this place.There are too many stories like this. We are compelled to hear their voices of protest. We cannot and we must not turn a blind eye. We cannot and we must not turn away from their cry for freedom. We must support the people of Myanmar, who are fighting so bravely to keep their democracy alive, because this is the battleground for democracy in the 21st century. The battle that rages on the streets of Myanmar is the frontline battle of our age between rising authoritarian military regimes and democracies.On the weekend, Australia was absent from a statement condemning the juntas violence against protestors. It was co-signed by ambassadors from almost a dozen democracies. Why? This is an opportunity to demonstrate strategic courage. The idea that its strategic realism to engage with the military junta because if we do not then China will fill the vacuum is nothing more than strategic cowardice. Australia, one of the worlds oldest continuous and successful democracies, must at least, and morally, stand with these protesters. But there must also be action. I have called publicly in this place for Australias military cooperation with the Tatmadaw to be suspended. Thankfully, after a month, the government made this decision. It should have been made after the first live bullets were shot at the protesters by the military.I have called publicly for tight and targeted sanctions on the military leadership and their families. I have called for the government to offer a Hawke-style amnesty to Myanmar students already in Australia. And I now call for Australia to follow in the steps of the United Nations, the European Union and the Inter-Parliamentary Union to recognise the CRPH, the representative body of the democratically elected Myanmar MPs and the acting vice president, who is in hiding. They are the legitimate government, which was about to form a new cabinet on 1 February, the very same day of the coup. These are concrete actions that our federal government can take right now.Myanmars nascent democracy has been brutally usurped by a military dictatorship. If Australia is serious about our leadership role in the region then we need to be on the front foot, working the diplomatic channels through our bilateral relationships and the multilateral architecture in the region with ASEAN countries and other democracies to lead a coordinated response and working to keep the pressure on the military junta. We need to say with one clear voice that we as an international community will not accept the military dictatorship as the legitimate government of Myanmar.I have met with so many people from the Myanmar community in Australia—in Melbourne, here in Parliament House and at rallies. These people have broken down in tears before me, fearful for their friends and families who protest back in Myanmar for democracy to be restored.I want the brave protesters in Myanmar and their families here to know that I stand with them. It is the least I can do. For if we, the democratically elected members of this place, will not stand up for democracy, who will? And to the foreign minister: when I next meet with these leaders in Australia, I want to be able to look them in the eye and say that we have not just used words in in place but we have taken action, that the Australian government, the Australian democracy and the Australian people stand with them.","Myanmar","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/subdebate.1[5]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr KHALIL (Wills) ","(19:50):"
228,0,0,0,1,1,"Andrews, Kevin, MP","HK5","Menzies","LP","N/A",3018," May I at the outset commend the remarks of my colleague and friend the member for Wills in relation to the situation in Myanmar. It is a dreadful situation, and everything that we in this country can do to try and bring about some resolution of that is well worth it. Having visited Myanmar a few years ago on a parliamentary delegation with members from both sides of this House, seeing the start of a democracy emerging in Myanmar—albeit imperfectly—and now to see that all go backwards under the military coup which has occurred, sadly, once again in that country is something which is tragic for the people of Myanmar.I rise in the House tonight to recognise that yesterday was 21 March, World Down Syndrome Day. The date, the 21st, is significant as the condition is sometimes known as Trisomy 21, a reference to an extra third copy of chromosome 21 in those who have Down Syndrome. Down Syndrome is named after the British doctor, John Langdon Down, who first described it in 1866. Its a relatively rare genetic condition, fewer than a thousand cases per year in Australia, for example, and many of those who do have this condition are able to live very satisfying and fulfilling lives.It was a delight to be able to join Down Syndrome Australia for an event here in Parliament House this morning, and in particular to see the appointment of a number of young people as health ambassadors for Down Syndrome. Remaining healthy is obviously important for all of us but its particularly important for those who do have Down Syndrome, and a program of regular exercise is therefore important to promote. I noted in a relatively recent edition of Voice, the Down Syndrome Australia magazine, an article devoted to exercise, with examples of exercise which would be very useful for people in that situation.It was good to be at the meeting this morning. I was particularly delighted because one of my constituents, Amelia Sloane from Bulleen, was appointed one of the health ambassadors for Down Syndrome Australia. Her role along with the other health ambassadors is to discuss the importance of remaining healthy, of doing exercise, of getting out and having a walk or engaging in swimming or whatever it might be that people engage in as their form of exercise in order to remain both physically and mentally healthy.Id like to congratulate Down Syndrome Australia for the wonderful advocacy and service work that they do, not just in what they did this morning, not just in what they do with the health ambassadors but throughout the year, day in and day out, in order to advance the situation of people who do have Down Syndrome and particularly their families.On a related note, I was also pleased to note the formation of a new 15-member disability advisory committee in Manningham. This is a committee formed by the Manningham Council to advise the councillors and through them the officials of the council and the broader community of needs of people with a disability in the municipality and to ensure that there are in place the types of services from a municipal perspective that will help people with a disability. So I congratulate the Mayor of Manningham, Councillor Andrew Conlon, for setting up this new committee and I wish it the best of progress in terms of the advice and the work with it does for the council.There are a number of services in Manningham which cater for those who are disabled in various ways. The Bulleen special school is a wonderful institution that provides educational services for young people, not just within the Menzies electorate itself but from a broader catchment. In Doncaster East, Onemda is a wonderful service that provides not only education but employment and activities for people with disability. The Kevin Heinze Garden Centre in Doncaster, again, runs a program for people with disability. All of these services, the Bulleen special school and the Kevin Heinze Garden Centre, fulfil a very valuable role for the people of Menzies.House adjourned at 20:00","World Down Syndrome Day, Menzies Electorate: Disability Services","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/subdebate.1[6]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ANDREWS (Menzies) ","(19:55):"

232,0,0,0,1,2,"Burney, Linda, MP","8GH","Barton","ALP","N/A",3020," Last year in July the New South Wales government opened the new M8 tunnel. It runs from Beverly Hills to St Peters. At the same time the government introduced a new toll on the M5 East. It runs from Kingsgrove and comes out just before Sydney airport. Both are major pieces of infrastructure in Barton.The New South Wales government promised that the M8 would double the capacity on one of Sydneys most congested routes. It argued that a toll on the M5 tunnel, never tolled before, was now justified for improving travel times. What is clear to me is the opposite has happened in fact—a horrible tax on motorists and families living in the area. For a car travelling on the M5 East from Kingsgrove to Arncliffe, motorists are now slapped with a $7.23 toll to use an old road each way. This toll will increase each year every year by four per cent. This is an incredible burden on the people of the electorate. A story from a resident in my electorate is telling: in January 2020, before the introduction of the M5 and M8 east toll, he paid $28.62. He now pays $173.80. Thats an increase of 500 per cent.My colleagues in the state parliament filed a petition to scrap this unfair toll. It attracted nearly 20,000 signatures. But tolls have an impact that is more than just the back pocket. Thousands of cars and trucks are now piling up on busy thoroughfares within the electorate—Stoney Creek Road, King Georges Road and Bexley Road. These roads are now full of motorists who refuse to pay the toll. This project was designed to reduce the surface traffic on local roads. It has done anything but.Jeff Tullock runs the local Bexley chamber of commerce and tells me that the change to introduce clearways on Bexley Road has hurt businesses by reducing parking. The high level of noise, vibrations, fumes and pollution are just the beginning. This extends right into the night. Truck drivers get on their horns, and this does not help things. There is such an increase in side traffic.I note the hard work of my colleagues in the New South Wales parliament who have been fighting so hard to raise this issue: Anoulack Chanthivong, the member for Macquarie Fields; Paul Lynch, the member for Liverpool; John Graham MLC, shadow minister for roads; Chris Minns, our local member for Kogarah and the shadow minister for transport.

From Melbourne to Gympie, motorists and their passengers travel on a four-lane safe national highway. Now that the final stage of the four-lane upgrade from Cooroy to Curra is underway, the state government and the federal government must accept that lives on our national highway north of Gympie are just as important as those south. We do not want this section of highway constructed at half the standard of what already exists from Melbourne to Gympie. The Tiaro Bypass will be just two lanes if it goes ahead as planned. That is half the road space that the southern states have for a similar amount of traffic and, in some cases, less traffic. With around 10,000 vehicle movements each day between Gympie and Maryborough, the Queensland governments proposed two-lane Tiaro Bypass will be less safe and lacks vision for the future. Once you lose a loved one to a motor vehicle crash, they are gone forever.If the state government wont listen to me, maybe they will listen to our community. For a safer road, a four-lane divided Tiaro Bypass, I ask Wide Bay residents to sign the petition on my website. In the few days that the petition has been alive, more than 600 people have signed. Wide Bay has spoken. Its people are saying, Our lives on our section of the Bruce Highway are just as important as those south, those in New South Wales and Victoria.The community wants a Bruce Highway that is safe to travel on, a highway that will allow Maryborough and Tiaro to grow. But the Queensland government and the minister do not think we deserve this standard of highway. The minister says there is no issue with gridlock or traffic queues, and, in his opinion, there is no need for four lanes for decades to come. Anyone who uses this road regularly understands that this is simply not true. Two lanes wont meet existing demands. A two-lane road wont accommodate the growth of industry, manufacturing and tourism, and it will put road users at risk. Any potential industry or future industry based in Tiaro requires a four-lane Tiaro Bypass. The federal government has clearly stated that, if the Queensland government puts forward a plan, it will consider it seriously. So I ask both the state transport minister, Mark Bailey, and the federal minister, Michael McCormack, to please work together to bring forward a plan to four-lane the Tiaro Bypass.","Wide Bay Electorate: Roads","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr LLEW OBRIEN (Wide Bay—Deputy Speaker) ","(10:33):"

I want to note that, over the last 12 months, the pandemic has been a significant hit to not only the religious but the cultural life of my part of Sydney, where people havent been able to gather in large numbers.The largest Christian gathering that we have each year and the largest Good Friday gathering I think in Australia is at St Charbels at Punchbowl on Good Friday. The Good Friday service, with music known as music for Maronites and magnificent choir, orchestral music as well—and actually, most of it is written by an Australian, Father Geoffrey Abdallah, who Ive known since he was at school. We werent able to gather in that way last year; people had to watch it on live stream. This year, Im looking forward to being able to share Good Friday again with people, including Sayedna Archbishop Antoine Tarabay and everybody who gathers there at St Charbels at Punchbowl.Four weeks later, under the Orthodox calendar, it will be the time for the Greek community to celebrate Easter. There, while the Good Friday gathering is incredibly special as well, the Easter Sunday gathering at midnight is extraordinary. I look forward to being able to ascend the stairs with Father Christos again. The bell is rung, you look out, and over Belmore there are just red candles everywhere. This will be a very different experience to last year, when I, at midnight, just for the sake of it, stood on my own verandah, on my own, with a red candle in the middle of the night for Orthodox Easter.I also want to acknowledge that, in the time between when parliament rises and when it resumes, Ramadan will start to be observed. Each year, because of functions under the lunar calendar, Ramadan comes forward 10 days earlier and 10 days closer to the warmer weather. That means that, every year at the moment, were going through a process where the days are getting longer and the period of fasting therefore is becoming longer as well. Sadly, the councillor has announced—and I understand why—that, because of the pandemic, were not going to be able to restore the Lakemba night markets this year. So Id simply ask people to wait for another 12 months, because I do want to get back to the point when I can invite you all to come to Lakemba again—to come any time of night, from sunset to sunrise.

I firstly became aware of Bob shortly after I was elected into the parliament back in 1996. Bob was a fierce advocate for improving communication in the Speewah area of my vast electorate. I very quickly learnt that, as a Liberal—Bob was a lifelong Labor member—we really didnt see eye to eye. Its fair to say that there were some heated conversations in those early days of our relationship, and not a lot of trust. However, Bob was persistent and I was determined to roll out communications not only in Speewah but across our broader electorate. Over time, we developed a very strong personal friendship where our political leanings were kept in the bottom drawer.Bob had outstanding knowledge of issues surrounding communications and connectivity and was very willing to be a community advocate for a range of digital services being rolled out into the region. This certainly wouldnt have occurred in that time frame if it wasnt for Bobs advocacy. His knowledge of all things communications related was quite outstanding and his information helped me immensely.Bob and I kept in touch over the years, and I would, infrequently, give him a call to touch base and have a chat. I can honestly say a true friendship was formed. Bob was a community leader and he was respected by his community. His desire and passion to have the best communications possible for his community was only a close second to his passion and dedication for his beloved Australian Labor Party.Mate, you almost achieved the impossible, and you will be sadly missed but fondly remembered by all of those who were fortunate enough to cross your path. Many a time, I had late night discussions with Bob about his frustration up there with the lack of services. It was a difficult area to service because of the terrain, but, nevertheless he was able to give me a lot of accurate information that I could pass on to the telcos and, in doing so, we actually achieved quite a significant coverage in an area that even I, I have to say to you, believed wasnt possible. But, nevertheless, we did it.As I say, I was very saddened when I heard of Bobs passing. I have to say to Bob: thank you, mate, for a job very, very well done.

I want to report to the House, on behalf of many of my local businesses and local workers, my great frustration about the effect that this is going to have in our local area.The frustration is exacerbated by the fact we now know that about one in five businesses who receive JobKeeper actually ended up doing better, or as well, as they had before the pandemic and are not being required by the government to put that money back into the pot so we might actually be able to target it back out to businesses that are affected. It certainly doesnt happen this way if you think you need a Centrelink payment and then you discover you dont; the governments pretty quick to come and take that back from you. But now we have businesses in this situation where they received it, they actually ended up doing better than they had the year before, and theres no requirement for them to give it back. At the same time, Ive got businesses in my local area who, because of the way the government structured JobKeeper, were never eligible to get it. Weve seen a lot of pressure, particularly with tourism, travel—Ive spoken about the travel industry a lot in this House—hospitality and the university here. So many jobs have been lost because businesses werent eligible to get JobKeeper under the way that it was structured.Just so that the chamber and the government are clear, there are real people at the end of this. I want to share with the House today an email I received in the last week: Dear Sharon, I hope this note finds you well. My wife Rosemary is a travel agent. Shes been in the industry for 40 years, and started originally with Peter Morton in Port Kembla. Rosemary is currently working at Merolas in Corrimal and has been there for 15 years. Shes been headhunted by a few agencies over the years. At the end of the month, she will lose her job. JobKeeper has kept her in the industry until now, but that money will have been wasted unless her expertise is retained within travel. Travel agents are primarily used by people travelling overseas—some 85 per cent it has been estimated. When Rosemary and others of her experience leave, they cannot be replaced. Experience cannot be taught without TAFE. Rosemary is 60 this year. She is petrified. Jobs for females aged 60 and over are few. Some form of assistance must be given to travel agencies and their employees. That was from Robert Green, who lives at Woonona in my electorate. There are real people at the end of the decisions towards the end of this week. The government needs to hear their voices and do something for them.","JobKeeper Payment","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[5]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms BIRD (Cunningham) ","(10:42):"
237,0,0,0,1,2,"Martin, Fiona, MP",282982,"Reid","LP","N/A",3023," Yesterday, the Morrison government released its report on the Australian Law Reform Commission review on the family law system. This follows the tabling of the final report of the Joint Select Committee on Australias Family Law System. I feel its an honour to be a member of this committee and to work alongside colleagues with the intent of improving the system that has long been broken. As a psychologist with approximately 20 years of experience, my contribution to this committee has been shaped by my experience of working with families, individuals and couples who are going through separation and divorce. There are many reasons why an individual or a couple may choose to divorce. Relationship breakdowns are incredibly complex. The complexities of divorce are worsened when the system that facilitates this process has unnecessary complexities. At best, the inefficiencies of the family law system can cause unnecessary costs and delays for a separating couple. At worst, the inefficiencies can put families at risk of serious harm. We know that during a period of separation there is an increased risk of experiencing family violence and abusive behaviour. Almost two in five women and one in three men who temporarily separated from a former partner experienced family violence during the separation.One of the most protective measures currently in the system is the principle of no-fault divorce, established in the Family Law Act 1975. In Australia, the only ground for divorce required is the irretrievable breakdown of the relationship, demonstrated by 12 months of separation. Prolonging the period of separation puts victims at further risk of abuse and harm. Reform of the system must mitigate the hostilities and risk of violence that can arise during a period of separation. Going forward, a key priority must be the safety and wellbeing of all family members going through the family law system. The Morrison government is already enacting a significant shake-up of the federal family law courts in order to end the unnecessary costs and delays that arise from a split federal Family Court system. It is legislation like the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill that will achieve this, but much work still needs to be done to create a system that works as quickly, inexpensively and efficiently as possible. I can assure the constituents of Reid that my focus will be on shaping reform to provide safe pathways for separating families which will benefit all families and communities across Australia.","Family Law","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[6]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr MARTIN (Reid) ","(10:45):"

Many people fled Iraq, particularly after the fall of Saddam Hussein, and sought refuge in Australia. In my experience, every one of them wants to make a contribution to their new country and they do so in many and varied ways, working in many charities and not-for-profit organisations across our country. I want to mention one Assyrian Australian today who is also giving back to her home country, her original country of Iraq, and that is Fay Daoud, who I met recently on her return visit to Australia. Fay is an Assyrian woman from Fairfield. She got her start working at Fairfield City Council, helping our community. Like so many, her mother and father left Iraq in the 1960s. Her father is a very well-known dentist in our community. Now Fay has gone back to work in Iraq with the United Nations as part of the Development Program to help with Iraqs infrastructure and services, to rebuild schools and hospitals and to restore roads and infrastructure after the desecration and destruction of ISIS, to fight poverty and to ensure immediate access to income by providing short-term employment and public works schemes. She has gone back to the place her family fled from, and she has shown great bravery in doing so. My last visit to Iraq was in 2018, and it is true to say it is not yet a safe community, particularly for Christians and members of the Assyrian community. But she is doing what she believes is right, and we all support her in doing so.She was stationed by the UN in Baghdad in 2018. For the last three years she has been working to help communities after the conflicts that they have had to endure, an important part of which involves facilitating those who fled their homes to return, rebuild and get back to as close to normal as possible, right throughout Iraq, in those cities and villages that have been destroyed by ISIS. This is an enormous effort. Again, Ive seen this myself in Erbil and have been briefed on the situation in Mosul. It requires a big effort on the part of the international community to help Iraq rebuild. Since 2015 the program has raised $1.5 billion, but much more is needed.I also take this opportunity to note that this weekend will be the Assyrian and Chaldean new year. I know the member for Calwell is a very active participant in this. I say to members of the Assyrian community: Howya brikhta reesha dsheeta qa koleh Atoorayeh—Happy New Year to all Assyrians! It is a very important festival right throughout Australia. The beginning of April marks the new year for Assyrians. It is a time to celebrate Assyrian and Chaldean culture and to hope that one day Assyrians and Chaldeans can return to Iraq and live in peace.","Daoud, Ms Fay","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[7]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BOWEN (McMahon) ","(10:48):"

Planet Innovation creates breakthrough products and commercially successful businesses that transform industries and have a positive impact on the world. The company employs over 300 Australians, including experts in research, design, engineering and manufacturing.It is companies like Planet Innovation and the Australians they employ that are set to benefit from the Morrison governments $1.3 billion Modern Manufacturing Initiative. The initiative specifically identifies medical products as one of the six national manufacturing priorities that this government will pursue in order to, among other things, better commercialise Australian research and integrate our manufacturing into global supply chains. This just makes sense. Quality medical products are at the centre of a healthy society, and Australias medical technology industry is truly world leading. Indeed, according to some sources, the pharmaceutical and medical products market is now Australias largest manufacturing export, at an estimated $8.2 billion in value.The Modern Manufacturing Initiative will help Aussie manufacturers in the medical product sector, like Planet Innovation, to scale up, become more competitive and create more Australian jobs. Funding is now available through this and other Modern Manufacturing Initiative streams. I encourage manufacturers in Chisholm and across Australia to take advantage of this unique opportunity. Dream big, and who knows what the future will hold? However, one thing in the future is certain: under a Morrison government, the future is bright for Aussie manufacturers.I look forward to working with Planet Innovation and other local Chisholm businesses to help them grow and succeed in any way that I can.

240,0,0,0,1,2,"Aly, Anne, MP",13050,"Cowan","ALP","N/A",3025," Like most offices, my electorate office in Cowan deals with a large number of inquiries about immigration and about visas. One case in particular that Id like to highlight today really does highlight the cruelty of this governments refusal to include parents as immediate family for the purposes of granting visas. The rules currently define immediate family as a spouse, de facto partner, a dependent child or a legal guardian, but they do not include parents.SBS recently reported on the case of Rajshree Patel, who has not seen her son, Nevaan, since July 2019, and that was just before the toddler was taken to India with his grandparents while she completed her Bachelor of Nursing. Shes a single mother with a chronic illness, and shes applied three times for a travel exemption for her mother and father to bring her son to Australia but was knocked back. On her most recent application, her mother was approved for travel to Australia but not her father, and, understandably, Ms Patel doesnt wish to have her parents separated.Its a very similar case to a case that my office is currently dealing with in Cowan. It is the case of an Australian citizen who is a survivor of domestic violence. She fled a domestic violence partnership, and having done that myself I know how scary and how difficult it is to do that. She bravely left with a young toddler while pregnant. She works full time for herself and her toddler and for her unborn child. She is due to give birth soon and desperately wants her parents to be able to come to Australia to support her through this very difficult time. The effect of needing someone to care for her toddler means that, with only one parent here in Australia, she will be forced to give birth alone, and I think many members here today can relate to just how daunting that would be for her. Her mother is able to come to Australia, but she has been pleading to have her father also be allowed to visit. Despite the best efforts of my office and of Senator Keneallys office, she has again been knocked back for her request. It truly highlights how this government has left behind somebody who has had the courage to leave an abusive relationship and who is now being left to give birth in isolation without family or friends beside her. I know that the member for Curtin delivered a petition to this House calling for the government to reconsider the definition of immediate family to include parents, and I urge the government to do the same.","Migration","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[9]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr ALY (Cowan) ","(10:54):"
241,0,0,0,1,2,"Howarth, Luke, MP",247742,"Petrie","LNP","N/A",3026," Last week I had an interesting and enlightening conversation with a woman in my electorate, Dr Kate Witteveen, who in the depths of despair in an emotional breakdown, threw in her long-term career as an academic, took herself off for some self-healing and wrote this book: How Being Good Can Be Bad For You. Its a catchy title and a great read. Its about how striving for perfection and high achievement and saying yes to everyone led to her burning out.The book steps through Kates journey from rock-bottom burnout to a career overhaul, where she is now helping other people with burnout. She has redirected her doctorate in psychology to work as a life coach, where she says many people are presenting to her practice with similar physical and mental health symptoms, trying to be all things to all people and losing themselves in the process, which can be very damaging.Kate said that, while there is no blood test or X-ray for burnout, it is a diagnosable condition. It presents as a combination of physical, emotional and psychological symptoms, building over a long period of time. Kate said she was constantly tired, anxious, unwell, found sleep and winding down difficult and was in an adrenaline overload. She said learning how to say no was the hardest habit to train. She wants people to know that self-care is not selfish—I think thats a great line: self-care is not selfish—and that you must learn to take time for yourself to be the best for yourself and for those people around you.Mental health issues affect approximately one in five Australians every year, and there are experiences like Kates and different ones too. Not all mental health issues are the same, and many people can recover if they receive support early on.The Morrison governments total commitment to mental health support is $5.7 billion this year, including funding for critical frontline services and suicide prevention, and the Morrison government is putting more funding into Lifeline, Beyond Blue and Kids Helpline to make sure people can get the services they need. More than four million Australians experience a mental health disorder every year and more than half will be affected at some point in their lifetime, with anxiety disorders forming a large percentage of those—a significant issue and one that needs to be combated.If you live in my electorate of Petrie and want to take steps to get help, you can visit your local GP. At any age, if you need to take steps to get away from feeling like that hamster running on the wheel, getting nowhere, to improve your mental and emotional wellbeing, speak out and perhaps grab a copy of Dr Kates book, Why Being Good Can Be Bad For You.

244,0,0,0,1,2,"Giles, Andrew, MP",243609,"Scullin","ALP","N/A",3027," I move:That this House:(1) notes that:(a) 15 to 21 March 2021 marks Harmony Week, a time to recognise and celebrate diversity and inclusion in Australia; and(b) 21 March 2021 is International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, a call for the international community to increase its efforts to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination; and(2) recognises that:(a) Australia’s diversity is our greatest strength, we should celebrate this, defend this, and strive to strengthen it; and(b) at a time of rising racism around the globe and in Australia, we must commit to a zero‑tolerance approach to racism, and to working to end all forms of racial discrimination.Last week, people right across Australia celebrated Harmony Week, sharing and celebrating culture. Yesterday, the weeks culmination was the United Nations International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. It marks the anniversary of the Sharpeville massacre, when 69 peaceful protesters against apartheid were killed by police in South Africa. As we recognise and celebrate the diversity that is modern Australia, we cant forget this, nor can we pretend that it is a relic of history, because racism persists and, indeed, is on the rise, as is right-wing extremism. So this year we do have to unite to fight racism.Our diversity truly is our greatest strength, but it can never be taken for granted. No matter who you are, where you were born, the language you first spoke or your religious beliefs, in Australia, everyone belongs. We must state this and restate it, and we must state that we are proud of our immigrant history and that we can build on this, including through a fair and just community sponsorship program, as an important report from Amnesty International released yesterday proposes. Were also proud to be home to the worlds oldest continuous civilisation. Its these things that make us who we are and enable us to imagine who we might be.The COVID pandemic makes these questions more pressing because it has unleashed a new strain of ugly racism across our communities. International students called Coronavirus; graffiti scrawled on a suburban garage door, saying, Go home, yellow dogs—shameful, disgraceful, disgusting acts. A national survey conducted last year by the community group the Asian Australian Alliance received 400 reports of racism directed towards people from Asian backgrounds. In May of last year, the ABC reported on the results of a survey conducted on peoples experiences of racism. It heard from people whod been abused on the street and yelled at whilst shopping. The Christchurch terrorist responsible for the horrific murder of 51 worshippers in two mosques in New Zealand two years ago was an Australian man, radicalised on our shores. We cant ignore that, but we still havent truly come to terms with that fact. Just last Friday, we saw a man wearing a cap with a Nazi swastika at a major train station in Melbourne. That was after shocking images from the Australia Day weekend of a Neo-Nazi gathering near the Grampians in western Victoria.This threat is real. We cannot afford to be complacent. Rising racism, rising xenophobia, rising anti-Semitism and Islamophobia, the rising incidence of hate crimes—these terrible threats are growing at home and around the world. We saw the terrible murder in Atlanta, Georgia, of eight people, most of them Asian American women.Racism ruins lives and it divides entire communities. It corrodes the foundations of what makes societies and communities successful. And racism is against the law. It is against the law to vilify a person or a group of people because of their race or their religion. We cant assume that the scourge of racism will go away by itself. This is a problem that requires action. It requires leadership from political and community leaders. It requires a strategy to defeat it. So I welcome the proposal by the Race Discrimination Commissioner, Chin Tan, of an antiracism framework.Labor has being calling for a comprehensive national antiracism strategy for over a year, because it is not enough for this government or any government to simply condemn racism. We need a comprehensive strategy to tackle racism through leadership and with appropriate support. Words must be matched by actions. Thats why federal Labor has commenced important policy work on a national antiracism strategy, focusing on empowering culturally and linguistically diverse communities and changing attitudes through a national antiracism campaign.As we renew our commitment to multiculturalism we must also commit to ending racism and promoting respect for all, building a society that is truly equal. We can and we must, each of us, demonstrate this through our actions each and every day. As Tim Soutphommasane says, we must name and confront racism, however uncomfortable this may be. We, those of us who have the responsibility and the opportunity to speak on behalf of others and to make decisions that shape this nation and its laws, must put in place a national strategy committing to a zero-tolerance approach to racism and to ending the stain on all of us that is the persistence of racial discrimination.","Racism","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr GILES (Scullin) ","(11:00):"

249,0,0,0,1,2,"Archer, Bridget, MP",282237,"Bass","LP","N/A",3029," I commend the member for Scullin for bringing forward this motion today. On Friday, a year after the last Harmony Day celebrations were cancelled as the realities of the pandemic set in, my local community, including hundreds of migrants from all corners of the globe, came together to celebrate the end of Harmony Week. With the theme of everyone belongs, I was thrilled to learn that more than 1,600 Harmony Week events were planned across the nation as a celebration of the success of Australias multicultural society.In attendance at my local event in northern Tasmania were some of the more than 5,000 Nepali and Bhutan-born refugees who call our region home. These wonderful migrants, many of whom are now proud Australian citizens, make up some of the more than 100,000 Nepali-speaking Bhutanese who wound up in refugee camps in eastern Nepal between 1990 and 1993 after being expelled or fleeing the small Himalayan kingdom, leading to a refugee crisis.I recently spoke of some of the many members of this amazing community who I have had the honour of getting to know over the past few months, including members of the Nepali Cricket Club, who have now secured a spot in the A-grade cricket league. Today I want to use the opportunity of standing here to give a voice to a fantastic young man who I met through his work with our local migrant resource centre. Obeth Rai is part of the Nepali-speaking Bhutanese community in Launceston. This is his story in his own words as he sent them to me:I arrived in Launceston with my family back in 2013 after living more than 20 years in a refugee camp in Nepal. Living in refugee camp was not easy as there were no any electricity, fridges to restore foods and all the stuffs. However, it was okay enough to make a living.When talking about Nepals life, I always had a passion about arts and culture so I established a theatre called Suruwath (which means beginning) and led around 50 young people there.Fortunately, an opportunity came around to my family where we got chance to come to Australia as a humanitarian entrant. Since then the life has been slowly changing, trying to adjust completely in a new environment. There were lot of struggles that I had to overcome once I arrived in Tasmania ranging from language issues, employment and cultural understanding.Since I was very passionate about arts, I wanted to learn more about it here but it was not easy because of language. However, after learning English by going to English classes, seeking advices from teachers, I managed to get into bachelors of contemporary arts course in university of Tasmania.After three years of study, I graduated from that course in 2018. I cant thank enough my teachers, friends, and family for always supporting and guiding me throughout my studies. After that I started involving actively in various social program including arts projects in different cities of Australia including:• MONA FOMA arts festival• Junction arts festival• Film screening - Bhutanese refugee feature movie in Adelaide.• Multicultural event in Melbourne with book launch.• 10th anniversary settlement in Australia in Sydney.• Bhutanese faces of Launceston - documentary project Cultural Dance workshops in Brooks High SchoolNow, I am currently working as a project assistant in Thrive project run by migrant resource centre north and also as a support worker in NDIS program. I am privileged to be part of these wonderful organisations and very lucky to be here in Australia. I am also so grateful that I got to call Australia my home.Obeth, I am so grateful that you now call Australia home.It would be remiss of me not to point out that yesterday, the last day of Harmony Week, coincided with the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, calling for increased efforts across the international community to tackle racial discrimination. I was pleased to learn that the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs, the Hon. Alex Hawke MP, met just last week with the Australian Race Discrimination Commissioner, Chin Tan, to discuss his proposals for a national antiracism framework. Our government recognises that there is critical work ahead to foster a more inclusive society and stamp out racism and has asked the Department of Home Affairs and the agencies, including the A-Gs Department, to work further with Commissioner Tan on the proposals he has presented. This is a positive step in the right direction to create a nation that is truly welcoming and safe for new migrants like Obeth.","Racism","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs ARCHER (Bass) ","(11:05):"

I also want to pay tribute to the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, which was actually marked yesterday, and to reaffirm our commitment to the principles of equality and our fight against racial inequality in all its forms and wherever and whenever it occurs.I want to reflect on why its particularly important that we recognise and mark these two very important occasions. Weve celebrated Harmony Week across Australia for over 20 years now, and it has played a very important role in helping drive social cohesion and creating a sense of belonging for everyone in this country. But our country has been on a journey of inclusion and rejection of discrimination for decades. Back in the 1970s, when multiculturalism first became a defined policy framework, we set about building our legal and social frameworks. We—Labor—introduced the Racial Discrimination Act and we stressed that having a strong and vibrant communal fabric of many different cultures was about much more than just tolerance, or assimilation, as it was referred to. It was about celebrating and embracing all those different threads and recognising that, if they retained their colour and stayed distinctive, they could be woven together to make our society so much stronger and more vibrant.My community is testament to this. We dont just do Harmony Day or Harmony Week; we actually live and breathe it on a daily basis. For us, everyone belongs is more than a beautiful-sounding theme; it is an important daily truth and a plan for future action in the way in which we relate to each other. Im particularly proud of the diversity of my electorate, with nearly half of my residents born overseas and over half who speak a language other than English at home. Hume City Council opened its doors on Friday to Harmony Week celebrations, and its always an opportunity for our local communities to share their rich cultural inheritances and to bring it all together with a sense of belonging and sharing for all of us.In an Australian context, citizenship lies at the heart of the idea that everyone belongs. Its through citizenship that we ensure that everyone who lives in this country lives equally as Australians and is recognised as belonging to the Australian family. Australia is a migrant country, and it has become successful because it has given people access to citizenship and permanent residency as clear pathways to permanent settlement, which is why Harmony Week is a very important opportunity to reaffirm our national commitment to the principles of multiculturalism, to Australian citizenship and to the Australian identity. These principles must include a fair and non-discriminatory immigration policy, proper settlement services and properly funded community services in a range of fundamental areas, such as education and training, health, housing and recreation, that are inclusive of and available to everyone who needs them.I must also include a recognition of the incredible contribution that migrants of various waves and different backgrounds have made and continue to make towards this nations future. We must never take for granted the hard-earned fight for inclusion, fairness and social cohesion that Harmony Week stands for, because there have always been those amongst us who cannot accept the principles espoused by Harmony Week. It seems a simple and obvious enough message, but, sadly, it is not something that everyone in this country accepts. We know this and we learn of this, and the member for Scullin gave an example of this. So we must always be vigilant. We must continue to move forward and work towards even greater access to services and equality of opportunity for all Australians. As we mark the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, Harmony Week is a very important reminder to us all that racism is on the rise again.So we have to continue to fight long and hard to protect our community against racism—and weve got to remain vigilant against its creeping effects—in all its forms and expressions. Belonging is not just a warm and fuzzy feeling. It means very deliberate and very concrete actions to ensure that everyone—regardless of their culture, their birthplace, their language or their religion—has access to safety; to shelter; to education; to work; to health care; to respect, more importantly; and to the freedom to live in peace in our communities right across Australia.","Racism","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms VAMVAKINOU (Calwell) ","(11:10):"

And, on 21 March, we celebrated the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination—something I believe is of precious importance, regardless of where you are in the world.As a migrant myself, coming from Hong Kong a few decades back, I came to this country without friends or family. I would be lying if I said I wasnt at all nervous. In fact, I was terrified—terrified at the prospect of coming to this country, with no idea what to expect.

With my cultural background, I have encountered adversity throughout the years, but there are always bad eggs in any place you go. The difference in Australia is that most Australians always do the right thing.Its our current government that has done the right thing and made public statements openly condemning all forms of racism It has committed to ensuring Australia remains a safe country to live in and belong to—something Im extraordinarily proud of. The Morrison government has always recognised diversity as a significant component to Australias economic success which allows businesses to be more prosperous and increases opportunities to build international relationships. In fact, the Morrison government celebrates the diversity of this nation and the shared Australian values that unite us all.Its through this recognition and celebration that the Morrison government committed to continuing development of the social cohesion program. Our government has allocated $63 million in the 2020-21 federal budget. This includes $37.3 million to promote understanding of our Australian values, identity and social cohesion and to counter misinformation online, $17.3 million to enhance engagement with multicultural communities and leaders, and $7.9 million to establish a research program dedicated to informing initiatives that strengthen social cohesion.Australia is well renowned for our success in bridging the distance between our citizens who may have been here for generations and those who have just arrived. We are a nation that has always understood the importance of developing and strengthening the diversity of our culture and people while ensuring that our Australian values are instilled in all those who share Australian citizenship. The government recognises that there is critical work ahead to foster a more inclusive society and to stamp out racism, but, as someone with a multicultural background who is sensitive to and aware of these issues, I can wholeheartedly lend my support to the good work our government has done and continues to do. In fact, I can say that Im proud of the work that the Morrison government is doing to eliminate racism here in Australia, and I will definitely do my very best to work with organisations and everyone in Chisholm to achieve this goal.","Racism","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms LIU (Chisholm) ","(11:15):"
252,0,0,0,1,2,"Gosling, Luke, MP",245392,"Solomon","ALP","N/A",3032," Im pleased to rise in support of the motion moved by the member for Scullin. Today is the final day of Harmony Week and yesterday was International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. The day was first proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly in 1966, commemorating, in part, the Sharpeville massacre of 1960. That was 55 years ago. In many ways the progress weve made over these decades is remarkable, but, in a larger sense, it is also true to say that it seems that very little has changed. Many of the same acts and structures which underpinned racial discrimination in 1966 remain unchanged. You just have to look at what is happening around the world at the moment: the ongoing struggle against police brutality and for full civil rights in the United States, acts of genocide and ethnic cleansing in many corners of the globe, and the rise of racial supremacist movements and their infiltration of the political mainstream. While the world may no longer look and feel the same as it did in the 1960s, we are still fighting the same battles for equality and justice.We are lucky to live in one of the most diverse and multicultural nations in the world. I represent a particularly diverse corner of Australia. Darwin and Palmerston, the capital of northern Australia, are microcosms of Australia, and this diversity is our strength. Its the experience of millions of Australians to live in a diverse and multicultural community. Diversity and multiculturalism are ingrained, woven into the fabric of our society. This reality is an everyday part of Australian life and its this fact that makes the ongoing racially based attacks on our communities particularly heinous. We know that, since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, attacks against many of our ethnic communities have increased. We are already dealing with economic dislocation and a global pandemic, and some of our multicultural communities increasingly feel under siege and as though they have to justify what none of us should have to defend: our rightful place in our own country.It is an iron rule of politics that words matter. Political discourse and the rhetoric of our leaders have a real effect on shaping attitudes and driving behaviour. We have seen this with the former President of the United States, Donald Trump, whose dangerous and divisive rhetoric will be his longest lasting legacy. Even in this parliament, we have seen similarly divisive rhetoric. The government, those opposite, for their part have abandoned their responsibilities to protect our multicultural communities. Not only have they failed to hold to account those within their ranks who sow division; they have made things worse with their own behaviour. This is the same government which keeps people and families in detention indefinitely.In my electorate of Solomon, nine people are still being held in inhumane conditions. One couple from Iran, Afsaneh Ghodsi and Mojtaba Hagthighat, have been in detention for eight years. One year of that was spent in Darwin, in my electorate, in a cramped small cabin. They are genuine refugees. The toll this has taken on their mental health has been significant. They have family here in Australia, including Afsanehs elderly parents. Those family members have been trapped in an unbearable limbo, waiting in the hope that government may show some humanity and compassion. This situation is completely unacceptable and it is untenable. We have seen people held in similar circumstances in other parts of Australia being released, including in Brisbane and Melbourne, so why not Darwin? The government should take its Harmony Week commitments seriously and immediately free these people to community detention.I would like to thank the member for Scullin for his excellent motion and for joining the people of Darwin and Palmerston in protesting these inhumane policies and calling for the release of the nine people still in detention. I remind those opposite and I remind the minister, who Ive written to several times, that these people are genuine refugees and are not a security threat to our nation. In the spirit of Harmony Week, they should be released to community detention so that the ongoing effects on their mental and physical health stop.","Racism","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr GOSLING (Solomon) ","(11:20):"
253,0,0,0,1,2,"Leeser, Julian, MP",109556,"Berowra","LP","N/A",3033," The successful multicultural society that we have around us is one of the hallmarks of Australia, and it is one of the hallmarks of my community in Berowra. Im pleased to have the opportunity today to speak about some of the organisations and people in my community who are engaged in bolstering and celebrating and providing services to that successful multicultural Australia that we have.The Australian Community Inspired Association Inc. was started in 2016 by a group of local people from both the Indian and Chinese communities. It is led by the irrepressible Bob Waller, who wanted to bring people together to work on community projects that would raise funds for important initiatives within our community and beyond—whether thats the Red Shield Appeal or the Whitelion youth support program or the local Mens Sheds. That organisation continues today and is now led by Barbara Ward, a leader in the Indian community. Bob Waller remains involved, and Wayne Lever, Gary Ward, Indu Harikrishna, Marla Mehta and Sreeni Pillamarri make up the team. They do a great job not only in providing services to communities but bringing communities together to work on projects.One of the older community organisations in my electorate is the Cherrybrook Chinese Community Association. Its an association that goes back 32 years, and it provides a world renowned—in my view—Chinese language school and a range of Chinese cultural activities in order to provide and pass on some of the important Chinese culture, not just to the next generation of Chinese Australians but also to Australians who are interested in learning more about China. I want to congratulate the newly elected president, Kwok Ling Chau, and Jenny Lau, who has been president, on and off, for many years, Dennis Loh, James Fong, Polly Chan, Stephen Lang, Ken Ng and Peter Tong, who make up their executive.Im proud to be a former student of the IABBV Hindi School in my electorate, led by Marla Mehta, who is a wonderful leader in the Indian community. She had the idea back in 1987 of forming a community language school so that young Indian Australians who are growing up in an English-speaking environment wouldnt seem alien to their grandparents, because theyd have some knowledge of the language and culture of their school. The IABBV Hindi School meets on a Sunday morning at the Thornleigh West Public School. There are children and adults of all ages. I want to say to Marla: dhanyavaad for all you do for the community.One of most important and interesting events of my year usually happens on the Anzac Day weekend, but, sadly, its not happening this year due to COVID. That is the annual festival run to commemorate Saint George by the Associazione San Giorgio Martire di Sydney—please excuse my murdering of the Italian language. The association represents a community that has effectively transplanted itself from the town Martone region in Calabria in Italy to Australia. Why is this such a beautiful event? Its beautiful because they have a wonderful mass, they have Italian bands and they have the best food in Sydney. It is wonderful to see, across the generations, the culture being transmitted and shared. I want to acknowledge the executive of the association: George Dolores, George Maiolo, Tony and Mary Macri, Vince Murdocca and Andrew Papallo.Perhaps the oldest ethnic community in my electorate are the Lebanese community, who have been here since the early 1900s. They congregate particularly around the St George Maronite Catholic Church in Thornleigh. Its a beautiful community that this April celebrate 20 years of the new church. Their original church, St Joachims, goes back to the 1900s. The Lebanese Maronite community have been worshipping at that church since that time. It is not the only interesting Christian community in my electorate. Im proud to have a Coptic Orthodox community at Galston, led by Father Barsoum and Father Abdelmalik; a Greek Orthodox church in Thornleigh, led by the Reverend Andrew Ioannou; as well as Sri Lankan, Korean, Bahai, Polish, Russian and, increasingly, Persian communities. So Im very lucky to represent a diverse electorate.In my remaining time to speak, I wanted to mention a related day to Harmony Week, and that is Harmony Day, which is marked by Moving Forward Together, a project that came out of the Bnai Brith in Sydney, led by Ernie Friedlander. For several years, theyve run a poster competition, an annual walk and now a songwriting competition to encourage people towards the idea that it is important for us as a community to celebrate diversity—that part of being a decent society is to be a society that caters to all, regardless of their colour, cultural origin or religion. That is a beautiful sentiment that I know Ernie and his committee pursue in their various activities very strongly, as they have done for many years. Let me commend this motion and commend all the multicultural communities in my electorate.","Racism","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr LEESER (Berowra) ","(11:25):"
254,0,0,0,1,2,"Georganas, Steve, MP","DZY","Adelaide","ALP","N/A",3035," I too rise to speak on this very important motion. I congratulate the member for Scullin for moving it and others who have spoken in this place this morning about Harmony Day and Harmony Week. Harmony Week is an event which is designed to celebrate Australias diversity, an important event. When we look at Australia, we see people from every corner of the world that have made this beautiful country home. But, very importantly, our First Nations people have been here for up to 60,000 years, and we should never lose sight of that.I represent an electorate that has over 180 different nationalities and ethnicities. To give you an example, this weekend alone I attended the Croatian Club for a very big event that they had yesterday; and Nowruz, the Persian new year, on Saturday, which was celebrated this year in conjunction with Harmony Day. It was a great event, with people from the Middle East—Iran, Iraq and all over. It is a big, big event that is celebrated in their homelands. That gives you some idea. I think we are extremely lucky as members of parliament that we actually get to see in our communities the different mix of people who have made their homes here in Australia.One of the things that underpin our harmony is our multicultural policy, which we have had since the late seventies and early eighties. Australia was a very different place, when you look at the 1700s. The majority of people were of British or Irish stock, and that all changed. It changed because people fought hard for those changes. They understood that the only way to have a society that held together and where people respected one another was to give every person that came to this nation to become an Australian equal opportunities, without discrimination, without bias, without any of those things that we see in many other countries. For example, in some countries around the world, if you are of a particular ethnicity, you cannot work in the public service or you cannot attend university. You cannot do things that we take for granted here. Imagine what Australia could be like if our laws werent managed the way they are today. Our society is one of the greatest successes of the world—our multicultural society, where everyone is respected and treated equally by the law, and it is so important to keep that going because it is what underpins our harmony.Sure, Harmony Day is great. Its fantastic; its about celebrating our communities. But the reality is that multiculturalism is about walking in someone elses shoes and understanding that they may be a bit different from me, or you, Madam Deputy Speaker, but we are all Australians working together for a common goal—to better this country and to ensure that we live happily, in harmony, without discrimination, regardless of race, religion, colour of skin et cetera. To give you an example, as I said, on the weekend I attended the Croatian Club. I went to the Nowruz new year. Yesterday we had wreath-laying ceremonies in my electorate. I have one of the largest Greek communities in Australia in my electorate. Its Greek Independence Day this week, but the ceremonies were all held yesterday and we laid wreaths. Every week, I attend everything from a Coptic church to ceremonies in Hindu temples to festivals; you would think that you were in another place in another corner of the world. That is one of the greatest assets that this country has, and we should always protect it and ensure that we build on it to give us this beautiful thing that we have that we call multiculturalism.Australia is like looking at a tapestry, all different colours of threads. Individually, you cant see the beauty, but, when you put it all together and you see that great big tapestry, that is our multicultural Australia. We are so lucky, and we all benefit from it. We must ensure that we continue to celebrate days like Harmony Day but also, at the same time, walk in others shoes and understand what theyve gone through, their trials and tribulations, and to live peacefully in this wonderful of country of ours.","Racism","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr GEORGANAS (Adelaide) ","(11:31):"

257,0,0,0,1,2,"Thompson, Phillip, MP",281826,"Herbert","LNP","N/A",3036," I move:That this House notes:(1) the construction industry:(a) employs over one million Australians;(b) consists of 390,000 small and family businesses; and(c) generates more than $100 billion, or around five per cent of our annual economic output;(2) the Governments HomeBuilder grant has provided critical support to the residential construction sector during the COVID-19 pandemic; and(3) that Treasury estimates that HomeBuilder is underpinning $18 billion worth of construction projects.Im very glad to move this motion today, because the HomeBuilder program has been a massive success not just for the entire nation but also for the electorate that I represent, Herbert. At the beginning of this pandemic, roughly around this time last year when everything was shutting down, the construction industry faced one of the highest amounts of uncertainty. Not only did they not know whether their job sites would be able to remain open or operational; who was going to build the new home or complete a substantial renovation when their job was at risk? The industry, which employs over one million Australians, told us they were going to fall off the cliff if we didnt implement something extra, targeted support in addition to JobKeeper. So, after consultation with the industry, the HomeBuilder grant was put together.In the first round, we saw $25,000 for new builds or major renovations. In Queensland, we had an extra $20,000 from the state government for first home builders. That meant a possible $45,000 for a first time home builder in an unprecedented time, and it was an unprecedented level of support. For a lot of people it was that little bit of extra cash they needed to outlay for their dream of building their brand new home, to get the project over the line.Now, coming up to a year on, the grant is underpinning $18 billion worth of construction projects. Thats supporting thousands of existing jobs and creating thousands more. Lets not forget, along with the supply line, the bigger economic impact. That $18 billion directly translates into $60 billion of broader economic activity. We have nearly 90,000 applications nationwide, and more than 10,000 grants have been paid.To give more of an idea of how much HomeBuilder has turned things around, new home sales had dropped to their lowest level on record in May 2020, according to the Housing Industry Association. Now they have increased by 32½ per cent compared to 2019. In 2021, the HIA says it has recorded 130,000 new detached homes projected to start construction. Master Builders have revised projections up from 124,000 to 160,000, and 43 per cent of new home loans at the moment are projected to be for new home buyers. The way this project has transformed industry and saved it from the brink cannot be overstated.Let me zoom in a little bit on Townsville and give you an idea of the boom were experiencing locally in the electorate of Herbert. Weve seen new home approvals in Townsville triple just recently—a massive increase. We saw them increase gradually from 40 in July to 82 in September to 104 in November, with all this leading to a good problem to have, and thats some supply chain issues and some workforce issues. The last thing I want to see is people not being eligible for the grant because work cant get started through no fault of their own. Ive already said in this place that we need to make some practical decisions to ensure that no-one has to give up their dream build because the construction time lines in the rules dont allow it. Its a conversation that Ive had with the Assistant Treasurer and something that Ill be continuing to advocate for, as severe weather pushes the six-month period from signing a contract to laying the first slab out a little bit.Finally, I want to touch on the bigger impact of not just HomeBuilder but the broader suite of assistance that has been provided. Last month PVW Partners Townsville Business Confidence Index showed that business confidence in Townsville was at its second highest in 30 years. The Townsville Bulletin quoted PVW Partners managing partner, Carl Valentine, as saying:Business confidence is at its highest in 14 years. The last time we saw results this positive was right before the Global Financial Crisis in 2007 …As we come out of one of the most economically uncertain years in recent history, its fantastic to see the Townsville business community gaining in confidence in such a big way. Mr Valentine cited JobKeeper, cash flow boosts and HomeBuilder as the government programs that have kept the Townsville business community alive. Its fantastic to see that local business confidence has skyrocketed and is the best its been in 14 years, and HomeBuilder has played a big part in that.","HomeBuilder Grant","MOTIONS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr THOMPSON (Herbert) ","(11:36):"

262,0,0,0,1,2,"Gorman, Patrick, MP",74519,"Perth","ALP","N/A",3037," This government loves congratulating itself. Its always boasting about success but never admitting to failure. How good are the WA Liberals? yelled Senator Cash—a key line for the ages. We saw Prime Minister Scott Morrison claim that he won the WA state election. Its just more proof of how out of touch he is with Western Australia. I live in Western Australia, and I can tell the Prime Minister here on the record in Hansard that he did not win the WA state election. Now we have this motion, where the government is congratulating itself for HomeBuilder while doing absolutely nothing for the housing sector. If you need a slogan for a policy, instead of HomeBuilder, what about ShelterSeeker, what about something for the social housing sector, for homeless Australians and for low-income essential workers?We know that homes took on new significance over the last 12 months. They became places of work, places of shelter, places where we had to crush boredom for weeks on end, and, for some people, unfortunately, places of no escape. But when the government are on to a good thing, as the member just told us, they have a tendency to cut it short. We saw it with JobKeeper, which was keeping a million Australians employed. What was the governments response? Theyre going to end it in six days time. We saw it with JobSeeker, which is providing essential support to low-income Australians who are about to see massive rent hikes when various rental freezes are cut off, particularly in my home state of Western Australia. Again, what was the governments response to something that is working well? Shut it down.Then there is HomeBuilder. What will happen to this program? Weve just been told about the million Australians whose jobs are being supported by this program. The government is going to shut it down, with nothing to replace it in the social housing sector. It could fill some of that demand gap. We know that when it comes to the rollout of things, this government is always great at the announcement—and this is just houses; Ill get onto vaccines in a minute. The rollout was bumpy. We had people lodging their applications. We had disputes with state treasuries. We had problems where people couldnt meet the six-month requirement because they hadnt been provided with essential information by the government. We had building licences that didnt meet the governments criteria. It was a mess.Then we had the problem that in some areas it caused unnecessary inflation. The chairman of the Master Builders Goldfields-Esperance branch, Brett Partington, said that buildings that used to take a week now take six weeks and that it has led to a 10 to 20 per cent increase in the cost of building houses and extensions at the moment. This is a huge problem in regional areas, and this government has created it through the poor design of this policy. But its okay because the member for OConnor, Rick Wilson, came to the rescue. Rick loves policy on the fly; he loves making things up.

Its a very worrying trend from this government.One of the final things I want to say is that it is essential that every Australian has somewhere to call home. Weve heard the congratulations from those opposite. Theyve allowed people to improve their homes—those who have maybe saved a few dollars here and there—but there was a very important report released by the member for Macnamara last week, which talked about the housing crisis in Australia. I want to quote from that report. It says:Theres always been a false narrative around people choosing to sleep rough. Anecdotally, it is common to hear that homeless people are choosing that lifestyle, but this is completely wrong.People may choose to live on the street rather than use temporary housing that they can access, because a well-lit street under a CCTV camera can often be safer than an overcrowded and dangerous rooming house.If we look at whats happened in my electorate over the last few years with increases in visible homelessness and a tent city having been erected, we see that there is indeed a crisis that this government has failed to confront when it comes to investing in social housing.","HomeBuilder Grant","MOTIONS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[8]","N/A","N/A"

269,0,0,0,1,2,"Simmonds, Julian, MP",282983,"Ryan","LNP","N/A",3039," Im pleased to rise and support the member for Herberts excellent motion and to reiterate the ongoing success of the Morrison governments HomeBuilder program. You know the government must be onto a winner, in terms of supporting Australians through a government program, when the Labor MPs who speak on the motion do everything but talk about the program in question. The previous Labor speaker spoke about JobKeeper, JobSeeker, homelessness and everything other than the HomeBuilder program, which has been a tremendous success for first home builders and for all Australians.We all know that when the COVID-19 pandemic hit in early 2020, because of the actions that had to be taken to keep lives and livelihoods safe, business confidence suffered and there was the potential for the construction industry to be brought to its knees. This government wasnt going to allow that to happen. It wasnt going to allow the tradies to sit idle and be put out of jobs. The Morrison government acted decisively to implement the HomeBuilder program—a targeted initiative designed to provide eligible owner occupiers, including first home buyers, a $25,000 grant to build a new home or substantially renovate an existing home. Importantly, it would provide critical support for the construction industry, which we know plays a vital role in the Australian economy, employing over a million Australians and generating more than $100 billion of annual economic input.Im so proud that, in my electorate of Ryan, we have not only a number of first home buyers taking up this grant but a number of fantastic companies who are seeing the benefit of this particular program to keep people employed and on the tools. I had the great pleasure of visiting two of those new builds in the Ryan electorate, in Upper Kedron, along with the architect of the scheme, for want of a better word: the Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Housing, Michael Sukkar. Both of the new builds had received the $25,000 HomeBuilder grants. It was great to be there with the minister to not just see the homes being built for these young families but talk to the guys and girls who were on the tools and working. They have plenty of work waiting for them, I have to say, because of this particular program. I want to give a special shout-out to Lloyd Payne, the general manager of Fresh Homes, who was undertaking both of these builds and gave the minister and me a bit of a tour and explained just how critical the HomeBuilder program had been for his business throughout the pandemic. This is a direct quote from Lloyd. He said: Before the HomeBuilder grant, our business was decidedly down. HomeBuilder has really given us and our industry a boost. Thats from somebody who would know and is dealing with it at the coalface.But not only are Lloyd and Fresh Homes doing great work in the Ryan electorate; they also have their business up in Townsville in the member for Herberts electorate, so no doubt he is noticing that as well. Lloyd said this about the member for Herberts electorate—and I can see why the member for Herbert has gone ahead and moved this motion: In Townsville, we are geared to be able to build a bit more volume up there. We went from about 13 to 20 houses a year to about 107 houses. Let me just say that again: because of the HomeBuilder scheme, Lloyd went from building 13 to 20 houses a year to building 107 houses!What HomeBuilder has done for the nation, I believe, is to really stimulate employment and the economy. Its just incredible to see the amount of traffic around the new housing estates where homes are being built. What a tremendous outcome for young families and first home builders around the nation, but particularly in my electorate of Ryan and in the electorate of the mover of this motion, in Townsville, where we are getting these first home buyers and these young families taking up these grants, getting them into their first home or a new home. As well, we are keeping good people like Lloyd and all of his tradies in a job, despite the COVID-19 pandemic and everything that has had to go into dealing with that.Like Lloyd, I am just so passionate about making sure that we can continue to get young Australians into their new homes and to ensure that worksites are booming because of the HomeBuilder grant. Its a tremendously successful initiative that is supporting jobs and delivering, for our construction industry, the confidence that they need, despite the COVID-19 pandemic.It was great, during the visit with Minister Sukkar, to jump on the tools myself. I laid a couple of bricks. I cant say it was too tremendous—the brickies very carefully then took them down once Id left!—but I had a great time doing it, and Im so pleased to be able to support those tradies.","HomeBuilder Grant","MOTIONS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr SIMMONDS (Ryan) ","(11:46):"
270,0,0,0,1,2,"Burns, Josh, MP",278522,"Macnamara","ALP","N/A",3040," When you listen to those opposite, you cannot help but listen to the hubris of this government. They constantly come into this place and the other one and pat themselves on the back and talk about how good a job theyre doing and all of the wonderful things that theyre doing as a government, when the reality facing Australians could not be in starker contrast to the governments delusions. The reality facing young families who are trying to get into the housing sector and into the homeownership market couldnt be further away from the self-congratulatory tone that these people come into this place with, day in and day out.Homeownership in Australia has been a wonderful wealth creator. It has been a wonderful way for Australians to lift themselves out of poverty and find that small level of financial security that is so important, that so many Australians and Australian families have ambition for—to be able to retire with a bit of dignity and with enough assets so that they are comfortable in retirement. But, under the watch of this government—under the watch of people on that side of the House, who have just occupied the treasury bench without any ambition or agenda and governed this country in a slothful way—the ambition to get into the housing market is disappearing for too many Australian families.On average, the net worth of an Australian family is around $980,000, if they are able to get into the housing market, but, if they are unable to, that number is actually about $40,000. Housing is a huge wealth creator in this country. But less than 40 per cent of Australians who are around the age of 30 are able to get into the housing market.So, yes, there is some construction going on in the housing sector, but the incentives that the government are providing mean that those new houses are not owned by the majority of young Australians. Young Australian families—the majority of them—are struggling to get into the housing market. If those opposite think that this job is done, is completely finished, because of a motion in the House of Representatives, then they are kidding themselves. To all of those families—all of those young professionals; all of those young Australians who are desperate to get into the housing market and desperate to be able to get either the constant wages in the amount required or to get that deposit—they are saying: No, were doing a great job. You just need to work a little bit harder. You just need to work a little bit harder, because this government is doing a great job. Well, theyre not.At the moment, the number of young Australians who are struggling to get into the housing market is increasing, and the people who this is disproportionately affecting are Australian women. Australian women are working for less. Theyre working in insecure jobs, working in industries that are paid less on the whole, and taking more breaks off work not just for family and for looking after children but for caring—women are doing a disproportionate amount of caring for family members in this country—and all of that is resulting in insecure housing for Australian women. Australian women over 55 are the fastest growing cohort of homeless Australians. And whats the governments answer to the myriad of issues in the housing sector? Its to come into this place and pat themselves on the back and say, Look how good a job were doing.What the government actually should do instead of congratulating themselves is admit that in the housing sector in Australia we have a real problem with access. We have a real problem with people who want to get into the housing sector, into the housing market, and be able to spend their working life paying off a mortgage and accumulating a financial asset that they can have some dignity in retirement off. But, of course, this government is not interested in those issues of access. All theyre interested in doing is patting themselves on the back and saying, Look how good a job were doing.The final point I want to make, like my friend the member for Perth made very eloquently in his contribution in this debate, is that social housing is the responsibility of anyone who wants to take responsibility for it. To hear the Minister for Housing constantly repeat this nonsense that social housing is the responsibility of the states gets under my skin. The truth is: the only reason its a responsibility of the states is that the federal government takes no responsibility. The only reason the states are doing the heavy lifting is that the federal government are taking no responsibility. It is rubbish. They can and should take responsibility for social housing and the myriad of problems in Australias housing sector.","HomeBuilder Grant","MOTIONS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BURNS (Macnamara) ","(11:51):"

So I had some discussions with Michael Sukkar, the Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Housing. What we looked at was ways that we could encourage—dont go, Member for Perth!—builders to stay in work, because we knew that they were facing an economic cliff. So HomeBuilder was born. Its a $25,000 subsidy to enable owner-occupiers. What the member for Macnamara said about this assisting people who are investors is total rubbish. It assists only owner-occupiers. What it does is help owner-occupiers to build their home—it doesnt have to be their first home. But what we are seeing is the largest increase in owner-occupiers, first home owners, the numbers of people buying and building their first homes, since 2009. So for those opposite to say that this isnt assisting first home buyers or that its assisting investors is fundamentally false.

Its one of the largest employers and sectors in the country, and, as someone who has been intricately involved and linked to it for the last 32-odd years, I can say it is a great sector. Despite the CFMEU, it is a great sector. HomeBuilder is not just helping people to buy their homes; its helping people to stay in jobs.I would have thought that those opposite would have been interested in job creation, particularly in what we once called the blue-collar sector, the trades. But those opposite, the Labor Party, have totally abandoned the construction sector and the trade sector. Ill tell you why—and this is proof positive of this happening.

277,0,0,0,1,2,"Phillips, Fiona, MP",147140,"Gilmore","ALP","N/A",3042," I absolutely support jobs in the construction industry. It is absolutely great news that HomeBuilder has provided some stimulus to the economy—that is true—but it has certainly been no magic wand, particularly for people in my electorate on the New South Wales South Coast. When HomeBuilder was first announced, many local people thought that this would be great for them. We had only just been through the devastation of the bushfires. In the Shoalhaven and the Eurobodalla, 1,037 homes were lost or severely damaged, so it is safe to say that a lot of building work was needed. Local people were contending with underinsurance and increased building costs because of changes to bushfire attack level, or BAL, ratings, and an extra $25,000 to help would certainly have made a difference. Personally, I would have liked to see the Morrison government dedicate funding specifically to help bushfire victims rebuild, but, like I said, we took what we could get from this government.It didnt take long before it was clear that HomeBuilder would simply not help many local people impacted by the bushfires at all. Roslyn, who lost her home in Conjola Park, one of the hardest hit areas, signed a contract to rebuild her home in March 2020. She was committed to getting on with things as quickly as she could. She thought this would help her recover from her loss sooner, but that meant she was excluded from HomeBuilder. I wrote to the Treasurer and asked him to make an exception. I got a response two months later from his chief of staff—a resounding no. What was the governments advice? Go and see the Red Cross. Its appalling.On the other end of this spectrum are a number of families who are not quite as organised as Roslyn. Because of circumstances beyond their control, they cannot get a contract signed in time to be eligible, but the government wont make allowances for them either. Fiona and Ian from Yatte Yattah lost their home and tried to apply for HomeBuilder, but they felt exhausted by the level of paperwork and constant requests for further information. Then there are Peter and David. Peter and David are mirror twin brothers from Jeremadra. They have lived together for 68 years and they jointly owned the home they lost in the bushfires. Like so many others, they have had to make special adjustments to their rebuild, like the massive underground water tank they had to install. How much did that cost them? It cost $25,000—perfect; HomeBuilder can take care of that! But again this government has shown its cruel heart to be just that. It has denied Peter and Davids application. Why? Because they are siblings, and the eligibility explicitly excludes siblings from accessing the program. This makes absolutely no sense. I also wrote to the minister for Peter and David. Im still waiting on that response. So far the silence has been deafening.I have been hearing about another unintended consequence of HomeBuilder that is hurting bushfire victims in my electorate. With so much of our forest burnt and with the added demand of HomeBuilder, the timber industry is in crisis. Timber for building is either not available or incredibly expensive, and it is our bushfire impacted families that are bearing the brunt. And what is the government doing? Its grant programs to help the timber industry have been slow to roll out, and, with no transparency or accountability, it is difficult to see how they have helped. The reality is the government has no plan to address this crisis, even though it has been clear for more than a year that it was coming. Instead, its programs have made things worse, not better—flashy announcement, failed delivery once more.There is one last point I would like to make about HomeBuilder. The South Coast has the lowest rental vacancy rate in New South Wales, at 0.3 per cent. We are experiencing a housing crisis. It is dire. Once again, the government saw this coming. It should be a shock to no-one. Investing in affordable and social housing projects would have stimulated the economy and helped the construction industry while also addressing the unfolding and urgent housing crisis we are now facing. Instead, the government took the short-sighted path. It took the path that would help people in the city undertake extravagant renovations, instead of helping bushfire victims and instead of addressing the housing crisis impacting on everyday families across the South Coast. HomeBuilder has been nothing more than a wasted opportunity which has left vulnerable people in my electorate behind.","HomeBuilder Grant","MOTIONS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs PHILLIPS (Gilmore) ","(12:02):"
278,0,0,0,1,2,"Hamilton, Garth, MP",291387,"Groom","LNP","N/A",3044," In my electorate of Groom, the construction industry is one of the key building blocks of our local economy. From major national firms, like FKG and Hutchison Builders, to small mum-and-dad operations, Toowoomba region businesses deliver big at both the residential and the commercial levels. The sector employs nearly 7,000 people and generated $819 million in the last financial year, making it our regions third most valuable industry. And its an industry that has not only survived but thrived during the challenges of COVID-19. Our local building boom has been supported by mass migration to the regions, with young people and families making the tree change to Toowoomba, and by this governments HomeBuilder scheme, which has seen 93,403 applications and over 14,578 grants paid nationwide since its launch.The take-up of this program has turned around the fortunes of developments like the Avenues of Highfields, which sits in my electorate. Project director Stephen Bowers tells me he was feeling pretty sick about the COVID situation last February. Werent we all! But, since HomeBuilder was announced, hes gone on to sell 220 lots, 50 per cent of those to first home buyers. Theyve now released the next stage of the development, four years ahead of schedule, showing that this truly is a market-led recovery. The Toowoomba region has truly answered the Morrison governments call to renovate, extend and build.The December ABS approvals data show that a remarkable turnaround took place in the last three months of 2020, with Darling Downs dwelling approvals skyrocketing by 121 per cent. The anecdotal evidence is that tradies are so flat out that there is a two-week waiting list for any of them. Local suppliers are now seeing shortages of some key materials, with sandstone blocks, crusher dust and most timber products in limited supply. This follows a national trend, with the Housing Industry Associations New home sales report for February showing that new home sales rose 60 per cent in the three months to February compared to the same three months in the previous year, while Master Builders Australia have revised up their projections for new dwelling starts for 2021 from 124,000 to 160,000. It is anticipated that 30,000 of those will be built in Queensland.More of these homes will go to first-time buyers. In December 2020 the number of new loans to owner-occupier first home buyers was at its highest level since June 2009, during the GFC, when first home buyer grants were tripled. First home buyers now account for 42.5 per cent of new owner-occupier loans, which is above the 10-year average.A division having been called in the House of Representatives—Sitting suspended from 12:10 to 12:24","HomeBuilder Grant","MOTIONS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr HAMILTON (Groom) ","(12:07):"

The Morrison government is truly committed to helping more Australians get into a home of their own sooner. The First Home Loan Deposit Scheme is another mechanism we have leveraged. It was accessed by almost 20,000 first home buyers in 2020, with over 15,000 of those applications settled. An extension of this scheme supports the one million Australians engaged in the construction sector, at a time when the economy needs it most.The huge demand for new homes in the Toowoomba region is also creating jobs for young people, with local construction firms expanding their teams. In my electorate, weve seen 846 apprentices registered through the Morrison governments $1.2 billion wage subsidy program. This program enables eligible businesses to be reimbursed up to 50 per cent of an apprentices or trainees wage, up to $7,000 per quarter. The announcement of the extension to this program received high praise in the Toowoomba Chronicle last week, with the headline reading: Toowoomba apprentices, trainers welcome extension to federal governments $1.2 billion subsidy scheme. Its a great title for an article. In the article, the CEO of Downs Group Training, Kris McCue, was quoted as saying:I think it will create a boost to apprentice numbers, weve already seen a big increase in numbers, and we see that continuing because its promoting confidence in the sector.Across the nation, its estimated this demand-driven expansion will generate around 70,000 new apprentice and trainee places, building on the almost 40,000 businesses whove taken on a new Australian apprentice or trainee since the start of the Boosting Apprenticeship Commencements program. This is the evidence that local employers are feeling confident enough to expand their teams, growing the construction skills pipeline in our region thats so important for future projects like Inland Rail.Looking at this big picture, its easy to see that the HomeBuilder grants have been critical in supporting the Toowoomba regions residential construction sector through COVID, easing the strain on housing availability and helping build a strong base for our overall economic recovery.

280,0,0,0,1,2,"Swanson, Meryl, MP",264170,"Paterson","ALP","N/A",3045," Small business is one of the most important aspects of our economy. I would argue its the foundation on which our country has been built, from when our Indigenous brothers and sisters participated in small business and traded to today, when weve got young people who are designing their own gumboots, having them made here in Australia and selling them. With this weather, I hope its going gangbusters.The Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman tells us that small business employs a whopping 44 per cent of our workforce—44 per cent!—and contributes around 35 per cent of total GDP. Its no wonder, then, that we rely so much on the hard work and enterprise that goes into starting, developing and growing small businesses, not to mention the risk that people take, often mortgaging their homes or asking parents and friends to go guarantor for a business. Theyre the lifeblood of our national economy and our local economies, too.It shouldnt need pointing out, then, that the scourge of COVID has hit our small communities and our small businesses for six. No electorate has been exempted from the financial destruction that the pandemic has wrought. For those fortunate enough to still have regular employment, the shock is still felt, and in my own electorate of Paterson Ive had many discussions with business owners who are facing the very real threat of ruin, if they havent already had that happen.Michelle Chrimes is a travel agent in my electorate. Her business has plummeted because of COVID. Her business relies on bookings for international travellers, and its obvious that restrictions on national borders have decimated her income. Michelle was eligible for JobKeeper, and that has been a great help. Unfortunately, shes not eligible for the consumer travel support program. She cites issues in definitions around eligibility criteria as impeding her claim, an issue which anecdotally she says is being experienced by many others in her situation. Again, red tape is making it difficult when it should be an easier process.While we should give credit where its due in relation to the JobKeeper program, we must also identify the shortcomings. It came later than it should have, after we, Labor, dragged the government to the table, and now its being extinguished sooner than it should be, while we plead to the government to keep it going. Claims of JobKeeper being rorted by the bigger players are rife, and this government refuses to acknowledge the fact or act. As with bushfire assistance funding, the announcements for funding are made but badly delivered—critically, if theyre delivered at all. I hope we dont see this with the flooding that now is wreaking havoc right across New South Wales and into South-East Queensland.We now have a package for the aviation sector. Once again, this is welcome news. Ive met with and support the aviation sector in my own electorate and appreciate the benefit that it brings to the Paterson economy. What we need from this government, however, is a comprehensive and understandable approach that can be effectively rolled out in a reasonable time. What we have instead is a government reacting rather than planning and, basically, picking winners, rather than doing it in a considered and fair way. They receive pressure from industry and then they make a snap decision on the run. I sincerely hope we are seeing the light at the end of the COVID tunnel, but we are a way off yet. Its too soon to pull the rug out from the small business economy.We need a national governmental approach that recognises that all Australians need assistance. We shouldnt leave out universities and councils, and we shouldnt implement assistance schemes that hardly anyone understands and that are funded yet made no use of. Thats the criminality of this; its just a crying shame that the assistance is there but it is so difficult for people to make use of. It should be easy. We should have systems in place that help people. If the money is there, it should be spent and it should be spent on small business—getting it supported and up and running as soon as it can be.For a government that boasts about being the partner to business and the economy, believe me when I say that I would welcome them showing some form in that department, because, so far, they have left too many behind, and were seeing it again with the rollout of the vaccine. Its there but is not being implemented by this government well enough. Our small business community, like our GPs and their receptionists—if youre a GP receptionist, I feel sorry for you. Keep up the good work, but you do need a government to back you in properly.","HomeBuilder Grant","MOTIONS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms SWANSON (Paterson) ","(12:26):"

They have since been tried in a Cambodian court. Their trials and the trials of hundreds of others are suspended at the moment due to COVID, in effect. We think theyve been charged with incitement, but were not really clear, because theyve received no notification of the charges. They heard about them second-hand, third-hand, fourth-hand or in rumours transmitted on the internet, because the charge sheets were all nailed to the door of a banned political party in Phnom Penh. Thats the extent of the legal due process, and this farce that will ultimately, sadly, unless a political resolution is found, lead to a kangaroo court where theyre tried, convicted, fined, banned and so on. They include constituents of mine and friends of mine: Mr Hong Lim, who served for over 20 years as a member of the Victorian state parliament, Hemara In and many other activists. And I know there are also people in New South Wales and elsewhere around Australia. Just be clear: these are Australian citizens. The aim of these charges is not to prosecute for real crimes. Its a tactic out of the authoritarian playbook of gangsters like Hun Sen to silence dissent, this time in diaspora communities.I asked the Department of Foreign Affairs and other experts if this was a new thing. Is Hun Sen going to go to the international conference of gangster authoritarians and say: Look at this new tactic. Heres a PowerPoint slide on how to do it? The answer was no; its stuff weve seen before. I think Egypt might have used similar tactics some years ago, so it pops up every now and again. But its not a tactic that democracies like Australia can or should ever accept. Its foreign interference. In effect, thats what it is; it is foreign interference in the right of our citizens here in Australia to freely express their minds. I ask every member to think about this. If someone like Hong Lim, who has served for 20 years as a representative in the Victorian parliament, can be charged with incitement simply for speaking up for democracy and human rights in Cambodia—Australia was a signatory to the Paris accords almost 30 years ago, where they signed up for democracy and human rights—then any member of this House who speaks up for democracy and human rights could be so charged. I think its important, but, since that time, three months ago, what response have we had from the Minister for Foreign Affairs? Nothing—absolutely nothing. To say Im disappointed with that is an understatement. Ive written to the foreign minister. My constituents have raised it with DFAT. I got a hearing from DFAT and the ministers office. But this is a matter of principle. The precedent cannot be allowed to stand. We expect the foreign minister to speak up for these values and to shape and lead debate, not to run away from it. I think the last time she was sighted in public was in the member for Gilmores electorate, where she was challenged. The member for Gilmore turned up and she literally walked away, got in her car and drove back to Sydney.When I first raised this matter publicly, Radio Free Asia interviewed one of the Cambodian government ministers, who said: Well, that member of parliament doesnt represent the governments views. The government supports what we do, because the government just gave us $35 million. We should have promised $35 million—its for COVID—but we need the foreign minister to speak up at the same time and defend our values, lest our generosity and aid be used as propaganda against us. To be clear: Australian citizens are subject to these charges. It is serious business. As a kangaroo court or whatever, its all a bit funny. Well, its not funny if you have a criminal record all of a sudden that you have to declare for the rest of your life and its not funny if you want to travel anywhere in South-East Asia, China or much of the world that has extradition treaties with Cambodia. We need the government to take this seriously. Theyve had months. Go and talk to our friends and neighbours who are also subject to this. Its not a tactic that can be left to slide because the foreign minister is too busy or doesnt care. I believe shes someone who believes in and supports human rights—Im told that consistently by people—but this is part of a much broader tactic, as the motion explains. There are hundreds of people around the world who have been subject to these charges in Cambodia, with many of them jailed, and around diaspora communities globally in these kangaroo courts. The only way to deal with this is to speak up and to work with like-minded countries.The European Parliament passed a motion in the last few weeks and Ive echoed many aspects of that motion here, on our Notice Paper, for our parliament to think about and debate. The United States government made a statement, but all weve had is silence from the Australian government. Thats shameful. Theyre not our values. I dont believe that the member who will speak next shares authoritarian views on democracy and human rights. All were asking is that the person who is charged with leading our foreign policy and speaking to the world speaks up and says something in defence of our values and my constituents.","Human Rights: Cambodia","MOTIONS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr HILL (Bruce) ","(12:31):"

It is noted that a member of parliament—in this case Julian Hill, the member for Bruce—spoke out and therefore another member of parliament, in their parliament, was questioned and responded. So its not as though we dont exist. We do exist.

Therefore, it is the intention of that regime to have an effect on what is happening with the diaspora here in Australia. I want to make the point that allegations such as these are inappropriate when they feed back into our sovereign nation. It should be known by those regimes that they have no right, no human right, to convict these people, as residents of Australia, in absentia.I just want to defend the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I know its fun to make personal attacks on ministers in this House and to suggest that they do not perform, but the fact is that, as you have just addressed, we care so much about the Cambodian people—not the regime, the Cambodian people—we are prepared as a nation to invest $35 million into their health and wellbeing around COVID. But I dont want to run out of time, because theres a lot to say on this issue.Ive been in and out of this place since 1990, more out than in. Recently Ive stayed for a while. Its been at least a comfortable visit over the last few years! To my knowledge, in the times that Ive been overseas—and I havent been there with any of the members in the room at the moment—we have been highly regarded for our efforts in regard to human rights wherever we go. When Ive been on delegations, theyve thanked us for the efforts the nation has put in on behalf of, especially, minorities in countries. They know Australia cares. They know we take an interest. They know we do it at every level of our activity, at the top ministerial level, even at the prime ministerial level, at the cabinet ministerial level and the junior ministerial level, but especially at the DFAT level.Ive had occasion to interact with DFAT personnel outside of the structures of this parliament, particularly the committees, where I think they are inhibited, restricted and controlled as to what they can say and how they can say it because theyre following a strict departmental line. But when you meet them at a social gathering and are able to have a discussion about what they do, theyre invigorated and excited about their work. Most parliamentarians never even find out what DFAT does. They wouldnt have a clue how effective our foreign interactions are on behalf of our nation. Its always an eye-opener to me how effective our foreign ministry is. I thank them, I applaud them and I honour them for the work that they do on our behalf, and I hope that they continue with everything thats been outlined here. I have a list of what weve done in regard to human rights regarding Cambodia.This nation actually cares. We dont want these types of things to happen again.

Thats a statement by the US based Brookings Institution. It puts into perspective the grave human rights situation faced in many countries around the globe, with research indicating that after decades of expansion democracy is now entering a period of retreat. Clearly, Cambodia is not immune to that trend. On that note, I also thank the member for Bruce for his motion and for his ongoing advocacy, particularly in regard to human rights for the people of Cambodia. Like the member for Bruce and the member for Werriwa, I have been contacted by many members of the Cambodian diaspora who are worried about the deteriorating human rights situation in Cambodia.The Cambodian elections in 2018 were nothing short of a sham. The reinstatement of the Hun Sen governments 33-year reign effectively returned Cambodia to a one-party autocratic state. The elections were neither free nor fair and failed to represent the genuine will of the Cambodian people, given the level of voter intimidation and the absence of any viable challengers. You will recall that the government arrested the opposition leader, Kem Sokha, dissolved the main opposition party and led an assault on media organisations and NGOs critical of government policies. The situation in Cambodia in terms of political and human rights developments remains highly repressive. The Hun Sen government has continued its crackdown against critical independent voices and forced the closure of many media outlets. The space for civil society also continues to be narrow, with significant limitation on freedom of expression, including the arrest and detention of a number of political activists, of whom I understand 60 remain in prison.The COVID-19 pandemic has also been used by Hun Sen as a pretext to further his grip on power. In 2020, according to a Human Rights Watch report, the Hun Sen government repeatedly resorted to violence against protesters, opposition party members and ordinary citizens for peaceful expressions of their opinions. The Cambodian government has manipulated the situation involving the COVID-19 pandemic to enact a state of emergency law severely restricting ongoing civil liberty. It allows the granting of extensive powers to the Prime Minister, including bans on the distribution of information, intrusive surveillance on telecommunications and total control of the media. It also empowers the government to restrict movement and demonstrations, and it opens the way for unfettered aspects of government control.If this wasnt enough, these laws are being imposed with disproportionate penalties, with Amnesty International noting that the legislation allows for prison sentences of up to 10 years on convictions. If thats not alarming enough, it is particularly problematic in Cambodia, where the courts essentially act on the whim of the government. The courts do not act with necessary judicial independence.We now see, as has been spoken about, foreign interference from the Hun Sen government even being played out here in our university campuses, business and charities, where support bases have been actively built for this Cambodian dictator. In February this year, Radio Australia reported on the multimillion dollar investments made in Australia by many of the Cambodian ruling elite over the last five years. On this note I call on the government to follow the lead of the United States and consider imposing targeted sanctions, including travel bans and asset freezes, against Cambodian political and military leaders who are found to be responsible for corruption and serious human rights violations. Clearly the situation in Cambodia is a perfect example of why it would be prudent to legislate Magnitsky-style legislation.In the 1990s Australia played a leading role in helping transform Cambodia from a communist dictatorship to a multiparty democracy. For the sake of humanity its now time to show the same level of commitment.","Human Rights: Cambodia","MOTIONS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr HAYES (Fowler—Chief Opposition Whip) ","(12:43):"
292,0,0,0,1,2,"Stanley, Anne, MP",265990,"Werriwa","ALP","N/A",3051," I rise to speak on the motion identifying the harassment, intimidation and politically motivated criminal charges against the people of Cambodia by its government. Governments need to be challenged and democracies held to account. To silence any criticism and to censor any dissent is the work of an authoritarian government. Its easy to take for granted the openness in which democracy is practised here in Australia. Its also easy to forget that democracy and freedom from authoritarian rule must be fought for.The politically motivated mass trials occurring in Cambodia are undemocratic, draconian and ultimately a blatant disregard of the human rights of those charged. By the end of last year, almost 130 people who openly criticised the government were charged with treason for passive, non-violent political activity. Many of those arrested are members of the sole opposition party in Cambodia, the Cambodian National Rescue Party.Prior to the Cambodian election in 2018 Hun Sen, the Prime Minister and leader of the ruling Cambodian Peoples Party, fearing a potential challenge from opposition, began pressuring the media to refuse opposition air time. Following this, the opposition were forced by the Cambodian high court to disband the party. All lawmakers from the opposition were removed from parliament. The explanation justifying the tyrannical act of arresting and imprisoning the opposition was conspiracy to commit treason and incitement to commit a felony. Prime Minister Hun Sen has been in power for 35 years and is known to frequently tread the waters of dictatorship. Now, he seems to have jumped into the ocean that is totalitarianism, winning the 2018 election—using an unfair and undemocratic election—in a landslide, obtaining all seats. Obviously this election has been called a sham.Sam Rainsy, the co-founder of the National Rescue Party, has been in exile since 2016, avoiding serving prison sentences for defamation and other charges. I had the pleasure of meeting Mr Rainsy in August 2019. Mr Rainsy, accompanied by a group of Cambodian activists, came to speak to me about the troubling situation in Cambodia. Many Cambodians in my community were on hand to see Mr Rainsy.My community benefits from a strong and vibrant Cambodian diaspora. Ive talked with many Cambodian people in my community and Ive heard their stories. I spoke with one much older woman whose whole family was gunned down. She told me about the traumatic day she lost her family. She told me how she was alone waiting for someone to come and help her. Later she escaped to Australia and re-established her life here. However, her very sad story is all too common. They have seen what has happened in Cambodia before and they are scared about what is happening now. Cambodians in my community are very concerned about the political situation in their home country and how it may still reach them here. Theyre concerned about the threats they receive from the Cambodian government—which, if correct, are simply unacceptable. Cambodia has also seen a marked increase in corruption. Transparency Internationals 2020 Corruption Perceptions Index ranks Cambodia 161st out of 180 nations.Im deeply concerned by the suppression of democracy in Cambodia and the conduct of the recent elections, and I, along with my Cambodian colleagues, have long supported a peaceful and democratic Cambodia. The development of strong democratic practices and institutions, including a free press in a civil society, is crucial to the countrys long-term prosperity, as it is for all free societies in the world. As a longstanding friend of Cambodia, Australia must continue to urge the government to take steps to allow free and open political debate and participation without violence and intimidation. Australia should again show leadership to ensure that the promises made for fair and democratic elections in that country happen.Im concerned to see voices unfairly silenced, and I share the concerns of the member for Bruce and all those whove spoken on this motion. I note that the motion calls on the Australian government to examine the imposition of targeted sanctions, including travel bans and asset freezes, against political and military leaders who continue serious human rights violations. I thank all members and I thank my community for their support on this issue.","Human Rights: Cambodia","MOTIONS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms STANLEY (Werriwa—Opposition Whip) ","(12:48):"
293,0,0,0,1,2,"Owens, Julie, MP","E09","Parramatta","ALP","N/A",3052," Weve been hearing for a couple of years now about attempts by the Cambodian Peoples Party to coerce students in Australia into supporting the party back in Cambodia. We hear about financial inducements, threats and threats against family at home—any way they can find to ensure that students in Australia, residents in Australia and citizens of Australia do not speak out against the government of Cambodia. Of course that is not acceptable, and can I quietly urge the government to be more active in this particular area of foreign influence, because were talking here about some very young people in the early stages of their adult lives. Theyre trying to develop an education, trying to find their place in the world, in many cases trying to live in a new country, and theyre feeling this incredible threat over their head on a daily basis. They tell me they literally look over their shoulder when they arrive home to ensure that the garage door is closed before they get out of their car—things that we shouldnt have to do in this country.This was brought to my attention—apart from what Id been reading in the media—by a man in my community called Sawathey, who came here in the eighties. Hes been here for quite a while. Hes an extraordinary man who came to Australia during the time of the Khmer Rouge and has built a life here. He established legal centres that gave legal advice to people who couldnt afford it. He has made an extraordinary contribution here and is trying to live his life here now, as a mature adult, and is still feeling the weight and the burden of his first country on him as he goes about his life here in Australia, and thats an extraordinary thing.Ive never had to flee a regime. Ive lived in a country where you can decide to live a life and believe you can achieve it and choose to be here. I want to say to the people in this parliament and to those out there who have never fled a regime: imagine if youd fled a country that you loved, where your heart was, where your memories were and, quite often, where your family is; you would not really be here until you could go home and you decided not to. While you cant go home, you dont really choose. And thats not me saying that theyre not committed to Australia, because they are; refugees commit with their heads in a way that most of us dont and they make this life work. But its like breaking up with a person you love. You break up twice: once when you break up and once again when you grieve for the fact that you wouldnt go back. When the people who come to Australia from violent regimes, traumatised, know that they could return, thats the moment when their lives settle.For Cambodian refugees in Australia, thats probably not going to happen in their lifetime. But at least we—as people in power, in government—can listen to the thousands of Cambodians in this country who are saying they are afraid, who are saying that that history and their trauma continue through their life right now; that they can feel Cambodia reaching out into their community and tapping them on the shoulder; that they know people in the Cambodian community who observe them and who report on them and who threaten them. If were not prepared to deal with that, were not doing what we, as a responsible government and opposition, should do. We should be making sure that our Australian residents and citizens can live safely, and, if any foreign government is causing our residents to feel fear, we should be having something to say about it and we should be doing so in the strongest possible language.We are an incredibly rich country because of the people who have come here and who call Australia their home. We have the world in us. There isnt a country youd rather be in at the moment, with the way the world is going global, with the way people cross borders, with the way theyll do that online and with the way businesses are no longer necessarily based in a geographic location. We have everything we need to flourish in this world, and part of that is because people have chosen to come here and live. Theyve had different experiences from the rest of us. And that sounds terrible—thats not the way I meant it. They have different experiences. Each group that comes has had different experiences, different language, different philosophy and different ways of perceiving the world. And we need to make sure that they can make the most significant contribution they can. In order to do that, they need to do it safely. We need to act on this. Its not good enough. So, again, I urge the government to have a look at this and take action.","Human Rights: Cambodia","MOTIONS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms OWENS (Parramatta) ","(12:53):"

296,0,0,0,1,2,"Young, Terry, MP",201906,"Longman","LNP","N/A",3054," I move:That this House:(1) notes that Government is committed to ensuring that all Australians, including young Australians, have every opportunity to succeed in post-pandemic Australia;(2) acknowledges that the Government has over 200 initiatives that directly and indirectly benefit young Australians;(3) recognises that:(a) the Governments $1 billion JobTrainer Fund will provide over 300,000 vocational education and training places for school leavers and job seekers; and(b) the JobMaker Hiring Credit scheme is encouraging businesses to hire young Australians; and(4) notes that the Government is investing an additional $1.2 billion to support businesses to employ 100,000 new apprentices.Last week we had some great news on employment figures. The national unemployment rate dropped from 6.4 per cent in January to 5.8 per cent in February. This is an outstanding result and its no exaggeration to say it exceeded our expectations. Importantly, more than 40 per cent of the 88,700 new jobs created in that period went to young people. The Morrison governments job creation initiatives through the COVID pandemic have worked and they continue to work. But there is still one area that, historically, has not been good enough, and that is getting young people into work.Youth unemployment in Australia is more than double the national unemployment rate, at 12.9 per cent. Its been somewhat encouraging to see this figure decrease in the last month, down by 1.1 per cent. In my home state of Queensland, the youth unemployment figure is even more concerning, at 15.1 per cent. Only South Australias is higher. In the Moreton Bay-North statistical area, which includes my electorate of Longman, the figure has historically been higher than the state average. But why? Why was this the case even before the pandemic struck? Why are there so many young people classed as unemployed compared with the national average? Firstly, young people often have little or no labour market experience and frequently lack relevant skills. Secondly, businesses face higher costs of investment and lower costs of termination when theyre employing young workers. Younger people tend to move between joblessness, training and working and are more likely to enter temporary and insecure employment. Youth employment has also been hard hit by COVID-19, as young people are overrepresented in industries that have been heavily affected by health restrictions, such as accommodation, food services, the arts and recreation.This is why the Morrison government is focusing on initiatives that aim to get young people across the country, including in my electorate, into a job. We are committed to supporting young Australians back into jobs or training through the JobMaker hiring credit, the Boosting Apprenticeship Commencements wage subsidy and the JobTrainer fund. We also want to ensure that all Australians, particularly young Australians, have every opportunity to succeed as we bounce back from the global pandemic and recession.The $1 billion JobTrainer fund will provide around 300,000 additional free or low-fee training places to help young people, including school leavers and jobseekers, gain the skills they need to get a job. Crucially, the program targets training for jobs that are in demand. Participants can choose from a range of accredited diplomas, certificates and short courses in areas like health, aged and disability care; IT; and trades. So, if your age is between 17 and 24 and youre looking for work or looking for a career change, you may be able to study a free or low-fee course through JobTrainer.Additionally, the Morrison governments $4 billion JobMaker hiring credit provides an incentive for businesses to employ young jobseekers who are between 16 and 35 years of age. The credit is available to employers who hire people in that age bracket who are receiving JobSeeker payments. The employer is paid at a rate of $200 per week for an employee under 30 years old, and at $100 for those between 30 and 35 years old. Were also investing heavily in employment services targeted at helping young Australians become job ready and to obtain and stay in a job. This includes $21.9 million to connect more young people to youth specialist employment services and targeted support like the Transition to Work service. Under this program, young people can get access to a Transition to Work provider and receive tailored, vocational and non-vocational support and advice.There is also the Youth Jobs PaTH program, which helps young people gain the skills and work experience they need to obtain and keep a job. This includes a youth bonus wage subsidy of up to $10,000 to support the employment of young people. More than 116,000 young people have participated in at least one element of PaTH, and, of those, more than 62 per cent have received a job placement, which is great news.The government is also encouraging employers to take on more apprentices and trainees through the Boosting Apprenticeship Commencements wage subsidy. These entry-level positions are a key pathway to employment for young people. The wage subsidy will also help prevent any future skill shortage. Just this month we lifted the cap on places under this program and extended it by a full 12 months, given its massive success to date.The youth employment rate in my electorate and across the country is simply not good enough. The other thing Id like to implore young people to consider is fruit picking. We have a crisis in many agricultural areas, including my area. In my electorate of Longman, we are desperate for strawberry-pickers and berry-pickers, so please have a look at that. Weve seen from the most recent unemployment data that this is working.","COVID-19: Employment","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr YOUNG (Longman) ","(12:58):"

301,0,0,0,1,2,"Wells, Anika, MP",264121,"Lilley","ALP","N/A",3056," History tells us that young people are often the most vulnerable to economic shocks. While older generations are often better prepared to weather a weak labour market through alternative sources of income, younger generations have not had the luxury of time to accrue an equivalent security nest egg. During COVID, the hospitality, arts, retail and recreation industries, which collectively employ 45 per cent of young people, were the first hit and they were the worst hit. Job losses in these sectors were exacerbated by the fact that more than half of hospitality staff and over one-third of retail, arts and recreation employees are casuals and were thus excluded from receiving JobKeeper altogether.In my policy paper published by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, I discussed the urgent need to evaluate the scarring effects of an economic recession on the youth labour market and to develop appropriately adapted labour market interventions to address the widening ravine in outcomes. I warned that, if we did not take action to prevent youth labour market scarring, the time-honoured covenant of generation-on-generation progress would be under threat and that existing intergenerational inequality would only widen.Enter stage right the JobMaker hiring credit, the newest addition to the Morrison governments suite of rhyming marketing slogans designed to tackle record-low youth unemployment. JobMaker was a $4 billion hiring credit that was supposed to encourage employers to create new jobs for young people. So far so good. The details of this scheme immediately raised a few red flags, though. Wouldnt this credit create a Hunger Games style job market, which would pit older and younger workers against each other? What would stop an employer from sacking an older worker who works 40 hours a week and hiring two young people to work 20 hours a week each? Wouldnt this just increase rampant underemployment of young people and unemployment of older people?Labor werent alone in our apprehension of the scheme. The Treasury also had some concerns, suggesting that the JobMaker hiring credit would create only 45,000 new jobs and that most of these jobs would have been created without the subsidy in the first place. Treasury documents also revealed that the scheme would allow an employer to sack a full-time worker over 35 in order to get more hours out of multiple part-time workers at no extra cost. However, never letting the truth get in the way of a good announcement, the Morrison government persisted.With the benefit of hindsight, I now realise that Labor and the Treasury had overlooked one key issue—that is, the Morrison governments inability to effectively implement any policy beyond the announcement. It turns out that the JobMaker hiring credit hasnt hurt older workers and hasnt boosted underemployment amongst younger workers because it hasnt actually done anything at all. The JobMaker scheme has created just 521 new jobs, with approximately $800,000 invested. Thats 0.1 per cent of jobs promised and 0.02 per cent invested. It is so comical it almost feels like an episode of Utopia playing out.On the weekend, the Treasurer suggested that the federal government was looking to overhaul the plan, citing better than expected unemployment rates in February. He stated that the unemployment rate had fallen from 6.3 per cent to 5.8 per cent. That sounds great and is technically true, but it doesnt accurately reflect youth unemployment, which this program was supposed to support. When you break unemployment down by age category it tells a much different story. The truth is that the youth unemployment rate is still higher than it was a year ago, by 109,000 people. Youth unemployment is at 12.9 per cent. There are currently 805,200 young people unemployed in Australia. For the Treasurer to say that the JobMaker scheme hasnt worked because unemployment is doing too well isnt spin; it is a flat-out lie. Right now we have a whole generation of young people who have no guarantee of sustainable or secure employment.Before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, the top issue that kept millennials and gen Z awake at night was the welfare of their family, before subsequent concerns about career prospects and their long-term financial future. What started as a funny joke from the Betoota Advocate is now no longer funny to millions of young Australians who need more than an announcement in high-vis and a hard hat from Scotty from Marketing in order to pay their bills. Young people need a comprehensive plan that ensures that all Australians can look forward to a future that offers secure, decent jobs and a vibrant future for their families and their communities. This week Ill be leading by example and seeking leave to table the Lilley 2021-22 budget submission, which will improve the lives of northsiders by creating real jobs if implemented.As for JobTrainer, Id first like to point out an error in the member for Longmans motion. It isnt the governments $1 billion JobTrainer Fund. The federal government are contributing half of that—$500 million—while the states and territories are kicking in the remaining $500 million. It is a crisis of the federal governments own design. Since 2013 theyve cut $3 billion from the TAFE and training budget and short-changed TAFE.

302,0,0,0,1,2,"Leeser, Julian, MP",109556,"Berowra","LP","N/A",3057," One of my great concerns since the pandemic began was about the unemployment of our young people, particularly the level of unemployment of our young people. Research from the previous global shocks indicates that the longer a person is on welfare the harder it is for them to get off welfare benefits. Thats why it is critical that we get people off welfare and into a job. The research indicates something particularly for young people. In 2018, according to the Reserve Bank of Australia, poor labour market outcomes early on not only affect an individuals future employability but also have persistent negative effects on lifetime earnings. So, if a young person doesnt get a job early in their career, it makes them less employable later and it also affects their total earnings. Research has found a similar deterioration in labour market outcomes for younger workers who entered the labour market in Australia after the global financial crisis compared to previous cohorts.Long-term unemployment is a human tragedy for each and every person who finds themselves in that situation. Thats why the Morrison government has had a sustained focus on getting young people back into work. Young Australians have lost their jobs at greater levels than any other age group. Thats because, as other speakers have said, young people tend to work in areas like accommodation, food services, arts and recreation, and those areas have been particularly affected by the COVID-19 lockdown. Encouragingly, almost all of the jobs that were lost after March last year have returned. Indeed, employment is now 3,600 above its pre-COVID level. However, the rate of youth unemployment is still too high. While the rest of the population has an unemployment rate of 5.8 per cent, the youth unemployment rate is 12.9 per cent. Thats why weve particularly focused on a couple of measures which are the subject of this motion today: the $4 billion JobMaker hiring credit and the $2.4 billion Boosting Apprenticeship Commencements wage subsidy.I want to spend a few minutes on the Boosting Apprenticeship Commencements wage subsidy, which I think has been the runaway success of the governments youth employment programs. On 4 October last year, the government announced $1.2 billion to encourage employers to take up an apprentice through the subsidy scheme. That program has been such a runaway success. It was supposed to last for 12 months, but within five months 100,000 apprentices had been employed. Four hundred and thirty-two of those apprentices are in my electorate of Berowra. This doesnt surprise me. From going to and talking to businesses, I know they are all so keen at this point in time to give a young person a go and to give an apprentice a go. Whether its in the automotive industry, in food production, in metalwork businesses or in oil and lubricant businesses, people are focused on getting the economy moving, and the wage subsidy has provided them the impetus that they need to employ young people. Thats why, on 9 March, we announced that we would extend the program with an additional $1.2 billion investment to encourage even more businesses to take on apprentices and trainees. The cap has been lifted from the program and it has been extended to provide a full 12 months of support from the date of commencement.The apprentice wage subsidy is one part of a series of programs that includes the JobMaker hiring credit. The JobMaker hiring credit is such an important program in encouraging businesses to take a young person who has been on welfare and give them a job, give them their first chance. Employers receive $200 a week for 12 months if they hire a young person in that category aged between 16 and 29, or $100 a week if they hire an eligible young person between the ages of 30 and 35. Its expected that after three years, when the program has finished, around 450,000 people will have been supported by the JobMaker hiring credit. The investment in the JobMaker hiring credit and the wage subsidy program is bolstered by the initiatives that we have around the JobTrainer Fund, which is a combined federal-state initiative worth a billion dollars to provide subsidised and free courses to people who are looking to train up and transition into new employment opportunities, giving people the skills that they need and the tools that they need to succeed.I want to finish by noting last weeks labour force numbers. They are terrific numbers in terms of our recovery. We went from an unemployment rate of 6.3 per cent in January to 5.8 per cent in February. Around 88,700 new jobs were created. Forty per cent of those jobs went to young people and 80 per cent went to women. Im also told that, on Friday, Seek had a record number of jobs advertised: 183,000. That is a terrific indicator of the opportunities for people in the Australian economy at this time. Our response to the unemployment crisis indicates how seriously we are taking these matters.

303,0,0,0,1,2,"Thistlethwaite, Matt, MP",182468,"Kingsford Smith","ALP","N/A",3058," I want to congratulate the member for Longman on moving this motion, because it gives us the opportunity to point out what a failure these government schemes—JobTrainer and JobMaker—have been, highlighted on no less than the front page of TheAustralian Financial Review today, where they looked at the JobMaker hiring credit. This was announced with all the fanfare by the Treasurer.Its a credit that goes to businesses for hiring workers between the ages of 16 and 35 years old. When it was announced, it was projected that it would deliver 450,000 jobs throughout Australia. Have a guess how many its delivered, Mr Deputy Speaker. The number was reported on the front page of The Australian Financial Review today, and its 521. By this point, it should have been delivering 10,000 jobs, yet it has delivered 521. I bet the member for Longman wasnt aware that that article was coming out when he submitted this motion saying what a success this JobMaker hiring credit has been, when, clearly, it has not, only delivering 521 jobs. Its been an abject failure. The coalition MPs may come in here and try to dispute these numbers, but theyre there for all to see on the front page of the newspapers this morning.The problem with this program is that its specifically aimed at younger workers but, if you look at the recovery of our economy post COVID, the area where workforce participation has recovered is that of younger workers. Younger workers are doing relatively better than older workers. The problem is with older workers. Many older workers—particularly those in their late 40s, 50s and 60s—are not getting the job opportunities during the recovery. Labor warned of this when this scheme was put in place. Its the older workers that have been forgotten by the Morrison government, yet its the older workers that need the most support to get back into employment. We all know that, if you look at the JobSeeker figures at the moment, the majority of people that are receiving those payments are older workers. Theyre not younger workers; they are older workers. And whats the governments response to these older workers, who have worked hard for this country for many, many years and built the economic wealth that were all benefiting from today? Their response is: If youre on JobSeeker, youve got to work to find 20 jobs per month. Not only that, were going to set up a hotline so that employers can dob you older workers in for not trying hard enough to get a job. That says everything about this governments approach to supporting older workers in our economy. The failure of the JobMaker hiring credit just proves that this government is all announcement and very bad at delivery when it comes to putting its money where its mouth is.This motion also goes to JobTrainer. It is a fact that in Australia, since the coalition government was elected in 2013, there are now 140,000 fewer apprentices. They announced an additional 300,000 training places two years ago. Where are they? Where are those additional training places? They havent been delivered. Once again, its all announcement and no delivery. Theyve cut $3 billion from TAFE. TAFE is the principal provider in our economy of vocational training, particularly to younger Australians. Whats this governments approach? Well decimate it. In concert with Liberal governments at the state level, we will decimate TAFE and remove funding for it. And thats exactly whats occurred. What is the result? Its not as many people getting apprenticeships, not as many people finishing their trades, and a skills shortage in Australia. Whether its hairdressers, carpenters, electricians, seafarers, cooks, welders or motor mechanics, in the Morrison governments economy we now have a skills shortage in these very, very important trades.Whats the Liberal Partys solution? Well just import workers. Well bring them in on temporary visas. Dont worry about training Australians up to get the skills to take these jobs. Well just import workers into the country. Now that COVID-19 has stopped migration, were all paying for it, particularly farmers and businesses in rural and regional Australia who simply cannot get any workers. Their crops are being left to rot. Theyre not being harvested. Its the result of skills shortages encouraged by this governments policies and encouraged by the fact that its solution to labour productivity and providing enough labour is importing foreign workers. Its all come crashing down with COVID and the stoppage of migration.

304,0,0,0,1,2,"Wilson, Tim, MP","IMW","Goldstein","LP","N/A",3059," The Morrison government is proud to support young Australians throughout this difficult period to make sure they have the opportunity to secure employment and to progress with their lives. The previous speaker, the member for Kingsford Smith, made a number of disparaging remarks regarding the governments record. I would simply remind the member for Kingsford Smith of the experience that many young Australians had during the 1990s recession. Without wanting to reflect on your age, Deputy Speaker Wallace, I suspect you at least would remember that period. I was a young adult at that time, just coming out of high school and into secondary school, and for me those experiences were a political awakening to the economic and human consequences when people find themselves unemployed. They find that they are not able to progress with their lives in the usual way, to do things like buy a home, advance their careers and provide security for their families. Of course for many people who were already in employment it meant taking a step backwards. The legacy of the 1990s recession, the recession we had to have under Paul Keating, led to a trail of human and social tragedy that far transcended the economic disruption, which was critical. Many of the people who lost their jobs never found jobs to be able to progress their careers again. Many suffered for years as they struggled to get ahead.By comparison, since the COVID-19 recession that we had throughout last year, as a consequence of events outside our control, we have managed to turn around the economic circumstances and the job creation in a rapid period of time. Thats because, firstly, we were prudent in the lead-up to the crisis, so we had the resources to throw at it to create the job opportunities for young Australians, and indeed all Australians, who found themselves displaced. But, critically, we had targeted measures to encourage employers to find a pathway for young Australians to get back into work. We did that because we understand how critical work is to peoples sense of fulfilment and purpose in life. The very concept of dignity of work sits at the heart of who we are and what we stand for as a government. We know that once people are in a position to secure employment theyre in a position to move ahead with their lives and, as I said before, buy their own home, and provide security and support for their family. Thats then the foundation for them to then have retirement security as well.Lets look at the hard facts. In February 2021 the youth unemployment rate stood at 12.9 per cent, more than double the unemployment rate for the overall labour force, 5.8 per cent. That is substantially down from where it was, where we saw young Australians bear the biggest brunt as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. We can take comfort in the numbers for unemployment overall, but we still need to keep targeting youth unemployment. Thats why there have been critical measures like the JobMaker hiring credit, which is available to employers for each new job they create over the next 12 months for which they hire an eligible young Australian. Employers will receive up to $200 a week for 12 months if they hire an eligible young Australian aged between 16 and 29, or $100 if they hire an eligible young person aged between 30 and 35. With that investment to encourage, or pump prime, employers to bring more workers on, and particularly to make sure that young Australians dont experience disruption once they have finished their secondary and tertiary education and entered the workforce, the expectation is not just that those young Australians will be able to go on and live fulfilling and productive lives—though we do expect that—but that they will make a contribution to the collective wellbeing of society by taking care of themselves and their families and sharing the cost to society by paying tax. It is also expected that it will provide 450,000 positions for young Australians, allowing them to live out their ambition to secure employment so they can have the foundations for success in their lives. And we provided funding of $21.9 million to connect more young Australians to youth specialist employment services and targeted support services, including providing transition-to-work strategies for those who are leaving school and need opportunities as well.This government understands clearly that young Australians, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, face barriers. Our job is to smooth them over and make sure young Australians are able to go on and live the full success and dreams of their life.","COVID-19: Employment","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr TIM WILSON (Goldstein) ","(13:19):"

Deputy Speaker, its good that you have provided more time for me to talk about the Morrison governments plans to assist young Australians to secure employment. I outlined already some of the measures that we have taken. Weve also provided $699 million to the successful Youth Jobs PaTH program over four years from the 2020-21 budget year. This program helps young people gain the skills and work experience they need to obtain and keep a job. It includes a youth bonus wage subsidy of up to $10,000 to support the employment of young Australians.But we should never lose sight of the challenges that young Australians face beyond simply securing work. The critical factor for young Australians to be able to provide security for themselves and their families in their working life and their retirement is the opportunity to purchase their own home. Disturbingly, since 1980 the average age at which a young Australian purchases their own home has gone from 24 years to 36 years. Why? Because a significant share of their income and the opportunity for them to have savings is taken away from them and held in compulsory superannuation. The consequences of this are very real. We have pushed out the average age at which young Australians buy their own home. They have less money available to them to purchase their own home. The average Australian between the age of 30 and 35 has $38,000 in superannuation, and a couple has up to $76,000 in superannuation. With other savings, that could be the foundation for a deposit to buy their own home.We know that members on the other side of this chamber oppose the opportunity for young Australians to be able to buy their own home with their own savings, but what they ignore is the hypocrisy that those very same super funds that take and hold young Australians money are allowed to use that money to buy properties that they own and that they rent back to the same super fund members. So there is an unlevel playing field where it favours fund managers and centralised capital at the expense of young Australians being able to buy their own home. I make no apology: thats wrong.What we have engaged in is a form of economic social engineering. We have prioritised lifes second-biggest financial decision for young Australians ahead of their first: homeownership. Members in this chamber, I would hope, would support the opportunity for all Australians to buy their own home. We want to see a nation built from the citizens up, not from Canberra down. We do that through the greatest form of economic, social and political democratisation, and that is the power of individuals to form families as the foundation for community and country. The ultimate form of economic democratisation is through homeownership, which not just provides the foundation for the security of the family but provides the vehicle and leverage—The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! I appreciate that the member for Goldstein has assisted the chamber in relation to an application for an extension of time, but he is straying somewhat from the topic of the motion.","COVID-19: Employment","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[6]","N/A","N/A"

It empowers families and individuals to be able to be the foundation of the success of our country and to own our country.

JobKeeper was supposed to keep Australian workers in jobs, not pad the pockets of billionaire corporate fat cats like Gerry Harvey, who now brags about a 185 per cent profit increase in September last year, paying himself $100 million in dividends while refusing to pay back a cent of what he received from Australian taxpayers.Instead of using taxpayer funds to pad the pockets of Gerry Harvey, the Prime Minister and Treasurer should have used their extensive discretion to make sure that support was going to where it was most needed. What the Treasurer did use his discretion for instead was to make sure that the 5,500 dnata workers, many of whom live and work in my electorate of Lilley, were excluded from JobKeeper—excluded altogether—because they worked for a foreign owned company. So, while Gerry Harvey received $20 million in support from Australian taxpayers, Steve, from the north side of Brisbane, who has worked in aviation catering for over 22 years, was denied JobKeeper when he was stood down from his role at dnata, because of who his boss is. Corporate welfare doesnt get much more twisted than that. Just imagine what we could have done with the $20 million the government gave to Gerry Harvey rather than to the people who really needed it. Its a colossal waste, and the responsibility for that goes straight back to the PM and to the Treasurer.","JobKeeper Payment","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[7]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms WELLS (Lilley) ","(16:10):"

As much as I like being here, Id much rather be celebrating this special occasion in the very place that it asks us all to celebrate, which is in our local pubs back in the electorate. This day, one year ago, 23 March, was a dark day in our history, particularly for our local pubs. It was the day that their taps were turned off and their doors were closed, something we couldnt have imagined. It would be easy to make a joke about a pub with no beer if it hadnt been so serious for the lives and livelihoods of those who were impacted. In particular, the uncertainty was hard to bear. But local pubs and clubs and businesses did their very best. They adapted as best they could and, importantly, they have shown a remarkable comeback, along with the whole Australian economy. So this year, to mark the anniversary and the resilience of our great local pubs and small businesses and clubs, the National Local Day campaign aims to get everybody to have a beer at their local pub to support these jobs and these businesses.There are many things that we can do to support campaigns in this place, and Im sure this is one we can all get behind without partisanship or politics to support these small business people. To all the residents of Ryan: I implore you, tonight, whether youre swinging by the Suburban Social in Chapel Hill, the Blind Tiger in The Gap or any of the many fantastic local joints that we have, stop in, have a beer and support those businesses and those jobs.","COVID-19: National Local Day","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[8]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr SIMMONDS (Ryan) ","(16:11):"

The facility is very important to community sport on the Gold Coast and the upgrade is tremendous. The upgrade at Queens Park in Southport will see more Gold Coasters participating more often, with 10 resurfaced championship courts, improved LED lighting and new fencing. The Morrison government contributed $149,900 for the lighting that will create 140 hours of additional court time available each week. Tennis Australia, also a contributor, expect the number of annual participants in the area to increase by up to 17 per cent, from 60,000 to 70,000, in the coming year. Tennis Gold Coast, the longest-running sports association on the Gold Coast, will deliver additional participation and coaching programs as well as competition play. I would like to acknowledge the special contributions of Mike Ford, the president of Tennis Gold Coast; Warwick Nicol, the president of Tennis Queensland; and tennis legend Ken Rosewall—it was a pleasure to meet Ken at the event—and thank them for everything they have done for tennis on the Gold Coast.Queens Park has come a long way since the four courts in 1958. In the late 1950s it played host to many exhibition matches with some of the Australian Davis Cup team, like Lew Hoad, Ken Rosewall, Neale Fraser and Ashley Cooper. In more recent times, it has been a training centre for Sam Stosur, Bernard Tomic and Kimberly Birrell.

The government should be looking at and considering options for that targeted support, to keep those people in jobs and to keep our businesses going.The industries that were hardest hit in my region include those in retail, tourism, hospitality and the arts. Many of them were heavily dependent upon international tourism and were immediately impacted when the pandemic hit. It just has been devastating for them. All the Prime Minister has offered is a half-baked plan to provide half-price airfares, but its only for a select few areas.

Our society is richer when both men and women are involved in decision-making processes and in senior leadership positions. Earlier this year, the Minister for Women joined me in Reid to visit Burwood Girls High School. It was here, surrounded by the portraits of incredible female leaders on the walls of the school hall, that the minister delivered the annual womens policy statement to a room of 300 senior school students. The minister announced $240 million in measures and programs to specifically support job creation and entrepreneurism as well as womens safety at work and at home and to promote women in STEM. I am pleased that the Burwood Girls High School was the setting for this address. The girls show leadership and excellence in their academic and extracurricular pursuits and through their service to the broader community. The Minister for Women focused on the importance of sustainable progress towards gender equality so that the economic and social reforms to empower women can be intergenerational and ongoing.Before the COVID-19 pandemic, womens workforce participation had reached a record high, and the gender pay gap was at a record low. Its a reminder that our progress towards gender equality cannot be stayed. It must be sustainable, adaptive and flexible.","Womens Economic Security","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[26]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr MARTIN (Reid) ","(16:38):"

On the weekend, I attended the opening of the Ray Sloss Field at Federation Forest Football Fields at Mt Druitt. Ray was the founding member of the Minchinbury Jets Junior Rugby League Club. In 1994, he pushed to set up a club in Minchinbury and for it to be included in the Penrith junior rugby league season. He turned his home into the first fundraising location, organised things like an under-11s team to start the campaign to bring in more players. Registrations were first held at the local Maccas, where 108 players formed eight teams, seven going on to seven finals and winning three premierships, and many more members joined, including Barry and Lisa Jones, who still play a vital role in the club. The club itself boasts over 30 teams and more than 500 players, and little of this would have been possible without Rays determination and dedication.Sadly, Ray passed away a couple of weeks ago, and I wanted to extend my deepest, sincerest condolences to Rays wife, Jacqui, and the entire Sloss family. The young players who run onto the Ray Sloss Field should always know they are supported by a legacy—a commitment from a bloke like Ray, who truly believed in their talents and wanted to see those displayed to the wider footy community.

Two Sundays ago, I attended the opening of the Hectorville Sports and Community Club, in the heart of my electorate, who were the happy recipients of $500,000 from the Morrison government. Weve been able to completely rebuild the clubrooms there, which are used for cricket, football and tennis; and the local Rotary Club of Campbelltown meet there on a monthly basis. Its been absolutely transformative for that facility. I used to go there quite regularly before the renovations, and there has been a complete transformation, particularly the kitchen facilities there. This weekend, Im happy and honoured to be attending a sod-turning at the Glenunga Tennis Club, to which we have committed $200,000 towards, again, rebuilding the clubrooms.These are two great examples of investing in local sporting infrastructure in my electorate of Sturt, like were doing right across the country in partnership with good local governments. The Campbelltown and Burnside councils—I acknowledge both those entities—have also been involved in committing extra funds to make sure that we can maximise the upgrades possible.

The name is from the Gulidjan word koraiyn, meaning bitter or salty. But I am neither bitter nor salty about this decision to rename the electorate! Simply put, the name Corangamite needs to change. We have 151 electorates in this place. Only 17 are named after women. The number of electorates named after a First Nations person is even smaller—only seven. We have more electorates named after former prime ministers than we do women.Thats why Im proud the AEC is recommending Corangamite be renamed after Margaret Tucker, a Yorta Yorta woman. Margaret was one of Australias earliest female Aboriginal activists. She was the first woman appointed to the Victorian Aborigines Welfare Board and she was also one of the first inductees to the Victorian Honour Roll of Women, in 2001.As a nation we can only heal by acknowledging our past.

345,0,0,0,1,2,"Thompson, Phillip, MP",281826,"Herbert","LNP","N/A",3075," A couple of weeks ago I had an opportunity to visit the Townsville Flexible Learning Centre, run by the Edmund Rice Foundation. Flexible learning centres are for high-school-aged students who find themselves outside the mainstream school system for a range of different reasons. When I had a walk around the school, I saw myself in a lot of these kids. I left school quite young. I was quite a ratbag—I still am a bit of a ratbag—and a school like this would have served me quite well.So it was great to be able to announce a massive $2.3 million upgrade, as part of the Capital Grants Program. This program provides funding for non-government school communities to assist them to improve capital infrastructure where they otherwise may not have access to funding. Thats why the flexible learning centre in Townsville has been the perfect candidate. Its a small school with only 130 students and no fees. The project will see part of the current admin building demolished and the vacant land used to build new administration and staff facilities, a general learning area, art rooms, closed walkways and student amenities. This is a new facility that will be purpose-built. As the campus head said, its not about having 30 desks and chairs in a row with a whiteboard at the front; its about being flexible and adapting the space to suit the learning situation. I look forward to going along with the school on this journey, because its a fantastic initiative for our students.","Herbert Electorate: Townsville Flexible Learning Centre","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[30]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr THOMPSON (Herbert) ","(16:44):"

347,0,0,0,1,2,"King, Madeleine, MP",102376,"Brand","ALP","N/A",3075," I move:That this House:(1) notes:(a) the extraordinary value of the resources industry to the Australian economy and Australians livelihoods;(b) Australias mining and energy sectors such as iron ore, coal, gas, gold, uranium, bauxite and alumina, copper, nickel, zinc and lithium are world class;(c) these sectors continue to provide quality jobs for Indigenous Australians and opportunities for training and apprenticeships for all;(d) the resources industry provided half of Australias total export share in 2019-20, worth $238 billion to our economy; and(e) around the nation, the resources industry provides 238,000 direct jobs for Australians;(2) congratulates the resources industry for its ongoing support of communities, regional towns and essential fly-in fly-out workers living in metropolitan areas; and(3) recognises the tireless efforts and sacrifices of workers and industry that has allowed the resources industry to thrive despite the immense challenges presented by COVID-19.The resources industry is the backbone of the Australian economy and, in turn, Australians livelihoods. As this motion asserts, this nations mining and energy sectors, such as iron ore, coal, gas, gold, uranium, bauxite and alumina, copper, nickel, zinc and lithium are all world class. This is a fact. Ive been lucky enough to see operations going on all over the country to extract, develop and refine these resources, from the North West Shelf LNG operations in the Pilbara to the coalmines of Maitland and the Hunter Valley to the goldmines and nickel smelter of Kalgoorlie and to the lithium, aluminium and nickel refineries in my own electorate in Kwinana. And I hope to see even more, as shadow minister for resources, including in Queensland next month.The resources industry continues to provide quality jobs for First Nations Australians. In fact, today, there are twice as many Indigenous Australians working in the minerals industry than there were in 2006. Thats 6,599 direct jobs for Indigenous Australians—nearly four per cent of the resources industrys workforce. The resources industry knows it can do better in this regard, but also many other sectors around this country can learn from this proactive example of empowering and employing Indigenous Australians.The resources industry also employs around 8½ thousand apprentices, reskilling and retraining essential workers, and, at the same time, training and skilling up our next generation of Australian workers. The Minerals Council is projecting that this number will continue to grow, with 5,000 new positions to be created over the next few years, mostly in rural and regional Australia.The resources industry makes a huge contribution to the broader Australian economy. Worth $238 billion in 2019-20, the resources industry provided over half of Australias total export share. In fact, it was closer to 60 per cent. On a more palpable micro level, the resources industry provides 238,000 direct jobs for people in this country, and this trend is growing. The sector saw an increase of 67,000 direct jobs over the decade. These are quality, high-paying jobs, jobs that pay over $2,700 a week, or $144,000 a year—58 per cent above the Australian average. In the year 2019-20 this meant $26 billion in wages to Australian resources workers.In addition to these jobs and their direct impact on the Australian economy, the surrounding services, such as Australias innovative mining equipment and technology services sector, contribute similarly to our economy and our way of life. Across the supply chain, mining and METS support a total of 1.1 million direct and indirect jobs, or one in every 10 jobs in this nation, as well as thousands of regional small and medium businesses.When you visit these resources towns, you see the real and positive impact that local procurement decisions by big multinationals has on the SMEs in the area. In visiting these towns, Ive seen firsthand the investment big companies have made in local communities—the schools and the hospitals, for instance. Some towns, like Dampier in the Pilbara, were literally built by mining companies—first, Hamersley Iron and now Rio Tinto and Woodside. Recently, I visited Onslow and saw the incredible work that Chevron does on the ground in supporting that remote community. And, through its local procurement program to support its offshore gas operations, INPEX has boosted the Kimberley town of Broome and helped it diversify away from the vulnerable tourism industry. The contribution of this Japanese company, INPEX, to both Broome and Darwin demonstrates how Japan and Australia have come together in peace and shared prosperity since the dark days of World War II.In Kalgoorlie, Ive seen the work of local companies Northern Star, Evolution, BHP and KCGM in supporting the community there—though I note there are still challenges, including affordable housing, that must be addressed. These companies know, more than anyone else, that this ongoing support is essential to their social licence to operate. Australia has more than 100 mining projects with completed feasibility studies, and the combined $50 billion investment flowing from these projects has the potential to create more than 32,000 construction jobs and 22,000 ongoing operating jobs across Australia in the years to come.I would like to congratulate all of the resources industry—everyone who works in it, everyone who hopes to work in it and everyone who has forged this industry from its very start way back in the 1880s and 1890s with gold and coal in this country. The industry provides hundreds of thousands of jobs to so many Australians. Its an industry that is the backbone of our economy and will continue to be so for many years to come.","Resources Industry","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms MADELEINE KING (Brand) ","(16:46):"

352,0,0,0,1,2,"Archer, Bridget, MP",282237,"Bass","LP","N/A",3077," After more than a decade living in George Town—for most of those years, serving on the local council, including as mayor—I would hope that the community would almost consider me as a local. So its as a local that I proudly stand here to support this motion—Id have been happy to second it—recognising the significance of our resources industry and the extraordinary value of the resources industry to the Australian economy and Australian livelihoods.Bell Bay, located in the municipality of George Town, is the heart of Tasmanias resources industry and is our states largest industrial precinct at 2½ thousand hectares in size. Fifty-nine per cent of all of Tasmanias manufactured exports are produced in the Bell Bay area, including manganese and aluminium. At the heart of the industry is Bell Bay Aluminium, situated on the Tamar River. Opened in 1955, the smelter was the first built in the southern hemisphere. It began as a joint venture of the Tasmanian and Australian governments, primarily to overcome the difficulties of importing aluminium during wartime. In 1960, the business was acquired by Comalco Industries Pty Ltd and, in 2000, Rio Tinto purchased Comalco. The smelter is now operated by Rio Tintos Pacific Operations division and produces around 190,000 tonnes of aluminium each year, operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week.The importance of the smelter to the local economy and, beyond that, the regional and state economy, cannot be underestimated. Its the largest employer in the area, with around 500 FTE and an additional 60 contractors per day. Independent studies have also found that Bell Bay Aluminium directly and indirectly employs approximately 1,500 Tasmanians and contributes around $690 million per annum to gross state product. There is no doubt that the smelter still occupies a firm place in the hearts of my constituents.As its an industry not widely known for being a significant employer of women in more senior positions—although I do note that this is changing—I was really pleased to see Shona Markham, Bell Bay Aluminiums general manager of operations, speak at a recent International Womens Day breakfast in Launceston, highlighting her rise to senior levels of a typically male-dominated industry. Im sure that, like me, Shona hopes that, in the future, her story will no longer be the exception.While Bell Bay Aluminium is the jewel of the industry in our state, for the region to grow and avoid overreliance on one operation or employer, there is a need for diversification in the industry, including expansion from being solely resource industry based to identifying other options, including that of renewable energy. This led to the formation of the Bell Bay Advanced Manufacturing Zone. Led by Bell Bay Aluminium, the BBAMZ, as it is known, was established in 2015 from a desire by businesses in the region for better collaboration and to grow the regions capabilities by supporting existing businesses, encouraging investment and promoting the benefits of the region as a place to live and work.As an industry based economic development group, BBAMZ is working in collaboration with government and community to support growth, investment and business diversification in the George Town and Tamar Valley regions. The BBAMZs aim is to lift the profile of the Bell Bay zone locally, nationally and internationally as well as build a sense of community pride in the region. With CEO Susie Bower at the helm, theyre certainly making some strides in significant work being undertaken by the group to secure the area as a green hydrogen hub. As mentioned in the House recently, I was thrilled to learn that the Bell Bay Advanced Manufacturing Zone, as a local industry group committed to ensuring the region can remain globally competitive, received a $100,000 grant from National Energy Resources Australia for research into the latest green hydrogen technology. BBAMZ was one of 13 clusters to share in this funding as part of the National Hydrogen Strategy.Our government has been a strong and consistent supporter of the resources industry across the country, including Tasmania, and its the leadership of government that has been instrumental in ensuring the success and resilience of the resources sector through the pandemic. Id particularly like to thank the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction, Angus Taylor, for his commitment to the resources industry in my electorate and for his willingness to listen as I advocate for the needs of my community.","Resources Industry","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs ARCHER (Bass) ","(16:51):"

I was captivated by the technology that makes these vehicles unique. Let me tell you that it had plenty of pick-up as well! You may wonder why riding in a Tesla has anything to do with resources. Quite frankly, it has everything to do with them. Many people dont realise this, but electric cars arent new. In fact, London inventor Thomas Parker designed and built the first practical electric car in 1884. By the 19th and early 20th centuries, electric cars, fuelled by high-capacity, rechargeable batteries, were the most popular cars on the road. In fact, in 1899 the New York taxi fleet was predominantly made up of electric vehicles. It wasnt until the more advanced combustion engine and the expansion of highways that sales of electric vehicles dropped off. Now, fortunately, thanks to mining and the resources sector, they are making a massive comeback.I love to know how things work. The Tesla I rode in had its body and chassis made from strengthened steel and aluminium alloys. Its thanks to the perfect combination of iron, coal, manganese, aluminium, palladium, nickel and magnesium that this vehicle is possible. Its thanks to nickel and lithium that the battery is possible, and its thanks to cerium, dysprosium and neodymium that the LCD screens can make its interface possible.The resources industry clearly plays a critical role in our lives. More than 49 mined metals and rare earths are used to produce a single smart phone. Mining makes holding the world in your hand possible. The extraordinary value of this sector is too often lost on us all. Did you know that one tonne of mobile phones yields more gold than a tonne of gold ore? These sectors continue to provide the ingredients necessary to make our very way of life possible. As the typical Australian wakes up in the morning, perhaps turns on the light and picks up their phone as they head to the kitchen to make breakfast, they have literally used coal, uranium, iron, copper, aluminium, carbon, zinc, silver and gold. From the light bulb in the fridge, its mining that makes it all possible. It also might interest the parliament to note that iron ore, coal, gas, gold, uranium, bauxite and alumina, copper, nickel and lithium are all vital to our everyday lives.In my home region of the Hunter, the resources sector plays a critical role in employment, directly and indirectly, and in our regions prosperity. We are the largest exporter of coal in the Southern Hemisphere and we are rich in the resources that are the envy of the world. Im incredibly proud of our coal and its purpose in our region and in our economy more broadly. Hunter coal is sought after around the world and our export market remains strong and competitive. It is keeping the lights on in many countries that would otherwise experience power poverty, which is not spoken about enough around the world. More people are killed because of electricity poverty and power poverty than anything else. Around the nation the resources industry provides 238,000 direct jobs for Australians. In my electorate we are home to Tomago Aluminium, which produces 600,000 tonnes of metal every year. Thats 25 per cent of Australias primary aluminium. Tomago Aluminium is a big employer in the Hunter, and its just one of many local success stories which have been spurred on by mining, providing direct employment and indirect employment across the sector. As my colleague the member for Brand mentioned, this industry employs around 8,600 apprentices and trainees. Its the gateway for many young people to establish the skills they need to go on to other things and to have a vibrant career in the resources sector. Im very proud to have grown up in Kurri, the coalfields. I remember fondly my father heading off to a dog watch at our local pit. The sources sector employed my father for over 40 years, and not a moment passes when I dont think about people who work in it currently. They are good, very well paid jobs. Australia would be much poorer if it werent for our vibrant resources and mining industries.","Resources Industry","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms SWANSON (Paterson) ","(16:56):"

As a second-year mining engineering student, it was the formative experience of my career. I clearly remember the first time I went underground to work on service crew, and later on as a nipper offsiding jumbo operators. If you have never worked underground its very hard to describe the teamwork thats required and the sense of togetherness thats quickly established in such harsh conditions. Its often hot, loud, dark and unstable. Large vehicles move quickly past, and of course the dangers associated with rock falls are ever present. I recall some years later, this time working as a nipper at the Ridgeway mine just outside Orange, I was returning from changing the drill bit on a jumbo. I turned my back to the cab and felt a gust of wind come past me. I heard no sound, but behind me several tonnes of rock had fallen, dashing the jumbo booms to the ground. It was an amazing thing to see.It was a dangerous place, but we were there for each other. Mining crews are like that. They might rib you a little bit, and as a project manager, much later in my career, I enjoyed a bit of banter with the crews. A good crew looks after its own. In many ways the whole mining industry is like one big crew. Although it is spread all across the world, mining is still a small industry. We all know each other; we know someone who worked with us on another site somewhere. The industry goes through ups and downs. In the good times we grow in numbers, the pay is good and the rosters get a little bit easier. Long-term miners know to put a bit of money away in the bank during the good years. That was certainly the best advice I ever got from an old driller I worked with at Northparkes.Young engineers often get a bit of a hard time in their first years, but we also get a lot of good advice. The best miners know to invest in their graduates because their future safety depends on it. Again, mining is an industry where we have to work together. In the down times that can be hard. I recall the end of the mining boom. As redundancies swept across Perth, I remember the uncertainty into which many of my own team were plunged as our clients scaled back operations, this time at the Argyle diamond mine. I remember the tears in the eyes of the grown men and women on my team who I had to break the news to. I remember the fear in my own wifes eyes as we faced my own redundancy shortly afterwards. But even in those dark times we were together. The support and mateship within the mining community is always there. It is always there at the end of the phone or maybe across the table at the pub sharing a quiet beer.","Resources Industry","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr HAMILTON (Groom) ","(17:01):"

This government, this side of the House, has always supported the mining industry. We supported the mining industry in the boom times and we supported mining in the bad times.

We supported the mining industry back then and we continue to support the mining industry, even though it has become unpopular. The place that the mining industry has become most unpopular is within the Queensland Labor Party. In my electorate of Groom, the Labor Party has repeatedly turned its back on and turned up its nose at the Acland mine. It has turned hardworking miners into jobseekers and turned opportunity into uncertainty.Be very clear: Queensland Labor are no friends of the mining industry. If you dont believe it from me, then listen to what the CFMEU had to say. This is from a leaflet that was dropped into letterboxes by the CFMEU around the Toowoomba region during the state election, authorised by Stephen Smyth. It reads: Labor has been hiding behind the court process at taxpayers expense and bowing to the inner-city green vote. Thats from the unions. Thats what they have to say. There is more. It goes on to say: Labors inaction means that the mine will close and more jobs will be lost. This is from the unions. Even they can see through the duality of Labors position on mining here. Its nice to say one thing here, but what about at the coalface that is being shut down in my electorate? Mining is a wonderful industry. Mining does so much for Australia.

If we go back through the last two centuries, as a Victorian I feel compelled to raise the example of the gold rush. We can go back as far as the 1850s to a time when we were the world-leading gold extraction and export country. Ever since that time, through successive waves of investment and through successive waves of the commitment of millions of workers, we have contributed so much, not just to the Australian economy but to the world through providing them with the raw materials that have provided so much.As previous speakers mentioned, this is the largest sector of the economy—10.4 per cent of the Australian economy—so it should come as no surprise that so many communities around this country rely upon the resources sector for jobs. There are around 240,000 jobs directly reliant on the resources sector and around 1.1 million direct and indirect jobs. These are almost incomprehensible numbers. There are over $264 billion in exports. Anybody whos at all familiar with trade understands that our trade balance is incredibly reliant on the expertise and capacity of our resources sector. For anybody out there who says its just a matter of digging it up and putting it on a ship and exporting it, we have some of the most technologically advanced export industries in the world and some of the most technologically advanced industries that extract resources in extremely difficult circumstances. Indeed, many countries around the world look to our resources sector for worlds best practice. Thats the first point I want to make. This is a massive sector that contributes jobs and contributes to our economy.The second point I want to draw out is the indirect contribution that it makes. Its actually a broader indirect contribution than many people often refer to. Theres the indirect contribution of the many construction jobs and the many jobs in regional communities that are supported. In fact, many economists who assessed the last long resources boom looked at the contribution that the resources boom made to the broader economy and they will undoubtedly assess the contribution that the current resources boom will make to the broader economy. We can see that many governments at the state and federal levels rely incredibly on revenue from the resources sector—tens of billions of dollars from corporate taxes and tens of billions of dollars through royalties. And indeed, many of the hospitals and services that governments provide in our communities right around the nation are reliant indirectly on the resources sector and the vibrancy of that sector. So much economic analysis of the resources boom that we saw in the decade past points very clearly to the fact that that boom benefited many people in our society who werent directly involved in the resources community and many people who lived in communities far away from resources communities.The third point I want to make is the massive potential for growth. We can see forecasts for growth of LNG of 67 per cent to 2030, as well as iron ore to 13 per cent, aluminium to 52 per cent and zinc to 29 per cent. There are all sorts of major exports that were currently world-leading on that can grow dramatically over the coming decades. But there are also, of course, niche areas like rare earths, where we can not only export more but also generate so many more high-value, high-paid jobs in the processing of those materials. As the member for Paterson said, if one looks at electric vehicles, if one looks at the renewables sector, there is so much potential for us to not just increase our share of rare earths extraction but also grasp the opportunity for the processing of those rare earths in supply chains that are secure—through rare earths that are extracted here and then turned into smart phones, electric cars and all sorts of other world-leading devices. So this is an incredibly important sector right now, in both its direct and its indirect effects, and will be well into the future.","Resources Industry","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr MULINO (Fraser) ","(17:06):"
362,0,0,0,1,2,"Drum, Damian, MP",56430,"Nicholls","Nats","N/A",3082," It is great to rise and talk on the resources sector. I want to congratulate the member for Brand and also, if its being co-sponsored, the member for Paterson—Ill let the two members work that one out, but its great that Labor have put this forward. We often have very serious debates about Labors true commitment to areas such as the coal industry and the gas industry. We forever get caught up in this place talking about our desire to get to zero emissions by 2050 and, therefore, which commodities we are going to cut back on. Very seldom do we talk about areas such as gas, as the transition source we know we need.The resources sector has been instrumental in enabling this government to put in place a very successful and resilient process and economy as we work our way through the pandemic. As we come out the other end of the pandemic, it sees the nation in a very solid position. The resources sector in 2019-20 accounts for nine per cent of Australias GDP, just with its export earnings alone. Effectively, resources and energy commodity exports account for $290-odd billion for Australia, with iron exports at over $100 billion, as we export enough iron ore to build more than 10,000 Sydney Harbour Bridges.I think, also, weve got to be careful—we just talk about these numbers, about people that are employed. All of these numbers, effectively, represent families. And with that, theres the esteem that comes with being able to provide for your family, because of the work you do. You should never be overlooked, and you should never be acknowledged as just another number. This is an incredibly important part of life in Australia—being able to get these jobs and being able to build on that. That provision for your family is something thats absolutely crucial.Theres no doubt that the resources sectors, whether it be the people that are directly involved or indirectly involved, really have given Australia the best chance we have at bouncing back from this incredible hit to our balance sheet. As previous speakers have spoken about, you cannot talk about the resources sector without also acknowledging the other parts of our economy that are the beneficiaries. We do have a world-leading health service. We have one of the best education systems, and we have possibly the best disability service—the National Disability Insurance Scheme. As we work through all the teething problems with that, in a bipartisan way we will be incredibly proud when we look back at what we have developed in relation to the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Its something that can only be afforded and achieved—and if we look forward to what were going to do with aged care, and the more money that we pump into aged care to give our people that true dignity in their last years of life in an aged-care facility—on the back of these incredible earnings that we see coming in from the resources sector.I spoke a little bit earlier about gas. Australia is already committed to making sure that we maintain our position as one of the worlds top exporters of LNG. We are already doing an amazing amount of work in this area. It is important that we constantly look at how gas can be this lower emissions source of energy that we use both in its own form and also to use it as another form of creating electricity. Not only that, I think we need to be somewhat critical of whats happened in Victoria in recent years, where they have, effectively, had no extraction of gas as a state government policy. In fact, what they have had is a reasonably lame exploration policy that has effectively gone nowhere for the last four or five years.We keep building on our coal exports of high-quality coal, and if we stop sending coal to Asia they will only go and use a much lower grade of coal in those Indonesian and Indian markets. So we need to acknowledge the importance of this sector, look at the benefits it creates for our economy and look at the benefits it creates for our society.

363,0,0,0,1,2,"Dick, Milton, MP",53517,"Oxley","ALP","N/A",3083," Thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, were facing immense economic instability. We know there are more than one million people who are unemployed and theres growing uncertainty when it comes to the sustainability of jobs and industries across the country. I pledge to keep working to address these issues, but I do want to place on record today how much more serious Australias economic position would be if it werent for our extremely valuable resources industry. Thats why I want to thank the member for Brand, the shadow minister for resources and trade, for putting this important motion before the parliament and raising this as a matter of urgency so that we can debate this issue.This is a sector that is central to our countrys economy and to hundreds of thousands of working Australians livelihoods. Ive been a big supporter of Queenslands resources industry, and Im proud to say that our states industry is worth more than those of New South Wales, Victoria, Northern Territory, South Australia, Tasmania and the ACT combined. Since the last election—straight after the election—I had the privilege of visiting several mines across my home state of Queensland, alongside the member for Paterson and a number of colleagues. This made me completely optimistic about our countrys future.The mines we visited—from the Mackay region, in the member for Dawsons electorate, right down to Gladstone—were providing opportunities for a huge portion of the states population. In fact, Queenslands resources industry alone hires more than 68,000 people. About 2,720 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders living in regional and remote areas choose to work in the sector. It provides new opportunities for apprentices and trainees. This industry, which made up half of Australias total export share in 2019-20, supercharges our economy, providing $238 billion every year so we can build the roads and bridges—and the NDIS, as weve just heard from the previous speaker—that we drive on and we can make the crucial improvements to our way of life. This is an industry that will be key to Australias strong economic recovery post the COVID-19 pandemic.On my visit to the heart of Queenslands resources industry, I saw firsthand the opportunities that have been created to diversify and bolster our energy sector. I visited Adanis Rugby Run solar farm, a 65-megawatt project that powers more than 23,000 homes and businesses in regional Queensland. This solar farm is a key contributor to the Queensland governments goal of reaching its 50 per cent renewable target by 2030. This is just one example of how our diverse and world-class commodities have put us on a path to allow every Australian to access reliable, affordable power into the future. Australia produces 10 of the 16 commodities needed for the manufacturing of solar panels. We hold the largest reserves of lithium anywhere in the world and we mine every commodity required to build smartphones and the battery and storage technology of the future. When you look at numbers like that, its easy to see that this sector positions Australia at the forefront of technological advancement on the world stage and makes a significant contribution to our strength as an exporter. At home, huge numbers of people are employed in the sector. It provides around 238,000 direct jobs across Australia, but there are also many who reap the peripheral benefits of this booming industry. In my home state of Queensland, more than 38,000 people in the sector earn an average annual salary of around $146,000, and they spend this income propping up our local economies. Regional communities are supported by the sector, particularly by the more than 5,700 essential fly-in fly-out workers who contribute to the $27 billion spent annually on goods and services from more than 15,200 local businesses.The COVID-19 pandemic has presented immense challenges to the resource sector workers and to the industry as a whole. Today I want to recognise the tireless efforts and sacrifices made by so many hardworking people to push through this tough time and contribute to Australias economic strength and our growth for years to come.Australian mining and resources remain the jewel in the crown of this countrys economy and workforce. We must be committed to incentivising and investing in future talent and reinforcing that there is a pathway into the mining and resource sector for our high school, TAFE and university graduates. We also need to make further commitments to invest in becoming leaders in scientific research to develop the technology necessary for further exploration under the work of the experts in the field.I know that an Albanese Labor government has confidence in the future of the sector and will be committed to supporting workers in the resources industry as well as those in sectors who benefit from a healthy commodities trade. Its never been more important to ensure this extraordinary-value sector continues to thrive, one I am a huge supporter of.","Resources Industry","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr DICK (Oxley) ","(17:16):"

We extract uranium out of the ground, semiprocess it, turn it into yellow cake, take it through the middle of town and put it on the boat. When it goes on the boat, its blessed. It becomes the blessed product. It becomes ethical, and it arrives in another country as it ethically drives zero-emissions power for them.

376,0,0,0,1,2,"Wilson, Tim, MP","IMW","Goldstein","LP","N/A",3086," by leave—on behalf of the member for Lindsay, I move:That this House:(1) notes that the Government is committed to safeguarding Australians from foreign interference in our universities and protecting government funded research from being compromised;(2) acknowledges that the Government convened the world’s first Universities Foreign Interference Taskforce in 2019;(3) recognises:(a) the Universities Foreign Interference Taskforce produced the Guidelines to Counter Foreign Interference in the Australian University Sector to ensure due diligence and to have conflict of interest polices in place to identify and mitigate risks of any foreign affiliations; and(b) there are examples of intimidation, threats and coercion towards researchers and their families; and(4) further notes that the Government has invested $145 million to combat foreign interference, including $1.6 million to strengthen cybersecurity in universities.Its a pleasure to be able to move this motion on behalf of the member for Lindsay, who I understand is in her fine electorate supporting people affected by the flood. Im particularly happy to see the Deputy Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, the member for Holt, in the chamber at this time. This motion goes to the heart of the security of our nation and, as you know, as a member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, we currently have an inquiry into issues around foreign interference in Australian universities. This inquiry is of critical importance to our country. Its of critical importance because it sits as part of the rich fabric of security mechanisms we need in place to protect our research, our academics and those who put energy and time into building and advancing the technology, innovation and ideas for the future advancement of our nation. We also need to have security mechanisms surrounding their conduct and their research so that it advances the interests of Australia and cant be used as a back-door vehicle to seek to either influence our country and/or be a target of cyberattacks or other activities that put universities, our intellectual property and information at risk.Only last week, on Friday, we had one of the many hearings of the PJCIS where we heard from universities directly about their initiatives and their efforts to address the attempts of foreign interference from foreign governments into their activities. To be quite frank with you, the response from the universities was mixed, from those who have a substantial way to go in taking measures to protect their information and their intellectual property against governments that seek to interfere in their activities, to others who have taken very proactive steps, and we would like other universities to follow their lead.Critical to that is a real focus on making sure that there are proper cybersecurity mechanisms. We need to make sure that anything that operates in the offline world operates successfully in the online world, and that includes security mechanisms. We wouldnt leave precious records and data available for anybody to walk in and open up without proper security and locks, and there should be the same approach towards cybersecurity. Thats why this government has invested $145.2 million since 2018-19 to strengthen cybersecurity in universities. While they are not necessarily a weak spot in the link, they are one of the spots in the link, and we have to be focused not just on government departments, not just on intelligence and security agencies and not just on the AFP but on any institution that is established for the purpose of advancing team Australia.We have also released guidelines to counter foreign interference in the Australian university sector and to strengthen the resilience of universities against foreign interference. Were working across the sector, with not just the institutions but their representative and standard agencies, to make sure that theyre part of the solution, as well as with the Australian Research Council. As you may be aware, Deputy Speaker Falinski, in the most recent round of ARC grants, a number of applications were knocked back by the Commonwealth because of concerns around national security. I think everybody starts from a position of saying that they would rather that that were not the case, but sometimes its necessary. This government will never cease to take necessary action, as required, to stop foreign interference in the tertiary education sector or anywhere where nefarious agendas are being played out.We see this as part of a rich fabric of the issues that confront our country. Addressing foreign interference in our universities is a critical part of that. We have seen programs, like the Chinese Community Partys Thousand Talents program, that are seeking to directly harvest the opportunities that our academics and their ideas provide towards agendas and ends that may not necessarily be to seek the advancement of our country but for other purposes. Of course we know that there are many countries that have sought to engage in espionage or the theft of intellectual property as part of their own industrial development, for their own military or defence purposes or to advance their interests in foreign countries. Universities should not be the weak link in that sector, and the Morrison government is committed to making sure that universities are on the side of team Australia.","National Security: Universities","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr TIM WILSON (Goldstein) ","(17:27):"

381,0,0,0,1,2,"Byrne, Anthony, MP","008K0","Holt","ALP","N/A",3087," I also support this motion. As someone who has a strong interest in this particular sector and also the issue of foreign interference, I always think that, as John Garnaut would say, the more sunlight we can shine on this issue, in terms of what is happening to our universities, our society and our communities, the better off were going to be. We need to be educating not just the education institutions but the Australian public about the threat of foreign interference in a lot of sectors of our economy and our society. Therefore, I support this and have been supporting the people who have worked so hard behind the scenes within the national intelligence community to bring us up to speed to protect our universities and research sector, which is the particular motion that we are talking about today.Its also important at the start of my contribution to point out that a lot of this has been driven by the actions and words of the Director-General of Security, Mike Burgess. He detailed this in his first annual threat assessment, when he said:The level of threat we face from foreign espionage and interference activities is currently unprecedented. It is higher now than it was at the height of the Cold War.I remember talking to the previous Director-General of Security, Duncan Lewis, with respect to that. It was something we actively discussed. Some in the public say, Theyre just words, but for the men and women of our intelligence and security agencies and our police forces theyre not just words; theyre actions. They need to take action. Theyre threats. They need to deal with the threats. This threat, this specific manifestation of this ongoing and enduring threat that we will face as a country for 25- to 50-plus years of our lifetimes—for the foreseeable future of our country—is immense. So I support that particular statement made by the Director-General of Security.With respect to the higher education and research sector, they are one of the threat vectors. They are one of the areas of strategic importance to us as a functioning democracy and as an economy. They are a threat vector point for those that seek to do us harm, those that seek to exploit us economically or steal research information from us. Our higher education and research sector generates about $32.4 billion—thats the figure Ive seen—as part of the export sector of the economy. I was looking at this in relation to the research that we do and how we punch above our weight in the products we deliver to market, that can be commercialised—that is, the collaboration of our university sector and the commercialisation that comes from that. The bionic ear, Gardasil, the medical application of penicillin, the Google Maps platform, the black box flight recorder, wi-fi, solutions for sleep apnoea, polymer bank notes, the ultrasound scanner—I could go on and on and on about the value of research in our tertiary sector. That research is absolutely critical. But, because of our success and our openness as a democracy, those that seek to do us harm, that seek to exploit that, are unyielding in their efforts.In terms of describing the threats specifically to the sector, I couldnt actually say it better than the testimony of Chris Teal, His current position is Deputy Secretary, Social Cohesion and Citizenship in the Department of Home Affairs, but hes also, very importantly, chair of the University Foreign Interference Taskforce. He is someone who has been intimately involved in this sector. Let me use the words of Mr Teal to describe the threat to the sector. For the committees benefit, Mr Teal talked about the method and aims of foreign actors who seek to engage in foreign interference in this sector. He said:… foreign actors who seek to engage in foreign interference in the Australian higher education and research sector, through the following means …efforts such as threats, coercion or intimidation to alter or direct the research agenda;financial coercion;solicitation and recruitment of post-doctoral researchers and academic staff; andcyber intrusions.He then said the aims of foreign actors and those who undertake the activity are important to understand. They include:stealing Australian research and technology for transfer overseas;cutting the time and cost required to replicate a desired technology;gaining commercial advantage in a competitive market;identifying, cultivating and recruiting individuals for future interference and espionage activities; andenabling long-term access to information.I have to commend the work of the University Foreign Interference Taskforce, and I also commend those who came before us on Friday on behalf of the universities. There has been a marked cultural shift that stands us in good stead to deal with the enduring threat. In the meantime, I support this motion. Weve come from behind. Weve got a lot of work to do.

I know she wanted to be here herself, moving this, but shes with her community as they are facing floods in this very tough time. I went through the 2011 Brisbane flood as a local representative, albeit as a local councillor. Its a very tough time for your community. You only hope, as a local representative, that you can rise to the occasion. I know the member for Lindsay will, and that she will support her community admirably.Like the member for Goldstein and others, I can confirm the Morrison governments commitment to safeguard Australians from foreign interference in our higher education sector, and more broadly, and add my wholehearted support to those efforts. We know that foreign interference is, unfortunately, a reality. But just because it is unfortunate, it doesnt mean we should turn our back on it. It is more important than ever to face up to that unfortunate reality and be prepared to deal with it in Australias sovereign and national interests. Whats more unfortunate is that foreign entities have sought to interfere with Australian sovereign values by infiltrating our universities, and we know this. These are hallowed institutions that are charged with the duty of educating and empowering our youth, and with important research that pushes our nation forward. Because of that, they are an attractive target for foreign interference. And because of that, we must safeguard them to the very best of our abilities.Im a strong supporter of the University of Queensland in our electorate of Ryan, of course. It enrols over 55,000 students from both here and abroad. Im a very proud graduate of it. But I have been concerned for some time about the University of Queensland—because I know it so well—because of its overreliance on overseas students and research funding, particularly from the Chinese market. No inference should be taken from that about the individual international students involved. But with that reliance comes a responsibility as an institution to have appropriate safeguards in place to make sure that our sovereignty is protected and that the important research and values that we as Australians hold so dear are protected.As I said before, the Morrison government acknowledges the seriousness of the foreign interference that we face in the higher education sector and convened the worlds first University Foreign Interference Taskforce in 2019. The task force has implemented robust guidelines for the Australian university sector to ensure strict due diligence and to have conflict-of-interest policies in place to identify and mitigate any risk of foreign interference. Weve also invested $1.6 million to combat foreign interference and to strengthen the presence of cybersecurity in the higher education sector.Mr Deputy Speaker Falinski, Australian universities are among the best in the world; you dont have to be told that. Seven of our very own institutions are ranked globally in the top 100, including the University of Queensland, which, as I said, I was privileged to attend. With the Prime Minister and the Minister of Health, I recently had the privilege of visiting the University of Queensland, specifically the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, to look at what they were doing in the COVID-19 vaccine development space. Unfortunately—we all know the story—the University of Queensland vaccine didnt quite make it to the production stage, but, jeez, they did a fantastic job, and their research is going to continue to push vaccine technology forward into the future. As the previous Labor speaker, the member for Holt, pointed out, its also the home of the Gardasil vaccine.All of this is testament to the tremendous work and research in our universities, and it goes to demonstrating why we are so passionate about safeguarding it and why universities have a responsibility as the custodians of this important information and work for all Australians. It is why we, the Australian parliament, as the custodians of our universities, need to make sure that our universities are supported in protecting those sovereign interests. And, of course, its why these universities are such attractive targets for foreign entities who wish to interfere with the work that our universities do.The $1.6 million of federal funding that I mentioned earlier is helping our institutions to support their IT capabilities to prevent cyberattacks. RMIT will spearhead this initiative on behalf of all universities, to strengthen universities resilience against cybersecurity attacks, and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation is of course working closely with them to intercept foreign entities seeking to undermine that national sovereignty. This is something that I am passionate about and that the Morrison government is passionate about. Were going to continue to protect our sovereign interests with the support of our national universities.","National Security: Universities","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr SIMMONDS (Ryan) ","(17:37):"
383,0,0,0,1,2,"Watts, Tim, MP",193430,"Gellibrand","ALP","N/A",3090," I too welcome this motion. Im pleased to support it. And I join the other speakers in the debate by offering my best wishes to the member for Lindsay and her community as they confront this very significant weather event and natural disaster.Foreign interference is a real and significant threat to Australias national sovereignty. Indeed, ASIO Director-General of Security Mike Burgess has been warning about the increased scale and sophistication of foreign interference in our society for some time. Last week, in his annual threat assessment, the director-general warned about the risks of espionage and foreign interference, describing them, appropriately, as threats to our way of life.Universities are significant institutions in our democracy, and an obvious target for this kind of espionage and foreign interference. Universities have a profound ability to influence the democratic process in Australia, whether its academics who contribute research that shapes the national conversation or its research that leads to major scientific breakthroughs that shape our national capabilities. Universities are vital democratic institutions that should be protected from espionage and foreign interference.More broadly, attacks on these institutions can be used to influence government and its processes, and weve seen examples of this overseas. One of the most prominent was the hack of the University of East Anglias Climatic Research Unit. This was a hack-and-leak operation that is now widely believed to have been directed by a nation-state with the intent of undermining the Copenhagen climate summit. More recently, weve seen COVID vaccine researchers targeted as part of Russian-backed vaccine disinformation campaigns. So I welcome government action on this important issue, particularly in my own shadow portfolio of cybersecurity. However, to be frank, it shouldnt have taken multiple cyberbreaches at universities to prompt this action—most notably, the campaign against the Australian National University in 2018 by a state-sponsored advanced persistent threat actor—but better late than never.We are in a somewhat situation in this regard, with respect to the cybersecurity posture of our most central democratic institutions—our Commonwealth entities. On Friday the Australian National Audit Office issued a scathing report that highlighted serious and alarming failures in the governments compliance with its own mandatory cybersecurity standards. The report found that of the nine non-corporate Commonwealth entities audited by the ANAO, including Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Attorney-Generals Department, the Department of Home Affairs and the future fund, none have implemented the Australian Signals Directorates top 4 mandatory cybersecurity mitigations—almost eight years after they have become mandatory. The ANAO explicitly found that the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Attorney-Generals Department and the future fund were not cyber-reliant as defined by the government itself. Thats the Prime Ministers own department, which handles cabinet papers regularly, and the Attorney-Generals Department, which is responsible for the Commonwealth cybersecurity framework.Last year the Prime Minister held a press conference with the defence minister to warn that a sophisticated state actor had been targeting Australian organisations. He told Australians:Our objective is to raise awareness of these specific risks and targeted activities and tell you how you can take action to protect yourself … It is vital that Australian organisations are alert to this threat and take steps to enhance the resilience of their networks.Yet even the Prime Ministers own department did not take notice of the Prime Ministers warning in his press conference with the defence minister.The reality is that cyber-resilience failings are a systemic problem within Commonwealth entities under the Morrison government, and that leaves the government exposed to cyberenabled espionage and foreign interference campaigns. The ANAOs report highlighted that only 24 per cent of Commonwealth entities audited by the ANAO since the election of the coalition government have implemented the ASD top 4 mitigation measures. Those are mandatory cybersecurity measures, and they have been mandatory for eight years.The report also highlighted that 436 cybersecurity incidents were reported by Australian government entities to the ASD in 2019-20 alone. It made the cause of these failings plain; its a failure of accountability. The ANAO report found:The cyber policy and operational entities have not established processes to improve the accountability of entities cyber security posture. The current framework to support responsible Ministers in holding entities accountable within Government is not sufficient to drive improvements in the implementation of mandatory requirements.Where have we heard that before?The Morrison governments aversion to accountability is not just protecting its own political interests; it now has real national security consequences. It is now undermining the Commonwealths ability to defend itself against the exploitation of Commonwealth entities for cyberenabled espionage and foreign interference. While I commend the government on acknowledging this problem and on the motion before the chamber, I urge it to do more to protect our vital democratic institutions from these serious national security threats.

384,0,0,0,1,2,"Sharma, Dave, MP",274506,"Wentworth","LP","N/A",3092," I want to acknowledge the member for Lindsay, who proposed this motion, and her own struggles at the moment to protect and safeguard her community, and commend her on her work in that regard.Foreign interference is an important topic, and its one were hearing a lot about these days. Its worth delving into exactly what we mean by this concept, because last week we heard from the Director-General of Security, Mike Burgess, that he believes that foreign interference and foreign espionage—that whole suite of actions—already does or will shortly pose a threat to Australia greater than terrorism. If this is our biggest national security threat, what is it exactly and why is it so much a topic of concern in this parliament and elsewhere?In Australia, particularly in the last 30 years, we have become accustomed to thinking of the conduct of statecraft in a binary fashion. Either states are at war or states are at peace, and when states compete they will have different interests. These different interests are negotiated, conducted and transacted openly. What we are increasingly seeing as a tool of statecraft, particularly by authoritarian states, are tactics and strategies that are more redolent of the Cold War. These are tactics that tend to be covert rather than overt, that tend to use state supported actors rather than state apparatus itself. Theyre tactics that by and large seek to exploit unique factors that make open-level and democratic societies such as ours particularly vulnerable to these sorts of approaches. Some call this grey-zone warfare. There are a number of practitioners of it. It goes against our expectations, if you like, of a binary mindset that either we have good relations with a state or we have bad relations with a state, that either were competing or were cooperating. In this grey zone that operates here, you can be doing both. You can have open trading relations and diplomatic relations with a state that is nonetheless seeking to undermine your society or your institutions from within. This is why we need to be careful to make sure that, when we defend against these actions, we dont jeopardise the very institutions that make our society strong.Universities are undoubtedly a theatre for this sort of foreign interference because they are attractive targets for influencing public opinion and public debate but also because they produce research, development, intellectual property and ideas which can be valuable to a foreign adversary. But universities thrive as well on open discourse, debate, the free exchange of ideas, interaction with counterpart institutions and universities, and, indeed, cooperation with counterpart institutions and universities. So as we go about protecting our institutions against foreign interference—and we must do this; we must harden our institutions—we need to make sure we dont sacrifice the very nature or the essential nature of these institutions, be it our liberal democracy, be it freedom of speech on university campuses, be it any number of other things. Thats why I commend the governments work in this area in working in cooperation with the universities. Because, ultimately, we need them on board if were to protect against foreign interference. Universities are the institutions that are best placed to identify attempts to subjugate their own work for the purposes of a foreign actor and the institutions that are best placed to defend against that as well.I believe that the work weve done with the foreign interference task force with the universities—and the establishment, in particular, of the University Foreign Interference Taskforce, which is being administered by the Department of Home Affairs—will boost our ability to discover, track and disrupt foreign interference. Part of that suite of measures involves the creation of new criminal offences to target that sort of behaviour and increase transparency around foreign influence related activities. We now have the Guidelines to counter foreign interference in the Australian university sector, released to help strengthen the resilience of universities to foreign interference and to help universities understand the nature and the magnitude of this threat and the vehicles by which it seeks to enter their campuses. Weve also recently established a Higher Education Integrity Unit within the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency to identify and respond to emerging integrity risks within the sector, and weve strengthened conflict-of-interest and due diligence policies for Australian Research Council grant funding applicants to ensure that publicly funded research is consistent with Australias national interest.Universities will remain attractive targets, given their work on the technologies, medicines and practices that are fundamental to the future of Australias economy, military capabilities and security. But its important, as we go about protecting these universities, that we preserve the international research collaboration which will be vitally important to Australias future economic prosperity and security.","National Security: Universities","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr SHARMA (Wentworth) ","(17:48):"
385,0,0,0,1,2,"Swanson, Meryl, MP",264170,"Paterson","ALP","N/A",3093," Im pleased to speak on this motion. I do want to note that we do absolutely, in a bipartisan way, need to be committed to safeguarding Australians and Australias important institutions, such as universities, from being compromised. Thats really what were talking about here.We welcome the governments commitment to safeguarding Australians from foreign interference broadly, and specifically, in this motion, our universities. Equally, we welcome any measure that ensures government funded research is safe from compromise. Possibly in no other recent epoch in time have we seen just how important it is to have well-funded research. As we stare down COVID-19, the universities of the globe have been looked at through a lens greater than ever before for a solution to this pandemic. We understand that, like COVID-19, foreign interference poses a real and significant threat to Australias national security. As ASIO Director-General of Security Mike Burgess pointed out just last week, foreign interference in Australia has increased in both scale and complexity, targeting both state and federal institutions online and in real life. This demonstrates just how important our national security funding is. These activities can undermine Australias national security and sovereignty as well as its democratic institutions. Its the staff of agencies like ASIO that are truly the unnoticed heroes that keep our country safe as well, and I want to commend Director-General Burgess and his staff for the work that they do.This motion goes to addressing concerns around intimidation, threats and coercion towards researchers. Its quite frankly unfathomable that researchers could be threatened. I understand they may be coerced, but having them even being threatened here on our home soil is something most of us hope would never happen. Yet it is happening.We must do more as a parliament to protect our academics. Its essential that Australians and Australian institutions are adequately protected against this threat and, indeed, any other. Universities need to be supported by their government, and truly this starts by ensuring that they are well funded. Sadly, under this Morrison government funding has gone backwards. However, motions like this continue to put the spotlight on vulnerabilities caused when universities arent sufficiently supported. We know that during COVID-19 17,000 jobs have been lost across the university sector. This is a honeycombing of the university sector that we just cant afford. Also, knowing that teaching hours are being greatly reduced, remuneration for preparatory hours for lecturers and tutors has been greatly reduced, this puts more and more pressure on that institution all around.We in this place understand that legislation alone will not combat the complex threat. Building a resilient Australia resistant to foreign interference should involve buy-in and participation from all Australians. Quite frankly, that has to start with a respect of universities and these institutions from the government. Thats something that Ive really found lacking from this government in recent years. While on one side of the equation they talk about the importance of research, the importance of STEM subjects, the importance of growing and deepening our economic base and all the subjects that are required to do that, on the other side of the equation they surely do not balance it by cutting funding to universities. We know that desperate, cash-strapped universities have had to seek other forms of income, and this makes it very difficult for them.So from a strategic point of view universities are institutions that we must hold in the highest esteem. They must be places that are safeguarded from foreign interference. We must maintain our strategic alliances and defence relationships that are so critical to our national security. This can be done via universities.","National Security: Universities","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms SWANSON (Paterson) ","(17:53):"
386,0,0,0,1,2,"Christensen, George, MP",230485,"Dawson","LNP","N/A",3094," The alarming level of foreign interference in our universities and educational institutions leaves us incredibly vulnerable as a nation. In my view, enabling foreign states to exert influence over the education of our young people is a near treasonous act, as is allowing Australian research and technology to fall into the hands of a bad-acting foreign power or, worse, developing technology for that foreign power.In the last year, we have seen the revelation of the Chinese Communist Partys Thousand Talents Plan, a state push to poach the finest scientific minds from around the world in order to supercharge communist Chinas technological advancement, particularly in the military sector. Not only does this pose a threat to our national security; the threat is coming in part from our own universities. It also robs Australia of homegrown innovations which could have significant economic benefits for the country. These universities receive billions of dollars in taxpayers funds. These professors develop their ideas through taxpayer funded government grants, and then those ideas are shipped off to communist China to potentially be used against us. Its sickening.There are also 14 Confucius Institutes in Australia. These so-called Chinese language and cultural centres are set up through partnerships between Australian universities and Hanban, an organisation directly under the CCP Ministry of Education. Thus, the CCP essentially controls what is taught in Confucius Institutes, and you can guess that neither the Tiananmen Square massacre nor the ongoing Uighur genocide get a mention. This is pro-CCP education or indoctrination on our shores. The purpose of these institutes is to promote a positive image of the CCP and its policies in our nation and throughout the world.The university model in Australia has become largely dependent on foreign students and, in particular, Chinese students. In 2019, approximately 211,000 of the 756,000 international students in Australia were from China. Former University of Queensland vice-chancellor Peter Hoj was quoted as saying that without Chinese money Australian universities would be plunged into Dickensian conditions.In 2019, the UQ student Drew Pavlou was leading a demonstration against the CCPs treatment of Uighurs in Xinjiang when he was surrounded physically and assaulted by pro-CCP activists. Brisbanes Chinese consul-general and UQ adjunct professor Xu Jie publicly accused Mr Pavlou of being an anti-Chinese separatist, an accusation which is actually a capital offence in China. This caused a wave of death threats and online abuse directed at Drew and his family. He was subsequently suspended for minor infractions, apparently not related to his political activities. But here is a young man who took it upon himself to stand up for human rights abuses of a foreign totalitarian communist regime, and whats the result? Does this university, a place where free thought and altruism are supposed to be encouraged, support him? No; they condemn him. They dont condemn the death threats, they dont condemn the assaults, they dont condemn the consul-general incitement, they dont even condemn the genocide of Uighurs by the CCP. Instead they condemn Drew Pavlou, and instead they spent $300,000 on legal fees to fight cases brought against them by Drew Pavlou. Did they any spend money on finding or investigating who punched one of their students in the face during a peaceful protest on campus? Of course they didnt. Why? Because the university depends so much on Chinese money that it would rather condemn a law-abiding student than risk being seen to take sides against their biggest source of income, which happens to be a genocidal totalitarian communist state.Its not just the CCP. In 2008 the University of Griffith sought $1.3 million from the Saudi embassy to pay for its Islamic campus and offered the opportunity for the embassy to reshape its Islamic research unit. This raised fears within the community, particularly amongst Muslims, that the university would allow itself to become a centre for the propagation of Wahhabism. What the uni did not know was that this funding was part of a larger project by the Saudis for the gradual and secret promotion of Islamism on a global scale. This includes through our education institutes, academic centres and think tanks. We cannot allow this foreign-state-sponsored infiltration of our universities to continue.I recently tabled a report in this place, as Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Trade and Investment Growth, the Pivot report, which actually said to the government: force universities to disclose foreign funding that they receive and block that funding if its not in the national interest. This has already begun, with the government starting the worlds first universities foreign interference task force in 2019, but we cant take our eyes off the issue.","National Security: Universities","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr CHRISTENSEN (Dawson) ","(17:58):"

The member for Lindsay cant be here, because she is busy at the moment working with her community to protect life and property. We on this side, and I have noted a number of speakers on the other side of this chamber, take this issue incredibly seriously. As the member for Dawson has just pointed out, these are regimes that are not friendly to the rule of law, are not friendly to procedural fairness, are not friendly to fairness and freedom of the individual. This government has stood, in lock step, against the narcissistic self-interest of too many university administrators who would prefer cash to credibility, who would prefer to persecute those people standing up for the freedom and rights of individuals—of Australians and of foreign students—and to take the cash of, as the member for Dawson describes them, a homicidal totalitarian regime.My father came to this country from an oppressive left-wing regime after the Second World War. He came to this country because it stood as a beacon of hope and freedom for anyone who was willing to come here and have a go. Too many of our institutions have given themselves over to the interests of those groups who would seek to undermine the very liberties that this nation was built on. Too many of our so-called betters who speak down to us on an ever-increasing range of subjects are not willing to stand up to regimes that, frankly, in past generations would have been opposed because they seek to treat their citizens as vassals.We come to this chamber because we understand the importance of the rule of law. We understand the importance of the values on which this nation was founded: freedom and fairness. We understand that, unless you have freedom and fairness in a nation, you cannot have people like the member for Lindsay, who is currently working with her community to save her community. We know that, when you get rid of these things and when you silence people in this very chamber, in this very building, through sneer and smear and fear, what you create is a culture of cancellation, because you cannot deal with the arguments; you can only deal with cancelling them. If they do not like what someone is saying, too many on the left today deal with it by cancelling those people who are saying it. The member for Dawson has pointed out that, on our campuses, in this nation, in our time, we have had people who have been protesting in favour of freedom of speech and that university administrators have sought to cancel them—to shut them down; to, simply put, spend hundreds of thousands of dollars in order to achieve what they could not achieve through argument, and that is to cancel them and ensure that they cannot be heard.This is a fundamental freedom that we are talking about. Those opposite talk about cybersecurity. I dont wish to demean that as an incredibly critical issue, but are they serious? Are they serious, when those people who administer our universities, which are meant to be centres of higher thinking and higher learning, are busy undermining the very freedoms on which this nation was built? We cannot replace our values with cybersecurity measures. Firstly, we have to stand up for our very values. And unless this parliament is not unwilling to fundamentally stand up for those who cannot stand up for themselves then we are lost—we are lost in this nation.The motion that the member for Lindsay has put to this parliament is absolutely critical and core to what it means to be Australian. It is exactly what this nation was formed for. It is exactly the beacon of light that so many refugees, so many migrants—including my father—came to, to observe and live through.

390,0,0,0,1,2,"Wilkie, Andrew, MP","C2T","Clark","IND","N/A",3096," I move:That this House:(1) notes that:(a) there are 300 locally owned distilleries spread across 84 federal electoral divisions, which directly support over 5,000 Australian jobs, with a further 15,000 jobs created through the supply chain including across primary producers, hospitality and tourism sectors;(b) more than 65 per cent of Australian distillers are in regional and rural areas which bring economic benefits through farm production, manufacturing, regional tourism and hospitality;(c) Australia has the third highest spirit tax in the world, with spirits taxed up to three times more than wine, cider and beer, disproportionately impacting craft and boutique distilleries;(d) it makes no sense to tax grain-based spirits, like gin, vodka and whisky, up to $6 per litre more than grape-based spirits like brandy; and(e) given the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the industry, it makes practical sense to support our local craft distillers; and(2) calls on the Government to:(a) cut the spirits excise rate to the brandy rate;(b) freeze spirits and brandy CPI indexation for three years; and(c) provide much needed relief to local craft distillers by increasing the current excise refund scheme limit from $100,000 to $350,000 for two years, bringing it into line with the rebate offered to small wine producers under the wine equalisation tax.Less than 10 years ago, there were 28 distilleries in Australia, but today there are 300 locally owned distilleries spread across the country, including over 50 established or planned in my home state of Tasmania, where distillers are taking the world by storm as producers continue to win awards on the international stage for their world-class boutique whisky, gin and vodka. Craft distilleries are predominantly small and medium-sized family businesses in rural and regional areas, buying produce from local farmers, bringing in tourists and creating employment opportunities for local communities. In fact, they directly support over 5,000 jobs, with a further 15,000 created across the supply chain from primary producers and manufacturers through to sales and hospitality. However, the ability of this flourishing industry to recover from COVID-19 is being hamstrung. Its hopes of expanding overseas are being dashed, because Australia has the third-highest spirits excise in the world. Indeed, craft distillers are paying a whopping $88 of tax per litre of pure alcohol, which increases twice a year and is projected to reach $100 over the next five years for each litre of vodka, gin or whisky produced. Thats why I am today asking the federal government to make three changes to spirits taxation. These changes have been recommended by the Australian Distillers Association and Spirits & Cocktails Australia. I understand theyre widely supported within the boutique distillery industry.The first recommended change is that the spirits excise should be cut by $6 per litre, which would put it on par with the brandy excise rate. This seems only fair, given that, per standard drink, even brandy is taxed at more than double the rate of wine, cider or beer. Its nonsensical that the taxation rate is unequal across grape-derived spirits, like brandy, compared to grain-derived spirits, like vodka, gin and whisky. Moreover, as these increases are linked to CPI and reset every six months, actual prices are rising faster than inflation, because the tax increases are on top of the inflation, and that adds up big time. Australian distilleries have faced 20 tax increases in the past 10 years, which makes the industrys request for a three-year freeze on the biannual tax increase not unreasonable, giving businesses time to recover and grow post pandemic.The final recommended change is simply increasing the distillers excise refund scheme limit from $100,000 to $350,000 per year, which would bring it into line with the incentives offered to small winemakers and is self-evidently fair enough.I understand a justification for high-spirits taxation is to reduce the social cost of excessive alcohol consumption, but I am not convinced that the current tax system achieves this. Many government inquiries, including the 2009 Henry tax review, have criticised the inconsistencies within Australias alcohol tax system and have recommended reform. It was noted in the Henry tax review and then summarised in the Australian Distillers Association and Spirits & Cocktails Australia pre-budget 2021 submission, which said:Spirits are taxed at one level if they are fermented from grapes (specifically brandy), and at a higher rate if fermented from grain (such as whisky). Cheap wine is taxed lightly, while premium wine is taxed heavily. Additionally, beer is taxed at one rate at the local pub and another when purchased to consume at home.My intention is not to drive prices down for consumers and encourage irresponsible alcohol consumption but to enable small businesses to flourish in the domestic and international markets. Surely with the extra funds freed up from the excise charge, boutique distillers would be able to employ more staff, invest in better infrastructure and expand their markets.Tasmanias boutique distillers in particular desperately need this tax reform, and some may sink without it. Significantly, the spirits industry predicts these measures are revenue positive for the federal budget and will have a net positive $1.4 billion impact over the forward estimates. Modelling by PricewaterhouseCoopers demonstrates that resetting spirits tax rates can actually increase government revenue while at the same time help the spirits, tourism and hospitality sectors. It is clear that current spirit taxation is a huge barrier to locally made craft spirits, achieving success nationally and in overseas markets. Its just as clearly time the federal government implemented the measures I have outlined above and support local distillers.","Distillery Industry","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr WILKIE (Clark) ","(18:09):"

395,0,0,0,1,2,"Archer, Bridget, MP",282237,"Bass","LP","N/A",3098," Its no secret that Tasmania is leading the charge when it comes to topnotch distillery products in the Australian market, as evidenced by the number of my fellow Tasmanians speaking on this motion, and I commend the member for Clark for bringing it forward. There are now over 300 locally owned distilleries spread across the country, 52 of which are situated in Tasmania, producing some of the best whisky you can find. Thats not bias; a number of Tasmanian distillers have been named the best single malt whiskies in the world. In my electorate of Bass there are eight incredible locally owned distilleries taking the market by storm. I can stand by their products as I can proudly state I have tried the wares of each of the following local distillery companies: Abel Gin, Corra Linn, Darby-Norris, Fannys Bay, Flinders Island, Furneaux, Tamar Valley and Turner Stillhouse. I note that 65 per cent of Australian distillers are in regional and rural areas like northern Tasmania, bringing economic benefits through farm production, manufacturing, regional tourism and hospitality.Our government has implemented a number of measures to support our countrys growing distilling industry, including the measure which will see, from 1 July this year, alcohol manufacturers automatically receiving excise duty remissions when they lodge excise returns, assisting with cash flow and reducing compliance costs. This builds on the governments decision to extend the excise refund scheme to distillers from 1 July 2017. Under the scheme, eligible manufacturers of alcoholic beverages can claim a refund of 60 per cent of the excise duty paid on the products. From 1 July 2019 the cap for the scheme was increased from $30,000 to $100,000. Additionally, in December 2020 the government announced simplifying and streamlining the excise regime would be a new priority area for the Deregulation Taskforce. The task force is working to make it easier for business to invest and create jobs as well as assist in COVID-19 recovery.However, a significant block towards further economic growth of this industry still exists due to the current high rate of the spirits excise tax. Australia currently has the third-highest spirit tax in the world, with spirits taxed four times more than wine and cider and double the tax paid by brewers, disproportionately impacting spirit producers. I believe an opportunity exists to look at reducing the current rate of the spirits excise, even by a moderate amount, which would provide our distillers with the confidence to reinvest in their businesses and create further jobs in the hospitality and regional tourism industries, two industries that were hardest hit by the pandemic. According to the Tasmanian visitor survey in 2018, more than 126,000 people visited a Tasmanian distillery. Whilst visitor numbers may have been recently impacted by COVID restrictions, it is a growing market. Further, a modest reduction in the rate would support additional industries, including agriculture and advanced manufacturing. From the discussions I have had with local distillers, a rate reduction would have a significant positive impact on their business and growth potential.I have also had recent discussions with local microbrewers, including Will Egan, a local microbrewer and co-host of Tasmanian beer podcast Beer Babies. I was recently invited onto the Beer Babies podcast to discuss, in addition to my favourite local beer, Little Rivers pale ale, the issues currently facing small microbreweries in the state. Whilst this industry is not as severely affected by the excise tax to the extent distilleries are, they are still challenged by the current rate of excise tax. I look forward to raising their concerns further with the relevant ministers.Lastly, as we all know, this week marks the ominous one-year anniversary since the first round of social restrictions came into effect, including the shutting of pubs and clubs across Australia. Lion, owner and operator of the iconic Boags Brewery in northern Tasmania, has anointed tomorrow, 23 March, National Local Day to recognise the resilience of our pubs and clubs over the past 12 months. If you can, hit up your local establishment tomorrow and order a locally produced beer or spirit and show your support for your local hospitality and beer or spirit producer.","Distillery Industry","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs ARCHER (Bass) ","(18:14):"
396,0,0,0,1,2,"Sharkie, Rebekha, MP",265980,"Mayo","CA","N/A",3099," I am very pleased to second the motion by the member for Clark. I support his motion wholeheartedly. South Australia is famous around the world for its wine. In my electorate I have six wine regions that have become an integral part of our economic prosperity and tourism experience.We all recognise the importance of the wine sector in regional Australia and the significance the industry has for our international reputation for producing outstanding products. In recent years, we have witnessed the development of craft breweries and distilleries. A decade ago, we did not have a single commercial distillery in Mayo. Today, more than a dozen craft distilleries operate and, like their wine cousins, are among some of the best in the world, producing some of the finest craft gin and whisky on offer. As the member for Clark advised, this rapidly expanding sector now comprises more than 300 locally owned distilleries across Australia, supporting more than 5,000 direct jobs and a further 15,000 indirect jobs. This growth has occurred despite the inequitable application of the spirits excise causing unnecessary financial burdens on hardworking Australians. It is simply absurd that our spirits distillers are subjected to the third-highest spirits tax in the world. They are taxed four times more than wine and cider producers and twice as much as brewers in Australia.Ironically, according to independent modelling the government has an excise rate that is now so high that it collects less revenue than if the rate were lowered. It is absurd. The current situation is an opportunity lost. It is a revenue loss for government, an employment loss and an export opportunity loss. Demand for spirits is growing globally, and markets within our region are expected to grow substantially. We have distillers that are producing international-award-winning gins, whiskies and rums; however, we are exporting at only $4 per capita, compared to $171 per capita in Ireland, $85 per capita in Estonia, $70 per capita in Sweden and $11 per capita in our near neighbour New Zealand. The potential for the Australian distilled spirits sector is enormous. It has the prospect to share a similar success to that of our wine industry, and we know how important the growth of the wine industry has been over the decades for Australia. It has helped enormously in the regions.On a final note, many craft distillers have told me that, while they employ people in their enterprise, they often themselves have a second job, because the excise tax makes it so difficult to be viable. However, they persist because they are passionate. Its not hard to see in my electorate, when I go and visit many of my distilleries and take home a bottle of gin from here and there—I never drink and drive! But, when I go and see them, they are so passionate about the craft that they create, and its so incredibly disappointing that we keep taxing the lifeblood out of them. I support the member for Clark in his call for a cut of the spirits excise to the brandy rate, a freeze in the spirits and brandy CPI indexation for three years and an increase in the current excise funding scheme limit for craft distillers from $100,000 to $300,000 for two years.I bet most people dont realise that, when they go to a winery and at the cellar door they are poured a sample, that sample is excise free—there is no tax paid on that for the producer. However, if you go to a gin distillery door, they need to pay excise on that small taste that you have—bottle after bottle. It is costing them a fortune just to keep the doors open. I really think that we can do much better for our distilleries in this place simply by having a fairer tax regime for them. I want to see more distilleries in my electorate. I particularly love it because its a business that a lot of young people have moved into. But we are taxing the lifeblood out of this industry, and this industry will not flourish. The government says its a government for low taxes and believes that, by lowering taxes, we stimulate the economy. Well, this is a prime example.","Distillery Industry","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms SHARKIE (Mayo) ","(18:18):"

399,0,0,0,1,2,"MemberContinuation","IMW","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Mr TIM WILSON: Her crusade for lower taxes is certainly something I believe in. But to have lower taxes on distilled spirits, Deputy Speaker, well, that just lights my eyes up! As you know, I am a bit fond of a tipple from the wonderful gin distilleries of this great nation. I have paid my own fair share of tax and excise across this country, as many other people have, and I think its about time we had a proper discussion about reform as well, and I know a lot of other members in this place do too. I say that not as a producer. I dont have a distillery in my electorate, Member for Bass, Im sorry to say. Id be quite happy to open one and be the No. 1 chief patron; however, the space doesnt allow for it. But there are some in close proximity. Hippocampus, which used to be based in Western Australia, is I understand now in Bentleigh East, which is just outside the Goldstein electorate. We have the very energetic, young blokes from the Original spirit company, which, like many things in the wonderful Goldstein electorate, even if we dont produce it, we definitely consume it! So, we are very proud of our contribution in encouraging the distilled spirits market to grow particularly premium spirits.Its one of the great success stories of our country. If you think about all the things that we do, and there are many—we do wonderful wines, wonderful minerals, wonderful agriculture and aquaculture—this is one of those areas where we have created a sector out of pure value-add and human ingenuity. Its a space where we as a country do it so differently to everybody else, which gives us an incredible product position. But theres one thing thats holding us, like the entire country, back: we desperately need tax reform, tax reform, tax reform. Lets start with distilled spirits. Id like something a little bit bigger than that, but Ill take it as a good starting place. We have such unique ingredients. It is a product we can sell to the world and that the world yearns for. It loves the product we offer, but tax is holding us back.The member for Mayo made an excellent observation. If youve ever been to a gin distillery and talked to the makers, they will tell you explicitly about how the tax structures force them to pay tax up-front. There is no other sector that is required to do that. As a consequence, its harder for new businesses to be established. We could have more distilleries creating new and innovative products—more shiraz gins, more gins with lemon myrtle, more innovative hybrid products. The member for Mayo made a sound point on that too. Ive had some gins from her electorate. In fact, Member for Mayo, my parents went to your electorate recently and dropped off some gin from your electorate. I think I have had some from pretty much everybodys electorate. In fact, Im quite disturbed at how much excise tax I have paid! But thats by the by.We need these sectors to thrive, because there is potential not only for these products to be consumed by us, to generate local employment, although they can, and to be exported—and a lot of our distilled spirits go on to win global medals, and rightfully so, because they have such unique flavours and taste; more critically, tax is holding the sector back from growing by making it harder for people to invest, to start new and innovative products and to be able to go on and sell them to the world. If we want to have a successful distilled spirits sector, with the potential to grow—and we have a distilled spirits sector already, but it is being held back—if we remove some of the taxes and make them a bit more equal to other tax arrangements, it would allow the sector to flourish and thrive. You would get all the allied benefits as well. Youd have spirits regions, where people would go and enjoy tourism. Thered be local B&Bs and lovely restaurants and, yes, maybe wine as well—one of those other great success stories of our country. At every point, if we rolled tax back, we would enable and empower the sector to grow, to attract capital and to be part of the future success of our nation.I want to see change. I see members here from all sides of the chamber seeking change, particularly members from Tasmania. We give a fair amount of money to the Tasmanian government through direct transfers. I want to make sure that they go towards something that we could all enjoy more of. As part of the great tradition of our country, Deputy Speaker Wallace, you might remember that, right back at the foundation of the modern nation, when we became colonies, we used distilled spirits as a tradeable product. Lets bring that back and make it part of our future too!","Distillery Industry","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[3]","N/A","N/A"

403,0,0,0,1,2,"Mitchell, Brian, MP",129164,"Lyons","ALP","N/A",3102," I thank the previous speaker, the member for Goldstein, for his contribution and I thank the member for Clark for bringing this motion on. I am the co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Australian Spirits, so I am here with a vested interest. Im a big supporter of the measures that the member for Clark is calling for. But I just want to give a brief history lesson. I have spoken on this matter in the parliament before, but its always good to repeat history, in case its forgotten. It was a Tasmanian Labor politician, Duncan Kerr, the former member for Denison—in fact, the predecessor of the member for Clark—who was responsible for bringing in Australias spirits industry. As history shows, about 28 years ago, Bill Lark, who everybody knows is the godfather of Australian spirits, whispered in Duncans ear and said, Did you know distilling is illegal in Australia for craft distillers? and Duncan said, Really? All that was needed was a regulation change by the government. Duncan went to see the then customs minister, Barry Jones, and, with literally the swipe of a ministerial pen, the law was changed—it didnt even have to go to the parliament—and that brought in craft distilling in this country. Three hundred distilleries later and many hundreds of millions of dollars and thousands of employees—all thanks to a great Labor legacy of Duncan Kerr, Barry Jones and, of course, Bill Lark. It would be remiss of me not to mention that Bill Lark was inducted into the inaugural Hall of Fame by the Australian Whisky Awards on the weekend. Congratulations to Bill.Normally, I would get to my feet and talk about the many distilleries in Lyons. There are well north of 20, perhaps 30 by now. Every hour theres another one opening up. Theyre all wonderful in my electorate and many of them win awards. Ive used up my time, so I cant list the awards. Distilling in Tasmania has a special place in every Tasmanians heart. We are a world leader in gin and whisky and, as the member for Clark said, vodka. Im very proud to be co-chair of the parliamentary friends, along with Senator Perin Davey from New South Wales. We had our launch at the start of this year. It was a fantastic evening. We had Stu Gregor and Greg Holland there from the industry—two leading lights really putting the case forward.But the reason Im on my feet today is to talk about the very serious issue of tax reform for this industry. Its been put to me that spirits in Australia are now about where wine used to be. When wine taxation was reformed, it led to an explosion in the industry. It just blossomed. Thats what we want to see happen with spirits. Theyve done pretty well over the last 28 years, I have to say. Despite the incredibly onerous taxation on them and the excise requirements, they have done pretty well at growing the industry, but they wont reach their potential unless theres further reform. Were after a number of reforms, but the most critical is the $350,000 rebate. If they can get that in the upcoming budget, that would be a terrific start. We want wider reform, and the member for Clark has spoken eloquently about that, as did the member for Mayo. The critical, No. 1 issue that I would like the Treasurer to give attention to is to lift the rebate so that its on parity with wine. Theyre not asking for anything different to other industries. Theyre asking for parity and to lift the rebate to $350,000. Thats the most urgent thing the Treasurer can do. Its easy to do. It could be done in the budget. I reckon the industry would be pretty happy with that as a start. That would allow more investment in the industry and would allow many more people to be employed. Particularly, this is an industry that has suffered quite dramatically from COVID, as we know. Its not just a retail operation. It relies pretty heavily on tourism and cellar-door operations, and those sales absolutely crashed, particularly for the high-end product. I have figures here. There was a 21 per cent decline in sales volume for bottled spirits and a decline of up to 80 per cent at the cellar door because of the drop. This is an industry that really needs assistance. Its an industry that has fantastic potential. Its an industry thats well loved, not just by Tasmanians but by all Australians—","Distillery Industry","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BRIAN MITCHELL (Lyons) ","(18:28):"

406,0,0,0,1,2,"Gorman, Patrick, MP",74519,"Perth","ALP","N/A",3103," Lets distil this motion in simple terms. Our spirits manufacturers are asking for a level playing field—a spirit level, if you like. For some, it is too whisky to make the investment grow under current conditions. For some, it just rubs against the grain. They are treated differently to others in the alcohol production industry, but they dont wine; they keep their gin up. They put their case to government through the gin-dependent member for Clark and his motion.As others have said, this is a very highly regulated and highly taxed industry. Its an industry that does need our support, just as it supported our community over the last 12 months. I will talk about that more in a moment. We need to keep an open mind to make sure that the necessary changes to ensure future growth in this industry happen and to make sure it remains competitive internationally. Because one of the great stories of this industry is that, as we continue to produce here at home—there are many areas where we dont—this is one area where we are reducing our reliance on imported products.We talk about bringing back manufacturing to Australia. The distilling industry is manufacturing, and we should do what we can to support it. Its exactly what Australians want: quality jobs, value added, export ready. We saw that when we needed them. The distillers were happy to step up to the plate, happy to do something to support their community. They were in a very important part of our front line against the COVID pandemic. I look at the Whipper Snapper Distillery in East Perth in my electorate. Its a fabulous distillery. Alastair Murdoch and his team run an amazing operation that went practically overnight from making fabulous high-end products to turning fabulous Western Australian wine into hand sanitiser. Within a week they were pumping out 1,500 litres of hand sanitiser a week, filling key demand for industry, for the WA health department and others.Now, thankfully, they are back to their normal production and hoping to expand. It means they use more WA wheat. I went down there last week and said I would be speaking on this motion and I would love something that I could bring in—could they give me one little grain of wheat? As we know, this industry doesnt do things by halves. They suggested I hold this up in parliament, which I know Im not allowed to do. So I said, Thats very nice of you. That is Western Australian wheat used by a Western Australian business to create an export-ready product.Its not just exporting in terms of exporting our products overseas; its also a huge tourism industry in my home state of Western Australia. We have heard from every other member who has spoken about the tourism benefits of these industries. Look at businesses like Old Youngs in the Swan Valley. I spoke to them at the height of the pandemic and the international border closures last year, when they were thinking, What are we going to do? They are award winning, a great tourism destination for people who visit the Swan Valley. Most people who visit the Swan Valley just want a nice glass of wine. But not everyone wants a glass of wine, so if you are in the Swan Valley and you want something slightly different, I suggest you pop by Old Youngs. Of course it would be easier for more people to do that if the Prime Ministers plane tickets that he waves around also applied to trips to the great capital of Perth, which has unfortunately been forgotten by the tourism package that was announced the other week.I know my community supports these local distillers. Ive been bombarded by emails, as many have. You dont get many emails about complex tax policy, but I have received quite a few about this one. So to Joel, Carla and everyone who has been emailing me, I have received your emails and you are about to get an acknowledgement of that with this speech.The other thing for me in the electorate of Perth is the Northbridge night-time economy. Those people who like to get out and about at night time, isnt it great to see them consuming? You look at the beer list, the wine list— its Australian products. And more and more we are seeing distilled Australian products in the cocktails and spirits that people consume. The more we can do in this place to support that transformation is a good thing.Finally I want to acknowledge that the broader alcohol production industry has done it tough over the last year. I acknowledge the local breweries in my electorate who have done it tough—I give a particular shout to Reece Wheadon of Nowhereman Brewing—and the independent retailers who sell all these products. I will finish by congratulating—which I havent done in this place before—Commune Wine Store, who fought through ridiculous, oppressive regulation and finally got their store at Maylands open at the end of last year. Congratulations.The DEPUTY SPEAKER: The time for this debate has expired. The debate is interrupted and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.","Distillery Industry","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr GORMAN (Perth) ","(18:33):"

But we also need to make sure that we steward and take responsibility for our environment to ensure that the inheritance that our children and grandchildren and their successors receive is as good if not better than we received.That is why we as Liberals have always taken a strong view on the importance of environmental stewardship. I remind members that the foundation of the Australian Greenhouse Office occurred under the Howard government. Numerous environmental groups were founded under the Fraser government. The Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments have also continued this important tradition because we believe that we should steward, for the next generation, an environment thats as healthy and prosperous as the one we inherited.We know that the challenge of rising greenhouse gas emissions means that, as one of the nations that have harnessed the potential of our natural endowment, we need to repurpose that and refocus that so we have not just an industrial revolution in the past but a clean revolution in the future. We want to see Australias economy continue to grow, continue to clean and continue to provide the jobs and opportunities for the next generation of Australians.We have a very clear plan about achieving that. Under the Abbott government, we ratified the Paris Agreement, and, critically, as part of that process we committed Australia to a net zero emissions target in the second half of the century. Right now, we are focused on what we need to do to achieve that target and, where possible, to bring it forward—not just because its in line with the international community, though thats obviously an important part of it, but because it goes to the heart of who we are as a country. I sometimes hear people say, Australian emissions are only a small percentage of global emissions; what does it matter? And my response is always the same: if you as an individual litter, of course that is only a small share of the litter of the nation. But the whole principle of liberalism is the idea of empowerment through responsibility. Having 25 million people take responsibility for themselves should be the principle by which we wish to govern a nation—responsibility, responsibility, responsibility. So, while we encourage other countries to follow our lead, we still have a responsibility to do what we ourselves know to be right.Weve obviously set out a target, under the Paris Agreement, for the second half of the century. Were now seeking to implement it. But, critically, were not doing it in the same way that so many other countries are doing it and that those on the other side have sought to do it. Were not trying to do it through taxes, because we know taxes dont work; they only work as a mechanism by which government can raise more revenue for itself, rather than targeting measures and driving technology to be part of the solution. As many people have often remarked, the use of horses didnt end because we ran out of horses or we ran out of places to put their droppings or leavings. It was because we innovated new technology, like cars. And the next generation of cars will be part of our transport based solution to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions while continuing to drive the Australian economy.Renewables are a critical part of the discussion about moving from the traditions of fossil fuels to new energy generation. The investment were making in Snowy 2.0 is a critical part of it being the battery of the nation. And we should not remove from the table important energy generation which can be a critical part of a competitive, low-carbon baseload future, such as nuclear power. Anybody who wants to remove that from the discussion is saying they dont actually care about climate change, they dont actually care about reducing greenhouse gas emissions and they dont actually care about the future jobs of Australians.Our record, in taking this approach, is unambiguously clear. We smashed our Kyoto-era targets by 459 million tonnes because we brought the future forward. Australias emissions have fallen faster than the G20 average. Weve seen emissions drop, between 2005 and 2018, by 13 per cent. By comparison, so many other countries, including New Zealand, can only promise targets as long as they exclude their sectors. If we want agriculture to reduce its emissions profile, or transport, energy generation, land use and the rest, technology is going to be the solution. At every step, the Morrison government is about building the future of the nation, and its competitive future.","Climate Change","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr TIM WILSON (Goldstein) ","(18:39):"

413,0,0,0,1,2,"Kearney, Ged, MP","LTU","Cooper","ALP","N/A",3106," What we have here is a classic case of Morrison government spin—a beautifully worded statement that is just dripping in spin over substance. Its the motion equivalent of a photo op and no follow-through. And who better to bring it to us than the member for Goldstein, who has left the room. Its good to hear that he cares about climate change. But what good is caring about climate change if you have a government that is not going to do anything about it? Lets tell the people the truth: the only climate change policy this government has is one of neglect, inaction and denial.The first line of the motion says:… the Government is taking real and practical action to reduce emissions while protecting our economy, jobs and investment.Oh my goodness! Every man and his dog are crying out for a coherent energy policy which allows for real investment in key industry and jobs. Weve had 22 energy policies under this government. Its no wonder theres such limited investment in energy generation. Why would you invest, when the policy keeps chopping and changing?As Renew Economy reported last week, a new survey has found that big global investors say they want to invest $1 trillion in renewable energy over the next decade but that they are scared off from investing in Australia, because policy chaos makes it impossible to predict future returns. Can you imagine what a trillion-dollar investment would do for our country? The jobs, the jobs, the jobs; the multiplier effect for businesses, for apprenticeships and for actual emissions reductions, not the fanciful rubbish being put forward here.Australia is now an international pariah for lack of action on climate change. Around the world, 120 countries have a target of net zero by 2050. Its legislated in the United Kingdom, with a Tory government; in France, with a centre-right government; in Germany, with a conservative government; and in New Zealand with, well, Jacinda Ardern—shes wonderful! But this government thinks it doesnt need to do that. On the climate change performance index, Australia ranks 54th out of 61 countries for climate action and policy; thats just ahead of Kazakhstan and just behind Russia.As I said, every man and his dog, from the BCA to the National Farmers Federation, have backed net zero by 2050. They know it drives investment and will create thousands of jobs. But, without coherent climate and energy policy, all this government has done is drive down investment and stymie opportunity to revolutionise manufacturing and traditional industries right across our suburbs and regions. Climate change policy and energy policy is the key to getting green manufacturing, sustainable manufacturing, going across our suburbs and regions, building jobs. Just saying, Its technology and stuff wont cut it. We need specific action. We need real action. We need real policies.The claim being put forward by this motion is:(b) updated forecasts show Australia is on track to meet and beat its 2030 Paris target—For this, Ive got to turn to a fantastic article which just rips the government report to shreds. To quote Adam Morton:The first thing to stress here is in the title—these are only projections. The report tells us what we might expect to happen under current policy settings. It is frankly weird the primacy projections have been given in public debate, given what matters is actual cuts.… … …In terms of the actual numbers, the bottom line is that—at a time when other countries are announcing increasingly ambitious targets—the government expects national emissions to fall by only 6.8% this decade—Well, targets can be met if theyre crap targets! But, as Mr Morton says—That projected drop is almost entirely due to a surge in electricity production from wind and solar that the Morrison government has tried to slow, not accelerate. In most other areas of the economy the projections suggest there will be no change in emissions over the next decade—despite what the member for Goldstein was just carrying on about. So get real!The fact is: when Labor was in government over a six-year period, emissions reduced by 15 per cent. The coalition has been in government over a six-year period, and emissions have reduced by one per cent. Stop taking credit where its not due. You need to tell Australians what you intend to do to make sure we play our part in reducing emissions, because, frankly, catastrophic climate change is a problem that needs to be seriously addressed.","Climate Change","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms KEARNEY (Cooper) ","(18:44):"
414,0,0,0,1,2,"Simmonds, Julian, MP",282983,"Ryan","LNP","N/A",3107," We are taking real action on climate change, and I take up the challenge from the previous Labor speaker, the member for Cooper, to say what we are doing about it. What we are doing about it is technology, not taxes. They always arc up when we talk about this because the Labor members have never met a tax they didnt want to implement. On this side of the Chamber, we back Australians to create the technology that will allow us to reduce emissions whilst still creating and saving jobs and Australian livelihoods, which is so important.We have been at this, election after election, for some time now, and still the Labor Party can come up with no alternative policy for tackling climate change other than simply introducing more taxes on Australian families and Australian households that are already doing it tough. We simply say, time and time again, that that is not good enough. There has to be a way, and there is, and that is the real action the Morrison government is undertaking to ensure that we reduce emissions and take real action on climate change by doing it through technology, not taxes, so that we can support Australian households. That is why I really commend the member for Goldstein for bringing forward this motion today. I know that he is passionate about real outcomes when it comes to tackling climate change, as am I. I really commend him on the work that he has done over the years to push that agenda within the government.When it comes to emissions reduction, we as a government have a strong track record to be proud of, and I am proud to talk it up to my constituents. We absolutely smashed our Kyoto-era targets by 459 million tonnes and we are on track to meet and beat our 2030 Paris targets. Now, that is a fact, a truth, that those on the other side of the Chamber and the many action groups like Extinction Rebellion dont like to acknowledge because it doesnt fit with their political narrative. They laud other nations around the world who talk big on tackling climate change but then fail time and time again to meet their Paris or Kyoto targets or to track in line with those targets. They are still lauded by the groups on the Left.Quietly and methodically, this government have been getting on with the job of simply reducing emissions and meeting our targets. Over the last two years, our position against our 2030 target has improved by 639 million tonnes. That is the equivalent—these are all very big numbers, just to frame them in peoples mind—to taking all of Australias 14.7 million cars off the road for 15 years. What an extraordinary amount of reduction this government has achieved without a tax—a new tax that destroys families and costs families and removes opportunities for families—without destroying jobs, without destroying entire industries and throwing people on the scrap heap of life before a more complete transition can be undertaken. Under this government, emissions are lower than when Labor was in government and, indeed, lower than in any year under the previous Labor government. Thats something that I am proud of. That is something I know the member for Goldstein is proud of. As Australians who have contributed to this, we should all be proud of this.Australia is a world leader when it comes to renewables. In 2019 Australias investment in renewable energy per capita was greater than the USA, Japan and the UK, and more than triple the per capita investment of Germany, France, China and Denmark. Australias emissions have fallen faster than the G20 average, faster than the OECD average and much, much faster than similar developed economies like Canada and New Zealand. This is something we have already achieved, that we can be proud of, that simply isnt acknowledged by Labor members opposite and by other activist groups on the Left.Because we are committed to practical change driven by science and technology we are able to achieve this, and we are doing some great work in this space. In my own electorate of Ryan, at the CSIRO facility in Pullenvale, they are doing tremendous work on hydrogen energy, particularly on the ability to export hydrogen energy so that we can supply the world with cheaper and lower emission energy and help reduce emissions right across the globe, just as we have done and will continue to do, in Australia. I thank again the member for Goldstein for bringing forward this motion. We are committed to real action on climate change.

415,0,0,0,1,2,"Haines, Helen, MP",282335,"Indi","IND","N/A",3108," I was in Corryong two weeks ago when a women approached me on the street—Ill call her Samantha. Samantha told me that she had grown up in Corryong and had just returned after being away for 30 years. Corryong, in the Upper Murray, is The man from Snowy River country. Its remote and wild country. Before it becomes mighty, the Murray River begins its journey to the ocean here in these hills.Ive told the story in this place before how Corryong was cut off from power in the bushfires, because it relies on a single, fragile powerline going down to Wodonga, which was burnt down. But losing power is not a rare event for people who live here. Samantha told me that she loses power at least once a day, from anything for a few seconds to several hours. When she first moved back here in January, her mother, who still lives in the Upper Murray, told her to buy two things: candles and a torch. Samantha told me, You need them around here; nothing has changed in 30 years. Not exactly supporting Australian households, as the member for Ryan just suggested. Nothing has changed in 30 years.After the fires left it completely isolated, the Upper Murray community came together to try and fix its problem of unreliable and insecure power. The result is the Upper Murray Place-Based Power Plan, which aims to build a minigrid of dozens of connected solar generators and batteries right across the region. The community has won $3 million in bushfire recovery funds to start work on this. The minigrid will allow them to generate and store their own power, especially in a bushfire event but also to make sure they have an everyday power supply. When I read this motion, which is really just self-congratulatory guff, I think of places like Corryong, where everyday people are getting on and building their own solutions with renewables. The contrast between the stunning lack of action from government to support community-led renewables and the impressive commitment of regional communities is remarkable. This is, of course, the government that claims to be reducing emissions by subsidising a gas-led recovery. Politicians in this place often stand up and beat their chests about how regional Australia needs coal and gas for all sorts of reasons. But, once you get past the bravado, the reality on the ground is completely different. Its not just local communities; large regional manufacturers are turning off gas and turning on renewables, not for some highfalutin concern about the planet, but because it makes sense for them and us in the regions.Ryan and McNulty Sawmillers, a timber sawmill in Benalla, has plastered its roof in solar panels to save power. Senator McKenzie and I, on Friday, visited the new Wangaratta pool, and we saw how its powered completely now by rooftop solar. The Mars factory in Wodonga, just a week ago, announced that it, along with seven other Mars factories in Victoria, has gone 100 per cent renewable by partnering with a solar farm near Ouyen, in the member for Mallees electorate. Theyre procuring enough renewable power to process 185 million bags of M&Ms, and theyre doing it because they wanted to cut down on power outages, which are immensely costly for a large manufacturer like them, and because renewables are simply cheaper.In places like the Upper Murray, the most rural of communities youll find, people arent talking about gas. Theyre talking about renewables. Theyre talking about their own locally designed, locally driven minigrid proposal. I dont know whose idea the gas-fuelled recovery is, or who it actually serves, but its totally disconnected from the reality of regional Australia that I represent. Its disconnected from the reality of regional hospitals, regional councils, regional manufacturers and regional people, like Samantha, who are just trying to keep the lights on.These arent activists. These arent, as the Deputy Prime Minister suggests, inner-city lefties. The gas distribution network simply doesnt even physically cover most of regional Australia. It doesnt reach places like Corryong. If you want to cook with gas in Corryong, you need to use a gas bottle. The idea that subsidising big gas companies will help communities like Corryong is, frankly, laughable. The National Party, really the entire government, has got this one completely wrong. Its time they truly listened to regional communities and actually understood what real, practical action means. Renewables could be the best thing to happen to regional Australia since the wool boom, but no-one seems to get that in government.In the last parliamentary sitting I tabled a bill to set up a new agency: the Australian Local Power Agency. Its job would be to drive investment in locally-owned renewables in regional Australia that would see jobs procurement and money coming into regional Australia. We should put support right behind communities like the Upper Murray. We dont need a gas-led recovery; we need a renewable-led recovery and we need a community-led recovery, so I say to the National Party and the government to look at my Australian Local Power Agency bill and back in regional Australia in our economic recovery.","Climate Change","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr HAINES (Indi) ","(18:55):"
416,0,0,0,1,2,"Allen, Katrina, MP",282986,"Higgins","LP","N/A",3110," I rise in support of the motion proposed by my good friend and colleague the member for Goldstein. As I highlighted in my first speech, the threats of climate change are very real and affecting us all. That is why I am proud the Morrison government is unequivocally committed to the global push to tackle the challenges posed by the changing climate. Around the world, we are seeing countries with the strongest ambitions towards a low-emissions future relying on innovative and renewable technologies to achieve their goals. Under the leadership of the Morrison government, our plan is no different.The Morrison government are aware of both the environmental and the economic necessity of a clean and sustainable energy sector, which is why weve developed a clear and comprehensive plan in the Australias Technology Investment Roadmap, prioritising new and emerging technologies that will support jobs, drive our economic recovery and, vitally, reduce emissions. Our strategy is underpinned by the ongoing development and deployment of low-emissions technology to reduce carbon emissions and achieve our international obligations in combating the effects of climate change. Deploying the appropriate technology when and where it is required will allow Australian industry to capture these new opportunities—with enormous potential in low-emissions technology like hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, biofuels and resources, and energy export to reduce emissions—whilst simultaneously strengthening our economy.Its not just about talking the talk; its about walking the walk. And that is why Im very proud of the fact that we have identified, as a government, five priority technology stretch goals. The reason why this is important is that we need to partner with business and new technology to make sure that the strategy to get there is partnered with the free market. And Im very pleased to say that the Biden administration too has taken on these five stretch goals for low-emissions technology. Theyve added a sixth one, but they have included the first five. These ones, basically, will provide a comparative advantage for Australia.The first of those is clean hydrogen under $2 per kilogram, and weve already signed memorandum of understandings with the Japanese government about our hydrogen future. The second stretch goal is energy storage electricity for firming at under $100 per megawatt hour. The third is low-carbon materials, including low-emission steel production, at under $900 per tonne and low-emission aluminium at under $2,700 per tonne. These stretch goals are incredibly important because you need to partner an economically sensible and rational approach with an environmental outcome thats going to be good for the planet. The fourth stretch goal is carbon dioxide compression, hubs transport, and storage under $20 per tonne of CO2. The fifth and final, which I know the farmers and regional and rural areas of Australia will be very pleased about, is soil carbon measurement at under $3 per hectare per year. Australia is a big continent with a lot of topsoil, and the quality of our topsoil can be improved by carbon farming. With these pragmatic and technology focused ambitions, we can also grow our economy and create jobs, all while creating a green and sustainable future for generations to come.Our strategy is working, and we are achieving results. In 2020 we met and beat our Kyoto targets by 459 million tonnes, and that was without using carryover credits. Moreover, the recently released December 2020 forecasts further demonstrate our credentials on climate action, with Australia on track to meet and beat its 2030 Paris targets. Indeed, over the past two years, our position against our 2030 target has improved by 630 million tonnes, the equivalent of taking all of Australias 14.7 million cars off the road for 15 years.There is so much more to do. There is so much more with regard to getting behind the new technologies that are coming online. I really call on all Australians to embrace new and emerging technologies. That includes solar panels, with us having the highest uptake of solar panels per capita in the world, but also using other forms of technology, which includes things like low-voltage meters that can be applied to households and to businesses. I have such a business like that in Higgins. This helps to bring down the voltage requirements for your business or for your home and therefore brings down the cost of energy as well. Its important that all Australians get behind these new technologies, because its also about the consumer use and uptake of these affordable and reliable technologies.Our clear and comprehensive plan as a government is to reduce emissions by investing in technology, not through taxes, and continuing to back our strong economic recovery out of the COVID recession, as this will create new jobs for the sector—up to 130,000—by 2030 by investing in new technology.","Climate Change","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr ALLEN (Higgins) ","(19:00):"

They went down from 540 million tonnes in 2012 to 527 million tonnes in 2014. Its very clear that, when the Abbott government removed the price on carbon emissions, they started increasing again.Australia would have to be one of the only nations in the world that had a successful policy of reducing carbon emissions, and had a national government come along and say: You know what? This policy is working so well, were going to abolish it and remove it; were going to get rid of it! And guess what happened? Carbon emissions went up again. And our kids and our economy will be paying for it, because not only are our kids going to inherit a dirtier, more polluted environment thats not safe, but also our economy is missing out on the economic opportunities that come from transferring to renewables.The claim in this motion is that emissions are reducing. I wonder how they got to this claim that emissions are reducing? I did a bit of research. The way they do it is that Minister Taylor claims that the impact of the extraction of LNG in its processing and the emissions that this produces should be excluded from Australias greenhouse gas reporting obligations because its predominantly exported! Can you believe that! This minister thinks that he can hoodwink the Australian people in that manner by saying: You know all of those emissions that we produce from LNG exploration and export here in Australia? Were going to exclude those. Its like saying, From all the emissions that are produced from cars in Australia, were going to exclude Toyotas because Toyotas are produced overseas—despite the fact that theyre driven on Australians roads. Its ridiculous! But thats what this government is doing.Over the last decade, Australia has had a big increase in greenhouse gases produced by the extraction and processing of LNG. They cannot be excluded from our figures. Thats how the government claims that emissions have been reducing—by excluding one of the biggest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions—and Australians are paying the price: a dirtier, unhealthier environment for our kids, and missing out on economic opportunities.The transition to renewable energy is occurring whether we like it or not. This government, despite its attempts, is not going to be able to stop that. Despite many of its backbenchers wanting to invest in coal-fired power stations and put public money into them, the government is not going to be able to stop that. So the question for the Australian people and the Australian government is: how do we position ourselves so that we benefit economically from the increase in renewables throughout the world and the industries that will come?How does Australia position itself to benefit from solar, from wind, from hydrogen, from electric vehicles, from soil sequestration and from new agriculture? How do we grow those jobs, jobs, jobs that come from these new and emerging industries? This government has no plan to capitalise on the economic transition thats taking place and were missing out on business investment and were missing out on training a new workforce. Most importantly, were missing out on the jobs that come with that transition to renewable energy. Its a disgrace that this government has no policy to reduce carbon emissions and that were missing out on those job opportunities for our future.","Climate Change","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[6]","N/A","N/A"

In my electorate of Mallee these measures are also improving our local economy, our jobs and our investment prospects.In a previous speech to the House, I spoke of Mallees potential to be a nation leader in renewable energy, with wind projects in the south and significant solar projects in the north. But I also argued that we need to prioritise projects that will increase our nations transmission capacity in order to harness the full potential of existing resources and to promote future investment in renewable energy. Im happy to inform the House that since my last speech the Commonwealth government has chosen Kerang, in my electorate, as the route for the new VNI West interconnector between Victoria and New South Wales. The government has also invested $250 million in the 2020 Commonwealth budget to expedite this and other key transmission projects, including the Marinus Link. This is a huge win for Mallee as it will allow the solar energy sector in the north of the electorate to flourish and expand. Private investors have been knocking on the door for years, but some have lacked confidence due to the lack of transmission capacity. Im so pleased that the Commonwealth government is supporting this thriving and growing industry in my electorate, and Im eager to work with industry and private investors to get more solar power into Mallee.Ive also spoken about my desire to see Mallee become a hub for hydrogen energy and biofuels, and there has been a lot of progress made in this space as well. The Loddon-Mallee branch of Regional Development Australia has completed its hydrogen road map, which plots a course of opportunities for investment and growth in our region for the emerging hydrogen industry. It identifies several opportunities for Mallee in hydrogen, including pursuing collaboration with industry, attracting investment and establishing a hydrogen steering committee.Another local organisation, the Mallee Regional Innovation Centre, has also received funding to take part in a nationwide hydrogen cluster through National Energy Resources Australia, NERA. This cluster will advance research on new hydrogen technologies to help develop this emerging industry. This places Mallee in a position to be a leader in hydrogen, which is very exciting, given the prospect of linking solar generation with the creation of clean hydrogen. This is also something I supported and campaigned for.I have also recently met Luke Jansen and Mike Free of FreeGen, a company aiming to produce millions of litres of renewable green fuel, as well as hydrogen, at a facility to be constructed in Mildura. Their technology takes waste products and converts them to hydrogen and green fuels. The green fuel they aim to produce can replace diesel in existing transport and machinery to rapidly lower emissions. FreeGen is seeking support to secure private investment for their project, which would lead to hundreds of new jobs for the region.This week I was pleased to host Linda and Peter from RDA Loddon-Mallee; Leonie and Rebecca from the Mallee Regional Investment Centre; and Michael and Luke from FreeGen in Canberra. The group met with the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction, Angus Taylor, to discuss this exciting work. Whether its through investments in new technologies or strengthening the nations transmission capacity, the Morrison-McCormack government is focused on energy security for future generations and is committed to reducing emissions and tackling climate change.I support ongoing investment into renewable energy technologies in my electorate and into Australias energy grid infrastructure. And I will continue to support the development of related projects in my electorate of Mallee.","Climate Change","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr WEBSTER (Mallee) ","(19:10):"

They havent been rewarded with ministries; the modern Liberals have been rewarded with a chair of the Economics Committee and lots of other chairs, but they dont quite make it to the upper echelon. The modern Liberals are the underfaction of the Liberal Party. You can see it, because its not just about the roles that theyre given; its also about the policies that they put forward. There have been a few. I noticed the member for North Sydney was pushing for net zero emissions by 2050, but the Prime Minister shut that down very quickly. Many others have said that maybe there should be net zero emissions by 2050, given all the states and territories, the Business Council, the Farmers Federation and the free world have already committed to net zero emissions by 2050, yet the government, despite the gnawing by the modern Liberal faction, despite the clutching by the modern Liberal faction, havent been able to move a policy that is anywhere near credible climate policy.There is a government instrument that would be helpful in bringing down our emissions. There is one. Its sitting on the books right now and it is called the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. The member for Mackellar was very busily interjecting when I was speaking before but was silent when the member for New England moved amendments on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation.

What did the government want to do to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation before the member for New England came in here and moved an absurd amendment that not even the government could support and they had to pull the entire bill? The government wanted to reduce the low-emission aspect of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation so the Clean Energy Finance Corporation could invest in programs that werent about low emissions. The government also wanted to remove the financial tests for the return on investment of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. Their idea of emissions reduction policy and supporting government agencies that are actually doing the work on the ground in emissions reductions was to make sure that they could invest in higher emissions technology, not low-emissions technology, and there was poor economic management and a poor return on investment. That is the legacy of this government. Its dysfunctional. The Nationals are all over the place. The modern Liberals are giving it a go, but theyre only getting the committee chairs; theyre not getting the ministries. What we have seen is that we are an international embarrassment and a laggard on climate policy. Quite frankly, we need a Labor government to get this job done.","Climate Change","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[4]","N/A","N/A"

I havent seen a comedy act better than that since two clowns and a circus monkey got involved! Three rings and a Josh Burns are what every good childrens party needs!The member for Macnamara seems to have confused Australia with that imprisoned island of Cuba. How un-Australian! Youre meant to go to the United Nations to have some tin-pot regime shout down a liberal democracy on the basis of human rights, not come to the Federation Chamber of the national parliament to hear an opposition backbencher—I would describe him as humble, but I believe that would be misleading the parliament—say, This faction of the Liberal Party, these modern Liberals, are giving it a go. Theyre only some of the most important House of Representatives committee chairs in this place, but he, as a backbencher in opposition, can tell us all about how we should be running climate policy in Australia!The fact of the matter is that the member for Kingsford Smith and the member for Macnamara simply have to come in here and use the same sort of illogical, irrational, unmathematical—innumerate would be a word you could use for both members; however, it would be unfair to those genuinely suffering from innumeracy. Everything that is up is down in their world. An increase is in fact a decrease. A decrease is in fact an increase. The member for Kingsford Smith was holding up a prop, but he was holding it upside down! Those opposite are a three-ring circus. I would like to say theyre missing clowns, but the problem is that theyre all clowns—every single one of them.This government has driven down greenhouse gas emissions in Australia. We have put the highest level of investment into renewable energy, compared to anywhere else in the world, per capita, multiplied twice. The rest of the world is looking at us, going, How can we do it as well as theyre doing it? The members opposite compare us to places like the United Kingdom, which had a 68 per cent decrease in greenhouse gases, but fail to mention the fact that they dont have any extraction resources or an export farming sector. They look at New Zealand—whose emissions have gone up, while ours have gone down by 19 per cent—which excludes agriculture from their outcome. Australians are leading the world. We should be proud of what weve managed to achieve, given the circumstances in which we have achieved them.We are exporting gas to those countries that otherwise would be using coal-fired power. We have reduced greenhouse gas emissions in South Korea and Japan, and the only thing that the opposition can do is sneer, fear and smear. They are their three tactics. They cannot deal in facts, they cannot deal in numbers, and they cannot deal in graphs held the right way up. All that they can deal in, quite frankly, is sneer, fear and smear, because they need to silence anyone who stands up with a factual statement. Fact: Australia is per capita the largest investor in renewable energy anywhere in the world by a factor of two. Fact: our emissions have come down by 19 per cent since 2000.We have met our Kyoto targets. We will meet our Paris targets. The Prime Minister has made it clear that our aspiration is to get to net zero before 2050 if possible. Unlike those opposite, who have a target without a plan—because lets face it, those opposite are a conclusion in search of a fact, and theyre yet to find one—this government is achieving what it said it would. We are not taxing Australian households. We are not taxing Australian companies. We are not destroying jobs. We are leading the world, and we should be proud of it. Its about time those opposite got in the game of agreeing and putting that forward.","Climate Change","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[9]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr FALINSKI (Mackellar) ","(19:19):"
