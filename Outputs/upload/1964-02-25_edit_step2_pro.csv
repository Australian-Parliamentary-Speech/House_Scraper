Many of them were the subject of policy statements during the election campaign, and will be referred to later in this speech as part of a legislative and administrative programme of action.The Parliament meets at a time when we had been looking forward, with loyalty and affection, to a visit by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother. We learned with deep regret that illness compelled Her Majesty to cancel her journey. We welcome the news of her steady recovery. Many millions of Australians have lasting and loving memories of her previous visits, and of her warm and gracious personality, so we are happy to regard her visit as a pleasure deferred, but not foregone.Since the Parliament last met, two tragic events have occurred. The assassination of President Kennedy deprived the world of a statesman of courage, character, and imaginative ability, and Australia of a warm and understanding friend. My Government has conveyed to the people of the United States of America, through the new President, the grief and sense of loss of all the people of Australia.The other tragic event concerns us in this country. The recent collision which resulted in the sinking of H.M.A.S.  Voyager  and the loss of the lives of so many gallant Australian sailors, is now under full and far-reaching judicial investigation by a royal commission. Meanwhile, the hearts of all Australians have gone out to those who have been so suddenly bereaved, and to those who were injured.In the field of foreign relations my Government will continue, through the United Nations and its agencies and by direct and sustained diplomatic effort, to promote the peaceful settlement of disputes, international stability, and rising standards of self-government and prosperity.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/quote/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

215,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MENZIES, Robert","N76","KooyongPrime Minister","LP","N/A",14,"- As honorable members know, since we last met the death by assassination of President John Kennedy of the United States of America occurred on Friday, 22nd November, 1963. He was the thirty-fifth President of his country and had held office for two years and ten months when his life, as I have said, came to its end in this brutal fashion. President Kennedy was sworn in on 20th January, 1961, and in his inaugural address to the people of the United States he set forth both the aim and the promise of his administration, namely, to begin anew the quest for peace and to seek a world alliance against tyranny, poverty, disease and war.The late president was born in Massachusetts on 29th May, 1917. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1946. In 1952 he entered the United States Senate as senator for the State of Massachusetts. In 1960 he won the Democratic Partys nomination for the presidency and was elected president in November of that year. He was the youngest man ever to be elected President of the United States.During the war he served with very great courage and distinction in the United States Navy and, as honorable members know, he had an association at that time with our own country through the activities of an Australian coast watcher, activities which he never ceased to refer to with marked gratitude.He was a very remarkable man. I will always regard it as a great privilege to have known him and to have discussed various matters with him. He was a remarkable man from the point of view of the world because he had large ideas and, as experience grew, he was able to pursue those ideas with more and more force and point. He undoubtedly had a great contribution yet to make to the world. He was of great significance to us in Australia because in a simple, unaffected and inquiring way he had a feeling of friendship for Australia and a feeling of interest in this country which I am bound to say I have never known quite equalled by any of his predecessors. He was a friend of ours.So the world has lost a leader and we have lost a friend. His wife has lost a famous husband and his children have lost a great father. Most of us in one way or another have taken the opportunity to say something about this event and to convey our sympathy, but I think it is appropriate that we in this House should place our feelings on record in due parliamentary form so that our expression is the product of this Parliament and of this country. I therefore move -That this House records its sincere regret at the death- of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, President of the United States of America, places on record its appreciation of his high courage and devoted service to the cause of international peace, expresses to the people of the United States its profound regret at the loss they have suffered, and tenders its deep sympathy to Mrs. Kennedy and her family in their bereavement.","N/A","DEATH OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
216,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CALWELL, Arthur","BV8","Melbourne","N/A","Leader of the Opposition",15,". - I support the motion. 1 want to say only a few words about the person who was taken from this earth so suddenly and in such shocking circumstances in November of last year. A great and good man died and a generous and noble heart ceased to beat when John Fitzgerald Kennedy, the thirty-fifth President of the United States, fell before an assassins bullet at Dallas, Texas, on 22nd November, 1963.President Kennedy attained the worlds highest elective office at the early age of 43. His occupancy of that office ended all too soon, with his work, so full of promise for his country, so full of hope for us all, only just begun. Like his illustrious predecessor Abraham Lincoln, he sought to make great and significant changes in the society in which he was called to lead. Like Lincoln, he knew that a house divided against itself cannot stand; it was President Kennedy who said, in the spirit of Lincoln -The science of weapons and war has made us all one world and one human race, with one common destiny.Like Lincoln, he met his death at the hands of an assassin.Death is always sad, whenever, at whatever age, it comes. Death takes on an unutterable sadness when it strikes down a nations chief executive at the full height of his powers, with great prospects opening up for him and his country. But when death comes as it did to John Fitzgerald Kennedy - the youngest president the United States has yet known, highly gifted, deeply dedicated, justly proud of his achievements, gracefully confident of his power to achieve more - and when that death comes with all the meaninglessness of assassination, then its sadness takes on a horror never to be obliterated from our memories.Let not the manner of his death obscure the meaning of his life, for in life his successes were noble and substantial. He will be remembered by a grateful world for his work in negotiating with Premier Khrushchev and Mr. Macmillan the partial nuclear test ban treaty. This is, and must be, regarded as a, milestone along the long and difficult road towards universal disarmament. His firm but restrained handling of the Cuban crisis in 1962, his clear but calm attitude towards the Berlin problem and his vigorous warnings of the futility of nuclear war all raised the hopes of mankind for a better, saner world. By his very strength of character and the purpose and ability with which he pursued his policies for human betterment; President Kennedy naturally became a controversial figure in his own country and beyond it. He strove to break down the barriers of racial discrimination. In doing so, he stirred up bitter animosities. In the light of the many still unresolved century-old problems created by the Civil War, such a situation seemingly was inevitable.What John F. Kennedy might have achieved had he lived out his full term of office and had he been, as seems most likely, elected for a second term, remains a subject only for speculation now. He will always remain a symbol of youthful promise, unfulfilled through tragic early death. But it is what he achieved that matters, and already he had won a place in the hearts of his fellow citizens and of freedom-loving people everywhere. In his last message to the people of the world, delivered at the United Nations General Assembly a few weeks before he died, John F. Kennedy spoke of the qest for peace and said that the badge of responsibility in the modern world was a willingness to seek peaceful solutions.  Let us , he said,  take our stand in the United Nations and let us see if we, in our time-, can move the world towards a just and lasting peace. These words, from one of his last great speeches, might well be his epitaph. May his memory remain ever-green and may the sum total of his achievements shine as a beacon light for those who seek the path to peace and a better life for all mankind.No tribute to the late president should neglect to make reference to his brave and gracious wife. The days of sorrow have been more difficult for her than for any one else, but she was blessed, as few women have been, to give her hero husband the comfort of her arms in the hour of his death. In life and in death she was beside him. History will not fail to find its place for Jacqueline Kennedy as one of the most distinguished women of America and one of its most notable and courageous First Ladies.Question resolved in the affirmative, honorable members standing in their places.","N/A","DEATH OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
217,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MENZIES, Robert","N76","KooyongPrime Minister","LP","N/A",16,"- Mr. Speaker, this House and, indeed, this nation, sustained a grievous blow on Christmas Eve when Athol Townley died. He was elected to the House of Representatives for the Division of Denison in Tasmania in 1949 and was re-elected in 1951, 1954, 1955, 1958, 1961 and 1963. He had a long Ministerial experience. He became Minister for Social Services and Minister in charge of War Service Homes on 1 1th May, 1951, and continued in those portfolios until July, 1954. He acted as Minister for Health during the absence overseas of the then Minister, the late Sir Earle Page. He became Minister for Air and Minister for Civil Aviation in 1954 and continued in those portfolios until October, 1956. In those capacities he visited the United Kingdom, Europe, Canada and the United States of America between January and March, 1955. On 24th October, 1955, he became Minister for Immigration, -\ post which he continued to occupy until 19th March, 1958. In 1957, he waa Acting Minister for Air during the absence overseas of the Honorable F. M. Osborne.Mr. Townley was Acting Minister for Health again in 1957. He acted as Minister for Civil Aviation in January andFebruary, 1958, and again in February, 1960, during the absences overseas of Senator Paltridge. He was also Minister for Defence Production from 11th February to 23rd April, 1958, and Minister for Supply from 11th February to 10th December, 1958. He acted for a time as Minister for Trade during two absences of my colleague, the Right Honorable John McEwen. Mr. Townley became Minister for Defence on 10th December, 1958, and was still in that post at the time of his death. He represented the Commonwealth Government abroad at the inauguration of the Parliament of the Federation of the West Indies in 1958 and subsequently visited the United States of America and the United Kingdom to discuss joint defence problems. In 1961, he again discussed joint defence problems in the United States, the United Kingdom and New Zealand, and he conferred with the United Kingdom and New Zealand Ministers for Defence at Singapore in March, 1962. He visited Indonesia in June, 1962. This, Mr. Speaker, is the bare record of a most versatile experience and service to this country.After Mr. Townleys visit to Indonesia, his health deteriorated, as I think many of us did not fail to observe, but he continued to serve, with great activity, selflessly and faithfully as a Minister. Indeed, in the Department of Defence he marked his period of office by some notable achievements, none of which was more notable than that which he produced at the time of his last visit to the United States. At the time of his death, he was ambassador designate to that country, and this was a post to which, as I well know, he was looking forward very keenly and which he could have decorated magnificently, for few men whom I have known throughout my life have had such a faculty of establishing personal relations and personal understanding. This was a very remarkable gift that our colleague possessed.Mr. Townley served his country during the last war as well as in the political sphere. He went into the Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve in 1940 as a sublieutenant and rose to the rank of Lieutenant Commander. He served in England and the South-West Pacific area and, indeed, was in command of one of the small vessels in Sydney Harbour on the notable occasion when Japanese midget submarines attacked there in 1942.I cannot permit myself to say all that one should say. This touches me too closely. Mr. Townley was extremely widely respected. He was greatly loved in the city of Hobart in which he and his family had lived. He played a conspicuous part in the life of that city. All of us who bad the opportunity to be at the funeral in Hobart were tremendously touched by the way in which this public respect was manifested. He was well-known there as a churchman, as a yachtsman, as a remarkable all-round sportsman - he was a cricketer - and as a pilot. But, apart from all those attributes, it was as a human being that he found his place with us. He was tremendously loyal to his friends, generous of mind and devoted to his tasks. He had a remarkably modern outlook and a delightful humour. He combined character, ability and charm. The truth is - I can say this for all of us, but I say it for myself - I shall always have him in my heart and in my memory.His wife who survives him is well known to most of us. She is a great lady in her own right. To her we extend all the most heart-felt sympathy that we can express. He left a son - a fine young man. They have the comfort of knowing that, whatever else he may inherit, he inherits a great name.Sir, I moveThat this House expresses its deep regret at the death on 24th December, 1963, of the Honorable Athol Gordon Townley, a member of this House for the Division of Denison from 1949 until 1963 and a former Minister of the Crown, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HONORABLE ATHOL GORDON TOWNLEY, M.P","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
218,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CALWELL, Arthur","BV8","Melbourne","N/A","Leader of the Opposition",17,". - It is the sad duty of .he Opposition to support the motion proposed by the Prime Minister (Sir Robert Menzies). The late Mr. Townley was highly respected in this Parliament on all sides. He had a host of friends here and outside the Parliament. He was one of those strangely gifted people who could enter into debate, take all the barbs that were hurled at him and, in replying, not seem to wound. He certainly left no bitterness behind when he made his points. In more recent years he spoke rarely, but he was a most knowledgeable man. He was very human in his approach and quite understanding when points about legislation or some act of administration were put to him in his ministerial capacity.I have known very few people like Athol Townley. It was possible to address a remark to him or to have a discussion with him and feel that he did his best to give whatever reply he could give. We always found him a man who understood the duties of his office, who knew more about administration than most people do and who was not only widely read but was also a very active man for one who was around the age of 56 years. He flew his own aeroplane. He sometimes piloted aeroplanes in which he was travelling from Canberra to Sydney, Melbourne or Tasmania. I believe he is the only member of this Parliament - certainly the only Minister - who has ever flown an aeroplane at 1,500 miles an bour. He piloted one of the new Mirage fighters. He was not only a Navy man, and a dis tinguished one too, but he knew a good deal about aviation. After the war he learnt more about aviation than most people would ever know and was himself an expert in the field.As Minister for Defence he had a great responsibility thrust upon him in difficult times. He discharged his obligations and duties with a full sense of responsibility. One of my last discussions with him - it may have been the very last - took place behind the Speakers Chair just before the last Parliament was dissolved. Mr. Townley told me that he was going to America on the following day and that an announcement to that effect would be made. He took on the task of canvassing Cabinet Ministers in the United States and interviewing other persons in high positions about a new bomber for the Royal Australian Air Force. He had been ill. I told him that I thought he was very game to contemplate making such a quick trip abroad in order to fulfil his public duties. He said that the mission had to be undertaken and that he was prepared to undertake it. I heard of Mr. Townleys death with very great sadness, as did all honorable members, I am sure. His death came so unexpectedly and so suddenly; it came at a time when everybody was waiting to hear that he had left hospital. When he was ill 1 addressed messages of sympathy to him and my last message was more cheery than the others because I told him that I hoped to see him out of hospital very soon.Mr. Townleys parliamentary career extended from 1949 to 1963. He intended to leave this Parliament soon in order to fulfil an obligation to the people of Australia in the diplomatic world. He was robbed of that opportunity by his death. We will always remember Athol Townley as a cheerful, genial and kindly man. I join with the Prime Minister in expressing sympathy to his widow and her son on the death of a very good husband and a very good father.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HONORABLE ATHOL GORDON TOWNLEY, M.P","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
219,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MCEWEN, John","009MB","Murray","CP","Minister for Trade and Industry",18,". - I desire to associate myself and my colleagues of the Australian Country Party with the expressions of sympathy embodied in the motion and in the speeches made by the Prime Minister (Sir Robert Menzies) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Calwell). We extend our deepest sympathy to Mr. Townleys widow, his son and other relatives. My colleagues and I are more deeply grieved by Mr. Townleys death than I can command words to express. To say that we all liked and respected Athol Townley is a tremendous understatement of our real feelings. He was a real man in physique and intellect but above all in ,his qualities of character and his true integrity.All of us like to think that there is a type of Australian manhood which embodies qualities that we admire. I believe that Athol Townley embodied those qualities which which approach a standard of perfection in Australian manhood. He was a vigorous and virile man. He was an athletic man, a sportsman. He was a good companion. He had a rare good humour and wit. Above all, he was a man upon whom anybody could rely in any circumstances. He was a man of great courage. He served his country with great distinction in war in some very perilous circumstances - in convoys in the North Atlantic in bitter winter weather, handling unexploded bombs in the United Kingdom, and here in Australia in command of small craft. He served in dangerous situations in our own theatre of. War. Here was a man who really served his country with great courage and great distinction when the testing time came.His qualities were many and varied. He was a highly successful business man. Those who attended the funeral service in Hobart must have been impressed by the testimony of his leadership in his own church. That was crystal clear there. Of course, Athol Townley was a very happy family man. He was a friend of all people.Like all of us, he had his party affiliations; but I believe that in carrying out his duties he knew no party lines when it came to deciding whether he could do anything to help a person along in his own electorate or anywhere else. He certainly was a man without any prejudice and without any bitterness. I never knew a sour word to come from Athol Townleys lips nor can I remember a sour expression ever being directed to him. That was a reflection of the kind of character he had and the esteem in which he was held.While he was serving with us all here his parliamentary service and governmental service were of great distinction. There must be few people of whom it can be said that in fourteen years of parliamentary service almost thirteen years were served with ministerial rank. That is a very rare experience and a revelation of Athol Townleys qualities. The Prime Minister has recounted the succession of high offices that he held. To cap that real service in the field of government, as we all know he was the ambassador designate to the greatest country in the world to-day - our great friend, the United States of America. We would have been represented magnificently by him and I have no doubt that he would have done tremendous things to entrench even deeper the good relationship between our two countries. His likeable qualities and his forthcoming honesty made him a very good negotiator. At all times he had a valuable record in that field. Those of us in the Parliament who served with Athol Townley are deeply sad to-day. Australia has lost a very good man and our deep sympathy goes out to Mrs. Townley and to Athol Townleys son.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HONORABLE ATHOL GORDON TOWNLEY, M.P","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

AsI entered this Parliament in 1946, it follows that I was a Tasmanian colleague of Athol Townley from the time he first stood for this Parliament in 1949 and during his entire parliamentary career. I wish to offer my brief but sincere tribute to Athol Townley, whose public service was so outstanding. As we all know, the burden of his latter responsibilities probably contributed to his early demise. He will be remembered for his service in war as in peace. Not least he will be remembered by many people in Hobart whom he and his brother, Rex Townley, helped in a very material way in the pre-war days when times were difficult for many families. He will be greatly missed. I tender my sincere sympathy to his wife, Mrs. Hazel Townley, and to his son, Athol David.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HONORABLE ATHOL GORDON TOWNLEY, M.P","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Others have spoken with the sincerity of long association of the worth of Athol Townley, both as a statesman and as a man. In extending my sympathy to Mrs. Townley and her son Athol, I would like to pay a personal tribute. Not only has Mr. Townley set high standards for me to follow in the representation of Denison, but he kindled my interest in a political career. When I was at the bar in London in 1961, the then Minister and his gracious wife, who were visiting England, entertained me at a small party. It , was there that he suggested to me that I directly interest myself in a political career. It is most unfortunate that my political debut should have been brought about by Athol Townleys death.In Denison the name of Athol Townley is respected by people in all walks of life. The first public function that I attended in Hobart after the Denison by-election was the opening of the Athol Townley Memorial Wing at St. Annes Rest Home in Hobart. That new wing will perpetuate the memory of Athol Townley. That speaks more eloquently than I could ever hope to speak about the feelings of the people of Hobart.

222,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MENZIES, Robert","N76","KooyongPrime Minister","LP","N/A",19,"- The Honorable Sir Josiah Francis, whose death occurred on Saturday, 22nd February, was elected to the House of Representatives for Moreton, Queensland, in 1922 and and was re-elected twelve times until he retired from the Parliament in 1955. His was, it will be seen, a remarkably long period of parliamentary service, extending over 33 years and covering not only periods in office, as I will point out, but also periods in opposition. I am not sure that I did not sometimes feel that it was in opposition that we got the fullest benefit of his remarkable personal characteristics. Anyhow, he had an all-round experience.He was a member of the Select Committee on the Navigation Act in 1923 and a member of the Royal Commission on National Insurance from 1923 to 1927. He was a member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works in 1929 and was chairman of that committee from 1937 to 1940. He was also a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in 1929 and 1931. As honorable members will see, all those appointments gave him a remarkably full experience of the matters that concern the private member and give him an opportunity to have a voice in administration.He was a Temporary Chairman of Committees from 1930 to 1931. He was Assistant Minister for Defence and Minister in charge of War Service Homes from 1932 to 1934. He assisted the Minister for Repatriation in 1934. He became Acting Minister for Repatriation in 1933. He was a member of the National Planning Committee of Canberra from 1937 to 1940 and a member of the Joint Committee on Repatriation from 1942 to 1943. He was chairman of the Rural Industries Committee from 3rd July, 1941, to 7th July, 1943, and vice-chairman of the Standing Committee on Broadcasting from 14th October, 1943, to 16th August, 1946. He was a member of a parliamentary delegation to Japan in July and August, 1948.He became Minister for the Army in December, 1949. He held that office until he retired from the Parliament in 1955. He was Minister for the Navy from December, 1949, to May, 1951, and was Acting Minister for the Navy during the absence overseas of the honorable Philip McBride - as he then was - in June and July, 1951, and from July, 1954, to November, 1955. He paid a visit to Australian Army units in Korea in December, 1951, and January, 1952. Upon his retirement from this Parliament in 1955, Jos. Francis - as we all knew him so well - became Consul-General for Australia in New York, with the personal rank of Minister, on 1st March, 1956. He spent there a number of years, giving quite remarkable service to this country. He had a notable military career. He joined the voluntary forces in 1913 and went abroad in October, 1916, with the J 5th battalion of the Australian Imperial Forces. He was commissioned in 1917 and was wounded in 1918. He became a captain in 1918 and, as most of us know, for the rest of his life he was very active indeed in the affairs of returned servicemen.That is a summary of a life of remarkable usefulness which spread over a very long period of time. It is the story of a man whom some now in this House may not recall, but who was well known in his day - and very affectionately known, I think - to everybody who then sat in Parliament. He was always willing, always ready to turn a hand. He was a magnificent team player in the political sense and he had, of course, a wealth of experience, as I have already shown, such as falls to the lot of very few men. I have always thought that when he went out of politics it was a singularly good thing that he went to New York and represented us there as Consul-General. He and his wife did a wonderful job. Very few people fully realize what is involved in such a job in the great city of New York, in upholding the banner of Australia, dealing with people who come through, and representing Australia in a friendly, practical, human fashion. He did the job, and his wife did it with him. I had nothing but admiration for what they did in that great city during the period in which he held office.Since he came back to Australia his health, notoriously, has not been very good. He had, so far as I was able to judge, two or three rather poor turns of health. In a sense, perhaps, it was not such a surprise when he died, but I am perfectly certain that there will be people, in this Parliament, and thousands of people in Queensland and thousands of ex-servicemen and their dependants throughout Australia, who would have learned of his death as they would learn of the death of a good man and a good friend. I think it is proper that we should honour, in our usual way, his memory and his remarkable service to Australia and, therefore, I move -That this House expresses its deep regret at the death of the Honorable Sir Josiah Francis, a former member of this House for the Division of Moreton, and a former Minister of the Crown, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow in her bereavement.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HONORABLE SIR JOSIAH FRANCIS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Francis family is well known in Queensland. It has rendered good service, not only in politics but in other fields as well.We all have different characteristics. As the Prime Minister (Sir Robert Menzies) has said, Jos. Francis had his own personality and expressed himself and put his point of view in his own inimitable way. From the time I first knew him when I came to this Parliament in 1940 until he left it in 1958 I and my colleagues regarded him as a very good man and a very effective parliamentarian.He left this Parliament, after 33 years service, with universal goodwill. It was hard to have an argument with the late Sir Josiah Francis. You could not feel that any statement he made was intended to be personal. He put his point of view a little ruggedly at times but he always had in mind his duty to Australia and particularly to his own State of Queensland. He held the seat of Moreton by majorities which other men would never have been able to obtain. He even held the seat before the enlargement of this Parliament in 1949 despite the fact that it was always regarded as a Labour seat and that in the State sphere the area was held by members of the Australian Labour Party with large majorities.There was a kindliness about Jos. Francis which was displayed until the time of his death. He was interested in public movements and in the betterment of humanity. He liked to present cups to the schools in the electorate that he represented and to donate prizes of various kinds. Even when he died so unexpectedly he was attending a regatta conducted by certain schools in Brisbane. He never lost his interest in public affairs and after his return to Australia from overseas he immediately took up the various interests that he had laid aside while serving in New York.Whenever Jos. Francis came to Canberra he renewed acquaintance with honorable members from both sides of the Parliament and every one was always happy to see him. On Saturday last I heard of his death with real regret. I used to see him periodically in Melbourne and in Canberra and I was hoping to see him again very soon somewhere around Australia. That opportunity is denied me as it is denied so many others, but he leaves a fragrant memory and his work will not be soon forgotten, in Queensland or in this Parliament.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HONORABLE SIR JOSIAH FRANCIS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I am one of the members who served a long time in this Parliament with the late Jos. Francis - as we all knew him - and came to respect him greatly. He was a man who bad standards and ideals of service and who at all times adhered to those standards. He passes from amongst us as a man who served his country well in the Parliament and in the test of war. As another speaker has said, at no time did he forget that he was a Queenslander and he stood well- for his own State.Jos. Francis served with the first Australian Imperial Force for about four years and was wounded in France. After his return he never for a moment lost his interest in attending to the well-being of ex-servicemen or in concerning himself with the efficiency and standards of the armed forces. As Minister administering repatriation and war service homes, and as Minister for the Army he had an opportunity, both by policy-making and administration, to exhibit his deep interest in these two fields. But while he had these special interests, all of us who served with him know that he was a jolly good all-rounder in the parliamentary scene. He took an interest in everything. He had knowledge of every point. He expressed himself vigorously - very vigorously - but no rancour ever remained. In this sense he was a very good Australian and whatever he bad to do was done with devotion, industry and effectiveness.Jos. Francis had a great and obvious quality of loyalty to his team. No one ever doubted his adherence to the team. The very fact that he was elected for twelve terms for the Division of Moreton must speak for itself. We know that he contrived to serve this country at a high level and, at the same time, never to lose touch with the individual persons and businesses of his electorate where he was well known and very well liked.A career of service was capped by a very distinguished period as Australian Consul-General in the great City of New York, where he was well liked and where he served Australian interests very well. I am sure that Jos. Francis there contributed a great deal toward bettering the relationship between our country and the United States of America. I join, on behalf of my party, in the expressions of sympathy to Lady Francis and to the relatives of the late Sir Josiah Francis.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HONORABLE SIR JOSIAH FRANCIS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

That is an outstanding record and it is a record with few equals throughout the English-speaking world. As both the Prime Minister (Sir Robert Menzies) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Calwell) have said, the late Sir Josiah Francis was infinitely skilled in political conflict. That, no doubt, may have contributed in no small measure to his surviving for 33 years as a member of the Parliament, but he had something far deeper, 1 suggest, than mere political skill. He had a tremendous reservoir of service and of desire to give service to the people. Even though the 33 years of his Life in this Parliament ran over a period of time intensely troubled and turbulent he never lost his capacity and his desire to serve the people, and even right to the end of his life he was out serving the people. He was running a memorial appeal and was directing it with great skill and with tremendous vigour. He had a cheerfulness and a friendliness about him. Jos. Francis would not have been capable of an unworthy thought or of hurting anybody, because he never knew how to hurt.One of the verses in the Book of Chronicles begins -And Josiah gave to the people . . .Those words attach very rightly to the memory of the man we recall this afternoon. Josiah Francis, member of Parliament for the division of Moreton for 33 years, gave to the people a tremendous sense of service, a unique understanding, a warm and a lively humanity.Question resolved in the affirmative, honorable members standing in their places.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HONORABLE SIR JOSIAH FRANCIS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Two things have been done. First of all, H.M.A.S Quiberon, which was due to be retired - in June, I think - is being kept in service. That is a purely interim measure. In the second place, before any long-range replacement could be organized - in other words, built - we necessarily had to find out whether we could have, over a period of four years, an interim but effective replacement for Voyager. I am happy to tell the House that we received the greatest goodwill on this matter from the governments of both the United Kingdom and the United States of America, each of which exhibited a willingness to help us as much as possible.Our own naval authorities investigated the matter. They had on offer at this time from the Royal Navy in the United Kingdom a Daring class destroyer Duchess which, on investigation by our naval authorities, was shown to be the most compatible with our own requirements and which would produce the minimum of dislocation in our naval arrangements. As it is a Daring class destroyer, honorable members will understand that it rather fits into the picture. The United Kingdom Government offered the destroyer on loan on very handsome terms and after the investigation by the Royal Australian Navy we have decided to accept the offer. We have so informed the United Kingdom Government. In the immediate short run Quiberon will remain on strength and the destroyer Duchess will be available for the next four years. As soon as may be the destroyer will be brought here from Singapore and will be refitted in Australia in the shortest practicable time.","ROYAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY.","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/subdebate.1[2]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

When this missile was superseded an arrangement was made with a number of European countries and the European Launcher Development Organization was formed. It was decided that the Blue Streak rocket would act as the first stage of a vehicle to launch satellites into orbit, basically for peaceful purposes and primarily, I should think, for use in communications. Because of our set-up at Woomera and the availability of launching gantries and so on, Australia was invited to join Eldo. This we did, and although we are now a full member of the European Launcher Development Organization and have access to all the technology available from laboratories of member countries, we pay no membership fee. In addition, of course, we are paid for the work that we do at Woomera on behalf of Eldo. It is quite possible that the first test firings of the Eldo vehicle have already been made.Later there will be full-scale firings of the vehicle, probably in April or May of this year. When these firings are made - and this is, of course, only the first stage, and there will be more to follow - naturally we will take every possible opportunity to bring home to the Australian people what this developing technology means to Australia, because having been invited to be members of Eldo, our membership gives us full access to any commercial developments which may arise out of the Eldo experiments.I think it should be kept in mind that a company has been formed to operate communications systems by satellites, and it may well be that within the next month a definite programme will be worked out by which the worlds first satellite communications system will be put into operation. At the moment we, as a nation, are hovering on the periphery of discussions on these matters, but we may well be invited to enter such discussions and perhaps be given an opportunity to take membership in the company. All in all, this is an enormously important organization. It represents an enormously important opportunity for Australia to join in a world-wide communications system, and the honorable members will realize how important this is in these times, when trade follows communications.","EUROPEAN LAUNCHER DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION.","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/subdebate.1[14]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I preface it by saying that a recent press report stated that dependants of those who were killed in the Voyager will receive payments fixed in accordance with the Commonwealth Employees Compensation Act. It is with this matter that I am particularly concerned at the moment. Does the Minister know that in Queensland the lump sum payment made to the dependant of a worker who is killed during the course of his employment is £3,300 plus £110 for each child under 16, or, if receiving full-time education, up to 21 years of age; that in Western Australia the amount is £3,386 plus £90 for each child under 16; that in Tasmania it is £4,000 plus £100 for each child under 16 or, if receiving full-time education, up to 21 years of age; that in New South Wales the amount of - compensation is £4,300 plus £2 3s. a week for each child under 16, while the Commonwealth legislation will entitle the dependants of those killed in this unfortunate accident involving the Voyager to only £3,000 plus £100 for each child? If he is aware of these facts, what action does he propose to take to ensure that dependants of those killed as a result of the Voyager accident will receive the same amount as they would receive if the provisions of the New South Wales legislation applied to them?","DEPENDANTS OF VOYAGER VICTIMS","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/subdebate.1[15]/question/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I am speaking of the principles, not of the amounts. In other words, the principles which apply in cases of this kind have been consistently applied, to the best of my knowledge. As to the provisions made under workers compensation legislation, It has been the practice of the Commonwealth Government to study the legislation of the States. I think it is quite misleading to select one aspect of a comprehensive workers compensation scheme and measure that against something which has just been plucked out of a piece of State legislation. You have to look at the legislation as a whole. I think it can be fairly claimed that, over the broad field of workers compensation, the Commonwealth provision has not been less generous than the provisions of the States. The Commonwealth must pay regard to the fact that it should be as consistent with the provisions made by the States as is practicable, otherwise injustice is likely to arise for citizens who come under State legislation rather than under Commonwealth legislation. In the light of what the honorable gentleman has put, I shall study the details of the applications likely to be made in respect of this matter.

There had been already a meeting of the Naval Board. It was then that I decided on my own responsibility that we would have an investigation by a royal commission, presided over by a judge, and therefore open to the public and to the full glare ofpublicity. I stated at the time that this was the proper procedure because nothing would satisfy the public mind except the most penetrating and public examination of what had occurred. This was my decision, and it was announced by me. I do not know why the honorable gentleman takes exception by suggesting that a Minister of Cabinet rank should have handled the matter. I suppose that I am still a Minister of Cabinet rank and I handled it myself.The honorable gentleman said that something else happened later on about accommodation. I hope that if in the inscrutable wisdom of providence the honorable gentleman becomes Prime Minister he will not take up the attitude that his Minister for a service department is unfit to handle the problems of that service department. This collision was a calamity that shocked the nation. It was therefore fairly and squarely a matter for me to deal with. But if I thought the Minister for the Navy was incapable of dealing with naval administration - apart from this large matter - then I think 1 would have to remove him from being Minister for the Navy. This is a new doctrine - that service Ministers are not competent, are not to be entrusted with the performance of their duties in the service departments. I do not believe it for a moment. I do not think that holding to such a doctrine is the way to get good Ministers, and I do not think it is the way to get good administration. Now, on this matter, apart from particular grievances that the honorable member may have, the thing that was of burning public importance was handled at the earliest possible moment, the morning after this unhappy event - this terrible event - and was handled, I believe I may say, in a fashion that gave considerable satisfaction to the people of Australia.","LOSS OF H.M.A.S.

There has been no change. So far as its dues are concerned, the Soviet Union has not reduced the level of its arrears below that figure which, under Article 19, will bring into jeopardy its right to vote. I think I ought to say, though, to make that answer complete, that there are perhaps two straws in the wind which, we hope, promise something more substantial. First, the Czechoslovakian Government in January paid enough into the fund to reduce its arrears below the level which would disentitle it to vote; secondly, Chairman Khrushchev, in his New Year letter, spoke of the maintenance of peace in terms which, if he carries them through logically, might conceivably lead to a change of attitude on the part of the Soviet Union in relation to this matter.","UNITED NATIONS.","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/subdebate.1[18]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is a very strongly constituted board, as I think honorable members will agree when they consider its composition. It is under the chairmanship of Mr. Walter Scott. It has the deputy managing director of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation, Mr. Armstrong, as one of its members, together with Sir Kenneth Coles and other leading figures well known to honorable members. The board had available to it the experience of South Africa, where a similar conversion operation had to take place and where compensation arrangements also operated. It is quite a formidable task for the companies directly concerned to carry this work out smoothly on what will be, in total, some 300,000 machines, to put it broadly. I do not think that it would be a practicable proposition for the Government to establish some instrumentality to try to engage the highly skilled labour that would normally be working with the established companies and to employ that labour to do the work for a government organization. I have no doubt that that possibility was considered by the board, which, I believe, has made its recommendations in a manner that will effect the smoothest possible conversion with the utmost economy.A very substantial sum has been mentioned. This cost will be spread, we believe, over three financial years. Set off against it will be great savings due to economy, greater efficiency and other factors once the decimal currency system is in operation. The conversion cost is a price that we shall have to pay for the benefits that we shall gain later. I do not think that there is any way in which we could reasonably economize on this cost. .It represents not so much amounts that will be paid to companies producing. machines, but rather compensation that will be paid to machine owners to meet reasonable costs of conversion incurred by them. I think that there is sufficient competition among companies engaged in converting machines to ensure that the owners for whom the machines are converted are not treated unreasonably.","DECIMAL CURRENCY.","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/subdebate.1[19]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The House will join me in extending to the bereaved families of those who have sustained this sudden and tragic loss, the very deepest sympathy. All Australia mourns with them.

298,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,"CAIRNS, Kevin","JTS","LILLEY, QUEENSLAND","LP","N/A",32,"- We have assembled here as members of the House of Representatives following the general election of 30th November last. I am sure we all appreciate that a democratic election is a most important part of the life of a democratic community because at such a time the people not only look back on the events that have occurred since the previous election but also look forward to what may occur in subsequent years. The people of Australia decided as they did on 30th November for several reasons. Certainly not least among these reasons is the attitude of the Government towards the economic growth of Australia and towards the development of its productive wealth. There is no doubt that our short term objective as well as our long term objective has been the economic development of Australia in the interest of the people who live in this country. That economic development has been pursued with the aim of constantly raising living standards and improving the welfare of the people.The economic development of Australia was pursued in order to make the people as happy as they could be made by government endeavour. It is true that nations in other parts of the world also have wanted economic development but they wanted it for different reasons. Some countries wanted economic development in order to obtain power. Others wanted it for purposes of prestige. Power and prestige may have their importance but they are not sufficient reasons alone for wanting economic development. For a number of years the Government has been criticized in certain quarters over its attitude towards economic development. It has been argued in some quarters that we should not place too much emphasis on the human factors of economic development or on factors concerned with education, population and incentive but that we should place emphasis primarily on such matters as capital investment and capital formation. It was maintained that those were the matters that were most important. The Government has always held the view that human factors are not expendable and that they can never be negotiated away. It is interesting to note that recent studies on the development of some European countries that bear comparison with Australia reveal that in the long term productivity does not increase by more than 2.5 per cent, or 2.6 per cent, per annum. It is interesting also to note that of that increase of 2.5 per cent, human factors are responsible for 1.6 per cent, or 1.7 per cent, and the more material factors of economic development seem to be responsible for about 0.8 per cent. These factors are, of course, interrelated, but the statistics are a justification for what has always been the social attitude of this Government. Not only has the Governments attitude now been justified socially but it seems also to have been justified economically.I take great pride in being able to come into this House as the representative of the electors of Lilley and take part in the decisions of a government which has such an attitude towards the economic development of Australia. It is interesting to note that the development of a number of countries in Europe seems to justify what has always been the attitude of this Government. In recent years the United Kingdom has not developed as quickly as may have been desired, even though there was evidence of no lack of capital formation. It may be argued that in Great Britain there has been a certain lack of appreciation of the importance of human factors and human incentive. It has been suggested that when General de Gaulle made his great decision concerning the United Kingdom and the Common Market he was afraid of a resurgence of the human factors in the development of that country.It is often claimed that the development of France in recent years has been the result of long-term planning, but it is a fair question to ask whether this is so. Most of us remember that during the 1920s and 1930s France suffered a relative decline.It has often been suggested that the economic activity of France suffered from some kind of sclerosis. But when France began to develop more quickly after the Second World War it is interesting to note that the sociologists of that country were the first to detect a new attitude in the nation. In the early years following the Second World War they spoke about a new vigour in French social and economic life. They spoke about a new vigour in the French approach to social matters. In the late 1950s this new social attitude became apparent in what we might call economic growth. So it may be said that the development of countries in Europe has vindicated. Australias attitude towards economic growth. The human factors have never been expendable in this country. They have always been important and they always will be important.What has been this Governments attitude towards the human factors of education, population and incentive? In the weeks preceding 30th November last year it was alleged in some quarters that not enough of our national resources was being devoted to education. I think the cry emanated first from some of our universities. I think possibly university students were the first to make the allegation and soon a number of university staff in Australia joined in the cry that insufficient resources were being devoted to education. In the recent election campaign statistics were quoted to show that at least 2.5 per cent, and as much as 3 per cent, of our national resources was being devoted to education. The statistics that have been quoted refer only to the years up to 1958 and it must be remembered that certain things have happened since 1958. It is fair to ask what amount of our resources has been devoted to education since 1958. Last year something like 3.7 per cent, of our national resources was devoted to education. This year, if we achieve a growth in our national product of 5 per cent., something like 4 per cent, of our national resources will be devoted to education. Those figures relate to public expenditure as well as private expenditure.One may ask: Is this expenditure of 4 per cent, significant? In their campaign in 1963 the university people claimed that we should aim for an expenditure of 4 per cent, of our national resources on education by 1970. It would seem that we have reached the target of 4 per cent, six years earlier. The Government should be given great credit for this achievement. The people who have been responsible for private expenditure in education also should receive great credit for their efforts. It is an honour for me to be allowed to participate in the Governments decisions in relation to education.Dealing with population increase, I think everybody now agrees that the regular increase in population that has been obtained from migration has been a good thing. But has the Government always been praised for its activities in the field of migration? In the early and middle 1950s the Government was criticised for varying from time to time the rate of migrant intake. It was claimed that by varying the rate of migrant intake the number of migrants brought to this country would decline not only in the short term but also in the long term. However, in the face of constant criticism the Government steadfastly pursued its migration policy and now is given credit on all sides for having done during the 1950s things which required a great deal of courage. So our attitude toward economic development has been and continues to be that the human factors are never expendable and can never be negotiated away.We in Queensland have been most interested in the development of our State because of our concern with human welfare and living conditions. I think many of us appreciate that the development of Queensland presents special problems. I can perhaps best illustrate my argument by referring to two reports that were made concerning the development of two States. One report was the Stanford report some years ago on investment opportunities in Victoria. That report endeavoured to outline which industries in Victoria were worth investing in and which would return a reasonable profit under reasonable managerial skill and without requiring special protections of various types. That report mentioned about 30 industries which were worth considering. Subsequently a report on the development of Queensland was prepared by an economists intelligence unit. That report dealt with the same type of questions as the Victorian report, but mentioned only four or five industries - half a dozen at the most.The point I make is that there is a difference between Queensland and other parts of Australia and it is apparent that Queensland has certain difficulties. We in Queensland are very grateful that the Commonwealth Government has appreciated our special problems. We are appreciative of the fact that the Government has taken notice of Queenslands special conditions, as witness the grants for brigalow lands development, loans for the rehabilitation of the Mount Isa railway, special grants to promote employment and, last but not least, the attention and consideration that this Government has given to Queenslands annual loan allocation, which unfortunately was allowed to slip during the reign of previous Queensland governments.In the field of employment Queensland has had some special problems. This can be illustrated best by going back to the immediate post-war years when this country adopted a policy of full employment. There was a lot of talk that conditions of full employment would be promoted and there would be a great increase in employment in manufacturing industries. Honorable members will remember the publications that were issued on this matter. Those publications made their point constantly and with vigour. However, our experience has been that the increases in employment opportunities have occurred mainly in tertiary industries or service industries. That is fair enough.The question which any Queenslander asks, having regard to the dispersal of population in that State, is whether that pattern of growth in tertiary and service employment has occurred in the provincial cities which have been developed throughout the State. It seems that the pattern of expanding employment in Australia is different from that in Queensland provincial cities. I repeat that because of our particular problems we have been grateful for the special attention that has been given to Queensland by the Commonwealth Government through the Australian Loan Council, by means of special grants and through developmental schemes. It is against that background that I, as the member for Lilley, regard it as a great honour to be allowed to participate directly in decisions on these matters. Decisions made in the past have often been courageous ones.In recent years a great number of people have wanted to have long-range, rigid plans for the economic development of Australia. Although those plans have always sounded very good, I believe there may be in them one danger that we should avoid. If those plans stifled the human factors in development, which are obviously so important, they would fall down under their own weight and defeat their purpose in the long run. Under those circumstances, this is a fair question to ask: In a country such as Australia, which has a disproportionately large amount of its resources devoted to international trade, do not long-range, rigid economic plans carry great danger? Overseas prices will not wait upon the plans that we make inside Australia. Flexibility and an approach which takes account of human initiative have to be preserved. Nothing indicates that more clearly than the plans for the development of the sugar industry in Queensland and Western Australia. Those plans follow very clearly from an awareness of the importance of human incentive and human interest in economic development. I believe that plans for economic development must be made to fit the people who are to develop this country. Many people have said that we should make plans and let the people fit into them. I say that we should suggest a plan and allow the people to work that plan out in their own way.","May It Please Your Excellency -","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH.

300,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MAISEY, Donald","KLJ","Moore","N/A","N/A",34,".- Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply. I fully appreciate this honour and I am grateful for the privilege that has been extended to me. I take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the electors of the division of Moore for giving me the opportunity to represent them here. I assure them that I am as conscious of the responsibilities associated with my duties as 1 am of the honour that goes with them.I cannot let this early opportunity pass without paying the highest possible tribute to my predecessor, Hughie Leslie, who represented the electorate of Moore so faithfully for so many years. As all honorable members know, he is a fighter and a worker. He worked faithfully for the electors of Moore for many years. He is a great Western Australian, a great worker for Western Australia and a great fighter for Western Australia. He also proved that he was a great Australian and a great worker and fighter for Australia. Ultimately, the time came when he felt the need to put to one side part of the burden that he was carrying. I am sure that we all wish him the contentment, peace and rest that he has so richly earned in the retirement which I know he is enjoying at this moment.The Speech by His Excellency the Governor-General alluded to many matters of far-reaching importance to the security and welfare of the people of Australia, which are to receive the consideration of this the Twenty-fifth Parliament of the Commonweallth of Australia. I note with pleasure that His Excellency referred to the cancellation of the visit by Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, as a deferment only and that there is hope that in the not too distant future we again will have the honour of her gracious company.His Excellency devoted considerable attention to matters related to the security and defence of Australia both in the field of foreign relations and in the field of defence requirements. It is heartening to note that the Government will maintain and extend its efforts to improve Australias relations with all countries, particularly our northern neighbours, and that there is to be a substantial increase in measures to strengthen the defence forces. On this occasion I should like to speak on the long term aspect of defence rather than the immediate question of armed strength and international relationships. I refer to the need to maintain the development of Australia, the level of immigration and the growth of population. If the present trend of development along those lines is to continue - and I see no reason to foresee any change - obviously the spearhead of attack on this problem will continue to be the expansion of primary industries, with their proven ability to earn overseas funds, as well as the development of secondary industries to service the ever-expanding needs of development in the primary sector.To enable primary industry to continue to sell its products in ever-increasing quantities at prices the overseas customer is prepared to pay, care must be taken to ensure that Australian production costs are held at least at present levels and to hold in check inflationary trends in the economy. In this regard it is re-assuring to the primary industries to note that early action has been taken to contain the availability of credit by temporarily freezing the surplus funds in the hands of the banking system. Too much inflation in the post-war era has resulted from the over-availability of credit to purchase consumer goods rather than the pressure on the economy of real money. The availability of credit for developmental work is, of course, in an entirely different category.Thoughtful people with practical experience of the developmental areas of Australia are becoming increasingly concerned at the inability of rural areas to attract and hold young people. It is pleasing to note that progress is being made with the extension of television services to provincial and country areas. The provision of this medium of entertainment as a means of improving living conditions in the developmental areas can make a most valuable contribution towards solving the problem of maintaining an active work force in these areas. Its provision should not be purely a matter of economic considerations.The major need of the rural areas of Western Australia at present is the completion of the agricultural areas comprehensive water supply scheme. A request for aid in the completion of this scheme has been submitted to the Commonwealth Government by the Western Australian Government. The request is for financial assistance in the nature of a subsidy on a £1 for £1 basis. The estimated capital cost of the work is £10,500,000 and it is proposed to spread that work over seven years. The project is to provide from reliable storages near the coast an assured reticulated water supply to farm lands and towns in an inland area of approximately 3,700,000 acres. The scheme is an extension of the modified comprehensive scheme which was completed in the financial year 1961-62 and which the Commonwealth Government subsidized to a maximum of £5,000,000, again on a £1 for £1 basis.The scheme will provide a pool of employment totalling 114,000 man-weeks.This will comprise every class of employment. It will include earthworks, concrete construction, manufacturing and laying of all classes of pipes, construction of buildings and the erection of the necessary machinery. Assured water supplies are necessary in the area to raise the standard of living and to ensure the retention of the sheep flocks in the dry years.The area to be reticulated by the scheme is in general well served by railway and road systems. Educational and medical requirements are there as are also postal and telephone networks. As a result of a successful programme of pasture development - particularly leguminous pastures suited to the drier areas of the State - the carrying capacity of the farms in the area is rising rapidly and limitations on the availability of reliable water supplies are now proving a serious factor in limiting the development of this area. The desirability of encouraging and enhancing the type of farm economy which depends more upon animal husbandry than on cereal production as at present cannot be over-emphasized. The economic aspects of cereal production costs when associated with higher stock carrying capacity are quite significant.Under the Commonwealth aid roads legislation which expires on 30th June next, it has been possible to provide some assistance to government bodies for the provision of roads in the developing areas. As these areas are situated well beyond the limit of existing rail facilities and living amenities, an adequate road system is a matter of extreme importance. I believe that the decision of the Government to make £100,000,000 more available to the States under the new scheme will prove of immense value to these developing areas and will encourage those stalwart individuals who are prepared to go out into these districts. They are leaving the comforts and amenities of the cities and bigger provincial towns to take on the hard burden of developing Australia, and this additional grant will enable them at least to be given the benefits of good and adequate road systems over which they can reach the nearest points of settlement and cart their returns from the land they are bringing into production to the nearest towns.The policy of stabilization of primary industries mentioned in the Governor-Generals Speech is sound and I believe it should be extended to cover an even wider range of primary production. The present arrangement under which the Commonwealth Government will match £1 for £1 additional funds contributed by wool-growers for wool promotion is a welcome recognition that the maintenance of a satisfactory level of wool prices is not the sole responsibility or solely for the benefit of the wool industry. The provision of adequate funds for the Australian Wool Board should permit the establishment of effective promotional machinery. This machinery should be designed in such a way that it can readily become an effective piece of marketing machinery if and when a majority of the wool-growers decide that the time has come when the Australian wool clip should be marketed in a more organized and businesslike manner.The recent rise in the export price of wheat and the strong demand overseas for this basic foodstuff have confounded all those Dismal Desmonds who predicted a national disaster through over-production. As well as producing an all-time record harvest the industry, through its own and its organizations efficiency, has reduced the price of wheat for internal consumption by ls. Sd. a bushel. It is at present supplying the internal requirements of Australia at ls. a bushel less than export parity. Had those in authority listened to the pessimistic theorists, Australia would have lost the opportunity to earn a vast sum of money and, what is perhaps more important, many thousands of people in other lands would have lost the opportunity to purchase much needed food.Australia has a tremendous potential for food production. If we are to retain the moral right to hold this country we must use every endeavour to ensure that that potential is exploited to the utmost. To suggest that we can hold this island continent if we restrict food production in the face of widespread hunger in other lands, particularly lands to our near north, is to invite a major disaster. The surest and safest way to make this country strong is to develop and populate it. I have much pleasure in seconding the motion.Debate (on motion by Mr. Duthie) adjourned.","May It Please Your Excellency -","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH.
