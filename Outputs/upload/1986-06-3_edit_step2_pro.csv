The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia sheweth that whereas:1. The present Australian national flag is not distinctively and uniquely Australian and is confused with other national flags.2. The people of Australia have never had an opportunity to express their views on an appropriate Australian national flag in a referendum.3. The present Australian national flag does not properly represent Australia as a sovereign, independent nation.4. The present Australian national flag falsely proclaims Australia as a colony, homeland, protectorate, dominion or government department of Great Britain.5. The first condition in the flag competition of 1901 required that the design should show Australias loyalty to the British Empire. The British Empire no longer exists.6. A public opinion poll held in 1984 using the Gallup Method revealed that 52% of Australians surveyed wanted a competition for a new design for the Australian flag.7. There is no inherent link between Australia proclaiming a unique and distinctive flag and the political issue of Australia moving to a republican form of government.8. The adoption of a truly Australian national flag would serve as a focal point for Australias bicentennial celebrations in 1988.Your petitioners therefore pray that your honourable house will:(a) Appoint a Committee of the Parliament with representatives from both Houses and all parties to invite and consider proposals for the design of a new Australian national flag, and(b) Require that Committee to make recommendations on the form of a minimum cost referendum at the time of the next general elections, in which the electors will be given the opportunity to vote for a flag from a selection of at least three designs which will include the present Australian national flag and the winner of the Ausflag-Bulletin-2MMM.FM competition of March 1985.And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled. The petition of certain citizens of Western Australia respectfully showeth:That all legitimate business expenses incurred in earning or producing assessable income should be allowable deductions.That the proposed Capital Gains Tax is an unwarranted burden on the rural sector, which will severely affect its long-term viability.That the delay by the Government in introducing the legislation into Parliament is causing confusion and hindering farmers in the organisation of their affairs.Your petitioners humbly pray that the Government introduces the Capital Gains Tax legislation without delay and that the Australian Democrats join with the Opposition to defeat the proposed legislation.To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully shows that whereas:(1) Identification cards and numbers severely threaten our freedom to live unfettered by excessive bureaucratic surveillance;(2) the Government has been unable to present any realistic justification for the introduction of ID cards and numbers;We humbly pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled should reject any proposal to inflict ID cards and numbers on the freedom loving people of Australia.To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.Being signatures collected at a meeting organised by `Scientists Against Nuclear Arms in conjunction with the Mosman Peace Group on Tuesday 11th February at which Dr Barrie Pittock of C.S.I.R.O. talked on the subject on `Nuclear Winter.On 29 January 1986 the Sydney Morning Herald and The Australian reported that R.A.N. Lt. Commander Lynch (Ret.), who for four years had organised the visits of nuclear powered and/or nuclear armed warships to Western Australia, had warned about the danger to Perth posed by such visits.In the light of this warning, the undersigned residents of harbourside suburbs are concerned at reports in the Mosman Daily and The North Shore Times that nuclear armed and/or nuclear powered naval vessels will visit Sydney harbour in March/April and again in October.We appeal to our elected representatives to protect us from the possibility of a nuclear accident by ensuring that no nuclear armed and/or nuclear powered vessels are allowed to enter Port Jackson.To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:This petition of concerned Australian citizens asks that:1. The Australian government exert pressure on Moscow to-a. Allow the International Atomic Energy Commission full expert investigation of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster and its human consequences;b. Allow Australian Ukrainians to send medical aid to family and friends in Soviet Ukraine; and,c. Allow free communication between Australian and Soviet Ukrainians.2. The Australian Government-a. Launch a public appeal to help the Chernobyl victims;b. Support the removal of Russian nuclear weapons out of Ukraine;c. Support the decolonization of the USSR so that captive nations like Ukraine and the Baltic states are not exploited for Soviet Russian nuclear purposes.And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia showeth:That many Australian wage and salary earners and self-employed persons do not enjoy secure retirement incomes provided by superannuation; andThat the Government issued in December 1985 guidelines for the implementation of the proposed productivity decision by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and draft operational standards for superannuation schemes.Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government:1. Guarantees to every employee the right and freedom to select the superannuation scheme of his/her choice.2. Protects the individual exercising that freedom of choice from any coercion, influence or other pressure which may be applied by any employer, association or trade union.3. Will recognise only those schemes which provide genuine superannuation and reject those schemes which do not provide for-preservation of benefits to retirement,vesting of employer contributions,equal employer and employee trusteeship control to ensure security of investments.And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/petition.grp/proctext/interject/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

10,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COONEY","SF4","(Victoria)","ALP","N/A",3213,"—The Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances was concerned about a possible inconsistency between the terms of the Fisheries Act and terms of certain paragraphs of the plan. I wrote to the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Kerin) last Friday and the Committee urgently considered his reply this morning. In order to allay the Committees concerns, the Minister has agreed to add further criteria to the plan in connection with the suspension and the cancellation of certain fishing licences. The Committee also noted that the Minister had received legal advice from the Attorney-Generals Department, which he accepts, supporting the argument that the relevant paragraphs of the plan are valid. The Committees scrutiny of this plan and related fisheries notices has been long and detailed, as I described in the Senate on 29 May 1986. The Committee acknowledges the considerable and very courteous assistance it has received from the Minister for Primary Industry in its scrutiny of the legislation. As is the Committees usual practice, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the Committees correspondence for the information of honourable senators and others.Leave granted.The correspondence read as follows-MINISTER FOR PRIMARY INDUSTRY THE HON. JOHN KERIN, M.P.Parliament House,Canberra, A.C.T. 2600Telephone (062) 73 1711Telex 62308Facsimile (062) 73 2194Senator B. CooneyChairmanSenate Standing Committee onRegulations and OrdinancesThe SenateParliament HouseCanberra, A.C.T. 2600Dear Senator CooneyThank you for your letter of 30 May 1986 concerning Plan of Management No. 3 under the Fisheries Act 1952 (the plan) and Fisheries Notices Nos. 158, 160 and 162. I am pleased to receive your advice that the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances has accepted all but one of the explanations in my letter of 27 May 1986. I also appreciate your opening remarks about that letter in general.In relation to the unresolved issue of the possibility that paragraphs 35.1 and 36.1 of the plan may have the effect of fettering the discretion that section 9a of the Act confers on the Minister to suspend or cancel a licence, I enclose a copy of the advice from the Attorney-Generals Department to which I referred in my letter. This advice indicates that in the opinion of that Department those paragraphs are a valid exercise of my power to make plans of management.Nevertheless, I have noted the general tenor of your letter which addresses the fairness of the two paragraphs. Given the reasons conveyed to you for not making reviewable a decision to suspend a licence and noting that a decision to cancel a licence is reviewable under section 16a of the Act, I have concluded that the interests of fairness will indeed be better served, without weakening the intent of the paragraphs to provide criteria on which to base decisions under section 9a of the Act, if I amend them so that the kinds of previous convictions to be taken account of by the Minister or the Secretary, in the case of a decision to suspend, or the Minister, in the case of a decision to cancel, are expressed more specifically.I therefore propose to insert a new paragraph in the plan that will describe an offence against paragraph 13 (1) (e), (f), (g), (h) or (i) of the Act, or against sub-section 14a (1) when the primary offence is against any of paragraphs 13 (1) (e), (f) or (i), as a ``relevant offence for purposes of Part 10. For purposes of sub-paragraph 36.1 (b) (i) of the plan, an offence against a provision of the Fisheries Regulations requiring the master of a boat to furnish information in relation to his fishing in the fishery will also be a relevant offence. Appropriate consequential amendments of Part 10 will also be made.In relation to your comments on the requisite intention which probably forms an element of many fisheries offences, the relevant intention is to do the act the substance of the offence, and not a criminal intention to damage the prawn fishery. The defendants intention would have been to use a boat to which fewer than the applicable number of Class A units have been assigned or to take prawns in a closed area or during a closed season or with prohibited equipment. In the case of paragraph 36.1, which applies only to a master-fishermans licence, the intention to withhold information or to furnish false information, required to provide me with essential data for managing the fishery, could also have existed.Since commencement of the plan, it has been open to a person who has had a master-fishermans licence cancelled to seek review of the period specified, in accordance with paragraph 36.2, in the notification that I am required to give under sub-section 9a (3a) of the Act. I would have regard to the merits of the case when determining whether that period should be a matter of days, weeks, months or years, up to the maximum specified in relation to the particular case by paragraph 36.2.I think it appropriate, and the representatives of the fishing industry who advise me about management of the fishery strongly support me in this, that a chronic offender against the overall management regime for the fishery should not be permitted to continue to participate in it if the offences have been proved before a court.You will note that the plan does not provide criteria upon which I would make a decision to cancel a boat licence. It is not the intention of the plan, where a person has had a master-fishermans licence cancelled, that the person should also be deprived of the right to hold a boat licence, although paragraph 37 of the plan does provide for suspension or cancellation of units of fishing capacity in relation to the boat involved in the offence. These provisions have been carefully drafted to provide the person with options that are reviewable if exercised by the Secretary.I believe that the proposed amendments of the plan will dispose of the paradox described in your letter. I do not agree that the AAT would have been precluded from considering any matter; they will be able to review any matter other than the fact of one or more previous convictions. The AAT had, and will continue to have under the amended plan, power to review a decision as to a period specified in accordance with paragraph 36.2.It was never the intention of the plan to cause mandatory loss of a right to a livelihood without appropriate review. First, the offence must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Next, because the plan never envisaged the cancellation of a boat licence, the holder of a boat licence who also had his master-fishermans licence cancelled can continue to use the boat for fishing in another fishery under the command of an employed master-fisherman. Third, the plan requires the decision maker to have regard to the merits of the case in relation to the period of refusal of a further master-fishermans licence. Fourth, a decision made by the Secretary rather than a unit holder to cancel units assigned to a boat involved in the commission of an offence or to suspend that assignment, is specifically reviewable. The Secretary would make such a decision only if the unit holder had failed within the time specified to make an election as to which option he preferred.I have approved the amendments of the plan to which I have referred above and expect that they will come into force without delay after they are printed and notified in the Gazette.Yours sincerelyJOHN KERINPARLIAMENT OF AUSTRALIATHE SENATESTANDING COMMITTEE ON REGULATIONS AND ORDINANCES30 May 1986The Hon. John Kerin, M.P.Minister for Primary IndustryParliament HouseCanberra, A.C.T. 2600Dear Minister,At its meeting on 29 May 1986 the Committee considered your letter of 27 May 1986 in connection with the Northern Prawn Fishery Management Plan No. 3 and Fisheries Notices Nos. 158, 160 and 162. The Committee acknowledges the consideration you have shown it in preparing such a detailed response to the Committees letters of 15 April 1986. Indeed the Committee is happy to accept virtually all of the assurances and explanations given in your letter.However, the Committee respectfully seeks your further clarification in relation to one aspect, namely the validity of paragraphs 35.1 and 36.1 of the Plan, which the Committee originally considered may be an unlawful fetter on the discretion conferred on you by section 9a of the Fisheries Act 1952. This particular aspect is dealt with in the last 2 paragraphs on page 2 of your letter. These paragraphs do not completely resolve the Committees uncertainties about the question.The Committee respectfully seeks your reconsideration of the question whether there may not be persuasive legal authority for the view that paragraphs 35.1 and 36.1 of the plan are invalid because they will have the effect of precluding the exercise of the discretion conferred on you and the Secretary by sub-section 9a (1) in connection with suspension of fishing licences, and on you alone by sub-section 9a (3) in connection with the cancellation of fishing licences. If in a particular circumstance you or the Secretary are precluded by the legislative instrument known as the Plan from actually exercising the suspension and cancellation discretions primarily conferred upon you by the Act, then these paragraphs of the Plan may be beyond power and may therefore be invalid. You may have disabled yourself and the Secretary from exercising the statutory discretion which Parliament has conferred on you in individual cases.The Committee would illustrate its concern in this way. Sub-section 9A (3A) of the Fisheries Act gives you a discretion to cancel a fishing licence if the holder has committed an offence under Commonwealth, State, Territory or PNG fishing laws. Cancellation of a licence means that a person and possibly a crew loses a source of livelihood. The Committee has no means of knowing with certainly, but it may be that some of the relevant offences in any of the 4 separate jurisdictions are offences of strict liability in the commission of which there has been no criminal intention to damage the prawn fishery. If there were no Plan, then, in such a case, or in any other case where mitigating circumstances were present, notwithstanding that there were two convictions you could exercise your discretion in favour of the licence holder and not cancel the licence. The Act gives you that discretion which must be exercised fairly in accordance with the purpose and objectives of the Act. General principles of administrative law might require that some measure of natural justice be afforded to the licence holder, for example the making of representations in mitigation, justification or excuse. However, if in the light of all of these matters, including the requirements of your own ministerial policy concerning the management of the fishery, you decided to cancel the licence, the merits of your cancellation decision could be reviewed by the AAT under section 16a of the Fisheries Act. The Tribunal could consider that given the purpose and object of the Act and your fishery management policy, the merits of the case did not, in all the circumstances, justify the individuals loss of livelihood.However, having made paragraph 36.1 of the Plan, which makes it mandatory that the licence of a holder who has two convictions under Commonwealth law only (paragraph 36.1 (b) (i) ) shall be cancelled, you may have disabled yourself from exercising a genuine discretion in a particular case directly involving individual interests. Yet this is the discretion conferred on you by Parliament in sub-section 9a (3a) of the Act in relation to individuals.General principles suggest that you must be prepared to make an exception to your general policy if the circumstances of the case warrant special treatment. The amplitude of the discretionary power to make Plans conferred on you be section 7b may not be so wide in connection with cancellation of licences as expressly dealt with in section 9A that you are expressly or impliedly entitled to adopt a fixed rule never to exercise your discretion in favour of a particular class of person. In the words of Lord Reid``The general rule is that anyone who has to exercise a statutory discretion must not ``shut his ears to an application (to adapt from Banks L. J.) [in R v Port of London Authority, Ex parte Kynoch Ltd [1919]1 K. B. 176 at 183] . . . What the [decision maker] must not do is to refuse to listen at all. (see British Oxygen Co. Ltd v Board of Trade [197] A.C. 610 at 625.)Paradoxically, where the relevant convictions have arisen under State, Territory or PNG law, paragraph 36.1 of the Plan may not apply and you may have retained your section 9a discretion.Nevertheless, where there are convictions under the Act or the Regulations you may have precluded yourself from considering any matter other than the fact of two Commonwealth convictions. In the adoption of such a rule you may have made it impossible to consider the merits of any particular case and the AAT may equally be precluded by the legislative Plan (as it would not be by a non-legislative statement of policy) from considering any question other than the fact of two convictions. If there are mitigating factors, such as strict liability offences or extenuating circumstances, these cannot be taken into account. The mandatory loss, under delegated legislation, of an effectively unreviewable right to a livelihood may be seen to be unfair and contrary to principle. The fact that you may not have actually exercised any discretion in the matter, when Parliament, in section 9a, intended that you should exercise some discretion, may make the cancellation unlawful. The paragraphs of the Plan, purporting to disentitle you from exercising any discretion, may be invalid.The Committee appreciates that complex legal questions are involved in the matter it has raised and that you have already given a detailed response which has satisfied the Committee on all but this outstanding issue. However, Principle (a) of its terms of reference require the Committee to scrutinise delegated legislation to ensure that it is in accordance with the statute and that it does not trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties. The Committee would be very grateful to receive your comments and advice on the issues raised in this letter. It may be that further considered advice from the Attorney-Generals Department can allay all of the Committees uncertainties. However, the Committee, while at one with you on the need to protect fisheries, is nevertheless concerned that the reasonable rights of fishing licence holders to engage in their livelihood should rest on clear and unquestionable legal authority and should not be dependent on uncertain or doubtful propositions.It would be most helpful if you could let the Committee have your further views as a matter of priority. Because the time within which the relevant notice of motion of disallowance must be withdrawn or dealt with is about to expire, it would greatly facilitate the Committee if it could hear from you by Tuesday morning 3 June 1986.Yours sincerelyBARNEY COONEYChairmanMotion (by Senator Cooney)-by leave-agreed to:That Business of the Senate, Notice of Motion No. 1 standing in my name for this day for the disallowance of the Northern Prawn Fishery Management Plan No. 3, be postponed till the next day of sitting.","N/A","NORTHERN PRAWN FISHERY MANAGEMENT PLAN","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/debate.sub1/speech/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

12,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COONEY","SF4","(Victoria)","ALP","N/A",3215,"—The Extradition (Finland) Regulations (Amendment) had the effect of removing from the legislation the requirement that, before extradition could be granted, evidence of criminality accompanying a request for extradition should be sufficient to justify the trial of the person under Australian law. The Committee was concerned about the removal of this protection. The Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) has explained that the deletion was made to give effect to last years changes in the Extradition (Foreign States) Act which was designed to facilitate extradition to civil law jurisdictions which do not have pre-trial evidence procedures. For extradition from such countries, what is required is information as to the allegations against the fugitive. The Extradition Act itself no longer requires that prima facie evidence of criminality be provided and the regulations have followed that approach. In the regulations the Attorney-General is following the policy foreshadowed in the amendments to the Act and the Committee has accepted his indication that persons subject to extradition requests will not be unduly prejudiced by the change because of the presence of a range of other protections in the regulations.The Rates (Amendment) Ordinance 1986 changes the way in which rates are assessed when improvement work is done to land by private developers rather than the Commonwealth. The intention is to have all improved land assessed on a similar basis. The Committee was concerned to discover what effect the Ordinance would have on applications currently before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal concerning rates assessment on a basis more advantageous to occupiers of privately developed land. The Minister has assured the Committee that the amendments do not operate retrospectively and that pending applications for review will be dealt with in accordance with the law as it was before the amendment was made. As is the Committees usual practice, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard copies of the Committees correspondence on extradition matters for the information of honourable senators.Leave granted.The documents read as follows-PARLIAMENT OF AUSTRALIATHE SENATESTANDING COMMITTEE ON REGULATIONS AND ORDINANCES15 April 1986The Hon. Lionel Bowen, M.P.Attorney-GeneralParliament HouseCanberra, A.C.T. 2600Dear Attorney-General,At its meeting on 10 April 1986, the Committee considered the Extradition (Finland) Regulations (Statutory Rules 1986 No. 32) tabled in the Senate on 9 April 1986. These Regulations amend the Principal Regulations to take into account a Protocol to the Extradition Treaty between Australia and Finland done at Helsinki on 10 September 1985. The Principal Regulations now provide that the Extradition (Foreign States) Act 1966 applies in relation to Finland subject to the Treaty as amended by the Protocol.The Protocol appears to make an important change to the Treaty. Previously sub-paragraph 1 (f) of Article 5 provided that extradition could be refused where ``the evidence of criminality could not have justified the trial of the person sought under Australian law. Under the Protocol, inadequacy of ``evidence of criminality is no longer a matter to be taken into account in the exercise of the discretion to extradite.The discretions described in Article 5 of the Treaty are protective discretions. The deletion of the paragraph limits the range of reasonable protections which, until the gazettal of these Regulations, have been available to protect the rights of a person sought. The Explanatory Statement accompanying the Regulations is rather brief and does not refer to the deletion of the paragraph. In its letter to you of 15 May 1985 concerning Extradition (Republic of South Africa) Regulations, the Committee previously commented on the inadequacy of Explanatory Statements accompanying extradition regulations.The Committee would be grateful if you could explain the reasons and justifications for the deletion of the paragraph and indicate what consequence it will have for Australian extradition laws generally and the rights of persons whose surrender is sought in particular.From the point of view of the Committees Principles ``persons whose surrender is sought may include innocent persons who may be migrants, refugees, exiles or political dissidents whose rights should not be eroded by delegated legislation without adequate justification made public in an Explanatory Statement.Yours sincerelyBARNEY COONEYChairmanDeputy Prime MinisterAttorney-GeneralParliament HouseCanberra, A.C.T. 260019 May 1986Dear Barney,I refer to your letter dated 15 April 1986 in which you expressed concern about the Protocol to the Extradition Treaty between Australia and Finland done at Helsinki, on 10 September 1985 and about the Extradition (Finland) Regulations (Statutory Rules 1986 No. 32-`the amending regulations). The amending Regulations give effect to the Protocol, by amending the Extradition (Finland) Regulations (Statutory Rules 1985 No. 163) to provide that the Extradition (Foreign States) Act 1966 (`the Act) applies in relation to Finland subject to the Treaty, as amended by the Protocol.You noted that the Protocol appears to make an important change to the Treaty in that the discretionary ground for refusal of extradition previously found in sub-paragraph 1 (f) of Article 5 of the Treaty has been removed. That sub-paragraph provided, in effect, that extradition could be refused if the evidence of criminality accompanying the request for extradition would not be sufficient to justify the trial of the person under Australian law.This is indeed an important change to the Treaty and I can well appreciate that the Committee is concerned that it might be seen to limit the range of protections for the rights of persons sought. I must say, however, that this change was carefully considered in 1985 and has not been made for a specific or ulterior purpose of limiting the rights of individuals.The change was made in order to give effect to the amendments to the Act that were made by the Extradition (Foreign States) Amendment Act 1985. In my Second Reading speech on the Bill for that Act I said (Hansard of 20 March 1985 at page 596) in reference to amendments proposed to section 17 of the Act that this amendment ``will enable Australia to conclude extradition arrangements with countries which do not require the requesting country to furnish evidence of guilt but rather information as to the allegations against the fugitive. I went on to say, ``This amendment is of particular significance to civil law countries whose systems have difficulty in adapting to the provision of pre-trial evidence. The extradition arrangements of most European countries which are reflected in the European Convention on Extradition do not require the production of prima facie evidence. In other words, therefore, the deletion of sub-paragraph 1 (f) of Article 5 of the Treaty by the amending Protocol is purely consequential upon the fact that the Act no longer requires that prima facie evidence of criminality be provided.In order to put the matter you have raised concerning the amending regulations fully into context, I think that I should also inform you of other new extradition Treaties or Protocols to existing treaties which adopt a similar approach to that taken in the Protocol with Finland, that is, an approach which does not require prima facie evidence to support an extradition request.Following the amendment that I have mentioned above and other amendments of the Act, the Extradition Task Force that I established in February 1985 urgently to conclude extradition arrangements with appropriate countries has negotiated new treaties with Belgium, The Netherlands, Norway, Ireland and Italy and Protocols amending existing treaties with Austria and Sweden, as well as with Finland. These new treaties and protocols employ this approach, as do the texts of treaties that have been negotiated with Switzerland, Portugal, Luxembourg and Monaco. Negotiations for new treaties, once again using this new approach, are also at an advanced stage with France, Spain and the Federal Republic of Germany.In fact, I would hope that by the end of this year Australia will have modern extradition treaties or arrangements with all the non-communist European countries and that significant progress will have been made for new treaties with the United States and a number of North African, Asian and South American countries. The new treaties will, wherever possible, adopt the approach that prima facie evidence is not required. I must stress, however, that these treaties and protocols either reflect or will reflect the scheme of the Act and provide the internationally accepted grounds for the refusal of extradition. Those grounds serve to protect the rights of all persons whose extradition may be sought.I should also mention that the new approach in relation to extradition treaties is not confined to civil law countries. Later this year I hope to persuade countries which are members of the British Commonwealth that the requirement that prima facie evidence be provided for extradition between Commonwealth countries should be deleted. I intend to try to do this at the meeting of Commonwealth Law Ministers which is to be held in Zimbabwe at the end of July and I am fortified in my resolve to propose this change by the publication recently of a White Paper by the British Government for Plans for Legislation in relation to Criminal Justice. In that White Paper, a copy of which is attached, the Home Secretary announced that the British Government intends to discard the prima facie case requirement for the purpose of extraditions between Britain and non-Commonwealth countries.It is worthwhile that I note in passing one particular passage from the White Paper, because it accords with my own thinking and is most relevant to the Committees concern about the amending Regulations. The White Paper states at para 50:``. . . the Government believes that the prima facie requirement should be abolished. The requirement does not offer a necessary safeguard for the person sought by the requesting state; if does, however, present a formidable impediment to entirely proper and legitimate extradition requests. There are other effective ways in which the rights of the fugitive are protected-for example; by the double criminality rule and by the proper application of the political safeguard.I have noted your concern about the brevity of the Explanatory Statement accompanying the amending Regulations. In view of the fact that my Second Reading Speech, to which I have referred above, foreshadowed that there would be changes to the prima facie case requirement in future extradition treaties, perhaps the Committee will see the brevity of the Statement as being a matter of less concern than the Committee had originally thought. Be that as it may, however, I have directed my Department to ensure that Explanatory Statements contain more detail in future and, in particular, that the Statements in relation to the new Treaties that I have mentioned above do likewise.Yours sincerelyLIONEL BOWENSenator Barney CooneyChairmanSenate Standing Committee on Regulationsand OrdinancesParliament HouseCanberra, A.C.T.PARLIAMENT OF AUSTRALIATHE SENATESTANDING COMMITTEE ON REGULATIONS AND ORDINANCES2 June 1986Your ref: M86-5323The Hon. Lionel Bowen, M.P.Attorney-GeneralParliament HouseCanberra, A.C.T. 2600Dear Attorney-General,At its meeting on 29 May 1986, the Committee considered your letter of 19 May 1986 concerning the Extradition (Finland) Regulations (Amendment) (Statutory Rules 1986 No. 32). The Committee also considered aspects of the British Home Office Paper ``Criminal Justice, Plans for Legislation, March 1986 (Cmnd. 9658, in particular, Part IV, Extradition) which you were good enough also to send to the Committee. The Committee has obtained the Green Paper referred to therein, on which Part IV of the Report was based.As is evident from your letter, you appreciate that this Committee would naturally be concerned about the apparent loss from extradition law, of a seemingly protective requirement for extradition. While the Committee could not regard the Finnish legal system or its law enforcement officials in the same manner as it might regard those in South Africa with which it originated its continuing interest in extradition regulations, the Committee is nevertheless, on principle, concerned at any prospect that the rights of any persons whose extradition is sought should be diminished without clear and persuasive explanations.The Committee thanks you for your very detailed and considered reply which indicates that the change reflected in the Regulations is a flow on from amendments made last year to section 17 of the Extradition (Foreign States) Act 1966 which repealed the former requirement in paragraph 17 (6) (b) for the production to a Magistrate of such evidence as would, in the opinion of the Magistrate, according to the law of his or her jurisdiction, justify the trial, in that jurisdiction, of the person for the alleged extradition crime.Without such authority from Parliament itself, the Committee might not have accepted the removal of the evidence of criminality provision in the absence of compelling examples of how its continued inclusion in Treaties had thwarted proper and effective extradition of persons who otherwise deserved to stand trial in requesting countries. For example, the Committee notes from the British Green Paper ``Extradition (Cmnd. 9421, February 1985) that``Something like a third of applications made to the United Kingdom under our extradition treaties fail, often because of the inability of the requesting state to satisfy the prima facie case requirement. Furthermore, there are occasions on which some states are deterred from making a request at all because they believe that it will be too difficult to meet the requirement. (emphasis added)The Committee also notes the argument, made at paragraph 2.6 of the Green Paper, that``If we are sufficiently satisfied with the standards of justice in a foreign state to enter into a treaty obligation, we should not require that country to meet procedural requirements here which differ markedly from their own. It should, in principle, be for the requesting state to judge the sufficiency of the evidence for a trial of the fugitive.The Committee acknowledges, of course, that generally, and particularly since its scrutiny of the South African Regulations, you have manifested your commitment to ensure that effective extradition procedures operate in tandem with effective protection of the rights of prima facie innocent persons.The Committee notes your comments about Explanatory Statements and welcomes your decision to ensure that these are somewhat more detailed in future. These statements are of considerable assistance to the Committee and others in comprehending the background to an instrument of delegated legislation and in understanding a Ministers intentions as to its particular effects.Yours sincerelyBARNEY COONEYChairman","N/A","EXTRADITION (FINLAND) REGULATIONS (AMENDMENT) AND RATES (AMENDMENT) ORDINANCE 1986","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/debate.sub1/speech/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

I refer the Minister again to the Prime Ministers comments at Canowindra in which he said that he would investigate the impact of the fringe benefits tax on farmers providing accommodation for their employees. I refer also to Mr Hawkes answer at Question Time in the House of Representatives yesterday in which he said that he was seeking information and kept open the possibility of change to the fringe benefits tax.

I said I would and later last night the Prime Minister supplied me with a copy of the letter. I think the best thing I can do is to read it now. I am sure Senator Chipp will not mind. The letter is addressed to Senator Chipp and says:At Canowindra on 31 May 1986 I received representations suggesting that the draft Fringe Benefits Tax legislation as it applies to rental accommodation--the Prime Minister only ever talked about the rental accommodation aspect of the fringe benefits tax--for farm employees would impact heavily on rural producers. In response to these claims I undertook to secure an assessment of the likely impact of this aspect of the tax.Advice received today confirms that account has been taken in the draft legislation of important concerns of rural producers. The review now underway is considering whether there is any valid basis for further flexibility in the manner in which the proposed tax is to be administered.There is no question of the Government moving to defer adoption of the draft legislation now before the Senate.The letter is signed by the Prime Minister.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[1]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In that article the acting Federal Secretary of the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association was quoted as asserting that Australian workers living standards at the end of 1986 would be lower than they had been under the Fraser Government.

22,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator WALSH","TJ4","WA","ALP","N/A",3219,"—I have examined the article and its findings are not accurate. The study paints an excessively gloomy picture of the living standards of Australians during the period since the present Government took office. It also contains a number of conceptual errors. I am surprised that the ACOA, which commissioned the study, has been quoting its results so uncritically, although perhaps one should not be surprised. The professors projections for developments during 1986 assume that the Commonwealth Government will cut real spending by 10 per cent in the areas he defines as being part of the social wage-that is, housing, health, culture, recreation and roads. He has drawn up those definitions, not me. I do not know where he got the idea of a 10 per cent real spending cut from. He takes account of the fact that wage and salary earners will see their next indexation pay rise discounted by two percentage points, but does not take account of the fact that pensioners and other welfare beneficiaries will not have their payments so discounted.When it comes to comparing living standards today with the standards applying under the previous Government, he adopts a very peculiar treatment of Medicare. He takes the levy off disposable household income because it is a tax, but in assessing health costs and, therefore, living costs directly, he uses the consumer price index figure which disregards Medicare. In other words, he uses an inflated CPI figure-the one that would have applied had Medicare not been introduced-but subtracts the Medicare levy from disposable income. I would have thought that that was a very serious conceptual error for an academic to have made. I am surprised that ACOA was satisfied with that and disappointed that the officials of that union, which has many members in senior positions in the Commonwealth bureaucracy who would be completely familiar with these things, did not seek sound advice from their members, instead of unsound advice from some academic scribbler. He also tracks the incomes of households in receipt of average weekly earnings and the incomes of households in receipt of unemployment benefit but ignores the fact that more Australians are in work under the present Government than was the case under the previous Government.Living standards for Australian workers generally will fall during 1986. The fact is that the terms of trade movements over the last 12 months have wiped about 3 per cent from national income. There are only two possible responses to that situation-either living standards on average must fall or the gap must be bridged with increased borrowings from abroad. While I am on this point, it is absolutely unfair that the entire burden should fall on wage earners. Groups in the community other than social welfare beneficiaries ought to be prepared to do their bit as well. I find it quite obscene that there is such trenchant resistance from other more fortunate groups to doing their bit and pulling their weight. In conclusion, the study does paint an excessively gloomy picture. It contains a number of errors. I am disappointed that the ACOA did not look more closely at the figures before going public with them.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[2]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I refer him to the claim by the Western Australian Premier, Mr Burke, that State governments should be compensated by the Commonwealth for the cost of the fringe benefits tax on their Public Services, which Mr Burke estimated in the case of Western Australia will be between $6m and $8m a year.

As to the accuracy of the figures, I am in no position at this stage either to confirm or to deny them. But I should express the scepticism that I have generally about people who present figures and who are claiming that they have been done in the eye by the Commonwealth Government. History certainly has verified that scepticism. I would be surprised if that changes in the future. I also note, of course, that Mr Burke did acknowledge that it would be quite wrong to exempt State government employees from the provisions of the fringe benefits tax-as it would be quite wrong, of course to disregard it in the case of Commonwealth employees. In particular, I would be surprised if the claims that Mr Burke is making about the alleged effects on remote areas are correct. As to the question of compensation, the overall financial arrangements between the States and the Commonwealth will be settled in the context of the Premiers Conference, as is normally the case.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[3]/answer[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

That is a precedent which I would commend to other honourable senators in their committee work because it makes life easier for governments. As to the substance of the question, the Attorney-Generals Department has been asked by the Prime Minister to assume the primary carriage of the Governments response to the Committees report. In this regard it should be noted that the Attorney-General does not administer the legislation that was the subject of the report-namely, the Defence Act and the National Service Act. The Attorney-Generals Department has become involved in this issue largely as a result of Senator Tates own initiative, from which I take it-I cannot be sure about this-that he does not now resile. In its task the Attorney-Generals Department will, of course, have to get significant input from other departments, such as the Department of Defence, as provisions of the Defence Act are in issue, and the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations, as the National Service Act is administered by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations.There are also a number of wider issues relating to conscription and conscientious objection that have been signalled in a letter from the Minister for Defence, and I am advised by the Attorney-General that departments have all these matters under discussion. While I am not able at this stage to respond in a manner that I would expect to satisfy Senator Tate, I am informed that there are good prospects that a response will be given after the winter recess.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[4]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Is he aware of the enormous number of recipients of German restitution payments who still have not received their full entitlements under the changes made by the Government in November last year? Can the Minister say how many restitution recipients are entitled to have this money excluded from assessment for eligibility for Australian pensions; how many of those people have made application; how many of those who have applied have been processed and are now receiving the higher benefits; and how many have had the full benefit to which they are entitled paid retrospectively from March 1985, as the Government promised? Finally, what explanation can the Government give for the protracted delays in administering this new system?","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[5]/question/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
30,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator GRIMES","9V4","TAS","ALP","N/A",3221,"—As Senator Haines said, we changed the system in 1985 so that German restitution payments were not counted in the means test or the incomes test as a result of an Administrative Appeals Tribunal decision that was made earlier that year. However, there have been difficulties in verifying the nature of payments received by some clients who do not have documents which specify the nature of the payments they receive from Germany. Most clients potentially affected by the changes have held the necessary documents, are now being paid at the higher rate and have received their arrears back to March 1985. I do not think that that indicates sloppiness or whatever else Senator Haines may call the administration of this legislation.For example, in one Sydney office there are 50 cases and in 40 of these the German restitution payments have been entirely disregarded and the arrears paid. In the remaining cases the clients are receiving restitution in respect of loss of income. In Melbourne three offices are most affected by the changes. I have only approximate figures but I will get the exact figures later. Some 400 cases have been identified in these three offices as perhaps benefiting from the change. Of these, all but 50 have been finalised and in only a handful of cases are the German restitution payments still being taken into account because they represent restitution for loss of income. The difficulties are partly due to confusion amongst some people-not only among pension-receiving people of German origin, I might add-because of the distinction which is being made between the restitution for loss of income and restitution for other reasons, such as loss of property. In addition, there have been some cases where the Department has been approached by people who are receiving normal German social security pensions which, of course, are still treated as income.Steps have been taken to seek assistance from the German authorities in order to overcome the difficulties for those people who are unable to provide the Department of Social Security with relevant documents, and the Department will continue in its efforts to assist those people to obtain the relevant documents, or will even obtain those documents on their behalf. No recipient of German restitution payments has experienced a decrease in income in consequence of the revised treatment. The issue is whether such recipients may be eligible for an increase in the amount paid to them by the Department of Social Security and a consequent increase in their total income. That is the issue which is being pursued by the Department and about which the Department is conducting inquiries with the German Government. That issue is not assisted by silly statements from politicians and others who claim that the Department is no administering the changes properly and is encouraging people in receipt of normal German social security payments which are not affected by the changes that were made to come to the Department of Social Security in the expectation that they will received increased pensions.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[5]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Government acknowledged the importance of taking steps to resolve that issue and prepared legislation to resolve the matter in what it believed to be a satisfactory manner, to find that the majority view, as expressed by the Opposition and the Australian Democrats, meant that the legislation would not be supported. So the residents of the Australian Capital Territory are being denied their democratic rights to a self-government body because of the attitude of the principal parties of the Opposition in this place.

In every mainland State the electoral system used involves single-member electorates. However, the Government is prepared to provide for an electoral system under which there are 10 single-member electorates in Canberra and nine members for the whole Territory elected by proportional representation. This amends the Governments initial proposal for 13 single-member electorates. The case for single-member electorates is overwhelming. It is the system recommended by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Electoral Reform, and it is the system that the previous Liberal Government legislated to introduce into the Northern Territory. As I said, it is the system used in every mainland State. The Oppositions attitude, therefore, should be seen in that light.The Opposition does not want to contest the election on equal terms because, obviously, it fears defeat. It is opposed to this system because it cannot predict the result. It will be a test of the popularity of its Party leader, John Howard, which, obviously, is something that honourable members opposite want to avoid in the current political climate. Unfortunately, the people of the Australian Capital Territory are to be denied a democratic voice in their own affairs. The Opposition parties have not been prepared to meet the Government on its compromise proposals. Unless the Opposition parties indicate that they are prepared to support the Governments amendments, the Minister advises me that there is no point in wasting the time of the Senate in debating the Australian Capital Territory Council Bills. It is the Opposition senators who will leave the Australian Capital Territory as the only significant Western community without a form of local administration answerable directly to the people.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[6]/answer/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

39,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator GRIMES","9V4","TAS","ALP","N/A",3227,"—Yes, I noticed the article in the Daily Sun. Senator Black drew my attention to it. I noticed also in the article that Dr John Saunders from the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital drug and alcohol unit described Professor Rosser, the doctor concerned, as a museum piece if he believed that the tranquillisers that he talked about were not addictive. The pamphlet on tranquillisers of the national campaign against drug abuse does not say that there has been an alarming increase in the use of tranquillisers. In fact, it points out that tranquillisers, because of their greater safety, are increasingly being prescribed in place of barbiturates, which is a very desirable development. The national campaign against drug abuse has adopted a balanced approach to all drugs. The material-certainly the material that I have read-is not alarmist, nor does it make value judgments; it makes what I believe are sensitive statements as to indicated usage and the risks involved.All jurisdictions in Australia have sought actions on these and on other drugs. In the case of the tranquillisers it is difficult to obtain accurate figures on the number prescribed. Neither I nor the Minister for Health has any accurate information at the moment on why Dr Rosser is in the country at all or who sponsored his visit. I must say, though, that if it has been sponsored by one of the pharmaceutical companies, particularly by Wyeth, it is reasonable for one to speculate as to the accuracy of his comments and his motives for making them.What we have tried to do in this Parliament, in the Senate, and more recently in this Government is to have a rational and sensible debate on the drug problem in this country. It is not achieved by people on either side making alarmist and stupid statements. I do not believe that the documents that have been put out by the Government and by all the State governments contain alarmist material, nor do I think the situation is advanced by statements of the like made by Professor Rosser who, like many visiting professors, apparently thinks that, because he is not in his own country and not amongst his own peers, he can make statements which will not be questioned and which do not need to be backed by facts. I would not hesitate to suggest that, back in Canada, he would not make such statements. If he does, his tenure of office as a professor will not be a very long one.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[8]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

As I have indicated in answer to questions in recent days, the Government does understand United States concerns about Soviet compliance with particular provisions of the SALT agreements. We have made clear Australias view that the Soviets have a case to answer on specific issues. As I think I said a few days ago in answer to a question, this view has been conveyed directly to the Soviet Government, most recently in a letter from the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, to General Secretary Gorbachev.

45,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator WALSH","TJ4","WA","ALP","N/A",3228,"—The short answer is no; it is not true. Like so many of the scandals the Waste Watch Committee purports to unearth, it is wrong again. I have seen the report in the Sydney Morning Herald and it refers not only to Senator Michael Baumes fearless leadership of the Waste Watch Committee stunt but also to some of his former careers in less than flattering terms.The article notes that the senators Waste Watch Committee tends to be particularly active on Sundays when things are generally a bit quiet and it can get a run in the papers on Monday. Actually I think the real reason the honourable senator wants to get a run is to further his own ambitions to find a place on the Opposition front bench. Indeed, it is more specific than that; he wants to supplant Senator Messner as shadow Minister for Finance. The Waste Watch Committee is the vehicle that he hopes will carry him onto the front bench. He hopes to eclipse Senator Messners less than dazzling performance with the publicity that his Waste Watch Committee stunts generate.It is not my place to give advice to the beleaguered Leader of the Opposition on sensitive matters such as saving his own skin. I reckon he has already got enough lead in his saddle bags without adding Senator Michael Baume to it. In his haste to obtain some personal publicity, Senator Michael Baume did not check back quite far enough on his facts, an error he has made before; indeed, an error he consistently makes. Grants totalling $20,000, the original source of which is the Federal Government, have been given to public servants in the Department of Social Security so that they can stage the in-house play In-Security, which apparently does explore the highs and lows of life in that Department. The funds were allocated through an Australia Council program called Art and Working Life. Rather than simply criticising and trivialising the destination of those funds, if Senator Michael Baume wants to criticise the policy of holding the Australia Council at arms length from government and giving it funds that the Australia Council distributes, he should do so. But that is not the real point that I want to make. The real point is that that particular program was established by the Australia Council in September 1982 and the most innumerate member of the Opposition should know that we were not in government at that time, but the Fraser Government, in which Senator Michael Baume was allegedly an influential back bencher was in office.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[10]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The South East Asian countries concerned returned the lightning-arresters when they discovered the damage.

55,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator WALSH","TJ4","WA","ALP","N/A",3229,"—I am aware of those figures which show the result or the outcome for the month of February which Senator Colston has mentioned. That is not an aberrant figure; indeed, it confirms a trend which has been very clear for many months, that is, that the advertised job vacancies in Queensland are consistently on a trend line below those of the nation as a whole, which is of course yet another example of the constant stream of economic indicators coming out of Queensland demonstrating the rapid deterioration of that States economy under a government in its declining years.The actual decline of 0.6 per cent in the job advertisement figures against a national average of a 5.9 per cent increase is another fairly dramatic indictment of Queenslands economic performance. I guess the Premiers attitude to that would be the same as his attitude to the comments of his prominent National Party colleague, Sir Roderick Proctor. However, clearly, with annual net migration in the last year in excess of 5,000 in the prime working age group of 20 to 34 years-the key job seeker age group-there are many people who are worried about the lack of job prospects in Queensland.The refrain of the Queensland Government used to be that Queensland has a high unemployment rate because it is such a lovely place to live, that people are drifting up from the south to lie around or to work in the sun. More frequently, according to the Queensland Government, dole bludgers from the south were coming up to lie in the Queensland sun. That argument was never credible. It is now demonstrably statistically disprovable.In fact, people in that prime working age group have been leaving Queensland in the last 12 months. There has been a net outward migration of 5,000 people. Those people are voting with their feet. They are leaving Queensland because they know that they have much worse prospects of getting a job in that State than they have in the Labor governed States to the south.Queensland has been the lucky State in a sense for many years. It has attracted easy investment because of its resource endowments. That period has now come to an end. When the Queensland Government is being required by economic circumstances to stand on its own feet and to compare itself from the same base with other States in its economic performance, employment growth and so on, it is found to be severely wanting. I guess that one of the symptoms of any regime that is coming to the end of its period is a sustained and severe decline in its economic performance.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[14]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Obviously in the education area we could give a great deal of assistance to all levels of education should the Papua New Guinea Government decide to allocate Australian aid funds for those purposes.I did have discussions with the Papua New Guinea Prime Minister, the Minister for Education, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and various other Ministers and also representatives of three provincial governments on ways in which education services and advice from Australia could assist in the various educational problems that have been identified. I believe that there will be a number of practical outcomes from these discussions. To begin with, I have made funds available for the Secretary to the Department of Education in Papua New Guinea to visit Australia soon to have discussions with Australian institutions and administrators and to observe the Australian Education Council. I have also made available, at the request of the Government of Papua New Guinea, a publications officer from the Curriculum Development Division of the Commonwealth Schools Commission to assist that country with developing publications suitable for its programs. I think it is important that the Senate should know that there are practical consequences of these visits; in particular, that the education services of Australia are held in high regard by the people of Papua New Guinea.

The following information has been provided by him in answer to Senator Sanderss questions. The issues raised in questions 1 to 3 of Senator Sanderss question fall within the portfolio responsibility of the Minister for Primary Industry. I expect that, when arrangements are finalised, the Minister will make details available so that the public can appreciate the mechanisms for protecting Tasmanian forests, particularly the National Estate areas. Senator Sanders will then be in a position to assess the answers to these questions.In relation to the Hollow Tree Enterprises project in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales, Senator Sanderss question appears to be based on the incorrect premise that if a proponent is designated for the purposes of the administrative procedures under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act, the project will automatically be the subject of an environmental impact statement. As is made clear in the memorandum from the Department of Arts, Heritage and Environment to the Department of Primary Industry, referred to by Senator Sanders, the purpose of suggesting that a proponent be designated was to provide a basis for a decision on the need or otherwise for an environmental impact statement.In fact, the memorandum states that the initial view of the Department is that an environmental impact statement would probably not be necessary, provided certain conditions could be applied to the project. These conditions related to restrictions of exports, waste materials and the application of environmental protection guidelines to the agricultural clearing and management of the companys property at St George in Queensland. The approval of the Minister for Primary Industry for exports covers only sawmill wastes, timber from clearing on the property, which would be subject to compliance with the appropriate environment protection guidelines, and thinnings from New South Wales Government hardwood plantations established for wood production. The honourable senator will appreciate that the decision as to whether a particular proposal is environmentally significant and whether a proponent should be designated is one for the action Minister; in this case the Minister for Primary Industry.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[17]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

63,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator GIETZELT","RG4","NSW","ALP","N/A",3231,"—The question of providing adequate care for veterans is a matter that has been before the Government since it came to office in 1983. The basic strategy, of course, is to keep people out of institutions. The reason for that, of course, is to meet the general aspirations and needs of veterans, as well as to apply cost effectiveness principles to the way in which those objectives are met. Domiciliary nursing costs have risen from $3.8m in 1979 to $17m in 1985-86. As a consequence, the Repatriation Commission has recently reviewed the procedures, with particular reference to New South Wales and Victoria, because there has been some blowout in expenditure and some laxity in the way in which the principles of domiciliary nursing have been applied. The Government is committing itself to providing services to veterans so that they can maintain themselves in their own homes. That is the basic principle involved in the way in which the system operates. Domiciliary nursing costs will increase, but institutional costs will increase faster. So we have a common objective in these areas.I have directed my Department to ensure that the interests of the taxpayers, as well as the interests of the veterans and war widows, are protected so that they are not exploited by profit motivated private nursing organisations. That has taken place in some cases in some States. As a result of the the recent review, from 1 September 1986 the maximum amount of domiciliary nursing which may be prescribed by a local medical officer without prior approval is one hour per day for a maximum of three months. Any nursing in excess of that will require prior approval. In New South Wales and Victoria the Department will exercise greater control over delivery of the service by assessing requests requiring prior approval, so that other than in exceptional circumstances the maximum payment for domiciliary nursing will be restricted to four hours per day. In order to meet that objective local medical officers will be reminded of the long-standing policy of my Department that where a government subsidised domiciliary nursing organisation exists, it should be used in preference to private or agency nurses, as we have less control over the way in which the money is expended if they are used.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[18]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I have noted the calls from the business community to which Senator McIntosh referred-in particular, one which was published in the Sydney Morning Herald yesterday and in the Adelaide Advertiser on the same day. I note that the business group is calling, among other things, for cuts in the funding to State and local government and has a quite extensive list of other specific program areas in which it is calling for cuts. I do not agree with all of the calls that it is making, but I will at least give the business community credit for having more courage and sense of responsibility than has the Opposition, which does two things. It says that expenditure should be cut, but never nominates an area in which that ought to take place. The second thing it does is that it promises $1 1/2 billion worth of additional expenditure in a variety of areas. Last week it promised another $500m-plus to the agricultural sector. So the Opposition, which is forever tediously saying that expenditure must be cut, does not nominate any specific area in which it should be cut. It irresponsibly promises $2 billion in additional expenditure, attempting to buy up the number of noisy pressure groups that it thinks will help to return it to government. Of course it has absolutely no intention of delivering those expenditure promises, should it get back into government.Senator Chaney informed us last week that the rural policy document, which was leaked, has no status; it is only a discussion paper. It lists about eight specific areas which contain promises for an extra $500m in outlays on the agricultural sector. Given that Senator Chaney has informed us of this, I have asked whether the Opposition is not committed to any of those individual promises in its discussion paper. I have asked which of those individual items the Opposition will welsh on or repudiate. Will it repudiate the commitment to refund all fuel excise to farmers, including the excise on petrol that they use to drive to the city and back? Will it welsh on the promise to fully restore the fuel freight equalisation subsidy, which would cost $110m? Will the Opposition repeal the sales tax on wine, which would cost the revenue $60m or the excise on brandy which would cost another $38m? Will it welsh on its promise to abolish charges for export inspection services which would cost about another $50m? I am still waiting for a reply from Senator Chaney, Mr Howard, Mr Sinclair or Mr Hunt on whether the Opposition will welsh on all those commitments and, if not, which ones will it welsh on and which will it stick by.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[19]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

From what I have heard from shearers who used to work on the pastoral properties owned by the President of the National Farmers Federation, there were certainly no fringe benefits for the shearers in those places.

The retired rural worker who wrote the letter to which Senator Maguire referred suggested that if that was actually so he might be prepared to come out of retirement. He said that the only people that he knew of receiving those tangible additions to their wages were `blokes who come from agricultural colleges with a degree that says they know all about farming and get put in as managers or some such.

I think, in deference to Senator Bjelke-Petersen, that I should give a supplementary answer to her question today. The film, prior to its registration, was examined by the Film Censorship Board on two occasions. The Board is an independent statutory body, qualified to make judgments on community standards. The Film Censorship Boards unanimous decision-it was the whole board of 11 members who saw and voted upon the film-is that the film is neither indecent nor blasphemous but rather seeks to give the biblical story of the Virgin Mary a contemporary setting.Although the central theme in the film concerns the emotional, moral and philosophical questions posed by the rather unusual dilemma in which the central characters find themselves-namely, a virgin pregnancy-the Mary of the films title is not the Bibles Mary and is clearly meant to be a contemporary character beset by late twentieth century social and moral conflicts. The director, Jean-Luc Godard, has described the film as devout. Against the protest that has been received from the church, one should mention that, as was spelt out in the Sydney Morning Herald of 14 May, La Croix, a French catholic newspaper, has called it Godards `great Christian film, and a Catholic jury at the Berlin Film Festival last year gave it an award.Finally, now that the film has been registered and released from the control of Customs, the Attorney-General has no available powers, either constitutionally or under regulation 40 of the Customs (Cinematograph Films) Regulations, in regard to this film. The Attorney advises me that he is confident that the Film Censorship Board, as an independent statutory authority, has approached its duties in a responsible manner.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[23]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Minister for Aviation has provided me with the following information: The Kingsford-Smith Airport international terminal has from time to time been the subject of adverse media coverage and gives rise to many personal complaints. For some years, the terminals deficiencies have been recognised by the Department and by the airlines. It is proposed that the terminal be remodelled and expanded in a number of areas to increase its capacity from 1,000 to 1,800 passengers per hour to cater more adequately for international passenger traffic at acceptable levels of service. The proposed works, which will concentrate on improving the passenger and baggage processing systems and public and passenger amenities, have been estimated to cost $20m.However, a Public Works Committee hearing dealt with these matters and that proposal was under its consideration on 4 February this year. The Committee reported to the Minister on 7 May and concluded that it was not expedient for the proposed work to proceed. It believed that the proposed work would not alleviate the congestion to any significant extent. It did not believe that the proposed work would be the most effective use of the money to be expended. The Committee recommended planning for the provision of a new international terminal building and stated that that should commence immediately. It recommended that the Commonwealth authorities provide staff to process passengers at a maximum attainable level. It also recommended that the curfew be reduced by one hour in the morning. That report from the Public Works Committee is currently being considered by the Minister and by the Government.

that would previously have gone to traditional arts areas has been diverted to trade unions and associated organisations.In addition, hundreds of thousands of dollars have gone to radical and ``front groups who use the arts to spread propaganda.At the week-end, the Australia Councils Theatre Board announced its final allocation of 87 grants for 1985-86, amounting to $800,000 and bringing its total grants for the year to $12.43 million.In line with Government policy, an increasing proportion of grants from the Australia Council for arts purposes has been diverted away from traditional recipients into programmes such as ``artists in community and ``art and working life, in which the union movement is heavily involved.The $20,000 in the latest grants to public servants is to write and produce a play called ``In-Security which is described as exploring the ``highs and lows of life in the Department of Social Security, depicting the work experiences of a demoralised staff.The play is being written as the group goes along from a working outline but a major theme developing so far is that the public is being ``short changed by the system.In a scene from this still incomplete play, ``bucketfuls of cheques are poured out for a poor pensioner, an ironic reflection of the bucketsful of money the play is receiving from the Federal Government.``Cut waste to cut taxesThe first Australia Council grant towards this play was $10,000 from the Community Arts Board in November last year through the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association, (the relevant union), followed by $1,000 from the Literature Board, and then this week-ends $8,416 from the Theatre Board.Organisers hope for another $8,000 grant when the show is hopefully ready for performance in July in Social Security offices around Sydney.Funding of this self-indulgence is bad enough, but depriving other genuine arts organisations of funds for this kind of wank is intolerable.If the Government believes it needs to improve morale among its employees in this fashion, it should not rob the artistic till to do so.Funding granted this year under the Governments guidelines by the Australia Council include:Workers Cultural Action Committee (NSW) $28,500 lifting its grants under the Hawke Government to $88,678.Trades and Labour Council of Western Australia $33,000 lifting its grants to $153,477.United Trades and Labour Council of South Australia $54,000 lifting its total to $263,000.Victorian Trades Hall Council $58,500 increasing its total to $133,200.Trade Union Labour Day Celebration Committee (Victoria) $15,000 lifting its grants to $45,000.ACTU $11,350 increasing its total to $83,850.Other unions receiving arts grants this year include the Combined Unions Shop Committee NSW, the FEDFA, Ships Painters and Dockers, Storemen and Packers, Municipal Officers Association, Musicians Union, Painters & Decorators Union, Professional Officers Association, ABC Staff Employees Association, and the Trade Union Community Research Centre (Tasmania).Radical and ``front organisations also receive arts grants such as the Australia Nuclear Free Zones Secretariat, FILEF (an affiliate of the Italian Communist Party which is a major recipient of Federal Government grants), the Australian Anarchist Centennial and numerous theatre and visual arts organisations whose objectives are political and which use the arts as a propaganda medium.If these Australia Council arts grants simply meant providing increasing opportunities for the arts to be available in the workplace or to working people who would not otherwise have access to them, then they would be justifiable, even in todays economic crisis.But these grants are mainly going to finance the spread of political propaganda under the guise of arts funding.At a time when a recent study showed the trade union movement having huge assets and enormous income, it is ridiculous for the Government to finance the spread of union propaganda through politically motivated songs, plays, banners, posters and newspapers produced at public expense under the guise of promoting the arts.If the union movement along with other political and radical groups wish to use the arts as a way of spreading their message then they are quite entitled to do so provided they pay for it themselves and not ask the Australian taxpayer to foot the bill.By making unions and radical groups into patrons of the arts at public expense, the Government is reinforcing the view that the easiest way for a writer, performer or artist to get money these days is to have a leftist or radical message, Senator Michael Baume said.25 May 1986For further information, phone Senator Baume 02/817-5625","N/A","PERSONAL

75,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator GARETH EVANS","VD4","(Victoria-","ALP","Minister for Resources and Energy)",3235,"—As Minister representing the Minister for Defence I table the Review of Australias Defence Capabilities by Mr Paul Dibb. I seek leave to make a statement relating thereto and to incorporate that statement in Hansard.Leave granted.The statement read as follows-I am very pleased to table today the review of Australias Defence Capabilities by Mr Paul Dibb. Mr Dibb has worked directly for me as a ministerial consultant; His review is not a statement of Government policy, but an independent analysis of major defence policy issues facing the Commonwealth at this time.The Dibb review will now become a basic input to the development of a Government White paper on Defence policy, which will lay down our plans for the Defence Force over the next decade and beyond.In preparing his report Mr Dibb has consulted closely with the Australian Defence Force and the Department of Defence. The CDF, General Sir Phillip Bennett, and the secretary to my Department, Sir William Cole, have responded favourably to Mr Dibbs conclusions on Australias strategic environment, and to his proposal for a National Defence Strategy for Australia. And they broadly agree with his specific recommendations on force structure, though with some differences on details such as numbers and timing.Overall they consider that Mr Dibb has done an excellent job-and I heartily agree.The Dibb review is an intellectually complex and rigorous analysis of the defence needs of this nation in the light of our strategic circumstances. This kind of analysis has rarely featured in the defence debate in this country, because public discussion of defence here has almost always been concerned solely with the broad foreign-policy environment of defence decision-making.One fundamental conclusion is that the contribution of all three services is seen as essential to our defence effort. There is a strong emphasis on maritime and ground force capabilities in credible contingencies. There is a proper regard given to the enhancement of our capacity to deploy air power across the vast distances of our continent and its approaches. And the potential for reserve forces to make a major contribution to our defence effort is clearly established.Defence FundamentalsN/AWhen Mr Dibb was commissioned to review Australias defence capabilities, he took as his starting point the strategic assessment endorsed by the defence committee. He then examined the three essential elements of our defence planning environment. These essential elements are not new-they reflect long-term historical trends and underpin basically bipartisan attitudes to our defence requirements.The first of them is that Australia should aim for defence self-reliance-the ability to defend ourselves from within our own resources from direct threats to our sovereignty and interests.Secondly, sound defence planning should be based on realistic Budget parameters. Australias experience has been that peacetime defence expenditure has never consistently exceeded 3% of GDP. Indeed for most of Australias peacetime history, defence expenditure has been well below this.Thirdly, we recognise that low-level military threats to Australia could emerge relatively quickly, but it would take many years for any country other than a superpower to equip itself to attempt a major military assault on Australia.On these foundations Mr Dibb has produced a rigorous and disciplined analysis of our force structure requirements.Self-RelianceN/AAustralians have a right to expect that their nation is able to defend itself. That is at the core of nationhood, and it has long been an Australian aspiration.Just fifty years ago this year, John Curtin told this House:The people of Australia would expect this country to be capable of defending itself should the occasion arise.And he went on to say:A greater degree of self-reliance in Australias defence is essential.In that speech in 1936 Curtin predicted the events between December 1941 and March 1942. He foretold that Britain, fighting for its life in Europe, would be unable to send its navy to defend Australia from the Japanese, and that without that fleet the inevitable fall of Singapore would lay Australia open to peril.He concluded:The dependence of Australia on the competence, let alone the readiness, of British statesmen to send forces to our aid is too dangerous a hazard on which to found Australias defence policy.In 1936 Curtins policy was hotly debated and rejected-to Australias great cost. But today self-reliance is beyond debate.A self-reliant Australia is an expectation both of the Australian people and of our allies. It has been required by our principal ally, the United States since the early 1970s.This requirement has been reiterated by successive United States Administrations. In a major policy statement in November 1984, Secretary of Defence Caspar Weinberger said:We have learned that there are limits to how much of our spirit and blood and treasure we can afford to forfeit in meeting our responsibility to keep peace and freedom. So while we may and should offer substantial amounts of economic and military assistance to our allies in their time of need, and help them maintain forces to deter attacks against them we cannot substitute our troops or our will for theirs.The previous Government recognised the relationship between self-reliance and a sound contribution to alliance relationships when it said in its 1976 white paper:This self-reliant posture derives essentially from our own national interests and responsibilities. It also accords with our status as an ally of the U.S., for by accepting our local responsibilities we can contribute to the alliance relationship and to the U.S. global effort.The ability to defend itself is the absolute minimum that any self-respecting country should contribute to an alliance. Australia can scarcely pretend to contribute to the defence of broader western interests if it cannot even defend itself. Indeed, as U.S. Secretary of Defence Weinberger said at the National Press Club in April:Defence of a countrys own borders and own airspace and the sea around it, obviously, is a prime attribute of sovereignty and, of course, has to be one of the first priorities of any country.So a policy of self-reliance contributes to the strength of the alliance. And Australia makes a further substantial contribution to western security, as well as to international stability, by hosting the joint defence facilities and through a range of other cooperative activities, such as regular visits by ships of the U.S. Navy.Equally, the alliance with the United States contributes to Australias ability to defend itself. Mr Dibb concludes that a self-reliant defence of a continent the size of ours demands access to intelligence, high-technology sensors and military equipment. For much of this the United States is the best source by far, and for some it is the only source. This is an important conclusion, and one which should not be overlooked in our thinking about the defence relationship with the United States.Our U.S. alliance will remain a significant deterrent to any potential aggressor. Any nation contemplating the use of force against us would have to reckon with the help-including possibly the direct military assistance which the U.S. might provide to Australia. That possibility would inevitably be a major complication in the plans of any would-be attacker, and thus it serves as a powerful deterrent.Our relationship with New Zealand is also of particular importance because of our common history and traditions, our proximity and our shared strategic concerns. Under ANZUS we have cooperated effectively with both the U.S. and New Zealand for many years to preserve our strategic environment. This cooperation continues with both parties, despite the difficulties in the US-NZ bilateral relationship. Nonetheless we look forward to the resumption of full trilateral cooperation under ANZUS when this becomes possible.We continue to value our excellent relations with all countries in our region and particularly with the members of ASEAN and of the South Pacific forum. Our good relations with our neighbours is a major enhancement of our security, and we value the contribution which good defence relations can make to the development of a broader understanding and harmony between ourselves and our neighbours, particularly under such programs as the defence cooperation program and the five power defence arrangements. Mr Dibb points out that such defence relations offer political benefits which exceed their direct military value.I believe there is no fundamental difference between this government and the opposition parties over the doctrine of self-reliance, and what this means for our alliances. The coalition governments white paper in 1976 was based explicitly on a self-reliant defence posture.In a key paragraph, that white paper said:A primary requirement emerging from our findings is for increased self-reliance. In our contemporary circumstances we can no longer base our policy on the expectation that Australias Navy or Army or Airforce will be sent abroad to fight as part of some other Nations force . . . We believe that any operations are much more likely to be in our own neighbourhood than in some distant or forward theatre.But despite this broad agreement on these basic issues, a clear conception of Australias real defence needs in an era of self-reliance did not emerge from the coalitions seven years of government.There were a number of reasons for that. One was the coalitions failure to establish a reliable financial basis for defence planning.Australia spends about 3% of GDP on defence. We spend more on defence than on any other Commonwealth responsibility except social welfare and health.This year the defence bill is over $6.5 billion-almost 10% of total Commonwealth outlays. This is a huge investment of Australias national wealth, and of the wealth of individual Australians. Defence costs every man, woman and child in Australia over $400 per year.Because such vast sums of money are involved, it is impossible to plan responsibly for defence without realistic financial guidance. Such guidance must respect the economic and political limits to the levels of defence spending which can be sustained in peacetime.The last coalition government twice proposed major expansions in defence spending, in 1976 and 1980. In both cases, the proposed high levels of expenditure on which defence planning was based simply could not be sustained. And on both occasions defence spending fell back to below previous levels within a year. The effect on defence budgeting of this glut-and-famine approach to spending levels has been very damaging.An effective and efficient defence force cannot be developed by making grandiose commitments when international crises make defence spending popular, and then slashing spending the next year as defence concerns recede. Yet that was what the coalition did.More fundamentally, the coalition government simply failed to put into practice the philosophy espoused in its 1976 white paper, because they would not tackle the hard issues involved in developing a self-reliant force structure.Comprehensive force structure planning was neglected and all too often procurement decisions reflected political and financial expediency. The protracted wrangle over replacing the aircraft carrier perfectly reflected their indecisiveness and lack of vision.In such an atmosphere it is not surprising that competing force structure philosophies flourished within the defence community. When this government came into office it sought detailed advice on our future force structure. But we found that there was no agreement, even on the scale of war we should be preparing to fight.Defence PlanningN/AThe difficulties which the defence establishment has faced in resolving these issues is indicative of broader problems which Mr Dibb found in Australias defence planning.One specific problem identified by the review is that each of the three services continues to do much of their initial force structure planning in isolation. This can lead to narrow and competitive views of Australias defence needs.I am pleased to announce that the government has decided to tackle this problem by appointing a vice chief of the defence force directly responsible to the chief of the defence force for co-ordinating military planning.This officer will be equal in rank to the chiefs of the individual services, and his appointment will mean that increasingly, planning by the separate services will be fully coordinated.As well, the Secretary to my department and the chief of the defence force are examining other ways to streamline force-structure planning.I am also pleased to report that Mr Dibbs work has done much to reconcile different views within the defence community on some of the fundamental issues in our defence planning. In particular, the chief of the defence force and the secretary to my department have advised me that they accept and support Mr Dibbs conclusions on the level of contingency which should have priority in our defence planning.Threats and WarningN/AMr Dibb has endorsed the judgement that major threat to Australias security-other than in the context of global war-would take some ten years to develop.This judgement has been endorsed by successive defence committees and has been accepted by successive governments from both sides of this house for over a decade.It is based on an expert technical assessment that no country, other than the superpowers, has the capability now to mount a major attack in the face of Australias existing defence forces, and that it would take at least ten years for such a capability to be developed.But the capabilities to mount low-level attacks of various sorts against Australia already exist or are in prospect. Such attacks could be mounted with quite modest forces of a sort and level maintained by most countries for their own legitimate purposes.Such low-level attacks would not threaten Australias national survival, but they would nonetheless be serious emergencies.Mr Dibb has found that this range of low-level military contingencies would pose more acute defence problems than is generally believed. A campaign of maritime harassment, and raids in remote areas, could severely test our present defence capacity. He recommends that these lower level contingencies should receive more attention in defence planning than in the past.This is not a prediction of military threat. I want to emphasise that Australia enjoys good relations with all its neighbours, and no country is likely to develop hostile intentions towards us. Before any country could develop an intention to attack us, relations would have to deteriorate dramatically and fundamentally. But because circumstances and intentions can change relatively quickly, our forces need to be prepared to cope with credible levels of conflict. These can be set by considering the limits of regional military capabilities.An important corollary of these judgements is that we would receive considerable warning of any effort to increase military forces to the point where they would have the capability to mount a major attack against Australia. Australia would have time to expand and develop its forces to meet higher threats as they developed.The challenge posed by the concept of warning time is to develop a defence force which could meet low level threats arising with little warning, and yet could also be expanded fast enough to meet a higher level threat should a potential adversary begin to develop the necessary capabilities.This challenge has not been adequately met in the past. The concept of a `core force has been developed on the basis of warning time, and Mr Dibb notes that it provides a useful set of basic principles on which to define the capabilities required for high-level conflicts. But he sees, in addition, the need for a strategic concept focused on dealing with lower levels of conflict within our neighbourhood.Defence Strategy for AustraliaN/AForce planning needs a clear overall conception of how Australias defence forces would meet a threat, before it can be decided in detail what sort of forces are needed.In articulating that strategic concept Mr Dibb has made a most important contribution to improving our defence planning.To bridge the gap between strategic guidance and specific force structure proposals, Mr Dibb has developed a defence strategy for Australia, which he has called a `strategy of denial.I want to make it perfectly clear that this has nothing to do with ``fortress Australia, as some have suggested before they have seen anything of the reviews contents.Mr Dibbs defence strategy embraces three key features. The first is a focus on the specific geographical features of Australia and its surroundings.The second is a concept of layered defence, which takes advantage of our geography. Thirdly there is a need for a clear understanding of the levels of threat we may face. The chief of the defence force and the secretary to my department endorse these basic principles.Strategic GeographyN/AMr Dibb argues that our unique geographical environment should play a central role in Australian Defence planning.He argues that the vast maritime areas which surround Australia-known to strategists as the sea-air gap-and the remoteness and harshness of our northern areas, critically determine the military options of both attack and defence.Australias huge distances contribute to its security, particularly from major attacks, because only the superpowers could project and sustain large-scale military force onto its shores.But in lower levels of conflict, the effects of distance work less in Australias favour. Although the sea-air gap remains a formidable barrier to forces of any size, our vast northern areas mean that a major Australian defence effort could be needed to find and repel small attacking forces.Mr Dibb concludes that our defence forces need to be structured specifically to exploit the strengths and to guard the weaknesses inherent in our strategic geography. To provide this geographic focus for our defence planning, Mr Dibb has indicated an area of Australias direct military interest. The characteristics of this area should be the over-riding determinants of the capabilities required in the ADF.Broadly speaking, this area of direct military interest covers the whole of Australias land mass, and extends some 1,000 nautical miles beyond it in all directions. That area is around 10% of the earths surface and it covers distances equal to those from Sweden to Afghanistan or from Finland to the Suez Canal.Australias area of direct military interest is not, of course, the limit of our strategic concerns. Mr Dibb identifies a broader area which he calls our ``Sphere of Primary Strategic Interest, extending throughout South East Asia, the eastern Indian Ocean and the South Pacific.We have important strategic relationships in this region which we should develop and strengthen. The area involved takes in almost a quarter of the surface of the globe. I defy anyone to describe this as an isolationist approach for a country with a population of only 16 million.The definition of Australias area of direct military interest does not preclude the possibility of Australian forces being sent further afield, in either fighting or peacekeeping roles.What Mr Dibb proposes is that priority should be given to developing those capabilities which best enhance Australias capacity to deny an enemy substantial military success against us within our area of direct military interest.That is the Australian Defence Forces prime national task, and that should determine its organisation and equipment. But forces designed to do that job will be capable of making a contribution further afield as well, should the need arise.Layered DefenceN/AMr Dibb proposes that our strategic geography can best be exploited by a system of `Layered Defence within our area of direct military interest.The first layer-and Australias most important defence planning concern-is to prevent any hostile force crossing the sea and air gap. For this we need good intelligence and surveillance as well as air and sea forces capable of interdiction.Closer in-the second layer-a range of capabilities is needed to defend our offshore resources and the coasts themselves, including air-defence, mine countermeasures and appropriate naval ships.Lastly-in the third layer-we need highly mobile land forces capable of operating across the north to protect population, military installations, infrastructure, and industry.It is important to point out that under the strategy which Mr Dibb has proposed, each of our three services has a vital role to play at all levels of contingency.Force StructureN/AI turn now to Mr Dibbs specific proposals about the force structure which his strategy requires. I will not attempt here to go through all his recommendations, but I want to identify some major issues and, where appropriate, to indicate the Governments intentions.The issues here focus on the classic question of ``how much is enough. At a time when Australia is at peace, and expects to remain so, these are not easy matters to resolve. Defence has to fit into national budget strategies like everything else. Defence planning has to be very rigorous, and our defence dollar needs to be spent wisely.Let me emphasise first that Australia already has substantial military forces. Our intelligence and surveillance systems are the most advanced in the region. Our strike and interdiction capabilities include some of the most potent equipment available anywhere in the region. And we have well-trained maritime and land forces that are being progressively re-equipped with modern weapons and support systems.The high priority for intelligence and surveillance capabilities recommended by Mr Dibb accords with the Governments thinking, and is reflected in current programs. Mr Dibb gives special attention to the over-the-horizon radar project which offers the very real possibility of allowing continuous monitoring of the great expanses of our sea and air approaches. We are looking at ways in which this program can be accelerated and expanded.The review notes that the further development of over-the-horizon radar may have implications for other systems such as airborne early warning. I am on record as favouring the acquisition of airborne early warning aircraft. Mr Dibbs advice is that an early decision on acquisition is not required. Instead studies should go ahead in parallel with the further development of over-the-horizon radar. Those studies are proceeding and the capability will be considered by the government as the white paper is prepared.The introduction of the highly capable F/A-18 marks a major improvement in our air defence capacity. I accept Mr Dibbs advice on our need for aerial refuelling, particularly to provide the F/A-18 with an improved capacity to provide air cover for surface ships. Planning for aerial refuelling is continuing on this basis.The review gives careful attention to our strike forces. Our 23 F-111 aircraft and six submarines are unmatched in regional terms, and we have formidable strike potential in other forces such as the orion and F/A-18 aircraft. The review concludes that the F-111 force should be retained until the mid-1990s when decisions about its long-term future will be required.The review endorses the new submarine program, which will introduce new highly capable submarines into the force structure in the 1990s.The potential of mine warfare against Australia is given particular attention in the review. Mr Dibb observes that we have a major force structure deficiency in the much-deteriorated state of our mine countermeasures force. Although some progress is being made, this is an area where we have unacceptable vulnerabilities. I am determined to remedy this as quickly as possible.I observe here that this experience illustrates the need for setting clear force structure priorities. Arguments can be found to acquire many capabilities. Some would argue for another fleet underway replenishment ship. Some would argue for more fighter aircraft and more tanks, all equipped with the latest in electronic combat systems and weapons. But these arguments have to be set against clear deficiencies in our capacity to handle credible contingencies, such as an effective mine-countermeasures force.Similar considerations apply to our requirements for surface ships. Mr Dibb starts with the fundamental issues: For what purposes do we need surface ships, of what kind, and how many? He rigorously examines the demands of Australias maritime environment.Mr Dibb identifies important roles for surface ships in lower levels of conflict. But he notes that there are some concerns about the vulnerability of surface vessels in higher levels of conflict, particularly when the very high costs of modern highly capable surface combatants are considered.He concludes that our surface fleet may become deficient in its capacity to handle a range of maritime contingencies if it is limited on the one hand to higher capability destroyers which can be afforded only in small numbers, and on the other to small patrol boats whose capabilities are essentially limited to peacetime tasks.He therefore proposes introducing substantial numbers of a new class of light patrol frigate in the 1990s. The light patrol frigate should be able to provide an effective maritime presence in credible contingencies in more exposed or distant waters, and to contribute to the protection of important focal areas and our shipping. This proposal represents a major advance in thinking about maritime priorities.These new frigates should be capable of carrying a complex modern weapon fit, including harpoon missiles, a gun, air defence systems and a helicopter.This is no brown water ship. Vessels like it are readily identifiable in NATO forces, although ours would need to be tailored specifically to meet Australian requirements.The outcome would mean, if the government were to adopt Mr Dibbs maximum suggestions, a substantial increase in the business end of the surface fleet. From 12 highly capable-if in some instances aging-warships we could go as high as 17.These ships would be in 2 categories. Firstly, heavy destroyers of the FFG/DDG variety, the capabilities of which were substantially enhanced by the governments decision to acquire Seahawk helicopters. Secondly, a class of light patrol frigate would replace aging destroyer escorts and some of the less capable patrol boats.Mr Dibb identifies a real role for the army, and he comprehensively refutes those who would do away with ground forces and rely solely on our air and naval forces. Mr Dibb concludes that low level conflict would be a formidable problem for our ground forces.The first priority for ground force planning would be forces to deal with raiding groups in a range of low-level conflicts. The emphasis would need to be on light but adequately armed forces, highly mobile, able to operate over vast distances, and needing the minimum of logistic support with concentrated protective forces in key areas.But Mr Dibb also notes that the possibility of fighting a conventional land battle in Australia is not so entirely improbable that we should not retain some limited skills and expansion capacity against such an event. The appropriate forces for such circumstances should be developed within the framework of a force giving priority of manning and equipment to the needs of lower-level, more credible contingencies.An important recommendation of the review is the need to upgrade substantially the tactical mobility of our ground forces by expanding the utility helicopter force. This is the single most expensive equipment addition to the current program that the review recommends.Mr Dibb also identifies a need for the army to be provided with adequate ground mobility and firepower.While the current M113 armoured personnel carrier may not be ideal it is generally adequate in the short term, perhaps with some modifications. In the long-term program for the replacement of the M113 there is time and scope for practical experimentation with different vehicle types, particularly in the north of the continent. There may also be a place for specialised mobility vehicles.Mr Dibb sees a reduced need for armour and mechanisation of our ground forces, and considers that artillery should be constrained. I emphasise that he does not propose doing away with these capabilities. Rather he proposes limiting the resources applied in these areas, and that the reserves should take a greater role in maintaining the expansion base elements.I note that there are some reservations in the defence force about the practicability or timing of some of these capability adjustments. Similarly, practical considerations may limit the speed with which the proposals for basing of major regular army units in the north can be implemented, although options are being considered for a smaller unit.These differences should not obscure the major contribution that has been made to our understanding of the role of Australian ground forces. Mr Dibb has confirmed our northern areas as the priority area for ground force operations; he has examined the nature of the conflict that could be expected there; and he has drawn attention to the huge logistic problems of dispersed operations across a vast and harsh northern hinterland.The Dibb review confirms the central role of airpower in the defence of Australia at all levels of conflict, and it endorses the RAAFs basic structure and capabilities.But the review calls for these resources to be more directly focused on the specific strategic requirements of Australian defence. To this he recommends the development of more air bases in the north, for example, and by acquiring air to air refuelling for the FA-18s.The review also confronts the airforce with the vital challenge of developing a comprehensive surveillance system involving an optimum combination of other, AEW and ground-based radar.I mention now some other issues raised in the review.The review does not propose any radical changes to the existing command and control system, but notes that the trend is for the joint command structure under the chief of defence force rather than single service operations. This trend is already reflected in the move towards functional command arrangements, and will be assisted by the appointment of a vice chief of the defence force. Other command and control proposals-the question of control of the battlefield utility helicopters and the establishment of a northern command-are already being examined within defence.ReservesN/AMr Dibb makes a number of major recommendations about the reserves, designed to give them more central and challenging roles in the ADF.Mr Dibb proposes that the army reserve should take over from the regulars some of the heavier weapons-including tanks and artillery-which are maintained primarily to provide a base for expansion. This would entrust the reserves with a vital and exciting role.But that does not mean that the reserves will only have a role in remote, high-level contingencies. It is also proposed that the army reserve should be given specific responsibility for the security of vital installations in our north.Mr Dibb has concluded that this task would be a major undertaking even in the type of low-level contingency which could emerge with little warning.Mr Dibb envisages that individual reserve units in southern states should be allocated specific towns and installations in the north which they would be deployed to defend in an emergency.Reserve units would deploy to exercise regularly in their allocated area of responsibility, giving them greater familiarity with their wartime tasks, and increasing their sense of purpose.Similar recommendations are made for the Airforce and Navy Reserves. In the Airforce Mr Dibb proposes that reservists take over specific roles in aircraft maintenance and airfield defence.In the Navy he proposes that reservists should take over the operation of mine countermeasures vessels, which as I have already said is one of the key areas of defence in plausible low-level contingencies.The Government is very concerned to strengthen the role of the Reserves in the ADF, and I believe Mr Dibbs proposals are an excellent guide to how this could be done.As a start, I agree with Mr Dibbs endorsement of the long standing proposal that limited call-out of the Reserves should be possible in situations short of a declared defence emergency. I intend to take legislation to this effect to Government. When implemented it will do much to increase the value and flexibility of the Reserves as an integral part of the ADF.These new tasks and directions for the Reserves will require a greater training effort, and we will be considering increasing the number of days training each year. We will also consider an increase in Army reserve numbers from the current figure of 23,000 to a new ceiling of 26,000 by 1988, instead of the present ceiling of 30,000.Mr Dibb has examined the readiness and sustainability of our forces, and exposed some deficiencies in our capacity to measure this. He points to the need to ensure that key military forces are properly ready to pre-empt or respond to credible low level situations arising with little warning.An important consideration here is the need for a proper stockholding policy, which has been badly neglected in the past. We do not need large stocks of all items, but we do need to ensure that the forces required to respond at short notice are properly equipped and can sustain operations.Specific funding will be allocated to ensure that some current deficiencies are remedied as part of the effort to improve the readiness of our reaction forces as Mr Dibb recommends.ConclusionN/AIt is the custom of many defence commentators in this country to run up shopping lists of capabilities, without regard to their cost or practicability. Mr Dibbs review was not intended to be a cost cutting exercise, and has not been conducted as such. But he has costed out his proposals responsibly. His work on resource implications was not intended to provide a definitive financial prescription for the future. Rather he was concerned to demonstrate the affordability of his proposals, and to illustrate a way ahead for their implementation.As Minister for Defence, I have been impressed by the quality of this review. Mr Dibb has taken the broad principles of strategic guidance, refined them into a defence strategy and applied these concepts to our force structure in a comprehensive and balanced way. It is of course possible to suggest different approaches and to quarrel with some of the lines of argument used and the conclusions reached. But I believe that most will acknowledge this review as a significant intellectual achievement that should make a major contribution to the way in which Australians think about defence.It is not my purpose here to provide a final Government decision on the conclusions and recommendations of the review, although I have already indicated my acceptance of its broad approach and its main principles. I now intend that there will be the opportunity for discussion and debate on Mr Dibbs work, both in the Parliament and outside.I understand that the Australian Government Publishing Service intends to have copies of the review available in its bookshops around Australia within a few days. Mr Dibb himself will undertake a round of speaking engagements as part of the process of discussion and debate.The public version of the review is essentially the same as the classified version presented to me. Classified material has been removed, including some technical details on equipment performance and some material on intelligence matters. The public version does include, however, a full and comprehensive discussion of all the major force structure issues.It should now be clear that the Dibb review is a very complex, rigorous document. It demands deep study, and I hope those who participate in the debate will give it the detailed attention it deserves.Defence policy raises fundamental and serious issues for this country. Defence expenditure is now at the highest levels for peacetime, and constitutes a large financial burden for a nation facing some economic difficulties and many competing demands.Mr Dibb has developed his proposals within responsible financial limits. Yet his advice on the defence program provides for new submarines, a new class of surface vessel, many more helicopters for the Army, new surveillance and early warning systems, a revitalised mine-countermeasures force and an improved capacity to sustain air and ground forces across the north.The House has a right to expect that those who disagree with Mr Dibb will do more than mouth slogans. Where there is disagreement with this report we deserve to know what specific programs would be implemented instead, how these are justified by our strategic circumstances, and how much they would cost.When I appointed Paul Dibb in February last year, I said that I regarded his review as the most important appraisal of our defence capabilities since the end of World War Two. The result has more than met my hopes.I conclude by formally recording my thanks to Mr Dibb and his team for their outstanding work.Motion (by Senator Gareth Evans) proposed:That the Senate take note of the paper.","N/A","REVIEW OF AUSTRALIAS DEFENCE CAPABILITIES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
76,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator SIBRAA","EJ4","(New South Wales)","ALP","N/A",3242,"—When this Government came to power in 1983 it was evident that some serious defence thinking was necessary. An overview of Australian defence needs, capabilities and potential was clearly lacking. In 1983 the Australian Labor Party came to power, after spending 31 of the previous 34 years in opposition. The failure of the coalition to come to grips with the defence question was painfully apparent. All too often in the late 1970s because threats were not present-I might add that they are still not apparent-little was done to develop this comprehensive overview of defence.Mr Paul Dibb, a well-respected and independent analyst, was employed to review the whole question of defence. His brief was indeed a large one, because the whole picture has to be reviewed. The role of the Australian Army, the Royal Australian Navy, the Royal Australian Air Force, as well as the question of logistics had to be reviewed. This review also had to come to grips with the changing perception of Australias role in this region and, indeed, in the world. Australia as a nation is a member of the Western Alliance and ANZUS which not only provide certain securities but also demand responsibilities. To be an effective member of that partnership Australia needed this defence overview. In dealing with this review some very important issues emerge. The Dibb Review of Australias Defence Capabilities is an intelligent, comprehensive and coherent vision of Australian defence capacity at present and what options we ought to pursue in the future. Put simply, the Dibb report tells us where we have come from, where we are at and, most importantly for defence planners, in which direction we need to head.In 1941 Australia faced the possibility of a Japanese invasion. Already committed to a war on the other side of the world and already with considerable forces in Britain and the Middle East, Australia lacked the ability to defend either its merchant navy or even its shores from a Japanese attack. At the time the Labor Government had to face immediate threats, even though Labor Prime Minister Curtin had forewarned about such eventualities years earlier. In fact, in 1936 John Curtin stated in a speech in the other place:The people of Australia would expect this country to be capable of defending itself should the occasion arise.He went on to say:A greater degree of self-reliance in Australias defence is essential.Five years after that speech the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbour, invaded Indo-China and swept through the Indonesian archipelago into Papua New Guinea.In February 1942 the Japanese proved that they were the masters of the western Pacific by taking the impregnable base of Singapore. The threat then, naturally enough, was obvious. The Japanese made the message clear by bombing Darwin, with a considerable loss of life and shipping only a few days later. The Curtin Labor Government was quickly made aware of its weakness and how Australia, relying on the bulwark of Singapore and upon Britains ability to reinforce that base in time of war, was now in peril of attack. Curtin-I repeat, five years before Pearl Harbour and substantially before German rearmament-went on it that speech to conclude:The dependence of Australia on the competence, let alone the readiness, of British statesmen to send forces to our aid is too dangerous a hazard on which to found Australias defence policy.The basic premise that has underpinned Australias defence thinking since those dark days of 1942 is the necessity to be able to be self-reliant. Australian forces of sufficient strength need to be able to defend sovereign territory, coastal areas, sea approaches and trade. Australia in the 1980s, rather than the 1940s, has to take the primary responsibility for its own defence. These words of United States Secretary for Defence, Mr Weinberger, in an address to the National Press Club in April, made the point very clearly:Defence of a countrys own borders and own airspace and the sea around it, obviously, is a prime attribute of sovereignty, and, of course, has to be one of the first priorities of any country.Secretary Weinberger had developed this point in a major policy statement in November 1984 when he stated:We have learned that there are limits to how much of our spirit and blood and treasure we can afford to forfeit in meeting our responsibility to keep peace and freedom. So while we may and should offer substantial amounts of economic and military assistance to our allies in their time of need, and help them maintain forces to deter attacks against them we cannot substitute our troops or our will for theirs.The previous Government also recognised the need to maintain defence self-reliance. In its 1976 Defence White Paper the following was stated:This self-reliant posture derives essentially from our national interests and responsibilities. It also accords with our status as an ally of the U.S., for by accepting our local responsibilities we can contribute to the alliance relationship and to the U.S. global effort.The problem was, of course, that whilst the bipartisan approach to self-reliance was a plank of defence policy, the actual implementation of the policy in the hands of our predecessors left much to be desired. Most of the hard decisions were avoided, put off for the next crisis, at which time expenditure could be much more easily justified, and the Defence Forces structural implications were not developed. In fact, Mr Dibbs job was made all the more urgent by the fact that some decisions had been put off for far too long.The Dibb report is based on sound par- ameters. In essence, three main bases for this report emerge: Firstly, the need for self-reliance as a primary aim, on which I have already made extensive comments; secondly, that costs be based on realistic budget estimates; and, thirdly, that we recognise that, whilst low level threats can emerge quickly, it would take many years for any country other than a superpower to equip itself for a major military assault on Australia. The second point, of course, is at the heart of the matter because the cost of a good, efficient, well-trained and capable defence force is not cheap. At present, budget outlays for defence are around 3 per cent of gross domestic product. That means for this financial year a cost of $6.5 billion. The 3 per cent figure is a realistic one even though it represents 10 per cent of Commonwealth outlays and is the biggest outlay behind the social welfare budget. Under the coalition the Budget outlay exceeded 3 per cent from time to time during some international crisis such as in 1980. However, in other years it was pared back well below that figure. The basis of this report is that an outlay of 3 per cent, which can be maintained, is better than the boom and bust syndrome with which defence planners until now have had to contend.As to the military threat to Australia, Mr Dibb makes certain contingencies clear in his report. Australia needs to have defence forces which can cope with low level threats, which can develop quickly or without warning at all. Such possibilities as incursions into sea and air space, harassment of fishing vessels and coastal shipping, terrorist-type raids on off-shore oil or gas rigs, covert mining of ports, air harassment of northern settlements, raids on northern communities and sabotage of installations would constitute a low level threat, a threat nonetheless that would require adequate and competent counter measures. Escalated low level conflicts would be more severe, more pronounced and would involve more regular attacks on shipping and on isolated settlements.The Australian defence forces would need to be able to react to all of these developments immediately. More substantial conflicts in which more pronounced threats to Australia and Australias vital interests should be detected by intelligence forces well in advance. An example of this might be the acquisition of greater capabilities by one of our neighbours which, when detected, could see Australian forces develop adequate counter measures. However, it must be clearly stated, so that no confusion on this matter exists, that the Dibb report at present sees no threat to Australia or Australian interests on any level. Current defence thinking is not based on some perceived threat in our region, but on the axiom that Australians have a right to expect that their nation is able to defend itself.Under this report the Army will not be reduced. The Army reserves will go up from 23,000 to 26,000. The operational deployment force capacity to lift a company into battle will be expanded to a battalion. Located at Tindal in the Northern Territory, a battalion of troops will protect military installations and ultimately these forces will be of brigade strength. Of course one of the chief recommendations of this report is the exciting way in which the reserve forces will fit into this new defence posture.","N/A","REVIEW OF AUSTRALIAS DEFENCE CAPABILITIES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

78,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator SIBRAA","EJ4","(New South Wales)","ALP","N/A",3242,"—That is an issue that is being looked at very carefully by the Minister. Not every line in this report has to be followed. The reserves will have better equipment, more training and will be assigned specific tasks in the north in times of danger. Call out legislation will be needed for use of the reserve formation under this plan. It should be pointed out, however, that these are volunteers and not conscripts. To assess the ability of any enemy adequate intelligence is required. It is, of course, required not only before any conflict but also during it. This review calls for two Jindalee over the horizon radar installations with eventually two more. This will be at the backbone of early warning and will need to have a high defence classification for security purposes. The use of this facility for civilian purposes, such as the detection of drug importation and consequent enforcement, will be an added bonus.In this report the role of the Royal Australian Air Force is seen as crucial. The ability to project Australian military power some 1,000 nautical miles from our coast will require a $200m upgrading of the current 23 F111s, as well as the acquisition of mid-air refuelling capabilities. To achieve such a presence a new Air Force base in north Queensland will need to be built. Under this review the Royal Australian Navy will not have a carrier and will be reliant for air support from the Air Force rather than having its own fixed wing component, but it will still be a blue water Navy with a clearly defined role. One of the first areas to be tackled is that of mines and mine counter measures. It is a situation which can be described only as one of criminal neglect; that is the way in which previous governments and the Navy have treated this matter. If current Navy plans to upgrade this capability fail, three ships from overseas will need to be purchased in the near future.The life of much of Australias destroyer escorts soon will effectively be over. The patrol boats which are in current use are also severely limited and of little strategic use. One specific recommendation is that five patrol boats and three destroyer escorts be replaced by eight light frigates. These frigates would be similar to the ones which are already in service with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. In essence, they would carry one Seahawk helicopter, be missile armed for surface-to-surface and surface-to-air capability and have guns for coastal bombardment. When the last of the FFGs are completed such vessels could be built in Australia to overseas design.There are many recommendations in this report and options for future defence planning. The Dibb review is a comprehensive set of recommendations based on a realistic set of precepts. The report does not have to be followed to the letter; far from it. A White Paper will be issued at the end of this year or early next year and it should be pointed out that Mr Dibbs comprehensive review has shortened the process that would necessarily have followed by at least 18 months. The Dibb review is the first comprehensive statement of Australias defence preparedness and in which direction it should rationally proceed. This review is not an isolationist one. The review talks about projection of adequate military power to 1,000 nautical miles from Australias coastline to being capable of defending Australian sovereignty and vital maritime interests.This review also recognises the value, as this Government does, of the membership of the ANZUS pact and the Western alliance. Recommendations are clearly shown about how Australia can usefully play a role in ANZUS and in the Western alliance, the foundation block of which must be Australian self-reliance. This review, I repeat, is not an isolationist one. It projects an Australia that can adequately defend almost 10 per cent of the earths surface.","N/A","REVIEW OF AUSTRALIAS DEFENCE CAPABILITIES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
79,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MacGIBBON","YH4","(Queensland)","LP","N/A",3244,"—I regret very much that the Senate has had very little time to look at the Dibb report, `Review of Australias Defence Capabilities, which has just been tabled. It is a big report and it certainly is worthy of consideration. I have read in full the tabling speech by the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley). I have read two-thirds of part 1 of the paper and I have skimmed the rest of it. I regret that I do not have time to take it apart piece by piece. I give notice that I accept the Ministers challenge in his tabling speech, and I will certainly be coming back to debate this matter in detail in the fullness of time. I hope that, in contrast to all the other speeches which I have made, the Minister this time will not run away from the arguments which are put to him. In all the years that I have been in the Senate I have never had the courtesy of a reasoned reply to any of the comments I have made in the defence field. Since the Minister has gone out on a limb this time and has invited comment, he will certainly get it from me and, I imagine, from a large number of my colleagues.This document authenticates Australian Labor Party defence policy. More than that, it authenticates what the Labor Party has already done in running down the capacity of the Australian defence forces to defend Australia. The document is certainly a very interesting academic treatise, from what I have seen; but regrettably it starts with some false assumptions and it builds its whole argument around these assumptions which are totally false. It does not matter how logical it is from there on; having made the false assumptions, or a series of false assumptions, one cannot get the right solution when starting from the wrong point. In the limited time we have this afternoon I certainly cannot go through this document in detail, so I will confine the few minutes I have to debating the conceptual basis, the conceptual inadequacies, of this report.One of the first points made in this report is that there is no threat. If we look at the history of mankind we will find that 90 per cent of armed conflicts between nations have never been predicted or foreseen. They arise de novo. We can see the origins of them very clearly when we look at them in hindsight; but with foresight, which is what we have to live with, we cannot see them. It suits the Labor Party to downplay defence and, in supporting that downplay of defence, it uses the assumption of no threat to back it up. I was very interested to see that the Minister quoted from a former failed Labor Prime Minister, Mr Curtin. He quoted at length from what Mr Curtin said in the 1930s. What he did not say was that six months before the outbreak of the Second World War Mr Curtin was saying that there was no foreseeable threat to Australia. Mr Curtin is reported in the Hansard of the House of Representatives six months before September 1939 as saying that there were no threats to Australia at all. What happened when Japan came into the war? Again we had this no threat doctrine.Honourable senators interjecting-","N/A","REVIEW OF AUSTRALIAS DEFENCE CAPABILITIES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

81,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MacGIBBON","YH4","(Queensland)","LP","N/A",3244,"—I do not need any protection from illogical people such as those opposite, Mr Acting Deputy President. Within four months of entering the war, the Japanese swept through the whole of the western part of the Pacific. Where was the 10-year warning time then? We paid for the negligence of the Labor Party at that time with the lives of young Australians. I for one will not tolerate a situation like that ever again while I have a say in the matter.Another basic concept on which this report is based is the strategic assessment. Labor hides behind the strategic assessment, as if the strategic assessment were some sort of holy document which is always accurate. The strategic assessment on which Australian defence planning is based, according to evidence which has been given to the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence and to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, is a political document. In other words, the public servants in the Department of Defence write the strategic assessment in the light of the government of the day to cater for the known prejudices and beliefs of that government. It is not a document which deals accurately with the strategic situation.The third false assumption in this document is that Australia can never afford more than 3 per cent of its gross domestic product for defence. Three per cent of gross domestic product is simply not enough in the modern age and in the situation we face to meet the defence needs of the country. Mr Beazley will not accept that. One of the very first conditions Mr Dibb was given in his remit for the report was that he had to accept the financial restraints that exist at present; in other words, the 3 per cent of gross domestic product. That is simply not enough.","N/A","REVIEW OF AUSTRALIAS DEFENCE CAPABILITIES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

85,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MacGIBBON","YH4","(Queensland)","LP","N/A",3244,"—I would look at cutting it down considerably. The fourth point which the Government goes on with is a jingoistic belief in self-sufficiency. I have always maintained that we should be self-sufficient in defence, but I do not mean that in the jingoistic way that the Labor Party means it. I believe that we should not be a parasite in the region. I believe that we should have effective standing forces so that we can maintain our alliances in the region.Finally, I come to the fortress Australia concept, which is the whole concept of what the Labor Party wants in defence. The bottom line of it all is: What can Mr Beazley get away with from the far Left of the Labor Party? The defence policy of this Government, like the foreign policy, is what the left wing, the Senator Cooks and people of that kidney, will accept. I do not accept that that is what the majority of Australians want, let alone what they need. With this report, we hide behind the flim-flam of a strategy of denial. There is no honesty in that. There is no declaration that this is fortress Australia. Instead, there is the dissembling point-it is a strategy of denial. I will come back to that point later.There is a dear belief in the Labor Party that, if we hide like a lot of good little children in our back yard and do not go out and play on the streets, we will be safe-no one will climb over the fence to get us. That might be a fine philosophy for kids, but it is not a philosophy for adults in an adult world. The Dibb report rationalises what has already taken place in the defence forces since Australia became governed by the Labor Party. The Labor Party got rid of any overseas deployment capability so that it could incorporate Fortress Australia as a fact of life. There were two keys to this. The first was abandoning the Fleet Air Arm. Not replacing the aircraft carrier means that we do not have air cover at sea. Despite what Senator Sibraa in his ignorance said, if we do not have air cover at sea we simply cannot have a blue water navy. But Mr Dibb, as he says in his report, cannot see the need for ships other than for coastal protection duty. I hammer this point: If we do not have air cover we cannot have a blue water navy. That maritime strategy has been known for 50 years.The second thing the Labor Party did to strip Australia of anything other than a Fortress Australia capability was to disband the amphibious squadron at HMAS Moreton. It got rid of the six landing craft heavy ships-Balikpapan, Brunei, Labuan, Betano, Wewak and Tarakan-and the amphibious heavy lift ship Tobruk. Not only did the Labor Party destroy that amphibious capability; it also in the same blow destroyed the training capability for the Army because 6 Brigade at Enoggera was tasked with training for the amphibious role.The most likely consequence for the use of Australian forces will be in the south-west Pacific area to support a friendly democratic government that is under attack, probably from some of the friends of the Labor Party from the Libyan Embassy, or the Cuban Embassy, in Vanuatu or something like that. Without an amphibious squadron, without an Army unit trained in amphibious operations, we simply cannot support our foreign policy in the region because the Labor Party has taken that resource and that capability away from us. In return it comes up with the Fortress Australia concept-the strategy of denial; the policy of layered defence.Mr Dibb put Mr Beazleys moat in terms of a thousand miles of what he, in a buzz word, calls the sea-air gap. Mr Dibb has only to look at the map to realise that the 1,000 nautical miles barrier around Australia has quite a lot of land in it. It is not a moat. It includes New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and Timor. It extends to Ambon, the Celebes and part of Indonesia. There will be bases in that land mass. He comes to the astonishing conclusion that although there will be this 1,000-mile barrier, we do not need to know what is going on in it because Mr Dibb recommends that we do not buy an airborne early warning capability. Without an AEW capability we simply cannot survey that area. The benefits of Jindalee, the over-the-horizon radar, are considerable. However, they are nowhere near precise or comprehensive enough to be able to survey those areas. We are going to have a moat of 1,000 miles and we are assuming that all the good people out there will not trouble us. We are going to have a brown water navy. We are not going to be able to put surface ships into the area because they lack air cover.Mr Dibb relies very heavily on the Royal Australian Air Force. As everyone knows, I have a very soft spot for the Air Force, which is an essential part of the deterrent function of Australian defence. However, the Air Force has a very limited use. One can either bomb someone or one cannot. One cannot influence the foreign policies of another country by putting aircraft overhead. That is not the way the Air Force works. One either destroys a target or one does not. Aircraft are very inflexible; what is more, they are very short term. One can be over a distant target only for minutes.Of course, the other casualty is the Army which is to be reduced really to riot police status. It will be a SWAT squad. The New South Wales Police Force would be able to take on the Army when the Dibb report is fully implemented because there is to be no armour, no armoured personnel carriers and no artillery. The Army is going to buy some helicopters, and that is good. However, one cannot fight from a helicopter. Soldiers have to get out of those helicopters if they want to do anything. I hope that the people running out of the helicopters are the Mr Dibbs and the Mr Beazleys of this world and that they have only a green shirt for protection. I hope that there are a few accurate markesmen on the other side because they will then learn-although it will be a fatal learning process-that we have to have armour on the ground and close fire support.The policy of strategic denial has some very fundamental flaws for Australian defence. It denies any alliances in the region. It abandons the notion that we are part of a community of nations which want to live in peace and stability. It says to those people in the region: `We in Australia will not be able to deploy the Army, Navy or Air Force, either individually or collectively, to help and support you if that need arises. We are saying: `We are turning our back on you completely. You do not matter to us. People in the region do not like it, as the Indonesians have made very clear. But more importantly, because we turn our back on those people, we are sending them a very clear signal that we see them as the potential enemies. The consequences of that for our foreign policy are enormous. At the end of the day one only has to look at history to know that no fortress has ever stood alone. We cannot pull up the drawbridge over the moat around Australia and live in peace in perpetuity. This simply cannot happen.I would now like to turn very briefly to the report itself which, of course, commences with that great statement I have already dealt with-the statement that there is no threat. The following statement is made on page 7 of the report:Air strike or naval interdiction capabilities that could contribute to our allies in more distant areas should not be a force determinant.That is a nonsense, and I have just dealt with that point. The report also states:Enhancement of the land-strike capacity of the F111 force is not required at this time.But the best part is in regard to maritime defence. I will refer to two statements in the report because they are factually incorrect. The report states:Land-based aircraft would be expected to provide maritime air defence where necessary . . . but we should avoid policies that require naval surface vessels to be placed at risk of air attack without access to our own defending aircraft.That is the most nonsensical piece of academic irrelevance that I have ever heard. Someone should have told Senator Withers or Senator Hamer when they were having the hell bombed out of them in the Mediterranean in the 1940s that there should have been a policy that should not commit ships without air cover. We do not control those situations. The second nonsensical statement is that the F111 can perform the role of a long-range air interceptor. One thing the F111 cannot do is to act as a fighter. It lacks the radar and the armaments to do it. All it has are Sidewinders. A big heavy aircraft like that simply cannot operate in that way.I will go through other things in the report in much greater detail at another time. However, in summary and in conclusion, this report is isolationist, it is insular, it is immature and it is impractical. It will destabilise the area and it is dangerous for Australias long term security.","N/A","REVIEW OF AUSTRALIAS DEFENCE CAPABILITIES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start[4]/para","N/A","N/A"
86,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MASON","YJ7","(New South Wales)","AD","N/A",3247,"—The Australian Democrats agree with the broad thrust of the Dibb Review of Australias Defence Capabilities which we have been awaiting with some interest. We believe that the report should now be used as a basis for broad agreement on what our defence needs are going to be over the next decade or so. I note with some interest the promise in the tabling statement of the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Gareth Evans) that there will be a White Paper and that that White Paper will contribute significantly to our defence planning over the next decade and beyond.There is little doubt that for many years there has not been clear direction in our defence planning and that this has resulted in some very serious and expensive mistakes. We have been ineffectively spending far more on defence than have most other countries, notably such countries as Canada and Japan. The comparisons between Australias performance and the performance of those countries are, to put it mildly, pathetic. This appears to have been due to an ambivalence in the planning area between whether we are going to operate in the world of today or whether all of our strategy, all of our thinking in defence, is going to be based on what happened 45 or 50 years ago. We might just as well go back to the Battle of Waterloo and plan on the basis of what we were doing then as go back to the lessons of World War II.I know that that argument has gone on in this place and the community since the days when the short deck aircraft carrier was proposed. This was a disastrous enterprise and a disastrous concept. I have put a number of questions on notice on this matter. The last one that was necessary was: In the event of war and the possibility of a nuclear attack submarine being in the vicinity of Australia, would the new short deck carrier put to sea? I understand that certain people in the Department of Defence gave this question a great deal of agonising thought and they came up eventually with the only possible answer which was yes. That was the end of the debate, because anybody with any rationality would know that such a ship at sea, with the means we have within our Budget to defend it, would not last five minutes in those circumstances. It would be a mere sacrifice of that ship and every living soul on it. Therefore, I think we are coming slowly and painfully to a more rational view of what might be done in this country from the point of view of defence.The concept of forward defence, with Australia substantially being defended by powerful friends, into whose forces Australias forces were interposed to play minor roles, has been disastrous for this country in the past in terms of planning and would be even more disastrous in some circumstances one could think about. I put a scenario, for instance, in which both of the super-powers were severely mauled in a nuclear war-this is a very likely possibility-but in which Australia emerged relatively unscathed. I do not agree that that is necessarily a very strong possibility, but it exists. We would then be alone without powerful friends and forced to look after ourselves in a situation of virtual isolation of forces. If we went ahead purely with the concept of throwing in our lot with our powerful friends, we would inevitably be the victim of any casual opportunist or adventurer among our northern neighbours. Such an adventurer or opportunist may not exist now, but we must take into account, as the Dibb report has, that it may emerge and that it is not beyond the bounds of possibility.In other words, it is good common sense and rational planning for us to take a strong, independent attitude towards our own defence and to do everything we can within the reasonable expenditure of money in the circumstances to see that Australia is in a position to defend itself and particularly to be able to convey a foreign policy message to the world that we are thinking along those lines. To allow Australia to come to a situation where we were apparently quite without a defence capability in modern terms would be disastrous. I had hoped, until I heard Senator MacGibbon, that that ambivalence about our defence aims would now become a thing of the past. Unfortunately, it appears that that is not the case.The oceans in war time will be very unfriendly places, with weapons afloat, especially under the sea, which we would have no hope of dealing with. Blue water ships of the type we could readily afford would be sitting ducks for a nuclear attack submarine. The Governments plans to build smaller, patrol-type frigates in Australia are along the right lines, but I hope that the same disastrous mistake is not made as was made with the Fremantle class ships. Those patrol ships are excellent small warships, but their main armament is a bofors gun of the type used in World War II, which I understand on good authority is not capable of even firing a shot across the bows of a Taiwanese fishing boat if it is proceeding in a stiff breeze upwind.","N/A","REVIEW OF AUSTRALIAS DEFENCE CAPABILITIES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

88,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MASON","YJ7","(New South Wales)","AD","N/A",3247,"—I gather that is the case. It is absolutely disastrous and totally irresponsible to have perpetrated such a thing. I have spoken to senior officers-not naval officers-who are concerned with this class of ship and they have wept tears of blood over this. They know perfectly well that those ships could be missile capable. There is space in them for the control systems and missiles and they ought to have been designed that way from the beginning. Happily, that point is noted on page 129 of the Dibb report, but there is an ambivalence there. It is stated that these ships probably will not be missile capable, but they might be. I suggest that the Government ought to grasp that nettle right now and not build or buy any more light ships or frigates of that type which do not have surface to surface or surface to air missile capability.Our reasoning is based on the enormous advantage of the capability to fire missiles in large numbers. Phalanx and other quick firing gun defence systems can protect an enemy from a small number of missiles, but our ability to fire such missiles in large numbers from cheap, mobile, easily defended and to some extent expendable platforms would progressively increase our chance of completely destroying an invading fleet. That has been taught in regional wars where naval forces have been engaged, such as the Middle East and the Falklands. Perception by the rest of the world that we have the capacity to do great damage is a vital foreign policy weapon that we should have. It would be a serious deficiency if once again, as with the Fremantles, we built a whole class of small vessels without that missile capability. Such ships with small guns scarcely enable units at all; they are more coastguard type ships. Somebody mentioned earlier in the debate something about coastal gunnery. We are certainly not going to do much effective coastal gunnery with ships of that type in any war I could conceive in the future.In relation to the Air Force, we agree with the two major recommendations; to provide air to air refuelling for the FA18 aircraft-it is absolutely essential if these aircraft are to carry out any kind of reasonable role in the future-and to maintain the F111 aircraft force. Senator MacGibbon does not agree with that, but I think the F111s are worth maintaining and upgrading. They fill a role that the FA18s are not capable of filling.For many years the Australian Democrats have pressed for a modern, professional Army with the strongest possible airborne and parachute capability. We are delighted to see that the Dibb report has made recommendations in this direction. The last thing we would want is an Army which does not stress quick mobility, trained and equipped along conventional lines, based in south-east Australia. That is what we have had in the past. If we have that, we are looking at the possibility that any future threat to this country will come from either New Zealand or Antarctica. That is not so; any future threat to this country will come from the north or west. It is again square one stuff that we have to have a highly professional Army with the best light weapons we can provide; not artillery, but weapons that a man can use in his own hands. Those weapons exist and are indeed lethal. The Army must have the capacity and training to be moved quickly to any location in Australia where a threat might arise.I agree with the Dibb report that there is not really a major threat to Australia at the moment because of our geographical situation. If a threat emerged, unless we are in a position to have that kind of mobile force, which could actually go and fight and operate efficiently on the ground anywhere in Australia, we might at some stage have the considerable embarrassment of having to fight a long, drawn out conflict against a comparatively small force which had been landed somewhere in our north-west, which we might not know about, on our present state of reconnaissance, for days or weeks after it happened. We have to have the capability of getting a force in quickly which is capable of dealing with that. Here again the foreign policy message is important. It is essential for our neighbours and the rest of the world to know that we are smart enough to see things in those terms.As I recall, there was an agreement among the Whips, which the Democrats intend to honour, that this debate should be held to 10 minutes on this matter, so I have only one more thing to say. I am concerned at the early reaction of the Liberal and National parties to the Dibb report. As has been reported in the media today, their comments have been unconstructive and quite damaging to an effective Australian defence effort. We cannot go back to the past and make important judgments on the basis of the weapons, strategies and experiences of the past. It is important also that one should not take something such as this report, which has been carefully thought out and constructed in detail, and damn it out of hand. I hope that that tendency will not be continued by the Opposition. I will not say that the report is not beyond criticism-of course it is not, and that is probably the best reason for my appeal to the Opposition. If the Opposition has criticisms, let them be realistic and useful so that when the promised White Paper, which will determine how our defence will stand for the coming decades, is written, the Opposition will have some constructive and useful input rather than merely saying, quite emotionally, that we ought to go back to the forward defence policies of the past without qualification.","N/A","REVIEW OF AUSTRALIAS DEFENCE CAPABILITIES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
89,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator VALLENTINE","IG4","(Western Australia)","IND","N/A",3249,"—I welcome the general thrust of the Dibb report-the report of the Review of Australias Defence Capabilities-that is, that Australia should be moving towards self-reliance in defence capabilities. This is an important document which highlights the need for a new approach to our foreign policy upon which this report is founded. A disturbing aspect of the tabling statement of the Minister for defence, Mr Beazley, is that Caspar Weinberger is quoted more than anyone else in the whole document. In fact, Mr Beazley moved swiftly from quoting John Curtin to quoting Caspar Weinberger, whose statements received a lot more prominence. It is as though we must have the United States permission to develop our own defence policies. The reality is that we have been requested by the United States to develop self-reliance since the Nixon statement in Guam in 1969. The Dibb report merely complies with that directive from the senior partner in the nuclear alliance in which we are now involved. Pages five and six of the text of the Ministers statement are an apology to those who think it inappropriate for Australia to have any independent thoughts whatsoever.The discussion which has taken place already in anticipation of this report has been very healthy. There must be much more debate about foreign policy and defence issues in this country. I call for a community based defence review inquiry along the lines of the one being conducted in New Zealand at present. The Dibb report will serve as a very useful starting point for such community debate. Like the issue of nuclear disarmament, I believe that foreign policy and defence issues are too important to be left to politicians and academic experts. The people should have a say and I look forward to that happening.Debate (on motion by Senator Grimes) adjourned.","N/A","REVIEW OF AUSTRALIAS DEFENCE CAPABILITIES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/debate.sub1/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
90,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MACKLIN","2I4","(Queensland)","AD","N/A",3250,"—I move:That the Senate take note of the paper.The statement put down yesterday in the House of Representatives by the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Kerin), presented in this place by the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry, Senator Walsh, deals basically with the single matter of the marketing boards which the Government is seeking to overhaul, as time and the legislative commitments of both chambers permit. We have already looked at the restructuring of some boards. Obviously a very large number are yet to be looked at. The Australian Democrats still see a number of problems with the proposition. We have been very firmly of the view that these marketing authorities should have a producer majority. The Governments second key principle, at page 5 of the text of the statement, reads:. . . boards of the authorities will be established on a corporate rather than a representational basis with members selected according to merit and relevant expertise.While that may sound very useful-I do not think anyone can be against expertise-we will lose a considerable amount of contact if we give away without question the representation base of these boards. Page 7 of the text of the statement, with regard to that representation base, reads:As such the system in which members are elected through ballots of particular interest groups is unsuitable since members would be answerable to those groups.I think that one of the particular strengths of the notion of a representative board as against a nominated board is that it is answerable to those groups. But, in being answerable to those groups, I believe that such a board is able to take those groups with it on most occasions with regard to the decisions that are made by that board. Surely it is of vital importance in regard to the boards of any of our major industries-or even some of the newer and smaller industries which have established boards-that the industries must have confidence in and support for the policies of those boards. By cutting ourselves off from the representative base, we give away one very real and effective means that has been used in the past to get the co-operation of the special interest groups. I remind the Senate that those special interest groups are not just any group in the community; they comprise the people who produce the commodity which is being sold. In other words, they have a very clear and distinct interest in what those boards do and in how successful those boards are.It is not the case that the representatives on those boards can in any way further the interests of the groups which they represent without at the same time furthering the aims of the boards, because the interests of those production groups and the interests of the boards are identical-that is, to increase the export of and markets for those commodities. Therefore, I think somewhat of a fallacy has crept into the Governments thinking with regard to this aspect. It is as though it believes there is some conflict of interest between those two groups. There is not, and there cannot be.When we were looking at representation on the Australian Wheat Board, which was one of the boards that the Government sought to restructure earlier, the Australian Democrats would not accept the Governments proposal and a compromise was reached whereby expertise was sought from representative groups. I believe that is a solution that should recommend itself to the Government so that we may be able to maintain both the representative nature that is currently available to the boards and the expertise that the Government is currently seeking.","N/A","GOVERNMENTS POLICIES FOR MARKETING RURAL PRODUCE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
91,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator VIGOR","OT7","(South Australia)","AD","N/A",3250,"—I rise to support Senator Macklin in his contention that the marketing boards should have a large amount of grower representation. The growers are the people who suffer from the rural crisis. They are the people who need to be protected against the problems that are imported from overseas. We do have a rural crisis, so it is very timely that the Government should be looking at reorganising the boards which are some of the main front organisations which handle our overseas marketing. Our prices overseas are very low because of dumping by countries all over the world, particularly by the European Economic Community and the United States of America, which subsidise their domestic production and also accumulate surpluses of the various agricultural products that they eventually dump on world markets. They also give aid through consumer credit programs. I believe the Government should consider allowing our boards to enter into that sort of program.I want to address a few other factors which the boards need to look at. I refer to the fact that many countries prefer to import pre-packaged or pre-processed goods which are ready for sale or final assembly into a salable product. If we can get into that area and have more value added to our products, we will get more revenue in this area. This is one of the points that was made quite cogently in the statement of the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Kerin). The other problem is that a lot of our products are considered to be fair average quality-f.a.q.-products. What is sought by foreign countries is high quality products which they can sell in their markets at a special premium price.We also have low local prices. The boards do handle some marketing on a local basis. One of the major problems is that we have many small producers selling to a few large wholesalers. A small surplus of products can result in a large slump in prices on the local market. It is possible that dumped products may compete and produce a local lowering of the price of the product, particularly where the products which are imported are of a higher quality or greater variety than the ones which are produced here. Currently we also have rising costs because of high interest rates, government service costs, wage rises and other costs, and an inflated capital value of land, which poses a real problem for people living near cities. We also have the problem of the cost of tariffs due to the tariff protection of oils, machinery and fertilisers.The Government is kidding itself if it believes that it can solve the problems of producing an export efficient industry just by reorganising the marketing bodies. The Minister promises an effort to reverse the corruption of international markets as countries default on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, but he does not say how this will be done. He talks about joint negotiations of marketing treaties with our Pacific neighbours, New Zealand for a start, through the closer economic relations scheme. I support that, but we must go a lot wider. It is very important that we should look at such innovative thoughts as tying the interest rates on overseas loans to commodity prices on world markets and try to institute that through all our systems. But the Minister does not address these views.I believe that we must get more and more behind getting higher value added products on to the market and exporting them. This can be done only through a sensible incentive program. I hope that the industry research and development legislation and the 150 per cent tax concessions will help in doing this and that people will look for sensible private sector solutions to complement the Minister.","N/A","GOVERNMENTS POLICIES FOR MARKETING RURAL PRODUCE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

93,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COOK","RF4","(Western Australia)","ALP","N/A",3251,"—I move:That the Senate take note of the paper.This is the first of a series of papers dealing with the International Labour Conference. It is important to note that Australia was a foundation member of the International Labour Organisation which is a branch of the United Nations devoted to labour studies. The ILO is a tripartite body which meets annually in Geneva and it begins its 1986 meeting next week. It is a body in which we have participated and by which we are well regarded as a country, although during the latter years of the Fraser Administration our standing in the ILO decreased because of activities by that Government on the industrial relations front in this country which contravened ILO conventions. However, this Government has adopted those ILO conventions that it is open to adopt and last November the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Willis) reported that convention 142 and convention 150-the first dealing with vocational guidance and the second with labour administration-had been adopted by Australia.These papers deal with two new conventions coming from the 1985 conference-convention 160 which concerns labour statistics, the method of collection, the formation of those statistics and what they cover; and convention 161 which deals with occupational health and safety. There are also recommendations in both those fields associated with those conventions. I wish to dwell on the one which the Minister has indicated he is prepared to adopt and ratify in Australia-that is, the convention on the collection of labour statistics. That convention tries to find a uniform international base for collection of statistics associated with employment, unemployment, underemployment, average earnings, hours of work, wage structure, distribution of income, labour costs, consumer price indices, household income and expenditure, occupational injuries and disputes. This would facilitate justifiable comparisons between countries. One would not be comparing statistics that are collected on differential bases and therefore are not quite accurate.This convention is desperately needed to bring greater sanity to the industrial relations debate. It is one of the provisions of the accord between the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Council of Trade Unions that we improve our statistics base so that we can address problems as they are instead of viewing them through rose tinted glasses and seeing them as various players in the industrial relations field would like them to be. We can now deal with reality, not illusion. The reason Australia can now move to ratify this convention is that we meet most of the standards and in the only two areas in which we do not meet them, we have steps in train to do so.The most important convention of the two is the one that concerns occupational injuries and diseases. As I said, there are steps in train to enable us to meet the standards of the convention on the statistics on labour costs. However, it is important to make the point that given the primacy of industrial relations and industrial disputes in the political debate in this country, there is nothing wrong with the provisions we have set aside ourselves as a nation for collecting statistics on industrial disputes. But we have absolutely no statistical base anywhere at all-nor have we ever had one-on the level of industrial accidents, injuries and disease. All the surveys that have ever been conducted show that losses to production in industry are between two and a half and three and a half times more as a result of injury, accident and disease than as a result of industrial disputes. It just turns out that industrial disputes seem more enticing as a political argument in public debate. Because that has been the case with conservative governments over the years, we have not attended to the need to get a statistical body of information together about accidents which are more damaging to our national output.This Government has moved in that direction with its occupational health and safety legislation; over time it will be able to meet the criteria set out in the proposed convention and it will be able to ratify the whole convention by adjusting its collection of statistics through the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission. When employers in this country bleat about the cost of workers compensation claims, it should be remembered that they talk about reducing the cost of workers compensation by reducing benefits, not by collecting the statistics to attack the problem and resolve the high human and financial cost to industry.","N/A","INTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

95,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator GILES","XG4","(Western Australia)","ALP","N/A",3252,"—Among the documents in this particular group I wish to address those that deal with the collection of labour statistics-convention 160 and its accompanying recommendations, convention 170 of the International Labour Organisation. I was gratified to read in the accompanying statement by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Willis) that the standards and goals set in Australia for collecting statistics in the area of labour are equal to or better than most of those embodied in the Convention and in the more detailed Recommendation and that where we currently do not fully meet the obligations of articles 11 and 14 we will certainly move to do so in the near future.The lack of comprehensive and reliable statistics of an international standard was brought home very closely to members of the Australian delegation which represented Australia at the United Nations Conference at the end of the Decade for Women in 1985. Strenuous efforts had been made by the United Nations to review and appraise the achievements of the United Nations Decade for Women. The information that had been finally collated was interesting and in some cases indicative, but in very many cases it was not particularly reliable. Of the 160-odd nations that are members of the United Nations, only about 108 were in a position to provide up to date statistics, not only in relation to employment matters, but also across a whole range of social and economic determinators. It was quite obvious, as we tried very hard to assess what had been achieved during the Decade for Women, that in many cases the data simply was not available. In the document that issued from that conference a number of references were made to the paucity and inadequacy of statistics. In paragraph 28 of `Forward looking strategies, the title of the document that was adopted by consensus at that conference, it says:According to ILO estimates and projections--Not firm statistics, I point out--women constitute 35 per cent of the worlds labour force, and this figure is likely to increase steadily to the year 2000. Unless profound and extensive changes are made, the type of work available to the majority of women, as well as the rewards, will continue to be low. Womens employment is likely to be concentrated in areas requiring fewer skills and lower wages and minimum job security. While womens total input of labour in the formal and informal sector will surpass that of men by the year 2000, they will receive an unequal share of the worlds assets and income. According to recent estimates, it seems that women have sole responsibility for the economic support of a large number of the worlds children, approximately one third and higher in some countries, and the numbers seem to be rising.Out of the same conference came another reference to the lack of information about the work that women do and the value of that work. Paragraph 120 reads:The remunerated and, in particular, the unremunerated contributions of women to all aspects and sectors of development should be recognised, and appropriate efforts should be made to measure and reflect these contributions in national accounts and economic statistics.It is a source of considerable satisfaction to those of us who were on that delegation to note that the Australian Government has given instructions to the Australian Bureau of Statistics to include in a time series in 1988 a survey of domestic production in Australia and the value of that domestic production to the economy, thereby taking up the suggestion that contributions within households should be recognised within national accounting.","N/A","INTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
96,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CROWLEY","ZF4","(South Australia)","ALP","N/A",3253,"—I rise to speak to the International Labour Conference papers too, although I must confess that a certain confusion about when papers are or are not coming on means that my preparation is less than comprehensive. I apologise to the Senate for that. I am very pleased to endorse strongly the remarks of my two colleagues Senator Cook and Senator Giles. I wish to pick up some of the points made by Senator Cook, in particular those concerning the lack of adequate statistics. Australia may have adequate statistics as compared to other countries, but I think that would mean that nowhere in the world are the statistics adequate, particularly when it comes to accident and injury and the problems of defining accident and injury, let alone the basic data collection concerning those matters.I think it is a matter of considerable pride that this Government has established the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission. A very great part of the central work of that Commission concerns the importance and adequacy of data collection. In fact, we received in our offices earlier this year a proposed outline of guidelines for the adequacy and standards of data collection in this whole area. I forget the exact title of that booklet, but I think it is put out by the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission. It goes to the very point that what we need at this stage is some guidelines as to what we mean by accident and injury and, further to that, how statistics relating to those definitions, once in place, can be collated and collected. It is certainly true that at the moment in Australia our statistics, albeit according to this report not unlike those collected in other countries, are worthy of the title `woeful.The other important point highlighted by Senator Cook was the issue of how many working days are lost in this country due to accident and injury as compared to industrial disputes. In the late years of the Fraser Government Mr Macphee was on record as saying that the difference was a factor of four; that is, four times more days were lost due to accident and injury than were lost due to industrial disputes. That was in the heady days of very high industrial disputation under the previous Government. I hope that the number of days lost due to accident and injury has fallen as well as the number lost due to industrial disputes, but in fact that gap may be even wider if our accidents and injuries have maintained somewhat the same level as before, because the level of industrial disputation has fallen so dramatically under this Government.I refer honourable senators to the annual report of the Commissioner for Employees Compensation, yet another report which was tabled in this place but which, due to time constraints, was not spoken to. It is certainly one of the reports to which I had wanted to speak. On page 26 of that report, under the heading `Collection of compensation statistics, it is stated:Unfortunately, the statistics collected annually from departments and other bodies falling within the jurisdiction of the Act-that is, the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act 1971-are not comprehensive. More detailed information is required to enable analysis of patterns of compensation expenditure. In coming months a statistical policy will be established that defines the statistics the Commissioner will collect and the purpose of these collections.This report, in this paragraph and others, goes to the very point raised by Senator Cook concerning the inadequacy of statistics and the importance and significance of our falling into line with the International Labour Organisation Convention so as to try to increase our statistics and data collection. One other matter that I point out concerning employees compensation relates to the dramatic increase in compensation payouts-from $21m to $156m between 1975 and 1985-as compared to a less than 100 per cent increase in the number of accidents. We do not have the statistics to enable us to understand why those figures are increasing so dramatically. We need them. I am delighted to endorse this report, which looks at Australias place in the world on this very important issue.Question resolved in the affirmative.","N/A","INTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
97,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator VIGOR","OT7","(South Australia)","AD","N/A",3254,"—I move:That the Senate take note of the paper.The 1985 annual report of the Western Australian Local Government Grants Commission comes before us at a time when local government funding legislation is very much in the air. On 21 May the Leader of the Opposition in Western Australia, Mr Bill Hassell, received some publicity on this topic under the newspaper heading `Big rise in council rates predicted. By the time the last edition of the West Australian had been printed, the story had worked its way from page one to page three. The point Mr Hassell was making was that Western Australian councils are in future to get a slightly smaller proportion of the national untied funds because that allocation is now moving to a per capita basis. The previous system disadvantaged South Australia and Victoria. The amount involved, while in the hundreds of thousands, is really nothing compared to the $2 1/2m which Western Australian councils lost last year because of the mini-Budget when the Liberals decided to assist the Hawke Government in pulling the plug on an election commitment.Honourable senators will recall that both Labor and Liberal policy in this area is that local government should receive 2 per cent of personal income tax collections by the Commonwealth Government. That was enshrined in the legislation until 28 May last year when the combination of Opposition and Government ranks saw it reduced to a 2 per cent increase in real terms. The difference turned out to be about $28m across the whole of Australia. The Lib-labs, that not so unusual combination of senators, sent a signal to the Self National inquiry into Local Government Finance that 2 per cent of personal income tax, or even some other proportion of a Commonwealth revenue or expenditure base, was politically impossible for the future. It was an unfortunate undermining of the work of the Inquiry, and was a view supported by all the local government associations and State Ministers for local government.I just wonder whether Mr Hassell was as strong a defender of local government last May as he paraded himself to be last month. If more Liberals had put the case for local government to their Federal parliamentarians in May 1985 the Western Australian Local Government Grants Commission, whose report we are discussing, would have had much more money to distribute. That in turn could have meant that over 100 extra people could be very gainfully employed in the areas of great need, because it would have been in these areas that the extra funds were distributed.There are some refreshing features in the eighth report of the Grants Commission. The State Government has increased local government representation on the Commission by substituting a nominee of the Country Urban Councils Association in place of a Treasury representative. An additional research position was created, taking the Commissions research and secretariat staff to four. This is indeed a modest overhead to ensure the fair distribution of funds and that contact is made directly with councils as the Local Government Grants Commission visits different parts of the State. In fact, the Commission has a four-year program for visiting all councils. It has also established a special hearing mechanism to give councils, which believe that their disabilities have not been properly recognised, an opportunity to make their case publicly. This is a very important part of the process. Quite often through this process it will turn out that councils get a better understanding of what information they need to provide to the Commission. Once councils understand roughly what goes into the calculations and how best they can put their submissions together, they will be happier with the processes and the outcomes.I notice also that the Western Australian Local Government Grants Commission refers to the need to improve the collection of financial and other statistics. It mentions that a standardised local government accounting system will improve the quality of information from 1985-86. That is an area in which Federal resources can be applied very effectively through both the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Office of Local Government. As local government moves more and more into the human services area, it will be essential to get a quantitative idea of the needs.","N/A","WESTERN AUSTRALIAN LOCAL GOVERNMENT GRANTS COMMISSION","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The proposal to index the market rental value of housing provided to employees is designed to make administration of this aspect of the fringe benefits tax easier for employers. As with the existing remote area housing provisions of the income tax law, it avoids the necessity of establishing a fresh market value every year. At the same time, it is necessary to bring the index value into line on a regular basis with the actual market rental value. These factors were balanced when determining the ten-year review period.

Surely the Minister, as a member of the Government in this chamber, would want to have the matter cleared up and made absolutely crystal clear in Hansard so we know exactly where we are.

I was determined that the record should be straight and Senator Walsh was determined that the record should be straight; that is why he read the whole letter from go to whoa into the Hansard today. I will read it out to honourable senators. The letter is addressed to Senator Chipp and says:At Canowindra on 31 May 1986 I received representations suggesting that the draft Fringe Benefits Tax legislation as it applies to rental accommodation for farm employees would impact heavily on rural producers. In response to these claims I undertook to secure an assessment of the likely impact of this aspect of the tax.Advice received today confirms that account has been taken in the draft legislation of important concerns of rural producers. The review now underway is considering whether there is any valid basis for further flexibility in the manner in which the proposed tax is to be administered.There is no question of the Government moving to defer adoption of the draft legislation now before the Senate.The letter is signed by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). What that means is that the Government intends to continue with the legislation as it is. Of course, there is a review. We do not put down pieces of legislation as though they are etched in stone and will never be altered. If there were any untoward effects we would take that into account. The problem with this whole area of fringe benefit tax on farm employers can be best seen by some of the nonsense that has been written and the inflammatory material that has been distributed. I noticed that the New South Wales Livestock and Grain Producers Association put out a statement saying that there are 56,770 farms with an average of one employee. That means there is a whole swag of them with half an employee, a third of an employee and a fifth of an employee because many farms have two, three, four and five employees. If a statement is started off with mathematical nonsenses like that in it, it is no wonder that the further down one goes in the statement the sillier it gets.","N/A","FRINGE BENEFITS TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1986 FRINGE BENEFITS TAX BILL 1986 FRINGE BENEFITS TAX (APPLICATION TO THE COMMONWEALTH) BILL 1986 FRINGE BENEFITS TAX (MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) BILL 1986","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1/speech[15]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The liability for tax is established by tracing through these provisions.Clause 148 does not in itself provide for the payment of the tax. It appears merely to define an employer and employee relationship. It then broadens that definition so that, in effect, the Commissioner is given an overriding power by determining the benefit in such a way as he can disregard or, in other circumstances apply, the factors relating to that relationship of employer and employee.

The gentleman who sent me the telex, Mr Trevor Atherton, said that the fringe benefits tax, calculated at 46c in the dollar, could amount to as much as $1,656 weekly, so employees in holiday flats and caravan parks will have problems. The people in the accommodation industry maintain that the effect of this extra tax will have to be passed on to their guests or they will have to reduce the standard of service. They feel, and I agree with them, that the accommodation industry seems to be a special case.

The situation is that if employees are being provided with a permanent home in a caravan park or motel as part of their salary, they will be liable for the fringe benefits tax. The difference with cruise vessels, I think, is that the people will be living away from home. That is a living away from home situation and I suspect that they would not be liable for the tax. Of course, that non-cash income will now become taxable and that will mean that there will be small extra costs in the running of a business. When one thinks of the size of a motel and the number of rooms in it, I do not believe that the cost of the one place that is usually provided would lead to the 10 per cent increase in costs which Senator Newman has mentioned it would be likely to be.","N/A","FRINGE BENEFITS TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1986 FRINGE BENEFITS TAX BILL 1986 FRINGE BENEFITS TAX (APPLICATION TO THE COMMONWEALTH) BILL 1986 FRINGE BENEFITS TAX (MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) BILL 1986","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1/speech[47]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

To exclude them, one would need more compelling reasons than Senator Newman has given. It is my experience-I am not saying it is universal-that, in the case of the National Trust, although the buildings may be valuable, considerable and even at times extensive, the accommodation provided for the warden, the caretaker or whoever is fortunate enough to get that accommodation is considerably smaller. The calculation in these circumstances, as is the case in regard to motels, would not concern the rental value of the whole place-a place such as Entally House. It would concern the rental value of the few rooms in which the people live.In the case of youth hostels, they frequently have very sparse accommodation. In fact, in the couple of youth hostels that I know of, the people who look after them are not provided with accommodation; they live nearby in their own homes. The alternative for the organisations is to charge rent or to pay people an allowance for the accommodation that is provided. I am not sure what is the tax status of the National Trust, but it is probably getting some benefit in that regard. I think it is a tax exempt body, so it is probably getting a benefit in that way. I think it is unreasonable to single out the National Trust, of all organisations, as being an organisation which should be excluded. I think Senator Walsh answered that question last night.

234,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MESSNER","9I4","(South Australia)","LP","N/A",3265,"—The question that arises in relation to this part of the Bill is two-fold: First there is the question of airline transport fringe benefits. I noticed recently that the group representing former airline employees on this matter had put forward an alternative suggestion to the Government about the way in which the tax might be calculated in order to save the airlines a considerable amount of administrative and clerical detailed work which, of course, is quite costly. I believe that the suggestion was that there should be a flat amount of $300 per person affected by this tax, payable to the Government directly without any further substantiation of the detail behind it. I wonder whether the Government has considered that because it appears to me to be a step in the right direction in terms of a sensible compromise in that the airlines would be saved from very considerable expense which would only add to community costs associated with this matter. Can the Minister give us some idea about the Governments attitude to that?While I am on my feet I mention the second point that concerns me in this general area. It falls under the heading of `board and it concerns the effects upon contractors who are operating in remote areas and working according to firm tender prices. They provide accommodation benefits for their employees which would be subject to the fringe benefit tax. In many cases there are no nearby towns in which those employees can live and in those circumstances the tax would be payable by the contractor who, of course, is unable to renegotiate the price of that contract with the principal. The point is that this is an extra cost which is not recoverable by the contractor, and in that sense it represents a retrospective impost upon him. As such it puts him in a weaker position in terms of his employment capacity. Has the Government considered providing a means by which people in those circumstances can be relieved of the very severe burden that will obviously fall upon them because it must be recognised that the costs of providing services of the kind of which we are speaking in the most remote areas of the country are very high indeed.","N/A","FRINGE BENEFITS TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1986 FRINGE BENEFITS TAX BILL 1986 FRINGE BENEFITS TAX (APPLICATION TO THE COMMONWEALTH) BILL 1986 FRINGE BENEFITS TAX (MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) BILL 1986","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1/speech[56]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It might be quite interesting for the Senate if I quoted from part of a speech that was made in the House of Representatives on 8 May. The speaker was Mr Mountford, the honourable member for Banks, and he was referring to the airline industrys fringe benefits. He said:The previous speaker said that airline employees would be affected. That, of course, is not the case. When first announced, airline employees justifiably feared the effects on their very generous travel concessions. I received many representations from airline employees within my electorate. Following talks with the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and the airline industry unions, the airlines have agreed to pay the full cost of the tax without threatening the existing travel concessions. This is yet another example of consensus in action.I draw the attention of the Senate to that last line: `This is yet another example of consensus in action. If ever there was a case of holding the gun at the employers head, those negotiations must have been it. Of course many employers will look at this legislation with a view to seeing which fringe benefits they can withdraw, but the airlines have been compelled to continue to provide these fringe benefits and therefore pay the cost of the tax. That does not mean that the cost to the airlines will go away. It means that although the employees will still get their concessions, the airlines will still pay and guess who will pay the bill? Ansett Airlines of Australia estimates that these agreed rates of fringe benefits tax on the travel concessions of its employees alone-just the travel concessions-will be in the region of $2m to $4m. How will the Government prevent this flowing on to the airline costs of the average Australian traveller?","N/A","FRINGE BENEFITS TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1986 FRINGE BENEFITS TAX BILL 1986 FRINGE BENEFITS TAX (APPLICATION TO THE COMMONWEALTH) BILL 1986 FRINGE BENEFITS TAX (MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) BILL 1986","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1/speech[57]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We are seeking some advice regarding the exemptions in relation to work-based child care. I remind the Committee that page 35 of the Governments statement entitled `Reform of the Australian Taxation System states:However, the provision of in-house child care facilities for the dependants of employees will not be taxed.I have raised this matter with the Minister for Community Services (Senator Grimes) before. The Opposition seeks to know whether or not adequate provision is made for exempt benefits in relation to work-based child care. I will take the Minister through our concern. If one turns to clause 47 (2) (b), at the top of page 39 of the Bill, there are some words relating to the provision of child care in a child care facility if that facility is located on the premises of the employer. On page 41, there is an amendment which the Government put in in the House of Representatives, which I acknowledge has helped because I think it provides in a very appropriate way an exemption for certain other kinds of provision of child care.There is only one remaining problem. I will explain it to the Minister in this way: A company in central Sydney owns a large building. It cannot establish a child care facility on those premises and have it registered but it can do so 200 yards away. I know of a company that was faced with that possibility. Reading clause 47 (2) (b) on page 39, as it has been drafted, child care provided in that facility which may not be a subsidised facility but is otherwise a work-based child care centre may not be an exempt benefit. I ask the Minister to explain to us what happens to people who are attempting to provide work-based child care in accordance with the spirit of what the Government is seeking to exempt. If they have to provide that facility in premises adjacent to or slightly away from their premises in order to meet the State licensing requirements, where will they be left in relation to the benefit exemption and how does that fit in with the provision of the Bill?","N/A","FRINGE BENEFITS TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1986 FRINGE BENEFITS TAX BILL 1986 FRINGE BENEFITS TAX (APPLICATION TO THE COMMONWEALTH) BILL 1986 FRINGE BENEFITS TAX (MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) BILL 1986","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1/speech[63]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I am obviously referring to mines which come under the remote area definition. It seems to me that the mining company that provides housing whether it is on-sold or not, notwithstanding the discount which some might describe as generous and others as modest, would be considerably disadvantaged compared with the company that flies its employees in and out. That company would receive the full tax deduction applying to the cost, whereas the company providing accommodation would ultimately be left with a residual amount of fringe benefits taxation.What I find most disturbing about the proposal is that more and more mining projects such as the Argyle diamond prospect in the Kimberleys of Western Australia-where there is no decentralisation, no mining town, no infrastructure and where there are no suitable roads and no desirable attractions for the area to be opened up generally-will fly their employees in, provide them with very sparse accommodation and fly them back out again. As I said, there will not be the infrastructure which can attract people, as is the case with Mount Newman, Dampier, Karratha, Paraburdoo and Pannawonica. One can name a whole range of mining towns which have been built around mineral deposits. It seems to me that as a result of the provisions of this legislation mining companies will be encouraged, because of the benefits so accruing, to provide simple accommodation on site and to fly employees in and out. In my view, such a situation would begin to debase the very character of society and very much destroys the incentive to have a decentralised community.","N/A","FRINGE BENEFITS TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1986 FRINGE BENEFITS TAX BILL 1986 FRINGE BENEFITS TAX (APPLICATION TO THE COMMONWEALTH) BILL 1986 FRINGE BENEFITS TAX (MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) BILL 1986","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1/speech[66]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Opposition parties announced early, following party and shadow Cabinet consideration, that we would move to try to exempt charities from the effect of this impost. We issued Press releases at the time and we have issued some subsequently. I must say that the Australian Democrats have also had a concern about the effect of this tax on charities and I understand that they have negotiated with the Government on their own. We determined that we would move an appropriate amendment. We hoped that, when the Bill was finally drafted and introduced, the Government, notwithstanding Senator Walshs macho rhetoric, would have actually inserted some exemption for charities, but there was none. As far as the Australian Labor Party and the Government were concerned, the charities were to be taxed for any fringe benefits that they offered. Clearly, some of those fringe benefits were absolutely unavoidable. Others may not have been but many of them were unavoidable. It seems to us that all that would happen was that the work of the great charities of Australia-the Sydney City Mission, the St Vincent de Paul Society, the Salvation Army-would be adversely affected, so the Opposition prepared an amendment.I wish to indicate that Senator Haines has pointed out to me, with accuracy, that my understanding of the word `charity and the legal meaning of the word are quite different. Let me acknowledge that it has been possible, working with the Australian Democrats, to develop a form of words which talk about the provision of benefits to employees of public benevolent institutions. The words `public benevolent institutions have their own meaning in law but they cover the great charities of Australia.

289,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator HAINES","1H4","(South Australia)","AD","N/A",3271,"—I would like to go into this particular amendment in a little more detail. As Senator Peter Baume mentioned, this has been a cause for concern for most of us ever since the fringe benefits tax legislation was brought down. Certainly at the Australian Council for Rehabilitation of Disabled conference in Brisbane last year I made comments then about the unworkability of the Governments proposal to tax fringe benefits provided by charities and then to try to make up for this by some sort of compensatory grant. It seemed to me that that was the most complex and cumbersome way that the Government could have gone about it. It seemed to us to be a much simpler method simply to exempt charitable organisations.We had a number of discussions with the Treasurer (Mr Keating) on this matter last year and again earlier this year. In discussions with Senator Peter Baume we settled on a definition of charitable organisations that appears with respect to section 23 (e) of the Income Tax Assessment Act. To the lay person reading section 23 (e) and seeing the mention of charities and charitable organisations it would appear as if that was a perfectly appropriate lynchpin on which to hang an amendment to exempt those particular charitable organisations from this fringe benefits tax. Unfortunately, as Senator Peter Baume said, we entirely overlooked the tortuous minds of some members of the legal profession and some of the issues that from time to time over the years they have picked up and classified as being related to charitable organisations. In fact, the word `charitable has a technical legal meaning which is completely different from the meaning that most people in the general public and I suggest most honourable senators have. Various Privy Council decisions and other legal decisions have led to some fairly extraordinary cases being picked up as charitable organisations which we in this place would not wish to be classified as such. Indeed, the Statute of Elizabeth is taken in by the legal profession and hence by the courts as defining what the charitable institutions are. These include some fairly extraordinary ones.","N/A","FRINGE BENEFITS TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1986 FRINGE BENEFITS TAX BILL 1986 FRINGE BENEFITS TAX (APPLICATION TO THE COMMONWEALTH) BILL 1986 FRINGE BENEFITS TAX (MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) BILL 1986","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1/speech[76]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

It continues:supportation, aid, and help of young tradesmen, handicraftsmen, and persons decayed--this may or may not apply to some people in this chamber or in another place--the relief or redemption of prisoners or captives; the aid or ease of any poor inhabitants concerning payment of fifteens;--whatever that may be--setting out of soldiers, and other taxes.Indeed, what has occurred as a result of this is that everything from vegetarian societies to homes for lost dogs has been classified by the courts as a charitable organisation along with, of course, the things that we would more normally classify as charitable organisations such as the Royal Blind Society and so on. Included, I might add, in this list of extraordinary things which are qualified as charitable organisations by the courts has been the reduction of the national debt. I do not know exactly how the Government could use that to its own deficit benefit, but maybe it could well do so. Having been met with that extraordinary list of things that were likely to be suddenly exempt from fringe benefits tax if the original proposal classifying charitable organisations under section 23 (e) were taken up, we then went looking amongst the murky depths of legal history for something that defines public benevolent institutions. In fact, an organisation is legally defined as a public benevolent institution if it satisfies the following tests:its object is the relief of poverty, sickness, suffering, distress, misfortune, destitution or helplessness;it is carried on without purpose of private gain for particular persons;it is established for the benefit of a section or class of the public; andrelief is available without discrimination to every member of that section of the public which the organisation aims to benefit.Quite clearly that definition of what is legally known as a public benevolent institution is the word that we, in this place, and most people in the community would regard as applying to what we would normally call a charitable organisation. So people who have been concerned, for example, that the Church of England has been exempt through the religious exemption, but the Brotherhood of St Laurence has not, will now be satisfied that picking up public benevolent institutions and exempting them will mean the Brotherhood of St Laurence, St Vincent de Paul, ACROD and the Blind Society of New South Wales and the Sydney City Mission provide a service.","N/A","FRINGE BENEFITS TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1986 FRINGE BENEFITS TAX BILL 1986 FRINGE BENEFITS TAX (APPLICATION TO THE COMMONWEALTH) BILL 1986 FRINGE BENEFITS TAX (MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) BILL 1986","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1/speech[76]/talk.start[5]/para","N/A","N/A"

In this case simplicity runs across equity and in a year or two we will be back amending the legislation again.Progress reported.Sitting suspended from 6.31 to 8 p.m.","N/A","FRINGE BENEFITS TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1986 FRINGE BENEFITS TAX BILL 1986 FRINGE BENEFITS TAX (APPLICATION TO THE COMMONWEALTH) BILL 1986 FRINGE BENEFITS TAX (MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) BILL 1986","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1/speech[77]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

310,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator PUPLICK","TI4","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A",3273,"—The Senate is debating cognately the Industry Research and Development Bill 1986 and the Income Tax Assessment Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 1986. It is my pleasure to lead on behalf of the Opposition on these two pieces of legislation, and to indicate that the Opposition will be supporting both of these pieces of legislation, although we have a number of matters to raise by way of query with the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button). I indicate that we have had some discussion with the Australian Democrats and when we come to the Committee stage we are likely to be supporting some of the Democrat amendments which I understand have also been discussed with the Government.These two Bills are part of an overall package which may be considered to have been developed over the last few years in terms of providing a structure for financial support for research and development to take place within Australia. Apart from these two pieces of legislation which are before us, one needs to bear in mind that they are supported by a number of other initiatives including the successful development over the last couple of years of the management and investment companies system and the development of the second boards, whereby a number of companies, particularly those in the high tech and venture capital area, have been able to get themselves listed on Australian stock exchanges and to raise funds for research and development under that particular method.As I said, the two Bills before us, which are measures to support industrial research and development by the provision of direct government financial assistance, are assisted by the MICs and the second boards. It is very encouraging to note in the 1984-85 annual report of the Management and Investment Companies Licensing Board that the number of eligible business entities, as far as that operation is concerned, rose in recent years from one to 36. It should also be said that the scheme, which underlies the Income Tax Assessment Amendment (Research and Development) Bill, for the provision of a 150 per cent tax concession for eligible research and development work undertaken, was one which has bipartisan support. It was, in fact, provided as part of the policy of the Liberal and National parties going into the last election that we would give a 50 per cent tax incentive over and above eligible expenditure which is exactly the same as the Governments provision for the 150 per cent subsidy being provided here.It is also important, when we are looking at research and development in its overall sense, to understand that it cannot simply be provided by measures of financial assistance. There is a whole raft of areas, particularly those which come within the portfolio of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce which also need to be borne in mind. I mention just a couple of these. The first is the development of an effective offsets policy. The Minister has been very diligent in attempting to develop a more comprehensive and intelligent approach to offsets policy, but there is still a degree of reluctance within the Australian Government to support Australian industry by a more positive buying Australian campaign. There is, for instance, a letter in the 30 May edition of Business Review Weekly from David Reid, headed `R and D misses out which makes the point that Telecom Australia is purchasing about $1m worth of local area network equipment, but that it is purchasing it from overseas. There was an article in the journal Australian Society in October 1985 under the heading `Government wont buy Australian in which it said that the Government, which is responsible for purchases of approximately 40 per cent of the material purchased within the information technology market nevertheless continues to pursue a policy of not positively buying Australian and making a contribution in that regard.For instance, we have a Bill on the Notice Paper, the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill. One of the things that that Bill attempts to do is to increase the tariff on the importation of optical fibres from the minimum 2 per cent which it stands at at the moment, up to a 20 per cent figure. We cannot see how, in terms of the development of an integrated approach to support Australian research and development, all of these policies are properly co-ordinated.One of the things which this legislation will do will be to go some way to redressing the imbalance of expenditure undertaken by the Labor Government-both this Government and the previous Labor Government-which has not been good news for science. I look, for instance, in the Budget papers. Going back to the 1981 Budget, if one looks at the Department of Science, at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, or at the Antarctic Division-the three areas which I have extracted-one can see that in the period of Liberal administrations there were substantial increases in the budgetary allocations, and that in the period of Labor administrations there have been substantial real decreases. My colleague the shadow Minister for Science, Senator Archer, in terms of an analysis of the three years of funding provided to research and development in Australia by the Labor Party, has produced a balance sheet which shows the extent to which science and technology have not fared as well under this administration as might have otherwise been the case. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the figures and statements to which I have just referred.Leave granted.The documents read as follows-SENATOR BRIAN R. ARCHERSENATOR FOR TASMANIAA MAJOR STATEMENT FROM THE SHADOW MINISTER FOR SCIENCELABORS THREE YEAR SCIENCE REPORT CARD-A FAILUREShadow Minister for ScienceShadow Special Minister of StateOpposition Spokesman on Tasmanian AffairsThe Federal Labor Government has been a disaster for the scientific development of Australia. Over the last three years, science has consistently been accorded an extremely low priority resulting in a crisis of confidence within the scientific community and an ever increasing drain of our best scientists and innovators to overseas commercial and research institutions.Clearly the Labor Government has failed to understand the link between scientific and technological advance and long-term economic development.The Labor Governments catalogue of anti-science decisions includes:Allowed Government funding of medical research to become the second lowest in the western world (after Italy) while hundreds of millions of dollars are wasted on the ALPs ideological binge-Medicare. As a result, Australias immense technical talent in the area of bio-technology and the vast commercial potential offered in this area will be wasted.Broken its promise to increase expenditure on scientific research in Antarctica by 300 per cent in its first three years.Drastically reduced the funding of Australias premier scientific and industrial organisation CSIRO despite promises to the contrary.Has pursued an incoherent policy towards the CSIRO often penalising those divisions of most benefit to the economy, e.g. the cuts to the Division of Tropical Crops and Pastures may cost Australia millions in lost export earnings.Has failed to provide any response to the ASTEC Inquiry into the future direction of the CSIRO, including the recommendations for greater flexibility in employment practices.Ditched the National Technology Strategy casting aside two and a half years of preparation and almost 250 submissions from industry, government and community groups. The strategy, which was to provide a detailed blueprint for government technology policy, now represents only a vague framework for policy.Refused a request from N.A.S.A. to provide night-time landing facilities for N.A.S.A.s Kuiper Airborne Observatory which was to study Halleys Comet utilising Australias technical and geographic advantage. As a result, Australias credibility as the leading technologically developed nation in the southern hemisphere has been severely damaged and NASA has been forced to relocate its experiment to New Zealand.May prohibit Australian scientists, companies, and research institutions from participating in a range of commercial and technological opportunities offered by co-operation with the USA on research relating to the Strategic Defence Initiative.Presided over the disastrous failure of the `Sunrise Industries Scheme ignoring the potential of applying new technologies to existing enterprises. On November 25 1985, the Secretary of the Department of Science admitted-`While sunrise industries had a gee-whizz appeal to a large number of people in the populace, the hard-headed businessmen saw they werent the way to go. I think he (Minister Barry Jones) has come to realise that but unfortunately its too late.Has placed in serious doubt, the future of the Australian Research Grants Scheme. The A.R.G.S has been targeted by the Expenditure Review Committee which recommends a halving of its funding. This is in direct contrast to Labors promise in March 1983, that it would increase ARGS funds by 10 per cent more than inflation in its first three years. That promise has been utterly broken.Eliminated commencement grants to new and small businesses initiating technology-based research as well as abolishing public interest grants which produced such international breakthroughs as the bionic ear and the new malaria vaccine.Excluded individuals, new and small businesses investing in industrial research and development from benefiting from the 150 per cent tax incentive scheme.Bungled the attraction of sponsorship for the proposed Bicentennial National Science Centre necessitating an injection of an extra $10m of government funds to underwrite the project.Failed to respond to the Industrial Property Advisory Committee inquiry into the Australian Patents, Trademarks and Designs Office completed in mid 1984.Failed to respond to the Madigan Committee report `A Space Policy for Australia published almost ten months ago.Presided over the continued deterioration of basic weather services, a situation which led forecasters to issue disclaimers with their forecasts. Labor has failed to fund the Bureau of Meteorologys re-equipment programme at a level recommended at ASTEC.Has failed to promote private sector investment in research and development by failing to contract out its strategic research and development to industry. The Australian Government contracts out only 2% of its R&D expenditure whilst the U.S.A. and Japan contract out almost 50% of their expenditure to industry.Split the portfolios of Science and Technology setting adrift two inextricably related functions of government innovation policy.Signalled the introduction of a capital gains tax at marginal and company income tax rates, thus destabilising the high risk/high return delicate balance for new and entrepreneurial high-technology companies and discouraging the flow of investment funds to high risk activities.The Hawke Labor Government must be judged by its record-as it has been demonstrated-and it stands condemned.Australias relative position in the scientific world has been falling rapidly, and as the entire future economic progress of the nation is so inextricably tied to our innovativeness, initiative and scientific development, the actions of the Government have already prejudiced our future.As the Liberal and National Parties continue to develop their Science and Technology policies this serious state of affairs will be taken into account.For further information and interviews: Senator Brian Archer (004) 315111 (004) 451164 A.H.Further information: Brendan Pearson (062) 726185.April 4, 1986.

311,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator PUPLICK","TI4","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A",3273,"—This is not something new for the Labor Party. If one looks at an article by K. C. Westfold in the August-September 1985 journal Search, which is the journal of Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science, under the heading `Research funding-the Whitlam Debacle it states:In the last days of the Whitlam Government it brought down a budget in which the 1976 allocation for the ARGC was reduced by 66 per cent and that for the NH&MRC by 42 per cent, notwithstanding an election commitment ` . . . to expand research work in the Universities. The impact of those cuts on the research community and its limited success in recovering the situation are recalled, in the context of the most recent ARGS allocation.One can look for instance at the very glossy publication-goodness knows how much it would have cost-entitled `Living by Our Wits, a selection of speeches by the Honourable Barry O. Jones Minister for Science in which we are treated to the collective thoughts of the Minister for Science (Mr Barry Jones) on this matter. If one looks for instance at the sort of ideological underpinning of science policy as it has been developed by this Government in his essay `New Paradigms for Old it states:The major influences on my thinking in writing Sleepers--that is an abbreviated form of Mr Joness magnum opus on the question-were Karl Marx, especially in his Grundrisse, the three dedicatees, Lewis Mumford, author of The Myth of the Machine and The pentagon of Power, Simon Nora, the French civil servant who prepared the major report Linformatisation de la societe . . . Hugh Stretton of Adelaide University, author of Capitalism, Socialism and the Environment, the Japanese economist Yoneji Masuda, and Professor Joseph Weizenbaum of MIT, author of Computer Power and Human Reason.That might all be very interesting as far as the intellectual development of the Minister for Science is concerned, but the record of the Minister in providing funding for research and development is better understood if one looks at the annual report of the Australian research grants scheme. The 1984 report stated:The funds available to the Committee were appreciably less than the amount required to maintain an adequate level of support under the Scheme and limited its capacity to provide proper support for its projects . . .The 1985 report stated:This increase was grossly insufficient to support the number of worthy projects that the Committee considered should be funded.Fortunately, a large part of Australias research and development policy has now passed into the control of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. There has been an appreciable increase in the significance given to the funding of research and development since Senator Button took this into his portfolio.We have two Bills before us this evening: The Income Tax Assessment Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 1986, the purpose of which is to provide a 150 per cent tax concession for eligible expenditure in research and development, and the Industry Research and Development Bill 1986. The first Bill is primarily a Bill which will benefit companies whose expenditure on research and development is $50,000 or more. It is true that companies which spend $20,000 will get a phased-in tax concession between $20,000 and $50,000 which will be of benefit to them. If they spend less than $20,000 by contracting out the expenditure to an approved research institution, they will benefit fully from the 150 per cent taxation concession. This scheme was criticised for not providing sufficient incentive and assistance for small and start up research and development companies. The Industry Research and Development Bill, however, picks up the area of small companies and innovative new companies and provides them with financial assistance along reasonably similar but not identical lines.As I have said, the Income Tax Assessment Amendment (Research and Development) Bill provides for financial assistance to companies which undertake approved expenditure. That expenditure is to be judged in a number of ways. The legislation defines research and development activities as those which include the systematic investigative or experimental activities that are carried on in Australia or in an external Territory; those which involve innovation or technical risk and are carried on for the purpose of acquiring new knowledge, whether or not that knowledge will have a specific practical application; or those which create new or improved materials, products, devices, processes or services; and those which are for certain other related activities. I think it is important to understand that this Bill provides some assistance for developmental activities. It allows the company concerned to contract its work to approved institutions. Those institutions are as approved under section 73a of the Income Tax Assessment Act. They include the CSIRO, a large number of government departments, educational institutions, overseas institutions, museums and certain other general research activities. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a list of those approved research institutions.Leave granted.The list read as follows-SECTION 73a: INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT ACTRESEARCH INSTITUTES APPROVED BY CSIRO (at 15.8.85) A number of other institutions are currently seeking registration.Government: Commonwealth and StateCSIRODepartments of Agriculture: South Australia; Tasmania; Victoria; Western Australia; New South Wales.

312,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator PUPLICK","TI4","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A",3273,"—I thank the Senate. Proposed new section 73B (2) provides certain exclusions for expenditure. It provides that things such as market research, quality control, petroleum or natural gas prospecting, the making of cosmetic modifications to products, management studies, social science, arts or humanities research and the development of computer software other than for the purposes of sale, rent, licence, hire or lease or the making of donations are not to be taken as being eligible expenditure under the Act.I would be grateful if the Minister would address himself to a number of questions I wish to raise. I refer firstly to the question of patenting. As I understand it, this Bill will provide that a patent which is taken out in the course of a research and development activity in order to lead on to the next step of actual research and development is to be an allowable expenditure under the Act. However, the patent which is taken out at the end of the research and development phase, and prior to the moving into the commercial exploitation phase, is not to be taken as an allowable expenditure under the terms of the principal Act. I would be grateful, firstly, if the Minister would confirm whether my understanding is correct in terms of expenditure being allowable in respect of a mid-way patent which leads to further development but being excluded in respect of the final patent which leads on to development. If that is a correct understanding, will the Minister tell me why the Government has decided that the first patent should be an allowable expenditure and the final patent should not be?The other point which I make is that the board which will be established under the Industry Research and Development Bill is going to have certain powers. Those powers include advising the Commissioner of Taxation as to whether in fact an expenditure should be regarded as an expenditure which falls within the definitions provided in the principal Act. It is interesting to note that clause 35 of the legislation provides that once the board has given that advice to the Commissioner, the Commissioner is in fact bound to accept that advice and therefore does not have a separate and independent discretion as far as that is concerned. I think it is interesting that there are very few other examples where the Commissioners personal or independent power of discretion is taken away. Only two instances have been drawn to my attention-one in relation to assistance to the film industry in Division 10ba of the Income Tax Assessment Act, and the other in relation to the certification of manning levels of coastal ships which is determined by the Department of Transport under what I think is section 57am of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Nevertheless the board has the power to make certain determinations.This potentially leads to a slightly confusing situation in that if the claimant for assistance is unhappy with a decision of the Commissioner, he must pursue his appeals through the normal process of the Income Tax Assessment Act. If, however, he is unhappy with the determination made by the board established under the industry research and development legislation, he must pursue his appeals, as I understand it, through the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. I think there could be some confusion arising in the minds of claimants as to the course of action which they would have to follow if they were seeking an appeal against a determination that certain expenditure was not to be allowed as a deductible item.The other point I want to raise in relation to the Income Tax Assessment Amendment (Research and Development) Bill is that it is interesting that the section 73b (2) exclusion of cosmetic modifications or stylistic changes to products is somewhat at variance with the way in which the Government was prepared to provide funding for the automotive industry. If one looks at the Automotive Industry Authority Amendment Bill, which we passed last year, one will see that under that legislation certain cosmetic and stylistic changes to the motor car industry are allowable deductions. So there again is a slight difference, depending on the particular field in which one is operating.The Industry Research and Development Bill allows the Government to provide financial assistance. Essentially, this will be done through a board which is to be established. Classes of grant will be made available so that industry research and development can be undertaken. The first of these are discretionary grants in which the Minister may essentially declare an activity to be an eligible activity for the purpose of receiving financial support and assistance. Secondly, there are generic technology grants. The Minister may declare an area of technology to be one of generic technology and assistance may be provided under that heading. Thirdly, national interest agreements are to be established. The board, which may in fact be required to act on the direction of the Minister, will be allowed to enter into agreements with individual researchers, or presumably with research institutions, to undertake research into an area which is regarded as being of significant national interest. As part of this whole process the old Australian Industrial Research and Development Incentives Board scheme is being wound up. There are transitional provisions to allow grants made under the old AIRDIB scheme to continue in place and many of the areas of AIRDIB funding are being transferred, in effect, into the discretionary generic technology and national interest agreements as provided in the Industry Research and Development Bill.The Minister may care to advise me as to why it is that under the guidelines which were published by the Minister in relation to this legislation, once again the cost of patenting appears to be excluded as a matter which may be taken into account in working out the expenditure to be provided for companies receiving some sort of assistance under the provisions of this legislation. I am slightly concerned about the extremely wide discretion given in the legislation to the Minister to give directions to the Board. He may give directions to the Board about what is or is not a generic technology. We know that from time to time Ministers will take markedly different approaches as to what constitutes a generic technology. I think there would be wide agreement in the chamber that things such as biotechnology, electronics and information technology are clearly part and parcel of the emerging frontiers of science and technology which ought to be assisted, but from time to time undoubtedly favourites will be played by Ministers, depending on what they happen to be particularly excited about at that time. I would not like to see a situation in which some degree of uncertainty was introduced, depending on whether a particular generic technology was fashionable or not. We know that scientific disciplines and scientific areas come and go as areas of high fashion, depending on a number of circumstances, very few of which have anything to do with the intrinsic merits or otherwise of the technology concerned.The Minister has power under clause 26 of the legislation to declare `eligible activities. He has power under clause 30 to declare what are generic technologies. He has power under clause 33 (2) to request the Board to consider entering into national interest agreements in respect of projects of research and development which the Minister specifies. So the Minister is put in a very powerful position to direct the nature of funding towards particular areas of research and development. We are not proposing by way of amendment any attempt to curtail the Ministers power in this regard. However, we indicate that it is a matter we will be looking at and observing with some degree of caution over the years.As this is the first opportunity on which this particular situation has arisen, I cannot let pass clause 4 (7) of the Industry Research and Development Bill. It is the first occasion on which I have has an opportunity to talk about the construction of boards under this Government. The Board is to consist of a chairperson and certain other persons. The Bill then goes on to provide:For the purposes of this Act-(a) the Chairperson may be referred to as the Chairman or the Chairwoman, as the case requires;Frankly, the cluttering up of legislation with such absolutely pathetic nonsense as `chairman or chairwoman as the case requires really is indicative of the extent to which we are bedevilled with this distorting of the English language which is going on at the moment. As to whether the case requires some objective test of whether the person should be referred to as chairman or chairwoman really boggles the mind. Undoubtedly the Minister will be able to give appropriate directions in appropriate cases.","N/A","INDUSTRY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT BILL 1986","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/speech[1]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

314,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator PUPLICK","TI4","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A",3273,"—If the Minister is minded to provoke me on this matter, there will be even further trouble about it. The other point I make is a general point about funding of research and development. I put it clearly on the record that I believe we have swung too far away from the funding of basic and fundamental research in this country. I understand the enormous drive which is being made for relevant research to be funded-research which will yield an immediate technological fix, economic fix or scientific fix. I understand the very lengthy debates which have taken place over a number of years about the relevance of scientific research, but I think we have now taken that to extremes. We have moved away from the funding of absolutely basic and fundamental research to altogether too great an extent.I look at an article by Leon Lederman in the Scientific American in November 1984 which indicates that, while the American taxpayers spend only about 5 per cent of the cost of applied research and development on fundamental technology, that is where most of the real innovations and developments originate. I look at an article in the Australian Financial Review in November 1984, headed `Japan downgrades development, beefs up basic research. I look to the seminal research paper in the Journal of Political Economy in 1959 by Nelson, entitled `The Simple Economics of Basic Scientific Research; an article in the November 1984 issue of the New Scientist by Martin, Irvine and Turner, entitled `The Writing on the Wall for British Science; and an article in the Economic Review of March 1986 by Stoneman, entitled `Research and Development Policy in the United Kingdom. All of those articles make the point very basically that unless we are prepared to spend sufficient funds on fundamental and basic research, all the applied technology, important as it may be, nevertheless will eventually wither and die. The failure to invest in basic research, in particular the failure to invest in technology transfer as an underpinning of development and research in Australia-we will have the opportunity to discuss this by way of an amendment to the legislation in due course-seems to me to be a matter of very great significance.Finally, I would like to put on the record a number of paragraphs in an article by Donald E. Lewis from the Department of Economics of the University of Wollongong in the autumn 1986 issue of the Australian Quarterly, entitled `Swedens manufacturing sector-a modern success story. Certain paragraphs on pages 26 and 27 make the point about the Swedish Government funding of basic research and a table indicates the expenditure on research and development in Sweden compared with a number of other Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development countries. I seek leave to incorporate that material in Hansard.Leave granted.The document read as follows-The Swedish engineering sector has always been prepared to make substantial investment in research and development. Both the historical and contemporary Swedish economy, especially the engineering industries, can be characterised by high levels of investment in research and development. `Almost half of Swedens exports now consist of products from the engineering industry which, moreover has largely focused on high technology and a high level of research.10 In this sector `about 4-5 per cent of sales value goes towards research and development each year.11As shown in Table 8 Sweden has one of the highest per capita expenditures of R & D in the OECD, exceeded only by the USA, Switzerland and West Germany. Swedish expenditure per capita is more than double that of Australia (194 verses 92 US$).Furthermore, Sweden was the only OECD `country where R & D spending grew more rapidly in the 1970s than in the preceding decade.1. Total expenditure on R & D in Sweden is small by world standards. It ranks ninth amongst OECD countries and accounts for only about 1 per cent of world expenditure on R & D. Nevertheless, it invests 36 per cent more in R & D than Australia.Table 8N/AEXPENDITURE ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, 1979Gross Expenditures in...Per capita Expenditures inmillions of U.S. dollars...U.S. dollarsN/ACountryRank inOECDAmountCountryGovt.CivilianTotalRank inOECDN/AUSA...156,560USA641882521Japan...218,285Switzerland82152232Sweden...91,608Sweden171771944Australia...111,183Australia8849212N/ASource: Young, A. 1983 `Science and Technology Indicators, OECD Observer, 121, 34-38.Substantial expenditures on R & D is an important reason why Sweden has been able to specialise in medium to high level technological based products.Entrepreneurs, scientists and engineers are very knowledgeable of industrial and engineering developments (widespread knowledge of foreign languages is a big help) and like the Japanese, they are quick to imitate and utilise overseas innovations.The newly emerging robot industry illustrates the rewards of substantial investment in R & D. In 1982 Sweden was the fourth largest user of robots (behind Japan, USA and West Germany), the third largest producers of robots (accounting for 24 per cent of the European market and 7 per cent of the American market) and was the most intensive user on a per capita employment basis in the world.13 ASEA is the major, Swedish producers and has already established assembly plants in Spain, France and production facilities in Japan. Investment in R & D is continuing and $40 million (Australia) has been allocated to research on robotics, computer aided design and computer aided manufacturing during 1980/81 to 1984/85.","N/A","INDUSTRY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT BILL 1986","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/speech[1]/talk.start[4]/para","N/A","N/A"
315,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator PUPLICK","TI4","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A",3273,"—I thank the Senate. I conclude by saying that within the overall raft of measures being brought forward for the support of research and development in Australia, the Opposition welcomes these two pieces of legislation. We note the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics figures, 27 May 1986, indicating that there had been a significant increase in the private sector activity in research and development. We know that the best part of 1,000 firms so far have registered-as a firm must register under this scheme-to be participants in this financial venture. We are encouraged by that. I believe that Australian industry as a whole has been encouraged by the lead it has been given by the Minister.It would be churlish to refer at too great a length to the criticisms made by the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills about the delays in the presentation of this taxation legislation, which was first announced a year and three days ago, I think, and which has only just seen the light of day. A number of people have been confused as to exactly what the provisions of this legislation would be and there is really very little excuse for a piece of taxation legislation to take more than a year to move from the ministerial announcement to the final form in which the Parliament is able to debate and consider it. Nevertheless, we welcome these two pieces of legislation. We believe that they will make a significant contribution to Australian research and development in the years ahead. The Opposition will be pleased to vote for them and to accord them a speedy passage in the Senate.","N/A","INDUSTRY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT BILL 1986","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/speech[1]/talk.start[5]/para","N/A","N/A"
316,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator McKIERNAN","1I4","(Western Australia)","ALP","N/A",3281,"—I will not delay the Senate over long in my contribution to the discussion on these two very important Bills-the Industry Research and Development Bill 1986 and the Income Tax Assessment Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 1986. My involvement in this area is a continuing one. In fact, apart from my swearing-in as a senator, my first official words in the Senate were contained in a question to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, in regard to research and development in Australian industry. Because of the time restriction that I am placing on my speech, I will refrain from picking up many of the arguments which Senator Puplick, who preceded me in this debate, put forward. It was a very well thought out contribution. It contained a little nitpicking, but many positive parts as well. I do not know whether we can attribute all of that to what he has read, but he did quote from one excellent piece of material which is doing the rounds at the moment-a book by Barry Jones called Living By Our Wits. Hopefully, he will recommend it to his colleagues and put some more pressure on those who sit on the Opposition front bench.The two pieces of legislation on industry research and development that are before us tonight should provide a much needed shot in the arm for Australian industry. Although it has had a very great shot in the arm in recent years, particularly in regard to the 30 per cent devaluation, many of the captains of industry-some of whom are very vocal at the moment in regard to the other major debate on the fringe benefits tax legislation-have apparently been sitting on their rears and doing very little in looking at the future. They have been whingeing, whining and complaining bitterly because their lurks and perks will be taxed, but they have not been getting off their bums to undertake a little more investment, which is needed in the long term interests of this country.The legislation, as Senator Puplick mentioned, has been discussed for quite a period. A number of industry sectors have welcomed it. I dare say that other representatives of industry in the very near future will castigate it. Another point Senator Puplick mentioned very early in his contribution was the question of buying Australian products. I also take up that point very briefly and relate it to some of the discussions that took place in the Senate last night. I refer honourable senators to the arguments that the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, used in defence of the tax on perks. Nobody was able to explain to him why some captains of industry use Rolls-Royces and Mercedes-Benz and not Australian built motor vehicles. I hope Senator Puplick will join the buy Australian campaign. We should show that we have confidence in Australian industry and that our products are good enough for our captains of industry.The two pieces of legislation are aimed ostensibly at private enterprise, because private enterprise investment in research and development is at a very low level when compared with the levels in other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. We are from time to time reminded of other statistics in regard to OECD countries. In regard to interest rates, we are continually reminded of the comparison between other OECD countries and Australia. In the area of private investment in research and development, the comparisons between Australia and other countries are also noteworthy. Private spending on research and development in Australia amounts to 0.3 per cent of the gross domestic product, compared with an average figure of over three times that amount-0.98 per cent to be precise-in other OECD countries. Between the years 1973-74 and 1981-82 that represents a decline in real terms of 40 per cent. Recent statistics show that the figures have picked up in recent months and years, but they have not yet picked up enough. The two pieces of legislation that are before us this evening-I hope that, with the agreement of both sides of the chamber, they will be passed-will provide that much needed and necessary shot in the arm.Of course, other areas of research and development must be addressed. I refer to the direct area in which governments become involved. The Industry Research and Development Bill 1986 addresses the areas of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the tertiary side. Much needed drive and assistance has been provided in that area which hopefully will be in the long term interests of Australia. If this country is not to decline-and I do not like to use the term, but it has been used-into a banana republic, we will have to take some long term investment decisions. The Government is showing that it is willing to make those long term decisions, decisions that show confidence in the future of the nation. It is now up to private enterprise to join us and show what can be done in a consensus atmosphere. The events of last weekend in one of the rural towns show that consensus is not yet dead. I commend both pieces of legislation to the Senate.","N/A","INDUSTRY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT BILL 1986","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
317,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator VIGOR","OT7","(South Australia)","AD","N/A",3282,"—We are debating a very important issue for Australias future. The two Bills that we are debating tonight-the Industry Research and Development Bill and the Income Tax Assessment Amendment (Research and Development) Bill-will offer an incentive to private industry to get into the act in terms of doing research in Australia. I will cite some figures which show that we are not very good in this area of doing research in industry. Currently there is world-wide recognition of the need for research and development, particularly in the high technology areas.Japan has a number of high priority programs, handled by its Ministry for Technology, which give priority to specific types of technology. This legislation is the first in Australia actually to recognise specialised technologies. Japan has a program to deal with highly parallel computers. We have no programs for developing computers in Australia. We do not offer any real help to people who are trying to develop systems. These Bills may give a boost to some of our local industries which currently have been dependent on programs which have been quite good, such as the management and investment companies and venture capital programs, and programs which have been developed within specialised organisations such as the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the universities. But Japan has gone a lot further than us. It is actually looking at developing 14 science cities or technopolies. These areas will bring together people who are interested in general research and who will be able to work together to develop new products.I join Senator Puplick in making a call to the Government not to be blinded by the practicalities of technology and to take heed of the need for fundamental research if we are to produce practical and practicable technologies and practical products which are innovative enough to be able to attract world markets. Australia currently has a considerable problem due to the neglect of this area over the years. I will not dwell on the trade balance which is currently in a desperate situation. The rural commodity markets need to be developed with a lot more value added products, both in farming and in mining where we could process some of our minerals and energy to develop products which could be directly marketed in both developing and developed countries. We are just not doing enough in this area and I am not certain that these two Bills go far enough in terms of recognising the stages which must be gone through from taking a product from a glint in the eye of the inventor through to something which can be sold on world markets.Australia has a declining share of world trade, particularly in the manufacturing and high tech areas, and I hope that if sufficient money is pushed into these areas these Bills will have the effect of building up our credibility. In 1981-82 Australian firms imported more than 98 per cent of their technical know-how, 75 per cent of this being payments to overseas parent companies or subsidiary companies for patent rights. These were transfers of technology, the research being done overseas, not in Australia, and then being applied as a production process here. This does not produce a good employment climate and currently we have around 10 per cent unemployment on average with very high spots in certain areas. In the manufacturing industry we are losing around 15,000 jobs a year which, I hope, this type of program will allow us to regain.In the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development examiners report of 1983 on Australias research and development problems, the examiners pointed out that there was a relatively poor investment in privately funded research and development. In fact, our investment was less than a quarter of that of similar OECD countries. Indeed, in those countries with similar populations an average of 0.93 per cent of gross domestic product was invested in private research and development. In 1968-69 Australian private investment was 0.48 per cent and this fell to 0.21 per cent in 1981-82-in fact that was just a quarter of the 0.93 per cent of comparable countries. It was also noted that Australias publicly funded research had declined from 1.3 per cent of GDP in 1968-69 to 0.8 per cent in 1981-82. However, the interesting aspect was that this compared favourably with the average of similar OECD countries, which had an average of 0.76 per cent. So it was mainly in the area of private investment-which these two Bills address-that we had a considerable shortfall.From this report, which made quite far reaching recommendations on directions of Australian research and development, the Government has instituted a review of publicly funded research, looking at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, which is one of our most effective research organisations and also at industry-based R and D. Through the reorganisation of those bodies, we are actually turning the corner, I hope.However, I must reiterate what Senator Puplick said and beg the Government not to throw out the baby with the bathwater. I urge the Government not to try to get CSIRO to produce small individual products. It is extremely important that we continue with fundamental research because that research gives us a language with which we can absorb ideas from overseas. It also allows us to bring technology into Australia effectively and gives us a group of people who can effectively answer questions for people in industry.I also believe that we must look very closely at co-ordinating our research in Australia in these areas, particularly research being carried out through rural bodies and funded by industry levies, and shift some of the funds in those areas towards market research because we are failing to produce products that are attractive to the world. We must develop from our primary produce high value derivative products which are of a very high quality and hence much in demand in the developed world. We need a manufacturing industry which understands the market it is addressing and we need to go out aggressively to export to that market. This program must be matched with a sensible program of export incentives. The export marketing development grants system is not adequate to complement this program. In this area there is a need for specialised technology export programs.I wish to look at the different stages of research because they will be relevant to amendments I shall move to both these Bills. The OECD examiners report recognises seven stages of research. Firstly, they look at educational experiments which are basically repeating results from overseas, part learning and part technology transfer. We need to have that funded and the Government seems to have totally ignored it in terms of the funding available in these Bills. We will move an amendment to make technology transfer a part of the processes which can be funded and which are regarded as allowable activities. The second item is the pure or basic research which is driven by curiosity and the goal of which is to increase knowledge and understanding. Generally that is carried out in universities or places of that type in a society such as ours. Thirdly, there is policy driven research directed by specific needs or areas which the Government specifies and also by industrial development which specifies the areas in which we concentrate. This legislation is relevant to grants and deductions for generic technology, national interest projects and specialised projects. This area is handled very effectively by CSIRO and other applied research organisations.We then move to applied research which is the discovery of ideas and which starts the search for practical applications as well as for problems which need solutions. This is an area which is well covered by the Governments legislation. Then we move to engineering and design of a product. The Government wants to cut out much of this area because it is also cutting out market studies to find out what type of product we want to handle. We will move an amendment to include the interrelation between the market study and the development of the product. Another item is production and process engineering, which the Government has recognised, and that is well handled. There is also need for the marketing and service follow-up, which this legislation does not address. I will move amendments to both of the Bills during the Committee stage, and will comment further on the reasons for these amendments at that time.","N/A","INDUSTRY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT BILL 1986","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
318,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator WATSON","VJ4","(Tasmania)","LP","N/A",3284,"—The two Bills before the Senate-the Industry Research and Development Bill 1986 and the Income Tax Assessment Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 1986-have the support of the Opposition. May I describe them as typical Liberal Party initiatives to industry. I believe the incentives offered to research and development will go some way in encouraging both investment and innovation. The key word is really innovation, because research is not really enough. Dr Whitton, Director of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation Institute of Industrial Technology, in a paper to the Australian Academy of Science, pointed out with regard to innovation:. . . the whole sequence of steps from research through development, design, construction and production, to marketing. Especially, it involved the commercial exploitation of technology. It is only by the completion of the innovation sequence, that research can lead to generation of wealth; if we only do research, we will not produce wealth.Dr Whitton went on to say:Britain had concentrated on research, and not on innovation; its record of converting research results into commercial use is poor.He said that was why the position of Britain in world trade was falling. In the past the situation in Australia has not been much different. Australia has achieved world-wide recognition in many areas of science. Our universities are held in high regard and we have a wealth of internationally regarded researchers and scientists in universities and government laboratories. Unfortunately, many have left this country because there is not enough scope or money for future development and achievement. There is surprisingly little transfer of technology from laboratory to full scale production in this country. Australia and Sweden make about the same level of contribution to world scientific publications; yet Sweden produces four times the number of patents and it is regarded as a leader amongst those who have a share in the worlds technological property. Too often research of great significance is made known to the world instead of being protected by patents. As a result, Australian industry loses its competitive edge. Sir Frank Espie has also pointed out that the lack of venture capital and the widespread lack of management skills and commercial experience amongst entrepreneurs in existing enterprises are the two major constraints in the creation of viable new high technology enterprises in Australia.Thus, while I commend the Governments proposal to introduce the 150 per cent tax concession as a means of encouraging research and development and its attempt through the Income Tax Assessment Amendment (Research and Development) Bill to make research funds available to suitable projects that would not be eligible for a tax concession, I am concerned that more must be done to ensure that research is carried through to production and the marketing stage. It is only by completion of the whole sequence that research can lead to generation of wealth. In other words, the Government must take action to ensure that more results from local research are worth exploiting and that industry has the skills, the finance and the motivation to take such research through to full commercial utilisation.Because my time is limited, I wish to raise another issue. I find it rather difficult to reconcile the Governments position, especially in relation to these two Bills which I commend. The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, appears rather determined to run the Australian textile manufacturers out of the country insofar as he is foreshadowing a move away from quotas. Since mid-1980 over $570m has been invested in the textile, clothing and footwear industries in upgrading buildings and introducing `state of the art technology in machinery. The clothing, textile and footwear manufacturers have done everything that was expected of them under the plan due to expire in 1988; yet their future is now in jeopardy. Not only is their share of the market declining under the plan but also imports are expected to increase to 28 per cent over the two-year period from 1985 to 1987 on the basis of maximum utilisation of quota.My concern is that we must ensure that any change is a controlled change. The emphasis must be on change. A tariff only regime is difficult to police because, for example, there are valuation problems. Everyone knows that business people in Singapore and elsewhere are prepared to give a receipt for any value that the importer likes to nominate. Another problem is that Australias spending on the clothing, textile and footwear industry has declined quite markedly to only 6.5c in the dollar. Furthermore, locally-produced textiles as a category command only 30 per cent of the total Australian market. On a 50 per cent tariff rate theory it is estimated that 50,000 jobs will be lost. The Industries Assistance Commission suggests that it will be only 20,000. I believe, and the industry believes, that this is a gross under-estimation. In fact, there will be massive social and economic dislocation, particularly in non-metropolitan towns. Change is acknowledged, but a predictable rate is also needed. Australian manufacturing must be given the opportunity to be internationally competitive, while consumers also must be given the opportunity of purchasing a wide range of goods at competitive prices. I am making these comments in the context of these Bills because I believe that by the 1990s technological innovations will be in place in Australia which will enable Australian industry to compete with the present low labour cost industries of Asia. But we must at least have an industry left in Australia to implement this new technology that is expected to be around by the 1990s.I remind the Senate that while the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) views the Australian textile, clothing and footwear manufacturing market as one area for increased Chinese participation, Chinese products already dominate most of the clothing categories, and their share is increasing quite markedly. Are we prepared to sacrifice Australian jobs? I will cite one simple statistic which I would like every member of the Senate to think of. A single worker in an Australian manufacturing operation receives more when he goes on holidays each year than his counterpart in China receives over a full five-year period. That is the difference. Australian industry is vulnerable to disruptive trade practices. The United States of America and the European Economic Community both maintain quantitative restraints. If we move away from the present regimes, as has been foreshadowed by the Minister, Australia will run into the problem of a loss of industry. I believe the Government will encounter the current dilemma that President Reagan faces. He has open conflict within the Congress and the Senate because on one hand the international community is demanding greater access to the American market, causing conflict with Americas international trading aspirations, and on the other hand the domestic economy is unable to adapt to those sorts of changes. I made a commitment that I would speak for no longer than ten minutes. I will stick to that commitment. The Bills have our support, and I wish them a speedy passage.","N/A","INDUSTRY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT BILL 1986","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
319,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator SHEIL","BJ4","(Queensland)","NP","N/A",3286,"—The Industry Research and Development Bill 1986 and the Income Tax Assessment Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 1986 are designed to give incentives to investment, and to encourage innovation in research and development. It is an old axiom that anything a government wants more of it subsidises and anything it wants less of it taxes. These Bills are designed to provide less tax and cause a distortion, taking investment into research and development away from economic realities and commercial considerations. Even though we are not opposing these Bills they are inconsistent with the policies that have been followed for some time by the Government in a couple of areas. One area I cite is the pharmaceutical industry, which has been the subject of such stringent policies by successive governments over the years that virtually all research and development in the pharmaceutical field has been driven out of Australia. I will not belabour the point because of the ecumenicalism that exists in the Senate at the moment.The other area of inconsistency that I point to is the film industry. Any investment in the film industry has attracted an enormous taxation advantage over many years, yet here we have Bills which restrict a taxation deduction merely to companies. In other words, anyone else who wants to invest in research and development, such as single people, partnerships or sole traders, will not attract this taxation deduction. That is a point that I would like the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) to answer in the interests of shortening the debate, as we have a restricted time in which to speak.The sole trader, the partnership and the single person would not be the only ones who would be disadvantaged. A small company may have a chance of doing research and development in an area for which it does not have the finance and it may wish to attract that finance from a rich uncle or somebody else, but only the company would attract the taxation advantage. The individual who gave the money to that company would not attract the deduction. I think we should be able to do as much for commercial research and development in Australia in the areas of industry and medicine and in all the other areas as we do for our films. I think this could generate a whole area of industrial and medical research that would be of as much advantage to Australia as Crocodile Dundee and all the other marvellous films that have been mentioned here tonight.","N/A","INDUSTRY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT BILL 1986","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/speech[5]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

I do not think I have to digress down every path which was followed in the course of the debate. Three specific things were put to me. Senator Puplick asked whether patent fees paid in the course of a research and development project were covered by the scheme. The answer is yes. If there is a patenting process at the end of a program of research and development, he is right in saying that those patenting costs would not be allowable. The reason for that is that in legislation of this kind one has to confine the parameters of research and development. I think Senator Puplick is concerned about a general problem relating to patenting and patenting costs. I understand that; I agree with that. It is a distinct problem as far as we are concerned.Senator Vigor-I think we will come to it in the Committee stage of this debate-has a number of proposals which, however desirable from the point of view of a personal feeling of warmth, would cause this scheme to be immensely costly by extensions of that kind. I think it is important that we confine the research and development process to what it is and not extend it beyond the process, the patenting at the end of the process being a step in the commercialisation of a research and development process.I think the only other point that Senator Puplick was concerned about was a warning about the apparent wide discretion given to the Minister in respect of designating generic technologies in particular and a warning about fashionableness and all those things. I accept all that. Some discretion is given to the Minister. I suppose one only substitutes the degree of fashion of the populous as represented in the Senate for the degree of fashion prescribed by the Minister. I do not know whether that produces very effective results but I concede that it is a wide discretion.Senator Sheil, the authentic voice of the National Party of Australia in the chamber tonight, had a couple of comments to make about this legislation. As I understand it, he was concerned particularly as to why the tax incentive applies only to companies.","N/A","INDUSTRY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT BILL 1986","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/speech[6]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

That is the warmest endorsement that I have ever had from the honourable senator in the whole of my political career and I appreciate it. If one looks at the area of research and development one sees that governments spent a lot of money on it right throughout the 1970s and all that happened to private sector research and development was that it went down and down, and that is because the incentives were wrong. The incentives in this legislation are applied, as the honourable senator has said, only to companies and that is because we do not want this scheme to be discredited by the other side of the coin which we had in the 1970s. As research and development went down tax avoidance and creative accounting went up. Maybe those two industries-tax avoidance and creative accounting-have an endearing charm for the honourable senator; I do not know. But that is what we have to be very careful about in respect of this legislation. That is why we have provided for a system of registration of companies which seek the benefit of the tax concession and that is why we have excluded sole traders and partnerships. I do not think it is much to the detriment of the genuine research and development community in Australia. I know that 100 flowers might bloom out there but so might 100 tax avoidance schemes and we want to be very careful about that. I do not have much more to say about the honourable senators view of the matter. I suppose that our priorities are different.

Our particular concern in this area of definition is that of systems and processes which are a potential area for export of high technology and have, in fact, been ignored by the Government. We believe that it is extremely important that help should be given to people who wish to develop systems and processes within the ambit of this Bill. The first Bill we are dealing with, the Industry Research and Development Bill or the Governments industry research and development scheme, is complementary to the 150 per cent tax legislation, and a lot of the definitions are complementary one with the other.However, in the GIRD scheme the Government has said that the only companies which will be eligible to receive the benefits of these grants are in fact companies which are involved in the manufacture of goods, mining operations or operations for recovery of naturally occurring petroleum and natural gas, construction operations relating to building or works, the production of software for computers or for similar equipment, or activities in respect of which a declaration under section 26, which is a ministerial declaration, are eligible activities. Only companies which carry on these eligible activities will be able to claim a grant under this scheme. We believe that there is a need for us to recognise that a number of Australian companies, such as Kimberley Seeds in Western Australia, export systems for reclaiming land and for growing trees. A number of people install factories and have very innovative ways of doing so. We would like to see those people covered. People who are developing systems, say for manufacturing or systems for robotics or processes for chemical production of goods will be covered by this Act if the amendment which I have moved is accepted.Amendment agreed to.","N/A","INDUSTRY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT BILL 1986","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

When a person applies to the Industrial Research and Development Board and explains his research and development project to members of the Board they would say: `Look, this element of the proposed piece of research and development arises from a technology transfer from the United States and is part of our cost of doing the complete piece of research and development.

I believe that the case for investment of public funds in technology transfer is absolutely overwhelming. When one looks at a number of the fields of very high technology and high technology development it will always be the case that 95 per cent, 96 per cent or 97 per cent of critical research is carried out overseas and that the transfer back into Australia and into the Australian manufacturing sector of research and development results which are achieved overseas will be absolutely fundamental to the growth and development of Australian science and technology and research and development in particular.Those who were privileged to hear Sir Gustav Nosal address the forum that was arranged here last week will have heard Sir Gustav at length on the question of technology transfer. I believe that the case that has been made out for the inclusion of technology transfer as a research and development activity is a powerful one. I am certainly inclined to accept the amendment put forward by Senator Vigor, as far as that is concerned. I am a little unclear as to the way in which the clause would read, simply as a result of the way in which the amendment is drawn. If I am correct, it would mean that it would read:`research and development activities means systematic investigation or experimentation activities-(a) that involve innovation, technology transfer into Australia, or technical risk.If my understanding of the way in which that clause would read is correct, perhaps I may say, on behalf of the Opposition, that we would be inclined to accept that amendment.","N/A","INDUSTRY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT BILL 1986","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Looking at the definition as a whole-`research and development activities means systematic investigation or experimentation activities that involve certain things; `innovation or technical risk . . . the object of which is new knowledge et cetera-if one includes there after `innovation the words, `technology transfer into Australia, it must be understood that the process of research and development activity inevitably, as I would read the current definition, contains an element of technology transfer. If one puts a scientist on the staff of the company, that involves an element of technology transfer. If one brings in a piece of knowledge from outside, it involves an element of technology transfer. But if one were to rejig this definition so that technology transfer into Australia were seen as an integral part, and an important, spelt out part, of the process of research and development, I think that one would run grave risks of abuse of the legislation, because one would run the risk that people would have an enormously significant piece of research and development done overseas, which is precisely where one does not want it done, and technologically transferred into Australia under the provisions of the expanded definition. We are very cautious about that, and I think, with respect, the Committee ought to be, as well.","N/A","INDUSTRY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT BILL 1986","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We should not accept that research carried out overseas can be brought in holus-bolus at the full price of that research. It is a matter of definition.

340,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator PUPLICK","TI4","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A",3289,"—I am not in the process of taking on the run whether Senator Vigor is or is not withdrawing his amendment. In terms of amendments being put forward, there comes a stage at which, acting in the best of goodwill and good faith, my inclination is to continue to support the inclusion of the words proposed in Senator Vigors amendment. However, I am not prepared to stand around for the rest of the night on shifting sands as far as Australian Democrats amendments are concerned. Nevertheless, to address the points that Senator Button has raised, if there is, indeed, an inevitability of technology transfer in any research and development program-I accept that there is-I am not persuaded that simply saying that in the legislation makes the position qualitatively different, one way or the other.If Senator Buttons problem is that a large scale cost will be involved in terms of the transfer of major pieces of technology or major costs of technology transfer into Australia, I am not persuaded that that is, in fact, a major problem, because of the Ministers discretionary powers under the legislation, particularly under clause 20 (1). That sub-section states:The Minister may, from time to time, by notice in writing delivered to the Chairperson and expressed to be given under this section, give directions to the Board with respect to the policies and practices to be followed by the Board in the performance of its functions, and the exercise of its powers, under this Act (including, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the policies and practices to be followed by the Board with respect to the entering into by the Board of discretionary grant agreements, generic technology agreements or national interest agreements and the provisions to be included in such agreements), and the Board shall comply with any such directions that are in force.I believe, therefore, that under the whole of clause 20, which is headed `Guidelines for policies and practices of Board, the Minister has sufficient power to prevent abuses of the legislation, and I am inclined to persist with support of Senator Vigors amendment-if, indeed, it remains Senator Vigors amendment in the circumstances.","N/A","INDUSTRY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT BILL 1986","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I might die of boredom after a few more of his interjections, and then he would have another Minister, and that Minister might not be as diligent as I am in exercising such discretion. With respect, it is not a good argument from a legislative point of view. Senator Vigor wants to include the same amendment in the 150 per cent tax incentive Bill, the Income Tax Assessment Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 1986. He is so concerned about what multinationals might do to this country. Imagine the operation of that provision under the tax incentive Bill. That Bill is market led. Matters are very much within the control of the company concerned. The honourable senator has given us a serve tonight about the evils of the multinationals. They could bring in massive amounts of transferred technology under that legislation, sell it within Australia, and make a squillion out of it, largely at the Australian taxpayers expense. Is that what Senator Vigor wants? That would be the effect of his amendment to the other legislation and he says that he would make this amendment here in the interests of consistency.I had discussions with Senator Vigor about his amendments, as he well knows, and I agreed to two of them. I agreed to two of them because I thought that they were thoughtful and intelligent amendments. But I appeal to the honourable senator to realise that these other amendments will make this legislation look like a dogs breakfast. That does not reverberate to the credit of anybody in this chamber including the mover of the amendments. One does not want that said about the legislation after it is ultimately passed.There is an inconsistency in what the honourable senator is seeking to do and the arguments he is advancing in support of it. The industrial research and development legislation, I concede, is very tight. It is designed to be pretty specific about the directions of research and development under grants from that Board. We are not in the business of social welfare here, and none of us ought to be, in terms of research and development done in Australia. We are in the business of providing an efficient, well directed scheme. If we make it sloppy around the edges we might get some comfort over a drink with some accountant on a pleasant Friday night, but we would not get any comfort from the research and development community in Australia. I sincerely put it to the honourable senator that this amendment is misdirected in that sense. I ask the honourable senator what he will say about this amendment when the Income Tax Assessment Amendment (Research and Development) Bill reaches the Committee stage. I think that the best way of achieving consistency between the two pieces of legislation is for neither amendment to be moved.","N/A","INDUSTRY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT BILL 1986","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[9]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

I suppose that taking these things on the run is part of the fun of the game. Nevertheless, the point which has to be made about the Industry Research and Development Bill is that it seems to have largely grown out of the criticisms which were made of the original 150 per cent tax concession legislation that there was insufficient provision being made for the position of small business and for small innovative companies. Therefore, it seems to me that, since they are the principal beneficiaries of the grants for industry research and development scheme, one of the areas in which they should be encouraged is in the significant area of technology transfer. I am totally unimpressed with the Ministers dire warning-apres moi le deluge-that there will never be another significant, consistent, intelligent and alert Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, and that it is all downhill from here on in. If that were the case when we came to matters such as telephone tapping, it would be interesting to see whether Senator Button pursued that argument with the same degree of vigour and the same degree of enthusiasm as he will doubtless bring to the trust me syndrome which will occur.

I am informed that the initial approach to the Government was negative-that is, it was not possible to enter into those joint ventures inasmuch as the Australian Meat and Live-Stock Research and Development Corporation is 50 per cent funded by government funds and hence was outlawed because of the proviso that research and development activities funded by government grants are excluded from the concession contained in this Bill. Following further discussions between the Cattle Council and the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Kerin) and Senator Button, as the Minister responsible for this area, the Cattle Council was given to understand that it was not the case that the Corporation was excluded from those joint ventures. In fact, the Department of Primary Industry specifically wants these types of ventures to take place.There seems to be some confusion on this matter.

Where that first $10 million has been written-off under the concession, the balance may attract any other relevant deductions.The amendments will provide for depreciation deductions only to be allowed in the foregoing circumstances in respect of plant expenditure not written-off under the concession.This will ensure certainty in the application of the law in the particular circumstances and will generally be to the advantage of eligible companies.But for the amendments, it would be open to question as to which other provisions may apply. Also, if, for example, the general mining provisions of the income tax law were applied, write-off of the plant would be over the lesser of 10 years of the life of the mine, instead of over a maximum of 5 years under the accelerated depreciation provisions of the law.The amendments will also ensure that, where plant is used for other than research and development activities and is eligible for depreciation deductions, those deductions will become available from the time the R&D concession would otherwise have applied in respect of the plant. I commend the amendments to the committee.Amendments agreed to.","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT AMENDMENT (RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT) BILL 1986","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[1]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

Basically, my concern is that the Government has a requirement that before people shall get the 150 per cent tax rebate, they shall invest more than $50,000, if the research is done on their own premises, on research activities or research related activities. There is a formula which phases in that amount from $20,000 to $50,000. We feel that small organisations should be given the benefit of doing research on their own premises without subcontracting that research to an external body, which is allowed under another clause of the Bill. We propose that the starting point for being able to claim the 1.5 per cent be from $2,000 upwards, as we believe that this will cover a number of quite small projects and would not place too much of a burden on the Commissioner of Taxation or on the registering body.","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT AMENDMENT (RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT) BILL 1986","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I do not believe that research and development to the amount of $2,000 is likely to be carried out on the premises of some company. The deduction which is available to any small company which undertakes research under the value of $20,000 is, in our opinion, adequately provided for by reading proposed new section 73b (13), regarding contracted expenditure, with section 73a (6), of the principal Act. Expenditure under $20,000, in terms of expenditure by small and start-up companies, is deductible-if it is done in an approved research institution and contracted out-at the rate of 150 per cent. We therefore do not regard this as an appropriate amendment.I am conscious of the time constraints and of the Ministers problem in getting this legislation to the House of Representatives. Apart from a couple of matters which I am sure Senator Vigor will want to raise regarding amendment No. 5 which he has circulated, I indicate at this stage that, of the 11 amendments circulated in the name of the Australian Democrats, it is not the intention of the Opposition to support any of them.","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT AMENDMENT (RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT) BILL 1986","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

So I will not be pursuing those amendments. I am, however, concerned about amendment No. 11. I want to make a point about that amendment and I seek an undertaking from the Government. My major concern is that the Australian people should benefit from this legislation and the grants which come under it. At page 18 of the Bill, clause 7 in relation to products being sold states:(a) On normal commercial terms; or(b) in a manner that is for the benefit of the Australian economy.I see no reason why one should have in the clause `in the course of normal commercial activity. I believe that any of the activities that should be carried out should be for the benefit of the Australian economy, if grants or tax allowances are to be given to these people. I seek an undertaking from the Minister on this matter. There are three matters involved. One has to do with partial use of the plant and people getting a partial benefit as a result of partial use of a plant; there is the Australian benefit; and there is the problem of a better definition of what a pilot plant can be used for.","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT AMENDMENT (RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT) BILL 1986","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In regard to amendment No. 11 I make the point that Senator Vigor supported this amendment on the basis that the Government, as he put it, would be handing out grants to people and they ought to be for the benefit of the Australian community. He is referring to the wrong piece of legislation. This is the tax incentives legislation. There is no handing out of anything by the Government. It is a market led scheme.

In particular, it is very important, if we are to produce proper products for overseas markets which are relevant to those markets, and if we are to carry out research to develop those products, that we should carry out proper market research, market testing and market development. I do not wish market research, testing and development to be specifically excluded from the ambit of this Bill. It is also very important that we produce quality products and, if we are doing research into quality control, I believe that that quality control should be able to be claimed as a deductible expense for tax purposes. I am not talking about quality control at the production stage, but quality control during the research stage and the setting up of quality control procedures.We also have here a statement that cosmetic and stylistic changes to process or production methods should not be allowed. As Senator Puplick has pointed out, this seems to be in contradiction to some of the attitudes that the Government has taken in the car industry in terms of grants in that area. It seems to me that a considerable amount of research can be done in terms of better ergonomic suitability of the products we have and that is probably one of the major things that will determine whether our products will be successful in foreign markets. One of the final two paragraphs relates to computer software. I believe that if people develop computer programs or software in the course of research programs for either monitoring or recording information associated with the research, that should be a claimable expense under this scheme.

If honourable senators want a wall to wall system of industry assistance at the taxpayers expense they will vote for Senator Vigors amendment because there would be nothing that most thoughtful companies in Australia do that would not be covered by the research and development tax incentive scheme. Marketing, market research, testing, market development, stylistic changes-all those are things which any company worth its salt would do in the normal course of its business. Research and development is not necessarily something which any company would do in the normal course of business; it is something to be encouraged by this legislation. The distinction between research and development and marketing and so on is very important in that regard. The costs of this scheme would be prohibitive if Senator Vigors words were included. The amendment would be of benefit to some companies but of great detriment to the amount of research and development done in Australia. The same applies to paragraph (d). The Government could not accept this amendment.","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT AMENDMENT (RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT) BILL 1986","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I think the people who donate to so-called benevolent institutions should know that from now on as a result of this amendment their donations can be used and will be used for that purpose.

Under the arrangements that we had before, benevolent institutions which provided cars or accommodation for anyone in the course of their duty in providing a service to the community were exempt from this tax. The people we were worried about were people such as executives who were provided 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with cars to drive around in. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) said previously that we would look at compensating organisations for the services provided in the course of their duties, but we did not believe that charities in the community should be able to provide these sorts of things tax free any more than anyone else.We are accepting the amendment. This amendment gives people carte blanche in that area. If honourable senators opposite are right, if no one abuses the system and if everything is okay, fair enough; it will not affect anybody.

They are concerned about the effect of the fringe benefits tax upon the operation of their system. We have therefore moved this second amendment to pick up a number of organisations, not least of which are the Catholic schools of Australia and, indeed, the other non-government schools.I also believe that there are other charitable organisations, and I listened to the list that Senator Haines read out.

409,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator VANSTONE","7E4","(South Australia)","LP","N/A",3299,"—Tonight I wish to raise the matter of appointments to public office. Many people wish to make points with respect to appointments to public office. The last time I recall such comments being made in this chamber they referred to the Constitutional Commission and the failure of the Government to take the opportunity to appoint a significant number of women to that Commission. I do not believe that all appointments to public office in statutory authorities and commissions should be political neuters. I quite accept that there are occasions when people who have acquired political skills from either side should have the skills that they have acquired used in some other area to serve the community. In the United Kingdom such appointments are very common but in the halls surrounding this chamber-referred to by some as the corridors of power but which might otherwise be referred to as the whirlpools of rumour-rumours have started to fly. The question has been raised of impending government appointments and who will go where. In particular, rumours relate to the person whom some describe as the arch priest of spontaneous moral indignation. This person is also sometimes referred to as the expert of predetermined moral outrage. This person, who took 20 years to decide he was in the wrong Party, is none other than Senator Chipp.Senator Chipp coined the phrase: `We should keep the bastards honest. Speculation is now mounting that Senator Chipp is about to sell, or has already sold, his birthright in that respect. Rumour has it that his time has come and that, within six or 12 months-honourable senators can place various bets depending on the period that they put on it-Senator Chipp will retire. I raise the matter of rumours in the Senate because I think Senator Chipp should know that these rumours are circulating about him, and, accordingly, he will then have an opportunity publicly to clear the air with respect to these rumours and to put the situation straight. I think he should be telling us whether he wants to retire, and he should be telling us when. Will he retire before the next election or will he wait until after the next election in the hope that he gets back; retire a month, two months or six months after that and have a casual vacancy that ensures that we have an Australian Democrat in the Senate for just a little longer than most of us would like to see?I am sure that Senator Chipp will take the opportunity to respond to these comments at a later stage. But having heard the rumours I turned my mind to exactly what sort of position he may be interested in. Of course, he would not be interested in political patronage because back in 1983 he made a very nice speech about the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and indicated that he did not want to return to the bad old days of jobs for the boys. Some other people have been so unkind as to suggest that he will do endorsements for private companies. The one that has been suggested to me is the Wrigleys chewing gum company because, as his behaviour in this place indicates, he must be a very good customer. Other suggestions have been that Sir Nicholas Shehadies appointment is coming to a close and that Senator Chipp might like to move off to the Special Broadcasting Service. Perhaps he would like a position on the Board of Qantas Airways Ltd or Trans Australia Airlines or the National Library of Australia. Perhaps when the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is formed-if it is-Senator Chipp would like a position there.There are numerous positions that Senator Chipp could have: I am sure that he would be interested in a position on the Film Censorship Board or on the Australian Science and Technology Council. All these areas that I mention relate to areas of Senator Chipps interest. Perhaps he would like a position on the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation or its advisory council. Perhaps the Commission for the Future would provide an interesting sideline. It is pointless to go on and speculate through the whole list of government appointments that could come up in the relatively near future and which Senator Chipp could accept were the offer to be made. If a deal has been done between Senator Chipp and the Government for a particular appointment some would say that it makes what is referred to as the Gair affair and the night of the long prawns spring back into the minds of all Australians. We all know that some, if not all, of the other Democrats are hovering around the Democrats throne; so presumably they are keen to see him go. I take this opportunity to air these rumours-namely, that Senator Chipp is about to be bought off by the Government with a plush job--","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

412,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator NEWMAN","BE4","(Tasmania)","LP","N/A",3300,"—I rise to speak tonight on a matter of concern to my electorate-namely, the threat to the airline services to the Bass Strait islands. The Minister for Aviation (Mr Peter Morris) announced recently the adoption by government of an aviation cost recovery policy plan to apply from 1 July 1986 for the use of aviation facilities and services provided by the Federal Government. Airlines of Tasmania Pty Ltd, which flies regularly to the Bass Strait islands and the west coast and north west of Tasmania, is facing a huge increase as a result of Federal Government action which it can ill afford. This airline is a small commuter airline which carried approximately 38,000 passengers in 1984-85 and a modest profit has been expected for the first time this year. The airline already pays $60,000 per annum for the use of airports, registration of planes, et cetera.As a consequence of the Ministers decision the charges for this little airline will go from $60,000 to over $150,000 in the first year. This amount of $150,000 is the amount which will be due after allowance of a $2m subsidy package to help country commuter airlines during the transition to the new charging arrangements. Airlines of Tasmania will expect to receive its share of the $2m which is to be distributed between 29 commuter airlines in Australia; that is an average of only $68,000 each. In 1987, therefore, it will be expected to pay approximately $150,000. In 1988, with the temporary assistance removed, the charges will go to $340,000. Let us survey that situation again. Airlines of Tasmania is being expected to move from $60,000 to $340,000 in just two years. That is a jump of 466.6 per cent in charges over two years. Only a government without any understanding of small business would impose such sudden increases in governmental charges on small businesses. I am talking about a business with an annual turnover of less than $3m. The company has claimed that it is becoming a tax collection agency for the Government.I remind the Government that it is not just the little airline that will suffer from this sudden huge imposition of extra charges. The people of Flinders and King Islands have no other alternative means of transport off the islands but air. The people of Flinders Island are totally dependent on Airlines of Tasmania Pty Ltd for regular transport to hospital, the doctor, the dentist, schools, stock and station agents, shops et cetera. The telephone calls to the Tasmanian mainland are subscriber trunk dialling calls and it is interesting to note that even Launceston Airport in the meteorological report which was released today is described as an isolated provincial airport. How much more isolated are the people of the Bass Strait islands? They will obviously have to face increased fares in the region of 5 per cent to 7 per cent. The Independent Air Fares Committee which sets fares is duty bound to include these costs in its calculations. There is no possibility that they can be absorbed by the airline. If numbers of passengers drop as a result of the increase in air fares, so too will the frequency of services have to be reduced, thus increasing the isolation of the islanders. As if the increase in costs is not bad enough, the islanders need their only airstrip upgraded.It is ironic that in my first visit to Flinders Island since becoming a senator a few weeks ago, one of the primary concerns of the islanders was the need for the upgrading and night lighting of the airstrip at Whitemark. These people are entirely dependent upon air travel, but have been trying in vain to have their runway resheeted. They need night lighting which now is possible since the introduction of hydro-electric power to the island which would enable the local hills to be lit at night. Night lighting would be invaluable in enabling existing services to be more flexible and to enable better utilisation of the flying hours and the available aircraft. It goes without saying that it would assist greatly in the constant air-sea rescues which take place in Bass Strait and also in the service of the Flying Doctor. The local hospital on the island covers cases of small emergencies and medical cases. All maternity cases and serious casualties are evacuated to the Tasmanian mainland.Considerable amounts of freight are taken by small commuter airlines to and from the islands. The freight will also be required to carry the increased charges generated by the Government. Speedy carriage of perishables for consumption on the island and freight of seafoods away from the islands is imperative. I remind the Government that these increases come on the heels of the withdrawal last year of the 10 per cent subsidy on air fares from Tasmania to the mainland. The islanders can thus justifiably claim to have been doubly disadvantaged. While I can applaud attempts to reduce the costs of government expenditure and trust that the Government will make serious attempts to reduce the size of its deficit, I call on the Government to reconsider the means by which these charges will be implemented. Bearing in mind the isolation of the islanders and their dependence on air transport, I ask the Government to look once again at the speed at which these new impositions will be placed on the very small commuter airlines in isolated areas.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
413,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator REID","VI4","(Australian Capital Territory)","LP","N/A",3301,"—I wish to refer tonight to the plight of many in the Australian Public Service who are in the category of being redeployed and the difficulties they face in obtaining other employment. I am not for one minute suggesting that it is an easy problem for management in the Public Service, but I want to stress the problems of those who find themselves in this situation. It has happened to a large number of people in recent times. It covers a number of departments that I know of. As I said, I am not suggesting that the departments are not trying to solve the problem. I ask that the Minister responsible for the Public Service take up the matter with the Public Service Board and perhaps work out some guidelines and some principles which would operate to assist those who find themselves in the category of being redeployed and without a meaningful job.There are two men in the Department of Territories in particular whom I thought I would use by way of example. I think both of them were invalided out of the remand centre. That is a particularly stressful place for them to have been employed. One man was then offered and accepted a Third Division status position as a clerk class 2/3 in the Department of Sport, Recreation and Tourism. He held this position for some time until he was told he was incorrectly placed and was reverted to a base grade clerk. He said:This position was quite unsuitable and I was informed that I would not be able to work in that type of environment.He did some courses at the Reid technical and further education college to occupy himself and to give him additional interest. As a result he lost about $7,000 in salary. The Department also stopped his first aid allowance as he was no longer in a permanent position. He said:All I have ever asked for is a suitable permanent position and to retain pay similar to my income whilst working at the Remand Centre.I have had nothing but good references from each section of the Department that has used my services.It is a fact that as a Redeployed Officer I am disadvantaged and cannot be given higher duties although I have seen others within the system rise rapidly through the ranks.It seems that while a person is in a status of being redeployed it is almost impossible to apply for another position and get any form of advancement. The problem is that after a period people feel that nobody cares about them. That may not, in fact, be the case, it may be that the Department is unable to do anything. These men feel that they are just on the scrapheap of humanity and there is nothing left for them. It is frustrating, it causes additional stress and I think it has an impact on their families as well. It is often suggested that they go back to the Commonwealth Medical Officer, get a sick note to cover being away, or all sorts of devices to, in a sense, almost fill in time. Again, this man refers to the frustration of applying for positions. He has served with the Scout organisation for a very long time in a number of countries before coming to the Australian Capital Territory and he has a record of service in sporting fields. He has not bludged along on the system. He says that all he wants is a meaningful job.The other case history I have is similar. It concerns a man of 55 years of age. In many respects it is perhaps worse for a man at that age to find himself without a permanent position, unattached and to be redeployed. He said to me that under the system redeployees have no chance. That is the pity of it. They really feel that there is very little left to live for. He also said that to be redeployed makes working life totally meaningless. I am not blaming the departments because perhaps they do not have a meaningful job to offer. I think it is a matter of looking at the policy that governs the situation of redeployment and trying to find a system which can make life meaningful for those in the Public Service who find themselves in that category. It may only be that they cannot work in a particular type of employment. Many have repetitive strain injuries. A number of bus drivers have been stressed and have been told not to drive buses any more. I think greater effort needs to be made to make life meaningful for these people so that they avoid the frustration and stress of being redeployed and feeling that they have been left behind.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
414,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator RYAN","GD5","(Australian Capital Territory-","ALP","Minister for Education)",3302,"—Senator Reid has raised matters concerning the Australian Public Service and redeployment. I will refer that to the relevant Minister. Senator Newman has raised matters concerning airline charges. I will also refer that to the relevant Minister. Senator Vanstone raised matters concerning the alleged motives of Senator Chipp in a number of matters. I am a little distressed that Senator Vanstone has raised those matters. In the absence of Senator Chipp or any representatives of his Party, obviously I can make no comment on them, but I hope that Senator Chipp will have the opportunity to respond to what seemed to me to be fairly serious allegations and perhaps allegations that should not have been raised in the absence of Australian Democrat senators.Question resolved in the affirmative.Senate adjourned at 10.49 p.m.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
