The petitioners note particularly that:1. This new tax will directly affect ordinary Australians in the form of rising prices of building, maintaining and improving their home and by consequential job losses and company closures in an industry which has faced many economic pressures over recent years.2. The new tax offers no net benefit to Australia and should be abandoned.Your petitioners request that the Senate should not pass this legislation when it is presented and/or work to prevent this taxation measure from being implemented by the current Federal Government.And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.The petition of certain residents of the Australia respectfully showeth that the tax on selected building products, proposed in the May 1995 Budget, will place an unwelcome burden on all Australians planning to build a new home or carry out alterations and additions, or repairs/maintenance to existing homes. Moreover, it is considered that the tax is iniquitous in that, when introduced, it will apply retrospectively to people currently building homes, who had entered in good faith into `fixed price building contracts.Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, should reject the extension of proposed wholesales sales tax to building products.To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled:We the undersigned citizens strongly urge the Government to accept the Democrats proposal to drop the intended tax on essential building materials.We believe the proposed tax—adding between $600 and $1,200 on the cost of a medium-sized home and up to $3,000 over the life of a mortgage—will make it more difficult for Australians to buy their own home, increase maintenance costs and rents on existing houses, and hinder growth in the building industry.We call on the Government to droop the tax on essential building materials.To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:1.We are opposed to the sex guide endorsed by Ms Lawrence, Minister for Health in the Keating Government, and published in the December issue of Cleo.2.We believe that the sex guide encourages dangerous sexual practices which could have serious medical and moral effects.We request the Senate to call on Ms Lawrence to withdraw her endorsement of this sex guide and for the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, to indicate his disapproval.And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.To the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembledForest Protection Petition for the permanent protection of remaining native old growth, wilderness and other high conservation value forest areas in Australia.This Petition of the undersigned Australian citizens respectfully points out that:There is an urgent demand from the majority of Australians for immediate Federal Government intervention, to comply with the United Nations Biodiversity Convention to which Australia is a signatory, and protect the remaining high conservation value forest areas which support flora and fauna unique to Australia.Your petitioners therefore request the Senate to:immediately implement the moratorium clause in the 1992 National Forest Policy Statement, and cease all logging activities in high conservation value forests;permanently protect in reserves, all old growth, wilderness, and other high conservation value forest areas, under the custodianship of Australian indigenous peoples, in cooperation with local communities, conservation and scientific organisations;reap only what is sown by utilising readily available plantation timbers for industry needs;rapidly implement timber industry transition from native forests to plantations, with provision for retraining, redeployment, and compensation if necessary for affected workers and contractors;restructure the paper and fibre board industries to use annual fibre crops such as kenaf, hemp, cane etc.create employment incentives to collect seeds, propagate, establish and manage sustainable permaculture-style mixed species timber plantations, on existing cleared and degraded lands, and encourage investment in the growing and marketing of indigenous forest products, such as native fruits, nuts, berries, seeds, oil, and other nutritional and medicinal resources.develop educational environmental tourism as a sensitively managed industry, in appropriate forest areas, with full respect for Aboriginal cultural heritage and sacred sites; andfurther support the above initiatives by the progressive utilisation of defence personnel, resources and funding, to assist rural communities to implement sustainable plantation forestry practice.And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.To the Honourable, the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.The Petition of the undersigned shows:`Observe the United Nations Convention of the Rights of the Child and grant all children social justice and equity in relation to a pre school developmental program which will provide the foundation for a quality education and future employability, by removing the 12 hour (or 1 day) child care assistance restriction for long day care based on parents marital and employment statusYour Petitioners ask/request that the Senate should:`remove the 12 hour (or 1 day) child care assistance restriction for long day care children based on parents marital and employment status.To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia:Urges the Federal Government to bring down legislation that all merchandise bearing the Sydney Olympics 2000 insignia shall be made in Australia from material made in Australia.To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:To uphold, defend, protect and retain forever Australias historic Constitutional Monarchy:-We the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia strongly support Australias Constitutional Monarchy as successful, positive historic and enduring and reject totally any thought of a republic and its insidious companion, creeping republicanism, as divisive, devious, extremist, and without merit.The Constitutional Monarchy has served Australia well, overviewed our impressive growth and undoubted prosperity, reigned continuously with pomp and circumstance from our first settlement and national foundation, guided our national development in both war and peace, ensured and protected our liberties while delivering peace, order and good government, and rightly denies to evil men those powers which could be used to enslave us.The Constitutional Monarch is Australias head of state by tradition, law and right, and, sitting as the Monarch does, at the apex of our Constitution, presides over a Constitution designed for Australians by Australians by some of the wisest constitutional designers to grace our national stage.We therefore look with trepidation at the antics of a few unwise individuals who would replace proven substance with unproven rhetoric and in doing so threaten the freedoms of all Australians and as loyal Australians hereby petition that the Senate, swearing allegiance to our Queen do live up to that oath by upholding, defending, protecting and retaining forever Australias historic Constitutional Monarchy.And your Petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray: God Save the Queen!","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/petition.grp/proctext/interject/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

39,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator VANSTONE","7E4","(South Australia)","LP","N/A",1934,"—by leave—Mr President, that may be the appropriate way. I thank the Australian Democrats for their agreement on the first and sixth paragraphs. I understand that we would all choose different words to back up the reason for a return to order. This is a serious matter where a federal government minister has had an agreement from the Commonwealth government that her legal costs will be paid. I understand from estimates hearings that the undertaking thus far is that it will be in a blank cheque form.This matter may go all the way to the High Court and it could cost taxpayers millions and millions of dollars. The matter deserves further investigation when, as I understand it, Dr Lawrences statement of claim had not even been filed when this agreement was announced by the government. So the Commonwealth has agreed to back an action without having had the opportunity to peruse the statement of claim.This is a serious matter. We would all choose different words. I agree with what Senator Spindler says. This is a matter that relates to Dr Lawrences duties in another capacity completely. Frankly, it is not obvious to anyone on this side what the Commonwealth legal interest in this matter is. The Commonwealths political interest, as in this governments interest, is obvious, but the Commonwealths legal interest is not.

48,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ELLISON","9X5","(Western Australia)","LP","N/A",1935,"—I move:That the Senate take note of the report.The report that I have just tabled is the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee report into the investigatory powers of the Australian Securities Commission. On 27 May 1993 the Senate resolved to refer to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for report on the following matters: firstly, the exercise of the powers of officers of the Australian Securities Commission to interview witnesses, including, one, the manner in which those interviews are conducted, two, the power to take transcripts of interview and the treatment of those transcripts and, three, the power to compel production of books and records; secondly, the exercise of the powers of the ASC to bring applications against corporations and individuals including, one, the bringing of applications during the course of investigation and, two, the process by which applications are brought.Broadly speaking, the reference was to look at how the Australian Securities Commission went about investigating corporations and the corporate area of the community generally. The committee received some 147 witness submissions and held public hearings in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. A number of these submissions were extremely lengthy and much of the evidence was of a highly complex nature. The committee received submissions and heard evidence from a number of persons who felt aggrieved by the actions of the ASC, in particular, by the way in which investigations had been carried out by that body.The committee wishes to thank all those persons who gave their time and energy in providing the committee with the benefit of their experiences. It also wishes to thank the Australian Securities Commission for its cooperation.I would like to thank my fellow members on the committee, in particular, Senator Spindler from the Democrats, Senator Cooney from the government, and Senator OChee from the National Party who caused this matter to be referred. I should also mention Senator McKiernan and Senator Neal, who has joined the committee of late. I thank all members of the committee for their assistance in this matter and for the work they put into it.The central issue for the committee was to resolve the difficulty in balancing the need for effective corporate regulation against the right of the individual to certain procedural safeguards in the investigatory process. During the course of the committees inquiry it became clear that there was an imbalance too far in favour of the Australian Securities Commission and that this imbalance was contributing to an atmosphere of antagonism between the business community and the Australian Securities Commission. In the committees view, this antagonism of itself is not conducive to efficient regulation of the corporate sector. While the Australian Securities Commission enjoys some favour in that sector of the community, a number of grievances were put to the committee which could not be overlooked.In its recommendations, the committee has sought to protect the rights of individuals and to alter procedures only where, in so doing, there are tangible benefits for the business community, the Australian Securities Commission and individuals at large. For example, in recommendation 15, the committee has recommended that legal professional privilege be available for all parties in investigations carried out by the Australian Securities Commission. Presently, due to the High Courts decision in Yuill, legal professional privilege does not exist for client to lawyer communications in relation to investigations initiated by the Australian Securities Commission.The committee was concerned by evidence given in the course of the inquiry that the lack of access to legal professional privilege may prompt company officers to act without legal advice or on the basis of imperfectly understood oral advice. The rationale is that if people are fearful that by going to a lawyer they will not enjoy legal privilege, they will not seek that advice in the first instance and will embark upon a path which is hazardous to say the least.The committee found that there were sound reasons both from the perspective of corporate governance and individual liberties to reinstate legal professional privilege for all parties in ASC investigations. Much of the committees time was concerned with the ASCs right to compel persons under investigation to participate in oral examinations. This power is derived from section 19 of the ASC law and the committee found that the compulsory oral examination is a key investigatory tool for the ASC and should remain part of the ASCs investigatory powers.But it was also evident to the committee that there are deficiencies in the present examination procedure, in particular in relation to protection for examinees against the misuse of procedures and powers enjoyed by the ASC. In recommendation 4, for instance, the committee has recommended that when personal assets are frozen, and when that action has been found subsequently to be entirely without merit, the individual who has had his or her assets frozen has a right to claim costs. In this instance I refer to the Aust-home example which was put to us by many witnesses. That was a case where people had their assets frozen in such a manner pending investigation.The committee has also made a number of recommendations touching upon the compulsory examination powers of the ASC, and briefly they are: that the ASC law be amended so that summonses for such examinations should be issued by district registrars of the Federal Court on application by the ASC rather than being a purely discretionary matter for an ASC officer; furthermore, that the ASC law be amended so that the power of the ASC to exclude a particular lawyer from a compulsory examination be only exercisable on application by the ASC to a court. The onus should be on the ASC to prove that the exclusion of a particular lawyer who would represent the person under investigation is necessary so as to avoid any prejudice to the investigation. Furthermore, the examination should be stayed during any such application by the ASC.The committee has also recommended that transcripts be available, that access be available to documents seized by the ASC, and that there be training for ASC investigatory officers. In total, there are some 15 recommendations, but time does not permit me to address them in detail. Suffice to say that the committee believes that it has struck the critical balance between the protection of civil liberties on the one hand and the protection of the community from unlawful practices on the other. Wherever government bestows upon quasi-government bodies—or anybody for that matter—investigatory powers, one has to look very closely at how those powers are exercised. The Australian Securities Commission has had a good many powers bestowed upon it. The committee did not say that this should not have happened because the excesses of the 1980s had to be addressed but, nevertheless, we, as a Senate, have to scrutinise such powers and ensure that they did not go too far and infringe the civil liberties that I have mentioned. There are a good many other good recommendations in this report and I commend it to the Senate.Question resolved in the affirmative.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/debate.sub1[2]/debate.sub2/speech/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

50,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator FERGUSON","EP5","(South Australia)","LP","N/A",1937,"—I move:That the Senate take note of the report.On 20 October 1994, the Senate referred to the Senate Economics References Committee for inquiry and report the matter of the tax treatment of small business. This matter arose following concerns about the appropriateness of the level of the provisional tax uplift factor that the government was proposing to apply to provisional taxpayers for the 1994-95 financial year.While the uplift factor was the catalyst for the inquiry, the Senate referred a broad range of taxation matters affecting small business for examination. These included the impact of the timing of the payments of the various taxes on the cash flows of small business; changes in the overall burden of tax by and since the 1993 budget; the potential for reducing compliance costs for small business through the improvement of tax payment arrangements; and whether the tax system can be improved to prevent tax falling due before income is actually received.The committee received 69 submissions to the inquiry from small businesses and their representative peak bodies, accounting firms, tax agents, public sector organisations, consultants, academics and other members of the public. The range of concerns expressed in evidence to the committee during its hearings clearly illustrates the extent and sheer complexity of tax law affecting small businesses—hundreds of thousands of whom are sole traders, family businesses and small partnerships. All of this, of course, is exacerbated by the seemingly never ending changes to tax and the need for small businesses to somehow keep track of it all.Not only are small businesses faced with the practical daily challenges of running their business affairs but, by necessity, they find themselves spending a great deal of time and effort keeping abreast of and complying with some very exacting tax obligations, or else they are paying their accountants to do so. Furthermore, in some cases, tax payments are often due not only before taxable income is received but even before it is earned. This is why the committees first recommendation is for the due dates of quarterly provisional tax payments to be put back by two months—one month to at least give a small business a chance to earn its income for the quarter, and another to receive at least some of what is due.The basic approach taken by the committee in this report was to continue to follow many of the issues raised at the time of the 1990 Beddall report, which made many recommendations in relation to the taxation of small business. The committee heard from small business throughout Australia and came to the conclusion that the objectives which guided the Beddall committees recommendations remain unfinished.This report has framed its recommendations with the view that small businesses could benefit from some affirmative action to balance the economies of scale which are available to large businesses. As the title of this report expresses, it is a question of balance as to the extent that the disadvantages of being a business that is small can be neutralised in the face of the natural advantages enjoyed by large businesses.The most complex issue that the committee had to deal with was the provisional tax uplift factor. Of all of the issues raised by small business in the inquiry, it is fair to say that the uplift factor was almost universally considered unfair, not the least because most small businesses do not experience a growth in income as great as the uplift factor expects them to. This is why the committee majority recommends that the uplift factor be set at a level no higher than the current or expected annual movement in the consumer price index. The committee did not settle on this recommendation easily. Its merit is that it is simple and fairer than the current system, which is complex, unfair, inappropriate and probably meaningless.The committee suggests that the government examine and evaluate the main alternative that was canvassed during its deliberations—that of an individual uplift factor that is derived from the particular circumstances of each provisional taxpayer. It is possible that setting a single factor to apply to a fundamentally disparate group of over 1 1/2 million provisional taxpayers is a completely wrong approach, particularly when it becomes obvious that the fluctuations in their individual and aggregate incomes from year to year are often anything but small.Other key recommendations include extending the option to pay sales tax on a quarterly basis to more small businesses, to ease compliance costs and give them a chance to receive more income before the tax is due; reviewing the messy and complex sales tax exemptions and classifications regime and establishing a process where new products can be quickly and easily classified; exempting small businesses from the annual FBT liabilities of less than $200 from FBT on car parking, compulsory award obligations and child care provided by small businesses in some cases; and deferring the capital gains tax on the capital gain of a small trading business which the vendor rolls over into another small trading business.It is a quirk of life in this country that small and medium enterprises have been largely responsible for the growth in employment in the 1990s and for many of their expanding export opportunities at a time when our larger enterprises have been preoccupied with rationalisations, downsizing, re-engineering and other measures which may increase their efficiencies but do not contribute much to employment or export growth. The measures recommended in this report are designed to give our small businesses a much fairer go.I want to place on record my thanks to the committee secretariat for their work throughout the whole of this entire reference and during our deliberations and their involvement in compiling this report. I particularly mention the secretary, Rob Diamond, and Merrilyn Pyle and Pippa Carron who were involved in the compilation of this report and in the running of the committee. I would particularly like to mention the work of James Satrapa who has provided a tremendous amount of expertise and knowledge to both myself and the other members of the committee in helping to understand the complexities of the tax problems that we were trying to overcome.I would also like to compliment all committee members for the manner in which the deliberations were conducted. It was a complex and difficult job to consider all of the submissions that were presented to the committee. At the end of the day there were differing political and philosophical positions on what were the appropriate ways to address the many complexities confronting small business in relation to taxation matters. The goodwill that existed during the determining of our final recommendations—you, Mr Acting Deputy President, were one of those members who were part of those deliberations—meant that we were able to come up with more unanimous recommendations than might have otherwise been the case. I commend my coalition colleagues on the committee, Senator Spindler from the Democrats and the government members of the committee, particularly Senator Murphy who was involved in the final deliberations, for the manner in which we were able to arrive at our final report.I urge the government to look closely at the recommendations of this report as they represent a widespread variety of views from small businesses around Australia. The very fact that we had so many submissions and the enthusiasm of the people who gave us evidence at public hearings only highlights the complexities that currently exist. Anything that we can do to help to improve the plight of small businesses or the efficiency of small businesses can only be in the best interests of Australia. I strongly urge the government to look very closely at the recommendations.Debate (on motion by Senator Panizza ) adjourned.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/debate.sub1[3]/speech/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

57,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator SHORT","DJ4","(Victoria)","LP","N/A",1939,"—I want to say a few words on behalf of the opposition before these appropriation bills are passed. They have to be passed this week because they provide the appropriations for the running of the affairs of government for the forthcoming financial year and are, in essence, the governments budget bills. I want to say a couple of things about the processes that we here in the Senate are now required to go through as a result of the change in timing of the introduction of the budget, because the change last year to bring the budget in in May, to have effect from 1 July, rather than the previous long-standing practice of introducing it in August, with effect from 1 July, was seemingly desirable and sensible. It has led to some very difficult administrative and processing problems for the parliament, particularly for the Senate through the estimates processes.The main scrutiny of the governments budget is done in the Senate through the Senate estimates processes. That has always been the case and it has become increasingly important in recent years as the Senates committee system has developed greater sophistication and the ability to cope with the complexities of the legislation that comes before it, including budget legislation.When we had the budget being brought in in the third week in August, that required supply bills being passed towards the end of the preceding financial year. It meant that the budget did not have to be passed until about the end of November or early December. So, under the old system, we had about three months—indeed, it could be stretched to 3 1/2 months, some 15 weeks—between the introduction of the budget and its eventual passage. That allowed the Senate much greater time to examine the details of the budget. So we had the budget introduced in the third week in August.We commenced estimates hearings in late September or earlyish October. Sometimes then we would have additional estimates hearings or supplementary hearings, depending on the questions and issues that had arisen out of those initial estimates hearings. Matters could be fully considered and outstanding questions could be answered adequately in time by government departments. Despite all that, the budget was still being passed in quite adequate time by late November or early December. So there was a period of up to 15 weeks to do the whole of the budget process.Now the budget is introduced in the second week in May. Because of that, there are no supply bills passed to enable the funding of government beyond the end of that financial year. Therefore, the budget bills introduced—I am referring particularly to the appropriation bills introduced in the second week of May—have to be fully passed by, at the very latest, the last week in June to enable the services of government to continue into the start of the new financial year.We have a maximum period of about seven weeks for the parliament to examine the budget in detail. In other words, it is half the time that existed before. That has posed some very considerable problems for the Senate in its consideration of the budget. It means that the first estimates hearings cannot really take place until late May. That is only a couple of weeks, or three weeks at the maximum, after the budget has been introduced. So there has been less time to examine the content of the budget in detail. By the time those hearings are held and considered by senators on the relevant estimates committees and answers are supplied to questions taken on notice during those hearings by government departments, the supplementary estimates hearings that may be required based on the responses of those questions cannot be held until the third week in June. Then we will pass the budget within a matter of a few days and, in some instances, a few hours after that. Indeed, an estimates committee sat last night—","N/A","APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL 1995-96 APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1995-96 APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 2) 1995-96","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[1]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

59,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator SHORT","DJ4","(Victoria)","LP","N/A",1939,"—Till 1 oclock this morning. Yet nine hours later we are being required to pass the appropriation bills. I do not know the answer to this, but it is a matter of serious concern and causes serious difficulty in the proper processing and consideration of the budget. It is something that the parliament will have to look at, as will the government of the day, if we are to feel confident that the parliament is able to do its job in terms of the proper examination and processing of appropriation bills.I think the process is a difficult one. Despite that, I think the Senate has done excellent work in the last few frenetic weeks in examining the budget. Those estimates processes have certainly revealed and exposed many of the basic flaws contained in this quite phoney, fraudulent and fudged budget of broken promises. This is a budget of massive tax increases. The increase in revenue forecast in this budget for the forthcoming year is the second highest increase in revenue—the second highest tax rip-off of the Australian public since those infamous Whitlam years, where we had budget policy which absolutely wrecked the Australian economy for years and years after that.Since then, this budget is second only to the disastrous first budget of the Hawke government in 1983-84. The first Hawke budget had a massive increase in revenue. If you take the budgets of 1994-95 and 1995-96 together, the increase in revenue in those two years will be far and away the greatest increase since the Whitlam years. Therefore, we have ratcheted up into yet another high taxing economy, an economy which makes it very difficult for the average Australian wage earner to get a job. We still have three-quarters of a million people officially unemployed, and you can well and truly double that when you take into account the underemployment in the economy. The government through its high taxing policies has made it extremely difficult for Australians to get a job in the first instance. Once they have a job, they are then battered right, left and centre with a whole raft of massive taxes—taxes of a nature that make Australia increasingly uncompetitive in a highly competitive world relative to other countries.It is all very well for the government to say we are more competitive than we were five or 10 years ago. That comparison completely ignores the fact that, against many of our major trading partners with whom we have to compete if we are to maintain and build our living standards, we have become less, not more, competitive. To the extent that we have narrowed the gap at all—and we have only done that in rare circumstances—has largely been done as a result of the short-term expediency of a progressively declining exchange rate. That, in itself, poses major problems for the economy.The budget does nothing at all to address in the short, medium or, I would argue, the longer term the fundamental problem facing Australia, a problem which is recognised in the rhetoric by the government—that is, the chronic lack of savings in Australia. The budget, having recognised that rhetorically—the Treasurer (Mr Willis) did that in his second reading speech—does nothing at all to tackle the problem. Indeed, through the raft of massive new taxes and tax hikes, it has made that problem much more difficult.The government would say that it has started to tackle the problem as a result of its proposals for compulsory superannuation. But it has done two things in that regard. It will pay for those at some distant time by a deferral, indeed a breaking, of its tax promises before the last election to give major tax cuts to every Australian taxpayer as from 1 January 1996. Those tax cuts have now been taken away from the Australian taxpayer. Indeed, as a result of that, he or she will be paying more tax, not less. At the same time the government, through its policies, has lessened the range of choice available to Australians in terms of their savings opportunities and incentives.So the budget has worked in quite the wrong direction with regard to the fundamental problem that we face in our economy—that is, the basic lack of savings. It is that fundamental problem which is reflected in the current account deficit, the deficit in our external accounts. The deficit this year is of the order of six per cent of our total national production. That is the worst figure for any industrialised country in the world.In terms of the problem we have with our external accounts, we are now even worse than Mexico. That is something that just a few short years ago would not have been considered even vaguely conceivable. Worse still, the government in its own budget forecasts projects no improvement at all in that current account deficit over the year ahead. It will come in at $27 billion this year, 1994-95, and the government is forecasting another $27 billion deficit in 1995-96. It is very likely that on Friday, in two days time, when we get the monthly balance of payments figures for May, we will see the highest ever deficit in our external accounts. At a time when the government is trying to argue that its policies are designed to correct the problems in the Australian economy, to tackle the fundamental problems, it is a cruel indictment of the mismanagement of this government over many years in terms of its economic policy.These are matters that we have been pursuing and will continue to pursue in some of the other budget related bills, particularly the taxation bills which are to be debated in the next two or three days. In particular, I urge the government to look at my comments in terms of the budget process so far as the Senates consideration of the budget is concerned, because we have some serious difficulties of a timing nature which, if we as a Senate are to feel confident that we are doing our job, do need to be addressed.","N/A","APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL 1995-96 APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1995-96 APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 2) 1995-96","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[1]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
60,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CALVERT","5F4","(Tasmania)","LP","N/A",1941,"—Senator Short mentioned that one of the estimates committees sat till one oclock this morning. There is no doubt that during the estimates different people, different senators, pursue different avenues of investigation. One of the reasons that we were delayed in this process was a particular matter I was pursuing and had been pursuing for some four years. When we had the supplementary estimates last Friday, I had 140-odd questions that were outstanding and some of them had been outstanding for 12 months.At the estimates hearing in which I was involved querying Telstra, the answers to my questions were given to me at nine oclock—and the hearing started at half past eight. In other words, it was impossible for me to ask any questions. Representatives from Telstra were brought along and had to be sent home. This happens on many occasions. It is of concern that we do not seem to be able to get the estimates processes correct.I want to put on the record, as briefly as I can, the result of this four years of work I have been putting in on behalf of what I class as a battler and a person who was the subject of an independent inquiry held by Ken Marks QC. This particular person, Mr Geoffrey Marr from Sydney, was stood down on 4 July 1990, charged with the misuse of six Cabcharge documents after having alerted the public to some 137 counts of misuse of overtime by some employees of Telecom, or Telstra as it is now known.I can tell you that it has been a long, drawn-out process. Some of the things that have come to light make me really wonder how big corporations and big government departments work in this country. I have said this in this place before, so I will be brief: this particular employee who was unfairly dismissed, as it has now been proved, had three lots of private investigators pursuing him; his telephones were tapped; his brothers telephones were tapped; and a friend of a friends telephones were tapped, for what reason I would not know and no-one else does either.In answers to some of the questions that I obtained last week, I have ascertained that Telstra had an internal inquiry which cost them something like $80,000. In total, they admitted that so far they have spent $322,000 pursuing this particular person.After the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) was made aware of this by me and Mr Marr, the minister found a fair amount of sympathy for this particular case because it had been going on for so long. It was because of our actions that Michael Lee organised this independent inquiry—and there are the results of it. It really shows that Mr Marr has been treated unfairly. It recommends that he be reinstated, be paid back pay, holiday pay and all the rest of it right back to when he appeared before a disciplinary appeals board.He went to the ombudsman and the AAT. He went through all the processes he possibly could trying to receive justice for himself. Then we unearthed all these improper dealings. As far as the disciplinary appeals board was concerned, Mr Marks found that evidence was withheld and that Mr Marr had been denied natural justice. The bottom line is that Telstra admitted to spending something like $322,000 pursuing this person on what would appear to be four or five charges amounting to $37.What really summed up for me how far people will go in trying to deceive or in trying to get the results they want is an internal memo, along with heaps of other material, that came into my possession. This is an internal memo from the Director of Corporate Affairs, Gillian Welshe, to Gayle Hill, dated 27 September 1994. This was about the time I was waiting for Mr Lee, the Minister for Communications and the Arts, to contact me to see if we could organise another avenue for Mr Marr to try to clear his name. The minister was very sympathetic and was making inquiries about the matter. The memo says:Subject—MARR—Feedback from Ministers office last Friday. . .Attention Gayle,The Minister is still keen to find an avenue to help Marr. The Trish Cavanagh advice of Tuesday did not seem to work. The Ministers office is now asking the Department for further details regarding an Audit Report that was apparently favourable to Marr in some respect.Not sure where this is going but we need to do more. Can you advise because W. Frank Blount is likely to speak to the Minister about this today. Please look at this and get Trish Cavanagh to tell us what the results were from the Ministers meeting.Here they were, on their own admission, deliberately trying to find an avenue to discredit Mr Marr and to try to mislead the minister. The lengths that people have gone to and the things that have happened absolutely stagger me. This little memo—and there are many more like it—sums up the lengths, the time and the expense. Commonsense would say that $37 worth of cab charge documents really are not all that great and do not warrant spending this amount of money or going to all this trouble. I would have thought an organisation such as Telstra would have just paid up and shut up and got on with the job it is supposed to be doing.But this matter is still going on; I still have questions on notice awaiting answers. No doubt the matter will drag on for another 12 months because Telstra will not admit that it is wrong. This memo shows everybody in the Senate what is going on behind our backs. The minister here was trying to help this particular person but the advice they had used to try to get him `did not seem to work. I seek leave to incorporate this memo in Hansard .

61,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator HARRADINE","6H4","(Tasmania)","IND","N/A",1943,"—By convention senators do not take the time to speak on the third reading of appropriation bills. However, I do so only briefly to raise a very serious matter for the attention of the Senate. It arose from my questioning on the amounts being allocated through AusAID to UNFPA, particularly my questioning of AusAID on 23 June 1995 which appears at pages 247 to 252 of the Hansard of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee. I draw that matter to the attention of honourable senators because it indicates how little is being done by Australia, and indeed by some other countries, to assess the gross violations which are occurring daily in the Peoples Republic of China in the implementation of that countrys fertility control policy.What was most worrying, and why I bring this to the attention of the chamber, was the apparent acceptance by the official of AusAID that the implementation of that program is not regarded as coercive, apart from the suggestion that it was the result of actions or the administration of local officials. I particularly draw attention to the fact that, on page 251 of the Hansard , I asked Dr Helen Ware, an official of the department, a question based on a statement in a cable by DFAT from China. It was a report of a discussion between a DFAT official and the Executive Director of the Family Planning Commission in Shanghai. That cable said:According to Liu, if for some reason there is a second pregnancy, the first step is education which in practice appears to be counselling to have an abortion. However, parents may insist on having the child, they will have to pay the state a fee of three times the yearly family income, payable over six years.I asked:Is that not coercion? Is that not said by an official, the Executive Director of the Family Planning Commission? Where are the zealous officials? Is that not coercion?Dr Ware said:In the Chinese view, if couples wish to have more children than is the government policy, given that they are provided with a very wide range of services for free under the Chinese system where there are not individual charges for almost all health services, for education services, where accommodation is subsidised and the like, it is the Chinese view that these very heavy imposts constitute a payment for the services which will subsequently be rendered to that child.Is asked, `Is that accepted by AusAID?. Dr Ware replied:Though there is a range of exceptions, there are two levels . . . of what is imposed upon people who are in government employ and what is the practice in relation to the rest of the population who are not in government employ, and the very heavy fines, for example, what is imposed upon those who are in government employ as a payment, as I say, for the very many services that are provided to their children.I asked, `Are you going to the Beijing conference by any chance? Dr Ware said:The delegation has not been officially announced, but it is my understanding that AusAID will be represented on that delegation.I said:It is very important when it comes to the question of Beijing. Here, if the woman does not have an abortion, the family is fined a fee of three times the yearly family income payable over six years—not my words, the words of the Executive Director of the State Family Planning Commission in Shanghai.Dr Ware said, `Yes. I continued by asking:Official. Is that not coercion? Is that not saying, `You have an abortion or you starve? Is that not coercion?I would like to draw the attention of honourable senators to what the response of Dr Ware was:The time over which that fine has to be paid is negotiable. As I say, as that cable itself indicates, they are the conditions under which the rules relating to a first child, a second child or even subsequent children are imposed.To my mind, and I believe to the mind of any reasonable person, that is horrifying. An officer of a government department refuses to accept that that is coercion. That person is likely to represent Australia at the Beijing conference on women.This is a matter of human rights. I believe that this matter will gain a great deal of attention between now and the Beijing conference and probably at the Beijing conference itself. We in Australia must be clear on where we stand on this matter. Try as I may, I could not get a response out of the department—I believe that this should have been its response—that this is official coercion. Such coercion should be condemned by every human being, particularly when it is directed at the women in China. Together with the culture of the Chinese, it results in a gross distortion of the number of female and male babies born. There is gross discrimination against females.I have raised it here today. I have placed a number of questions on notice. I asked a number of questions at that meeting. I expect that those answers will be forthcoming as a matter of urgency. It would be in the governments interests and in the interests of humanity itself for those questions that I have asked to be properly and urgently responded to.Question resolved in the affirmative.Bills read a third time.","N/A","APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL 1995-96 APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1995-96 APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 2) 1995-96","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

66,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator GIBSON","BX5","(Tasmania)","LP","N/A",1945,"—Mr Acting Deputy President, the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Modification (Excise) Bill 1995 and associated bills will alter the sales tax law to give effect to the governments announcements in the 1995-96 budget. These bills continue a pattern of behaviour by this government which can only be described as typical because, in every budget of this government since 1983, amendments have been made to the sales tax arrangements in this country.Some amendments have been reforms to the avoidance provisions within the acts. Some amendments, particularly in the early years of the government, were to reduce sales tax rates where it was deemed inequitable for goods to be taxed at particular rates. Most of the changes have been to remove exemptions and to raise the rates of sales tax applying and to alter the classification structure of goods to bring more goods into the higher sales tax bracket.The government even added new items to the sales tax net to overcome what it perceived to be anomalies—cases where there was no logical reason why one good should be taxed and another should not. This is a most interesting point to remember and I will return to it a little later.Given all these changes it should not be surprising to anyone to have to debate these tax changes today. It is not surprising that this government should increase sales taxes on certain products or for this government to remove exemptions. The government has form. It has a record—a record of continually adjusting the sales tax legislation, a record of continually adjusting the tax laws to raise more and more revenue from indirect taxes.Budget Paper No. 1 provides an interesting analysis of the trend of government revenue obtained from sales taxes over the period of this government. In 1982-83, the last year of the Fraser government, sales tax returned $3.4 billion to total revenue, or 8.4 per cent of taxation revenue. By 1989-90, just before the recession, sales tax had risen to $10.1 billion, or 11 per cent of taxation revenue.In the first financial year under the leadership of the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating), sales tax raised $9.2 billion, or 10.3 per cent of tax revenue. For the next financial year, 1995-96, which starts on Saturday, should these bills be passed in their current form, the government will obtain $14.16 billion from sales tax, or 11.8 per cent of the total taxation revenue. To say that there has been a broadening of the application of sales taxes would be an understatement.If government is to obtain its funds through taxes on the consumption behaviour of citizens, at the very least it should provide over a period of time for those citizens with the necessary income to make those purchases. Increasing direct taxation at the same time as increasing indirect taxation is to institute a double blow to the taxpayer. It would mean that individuals would have less money in their pockets after tax and would have to pay more for their sales tax loaded goods. This double tax is unfair; it is a tax grab. This double tax grab is unreasonable. This double tax grab has been the policy of this government ever since the current Prime Minister took office.In 1992-93 the government raised $47.5 billion in revenue from income tax on individuals. In the next financial year, the government has forecast, it will raise $62.2 billion. Contrast those numbers—$47.5 billion at the start of Mr Keatings prime ministership and $62.2 billion next year. To paint an analogy: while this government has planted one hand firmly in the wage pocket of every Australian, in its other hand it has scissors actively cutting a yawning hole in the very same pocket. While wages disappear faster and faster through an ever-widening hole in the pocket, the tax bucket gets fuller day after day.A distinction between the manner in which the government and the coalition treat indirect taxes is a very basic one: a principle. It is a principle upon which the coalition will stand proud and oppose these particular tax measures. It is a principle that we hear the people say they want from their politicians.It would be wrong to suggest that honesty is an easy principle. It would be wrong to suggest that honesty should be a tradeable principle. If any member of this chamber would stand before any schoolroom at any level in our education system and have the audacity to advocate that honesty is a flexible principle, I dare them to say so. It is true that to be honest can sometimes hurt. To be honest will sometimes mean saying or doing things that cause suffering or hardship. Regardless, being honest is a principle that only those who want honesty can treasure. For those who do not believe in the need for honesty there is no value in the principle: they will mock those who treasure it and ridicule those who advocate it, but you will never hear them decry the need for honesty.These bills which we debate today are not honest. They represent deceit, betrayal, and above all else they represent a pattern of behaviour that has resulted in the character of politicians being rightly abhorred by our fellow citizens. When this government attacked the coalition in 1993 for proposing the joint broadening of the indirect tax base and, at the same time, the reduction in direct taxes, the Prime Minister and his sycophants used ridicule and deceit. They portrayed the coalition as parties of higher taxation and greater government greed.The fact of the matter was that this government had already determined that it would introduce higher indirect taxes without offsets. It had decided that it would increase direct taxation without any trade-off to the Australian taxpayer. It had decided that it would devise a false and misleading charade for Australians to admire and to contrast it with the difficult but necessary truth in the coalitions honesty. After the election the charade would be forgotten and the power of government would again be exercised to ruthlessly increase taxes.The people of Australia must not forget. When the Labor Party hustlers come hocking their wares at the next election the Australian electorate will know that what they are selling is deceit, fraud, humbug, empty rhetoric and more false dawns. The Australian people will know that it was the Labor Party that not only proposed but introduced legislation to impose a 12 per cent tax on their hardware and building materials. The Australian people will remember that it was the Labor Party that increased taxation on the family car by 30 per cent. The Australian people will remember that it was the Labor Party that tried to tax the family home, not only as it was being built, but every time it was going to be repaired.Every time an Australian enters a hardware shop he will remember that it was this Labor Party government that will tax all nails, plaster and putty in the shop. Come the next election, the Australian people will need to listen long and closely to the promises of the Australian Labor Party. If words such as `promise, `law, `guarantee, `assurance, or even `cross my heart and hope to die are uttered from the mouths of the Prime Minister or any of his posse of amigos the Australian public will know that they are being wound up, led on, and probably deceived.I strongly believe that the Australian people have heard this government cry wolf just once too many times. The governments excuses are not just thin, they are absolutely threadbare. Believe this government only if you like a good whack around the ears.The government even has the audacity to blame the Senate and the opposition parties for potentially causing interest rates to rise. Even though it is the Labor government that has been in government for 12 years; even though it has been the Labor government that has been in charge of the economy for 12 years; even though it is a Labor government which for 12 years has had the entire public service at its disposal, including the economic talents of the Treasury and the departments of Finance and industry et cetera; even though for 12 years it has been the Labor government which has pulled the levers, manipulated the market and run the Reserve Bank—the government now accuses the coalition and the Australian Democrats of controlling interest rates. What bunkum, what nonsense, and what a cop out! If those ministers opposite are unable to manage the Australian economy with a potential reduction of less than one per cent of revenue it is time they surrendered, admitted their failure and total incompetence, and got right out of the kitchen.While we are on the subject, let me knock down once and for all the myth that what the coalition is doing in opposing the governments new tax measures is somehow unique. Let me point out to those in the media who may have missed this point that the coalition will not oppose all the measures in this bill. Where those measures involve the modification of a currently existing parliamentary mandate, the coalition will not oppose the governments actions. Where the government is merely acting to clarify an existing law, the coalition will not oppose.Indeed, it was a member of the coalition, the member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall), who moved to amend the legislation to extend the definition of eligible disabled persons in schedule 2 of the bill. If the coalition is so negative, why would it actually move to amend the legislation to make it fairer? To the governments credit, it acknowledged the merit of Mr Halls amendment and supported the change. The coalition does not seek to be politically expedient or to grandstand; it merely seeks to do what is right by the Australian people.It will remain the responsibility of the government to justify to the Australian people why their musical instruments are taxed in the manner that they will be and why their scaffolding, racking, shelving, safes and recycled paper are taxed as they will be but, in any regard, the coalition will not oppose these government amendments to the sales tax acts. These changes involve the clarification of the current arrangements, and the coalition acknowledges the governments right to take action.In regard to the coalitions opposition to those measures which raise sales tax on motor vehicles and impose sales tax on certain building materials, I quote, in part, the words of a currently influential Australian:. . . these measures represent a repudiation of a pledge made not to broaden the indirect tax base, they will have an adverse effect on the living standards of Australian families, they will affect the equity of the tax system in a quite regressive away and they will most certainly add to the inflation rate.Do you think these words are of a rampant Liberal, hell-bent on forcing up interest rates? Maybe they are the words of an angry, economically manipulative Democrat. No, they are the words of the current Treasurer of Australia. They were the words of Ralph Willis, when he and all the Labor Party voted against the tax changes introduced by John Howard in 1981.The Labor government is simply two-faced. In fact, it is more than that. I quote from another senior Labor parliamentarian of the time, who argued that the coalitions 1981 proposal could be rejected by the Senate, because:. . . there can be no question of a mandate of any kind for these particular sales tax Bills—direct or indirect, specific or general, implicit or explicit. As I have said already, the possibility of more indirect taxes either as a supplement or as an alternative to income tax simply was not floated at the time of the last election . . .Which election are we talking about? In which election did the government of the day fail to float the possibility of raising indirect taxes, not to mention direct taxes? In fact, again, the quote is from 1981 and comes from the current foreign minister, Senator Gareth Evans.Does anyone remember the Labor Party talking about raising taxes at the last election? I do not think so. Does anyone remember the Labor Party ever floating taxes on building products during 1992 or 1993? From where does the government draw its mandate to raise these taxes now? The fact of the matter is that this government set the rules in regard to how to handle sales tax proposals in the Senate. The government set the precedent and the government will now have to live by its own standards.I would like to conclude by quashing one of the further myths that the government would like the media to run with, to distract from its incompetence with regard to the current budget. The Labor Party will say that the opposition is hypocritical because, when it comes to government, it may not remove the impositions proposed by the government but would use the revenue for its own budgetary purposes. Once again, the government in this instance has form. To discover this form, we must go back 12 years to the start of this government. When it entered government, did it abolish the previous governments taxation initiatives which it had voted against previously? Not on your life!Any future government must start with the revenue base it is left with by the previous administration. Where the coalition differs from the government is that any changes which the coalition may introduce in government will be part of a comprehensive taxation and expenditure program. What the government is proposing in these bills is merely a further extension of the sales tax base from the sanctuary of government. If the Labor Party wants a mandate to increase taxation, let it propose that to the Australian people at the next election.This brings me to a point I made earlier. If this government wants to impose a sales tax on certain building materials, what is there to stop it from extending the tax to all building materials after the election? Nothing but the Australian people at the next election. If the government is so confident of its mandate to introduce this tax, let it take it to the Australian people. Let it be clear to all Australians at the next election that the Labor Party wants a mandate to tax its building materials. I look forward to seeing the Labor Partys slogan for the next election. Perhaps I could propose one—`For a tax on your home, vote Labor.I remind honourable senators again of Prime Minister Keatings 1993 election promise, when he said, `What I am promising is not to put up tax. We in the opposition therefore oppose the tax increases on motor vehicles and building materials. I give notice that in the committee stage I will be moving amendments to that effect. What we have said all along is that we will oppose any tax increases against what the government promised in the lead-up to the 1993 election.In conclusion, I reiterate that as the government of the day, it is this Labor government which must take responsibility for the budget and what it contains. The only good thing about this budget is that it ensures that the Labor government will not be the government of the day for much longer.","N/A","SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (EXCISE) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (CUSTOMS) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (GENERAL) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
67,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator KERNOT","XW4","(Queensland-","AD","Leader of the Australian Democrats)",1948,"—This is a very important package of bills. It puts in place much of the governments $700 million of increased sales taxes via the budget. That is in addition to the extra $600 million of sales tax to be collected because of the automatic one per cent rise that has flowed on since John Dawkinss 1993 budget. That automatic increase begins on 1 July. The combination of that measure in the 1993 budget and this one actually means that the government raises over $14 billion in sales tax. That represents an increase of over 50 per cent on the $9.2 billion collected just three years ago.We have avoided the ongoing debate since Australians said no to a GST, but we are still collecting an awful lot of tax via indirect tax measures. I think the wholesale tax regime is preferable to the goods and services tax at this point. Nevertheless, we really should be talking about the merits of broadening the tax collection in this way.The extension of the sales tax on building materials, in the Democrats view, represents a breach of faith between this particular government and the electorate, but particularly home buyers. It was this government which promised, prior to the last election, that it would not increase taxes on building products, yet here it is doing exactly that.We all remember what was quite an hysterical anti-GST campaign. We saw the dozens of claims made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and others about the impact of the GST on housing. As a matter of fact, the Prime Minister wrote to all builders in 1992 warning that the GST would add $4,000 to the price of a $100,000 home and that under his tax legislation, building materials are completely exempt. He further said:It is important that there be no drastic changes of policy which would choke off economic activity.In question time on 4 November 1992 the Prime Minister said, quite clearly:The Government is not about taxing the building industry.In talking about extending the sales tax base, we are really reminded of the Prime Ministers unequivocal comments. In that respect, they do represent a breach of faith. This is the second time this government has tried to tax building. In 1986 Paul Keating proposed a broad-based consumption tax.

69,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator KERNOT","XW4","(Queensland-","AD","Leader of the Australian Democrats)",1948,"—We have been totally consistent and have voted against it each time, which is more than we can say for any of the other parties. As I was saying, when John Howard was Treasurer in 1981, his government tried to tax building. Again, in 1993, we saw a proposed GST on building. The Democrats have always believed that shelter is one of the necessities of life. You can draw a distinction with expensive granite tops in kitchens, but a kitchen cupboard in a kitchen is part of essential shelter. For 15 years we have been consistent on this issue of sales taxes on the necessities of life.This package of bills does four things. First, it seeks to broaden the sales tax net to cover a wide range of building materials that were previously exempt; and, second, it seeks to restore the rate of tax on passenger motor vehicles from the concessional rate of 15 per cent to the general rate of 22 per cent. It is claimed that this reverses the anti-recessionary concession granted in One Nation in early 1992. We have talked to industry. It is true that the industry has recovered—and the Democrats will be supporting this measure.The third thing in the package is a number of measures designed to protect the sales tax base. That includes scaffolding, safes, racking, shelving, musical instruments and model aircraft. The Democrats will support this extension. The fourth thing the package seeks to do is increase the rate of sales tax on recycled paper from zero per cent to 22 per cent. The Democrats strenuously oppose this. Senator John Coulter will speak to this in detail.As I have stated, extending the sales tax net across building products is a breach of the governments pre-election commitments. Further, we believe the timing of such an extension is ill-judged and inappropriate. We have had a high interest rate policy under this government and we have the highest real interest rates in the OECD.The building industry is in free-fall at the moment. Housing commencements are down 34 per cent on their August peak. Unemployment in the construction industry has risen by 10,000, with Australias largest builder, A.V. Jennings, putting off 30 per cent of its work force since March. In 1996-97, commencements are expected to drop below 130,000, well below the anticipated demand of 152,000 recently set by the indicative planning council.This collapse of confidence in the industry is starting to bite. It is noticeable in the rental market where investors are simply refusing to invest in new stock. The result has been a slump in vacancy rates and a rising trend in rents. The vacancy rate in Sydney has halved in the last 12 months and, at 1.4 per cent, it is close to the worst point reached in the 1980s. Melbournes vacancy rate has fallen from five per cent at the beginning of 1994 to 2.4 per cent. In Perth it is down from 4.5 per cent to 2.9 per cent, while Brisbane and Adelaide are trending downwards at a slower pace. That rate usually means higher rents. In Melbourne, rentals are up 10 per cent in a year and Sydney agents are predicting a similar rise.We should not forget that the safety net is leaving renters behind because, in this budget, the government has cut funding for public housing. It has cut $6 million from rental assistance. Public housing starts are already down from 12,000, three years ago, to fewer than 7,000 this year. Waiting lists are rising; they are up by 37,000 in the last three reported years. That is a bit of a gloomy picture.On top of that, the government proposes a tax which would add about $1,000 to the cost of an average new house and about $700 to $800 to the cost of an average kit home in the $70,000 to $80,000 price range. I think it can be argued and demonstrated that, in this debate, the government has deliberately sought to underestimate the impact of this tax. Its $215 million revenue estimate has been shown to be wrong, while its price impact has also be shown to have been understated. For those reasons, the Democrats will be opposing this tax.I turn briefly to the issue of recycled paper, because I think the governments policy in this area is in an absolute shambles. Australia, by international standards, has a fairly good recycling record. It could be better. There remains strong consumer resistance to recycled products in stationery. Many types of office equipment, such as photocopiers, are still not able to take recycled paper without adjustments, and there remains a significant cost differential between recycled paper and paper made from virgin pulp. Despite all of this evidence, the government is determined to dampen demand for recycled paper products by making them more expensive. The government proposes to spend $4.5 million to persuade consumers to pay more for recycled paper and to persuade offices to collect more paper waste for recycling. There will be little or no point encouraging the collection of paper waste if there is no market for the product at the end of the day.We are told that, in removing this exemption, we are levelling the playing field on paper products. We keep being told about level playing fields across the board, but this is particularly incorrect. There is no level playing field on paper products. Virgin pulp products carry a very high environmental cost in terms of energy consumption and the pressure that they place directly and indirectly on native forests. As we have pointed out before innumerable times, the timber industry, especially in the logging of native forests, is propped up by massive government subsidies. The accumulated debts of the various forest services exceeded $5 billion. That is public money. A lot of our virgin pulp is still imported, exporting our environmental problems to other countries. If waste paper is not re-used, it adds to our own waste disposal problems. I really think a sound economic case as well as an environmental case can be put for supporting concessional tax treatment of recycled paper.The final issue I want to deal with is the role of the Senate with respect to budget bills. This week we have seen a constitutionally dubious attack from the Prime Minister on the role of the Senate in dealing with budget matters. Let me take this opportunity to answer him in a couple of respects. I need to point out to him that history has brought significant changes since 1975, and one is the existence of the Democrats. The Democrats do not support the blocking of supply. While we have the balance of power in the Senate, supply will not be blocked. There will not be a repeat of the 1975 constitutional crisis.The second point I need to make to the Prime Minister is the difference between taxation bills and supply bills. I am sure that he knew he was making an over-the-top claim. Nevertheless, I point out to him that the current Treasurer (Mr Willis) joined with the Democrats to block this same tax on building materials. That provoked our current Senate leader, Senator Gareth Evans, to give an excellent exposition to the Senate at the time on the difference between taxation bills and supply bills. Perhaps the Prime Minister needs to be reminded of these differences. In 1981 Senator Evans said:The relevant distinction . . . on the one hand Bills which are crucial to the survival of a government, and . . . on the other, those which do not satisfy that description. In the former category are undoubtedly those major supply and appropriation Bills . . . perhaps also in that category of packages of Bills . . . are some major taxing Bills, for example, Bills to establish the whole system of personal income tax . . . In the latter category are included those lesser money Bills which impose fees or fines or make particular appropriations of perhaps a few hundred thousand or even a few million dollars for some particular purpose, or Bills which impose taxes, generally speaking, and do not satisfy the description of being measures which are essential to the survival of the Government.The sales tax legislation . . . is undoubtedly in the latter category of lesser money bills which cannot be regarded on any analysis as essential to the survival of a government.He went on:It is not . . . unacceptable . . . for this Senate . . . to oppose the passage of Bills in respect of which the Government not only lacks an explicit mandate but also in respect to which, given its pre-election commitments, it has been profoundly dishonest and hypocritical.We could not say it better ourselves this time, could we? All of those arguments still stand.The denial of the $215 million extension to the sales tax via building materials will affect less than one-sixth of one per cent of the governments $124 billion revenue haul. It has had a negligible effect on interest rates. It will not affect the governments declared bond issuance target of $3 billion to $4 billion. It is quite clear that the governments policies which have caused a $27 billion current account deficit have a more significant impact on interest rates than the amount of $215 million. As a matter of fact, since the Democrats announced our position on the building tax two weeks ago, interest rates and bond rates on the financial markets have fallen further. So it was just a first stage in the psychological warfare that has been going on around this budget. Far from the Senate overplaying its hand, I think we find in this case that the government has overplayed its hand.The Democrats have had discussions with the government on alternative revenue options. The Treasurer sensibly says he will wait and see what happens to the budget at the end of this week before wishing to pursue further discussions. As I said, I think that is totally understandable. It also indicates to me, though, that it is not a huge issue at this point. I think the government has no mandate for taxing building. Also, it has no good economic argument to support the extension of that sales tax. As a result of the combined vote of the Democrats and the coalition, the government will have no building tax.","N/A","SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (EXCISE) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (CUSTOMS) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (GENERAL) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
70,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator TAMBLING","6E4","(Northern Territory)","NP","N/A",1951,"—We are debating today a package of bills relating to sales tax which are directly linked to the 1995-96 budget. As Senator Gibson and Senator Kernot said, the government did not listen to the very early messages that were sent with regard to this legislation and certainly made some shocking judgments in putting together the initial budget.I am very pleased that in his response two nights after the federal budget the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) made it patently clear that the federal opposition would not be a party to the impact of the sales tax on building materials and home ownership throughout Australia. It is good news that two weeks ago the Australian Democrats reached that same position and made their announcement.The budget implications that I will address today are confined to the aspects affecting building materials and home ownership. I suggest to people that they go back a week or so and look very carefully at the situation that surrounded the resignation of Mr Howe as the Deputy Prime Minister. There is a lot to do with this piece of legislation that has affected Mr Howes career and his status within the Labor Party. In coming months we will see his demise as the Minister for Housing and Regional Development as a consequence of these issues. Of course, we know that he is exiting the parliament at the next election.But I would argue that there was a budget collusion between the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, the Treasurer, Mr Willis, the Minister for Finance, Mr Beazley, and the housing minister, Mr Howe. That is very interesting when you look at the budget figures in this particular area. The amount of money allocated for the better cities mark 2 expenditure and the amount of money to be collected from this wholesale sales tax on building materials is strangely coincidental and almost identical—some $230 million to $240 million.This particular budget has been blatantly manipulated. I would love to have been a fly on the wall for some of the considerations that must have taken place because, as demonstrated to our estimates committees recently—and I will come to that a little later—there was no real proper consideration of how the estimates for this wholesale sales tax on building materials was calculated. There was no proper and appropriate assessment between the Department of Housing and Regional Development, the Department of Finance and the Australian Taxation Office. That was obviously not properly done and not properly constructed—and that has now become very obvious.This year, the government set out on a politically motivated budget—it set out to do no more than manipulate a so-called budget surplus. The inner sanctum of cabinet traded funds between certain programs knowing the gamble that it was taking—and that gamble is not paying off as was planned. Look at the interest rate philosophy—if you can call it that—of this government: it is nothing more than a series of inconsistent statements and there is no underlying principle whatsoever.A few moments ago, Senator Kernot referred to the way in which this government is handling the current account deficit and the lack of policy in that area where we are seeing the impact on interest rates that again have such a disastrous effect on housing. Of course, talking about deficits, we need only to look at this governments asset sales strategy to see that it is not going to be a budget that is going to result in a surplus. If anything, it will be a billion dollar plus deficit this year. It is a real shame that in so many of these areas on which the deficit impacts—housing affordability, rents and public housing waiting lists throughout Australia—the government is seeking to blame the opposition or the Australian Democrats for any adverse effects on interest rates. What a load of bunkum!I hope historians will have the opportunity to quiz Mr Howe who was then Deputy Prime Minister and housing minister to see the real effects and the strange deals that were done in putting together the patchwork mosaic of this years budget. No wonder Mr Howe has had to resign very early after the budget from his position as Deputy Prime Minister and give notice that he is on the way out in the other areas.The sales tax legislation proposes to modify sales tax law to remove the exemption from a range of certain building materials which, if the bill is passed in the Senate, will become taxable at a rate of 12 per cent from 1 July 1995. Thankfully, that looks like not happening. As Senator Kernot said, the bill is certainly a breach of faith that has been established against this government, against Mr Keating and his previous statements and against the intent of the housing minister, Mr Howe. Again I ask: why has Mr Howe walked away since February this year in the preparation of a major housing initiative statement to this parliament? It has been deferred month after month after month and is yet further evidence that he was shafted by the economic ministers in cabinet and was not able and is still not able to bring forward the housing initiative statement.The coalitions position in opposing these bills has been well documented since the governments announcement on budget night. The proposed wholesale sales tax raises financial barriers to home ownership and will add, as we have seen from the industry group representations made to many of us, about $1,000 to the cost of building a home. That is not to mention what it will add to the very extensive programs of renovation that most existing home owners throughout Australia engage in from year to year or the effects that it will have on people renting in both the public and private sectors. We have seen well-documented figures in that area.I would argue very strongly that low income earners, younger households and, at the other end of the spectrum, pensioners and retirees will be particularly hard hit if this legislation is to pass. There are no offsetting measures to compensate low income groups. The compensation deals that Mr Howe did were all in the better cities program and are all related to a totally different area, so they would not have a direct co-relationship. There have been some strange deals in that particular regard.This package of bills was referred to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, which met last Friday. At that public hearing industry bodies gave evidence about the detrimental effect that this tax will have on Australian home buyers, on those people who wish to maintain or renovate their existing homes and on the building industry in general throughout Australia.It is interesting to note that the whole committee, including the Labor members, stated that it had to draw the attention of the government to, firstly, the effect of sales tax on off-site manufacturing of bathroom and kitchen cabinets which may result in less efficient construction on site, thus negating the efficiency gains achieved by the industry; and, secondly, the need for transitional provisions relating to stock on hand in the building industry and more precise definitions for builders hardware. That was in the majority report, and that included the input of Labor members who were being critical of the government in that area.I will also turn to the excellent minority report that was put forward by my colleagues Senator Panizza and Senator Crane. They knew and were able to accept and see the more important issues that arise here. Both Senator Panizza and Senator Crane suggested that industry expected job losses resulting in skilled labour within the building industry diminishing; that the level of rental assistance would have to be increased to compensate low income earners for the sake of the new tax; and, thirdly, that for every worker losing his or her job with the building industry, one other in the supply manufacturer line would also lose his or her job. So Senator Panizza and Senator Crane very rightly pointed out that there were a lot of flow-on consequences that were going to be brought about by this particular legislation.The tax proposed by the government is a blatant attack on Australian home owners, home buyers and so many other people throughout the community. It will have a very wide effect across the entire community. I was absolutely staggered when Senator Cook, in his summing up at last Fridays committee hearing, stated:We are not aware of any convincing evidence that persuades us to in any way change the estimates we have given.He also said:. . . it is not simply a matter of imposing a tax, it is a question of improving the tax regime.Senator Cook obviously sat through last Fridays hearing with his ears closed. Obviously he was not listening to any of the evidence that was presented. His statement smacks of the same rhetoric wheeled out by Mr Keating when Treasurer back in 1988 when he was justifying extending the sales tax on bathroom fittings to adjust a couple of anomalies.The ministers of the government, whether it be the Prime Minister, Mr Howe or Senator Cook, obviously had a fixation with the deals that were done in the anterooms to budget cabinet. The coalition and the industry have continued to question the methodology used by the Labor government both for the estimated increased price of a home and for the revenue raised by the impost. The government has continued to refuse to reveal its calculation or its methodology on revenue raising. On the other hand, the housing industry has put together its calculations and its methodology and has put it on the table for scrutiny by all concerned. Senator Cook just waves it aside with the brush of a hand.The government appears to be unconvinced—not unconvinced, just damned ignorant. It is not prepared to accept good argument when it is put forward. The Treasurer, Mr Willis, has now admitted that he understated the tax on a new home. He had previously stated the tax would add up to $400 to the price of a new home, and, in parliament on 6 June, he admitted the figure was more likely to be $800 on a median home. They are his bodgie calculations, not related to any of the decent material that is obviously available. Senator Ian Macdonald in the Senate yesterday, when raising a question, produced evidence from a quantity surveyor in North Queensland that established that considerably higher costs would result in this particular area.The 1995-96 budget estimates that the revenue gain will be $215 million, $235 million in a full year and $245 million in 1996-97. It is strange that they are so widely different from what the industry is saying. The industry estimates that the revenue grab will be at least $576 million per year—2 1/2 times the governments estimates. We must surely question the methodology used by the government and Treasury.Let me take you back to the estimates hearing of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee of 5 June 1995. The Australian Taxation Office was asked about its involvement in estimating the revenue effects of this tax. The ATO stated:. . . in relation to this specific initiative, this matter was entirely in the hands of Treasury.The ATO was given very short notice—only a matter of days—of the prospect of some changes. Perhaps this was part of what Mr Howe was doing with his better cities trade-offs around the corridors of budget.The ATO did not have sufficient information at its disposal to fully estimate precisely all of the elements. Treasury went with its own estimates on these specific initiatives. There is no mention anywhere of any discussion or arrangement with or advice from the Department of Housing and Regional Development that ought to have been advising Minister Howe. Obviously, figures were plucked from the whiteboards of the budget cabinet.The Australian Taxation Office revealed that, in the area of sales tax: `Treasury is increasingly relying on its own revenue estimating models. The Australian Taxation Office and the Australian Treasury are obviously out of whack with each other and are not being properly consulted by the processes of budget cabinet.I would argue that these answers by the ATO reveal that the last minute manipulations of budget estimates now appear very well established and evident; that the Treasury had no intention of consulting either the Australian Taxation Office or industry on its methodology, and it certainly cannot be proven to be effective; and that the partnership between the ATO and Treasury of coming together and comparing their information, of generally agreeing on consistency between different techniques, has sorely broken down.The reason the ATO has been left out in the cold is purely political. I would ask: where was Mr Howes department in this process? There is no evidence whatsoever. Mr Howe has obviously been so frightened off by this entire escapade that he has resigned as Deputy Prime Minister and he has put in the never-never basket the major statement on housing initiatives.What have we seen lately in terms of the impact on housing? We have certainly seen the governments inconsistent and stupid policies with regard to interest rates having a huge impact on home buyers throughout Australia. We have certainly seen the effect on housing affordability and the cost of housing. This legislation will force up the cost of housing even further; that point is well-established and demonstrated. It would force up drastically the cost of renovation and improvement to homes. I argue that the people who would feel the effect of that most are Australias ageing population. Self-funded retirees and pensioners generally at that point in life make either major improvements to their home or change their home dwelling situation. The costs would be disastrous without any offsetting compensation.I do not believe I need to remind the chamber that, if implemented, this proposed new building tax will hit more than three million Australian households per year. Home ownership would be affected. Housing tenants would have to suffer the consequence of increased rentals. Public housing would have to face increasing pressures as more and more people enter the waiting lists. There would be pressures on state and territory governments.There would be so many consequences that it is patently obvious there is no alternative for this Senate but to reject this measure. I am pleased to see that the Australian Democrats have agreed with the initiatives of the coalition. On budget night and in Mr Howards response to the budget we outlined what we would do from day one. The government has cheated on the Australian public with regard to these proposals.The new sales tax on building products is totally unfair and unnecessary. This legislation ought therefore to fail, just as this government will surely fail in the eyes of the electorate when it next faces the Australian people.","N/A","SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (EXCISE) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (CUSTOMS) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (GENERAL) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
71,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator PANIZZA","JI4","(Western Australia)","LP","N/A",1955,"—I rise with pleasure to take part in this debate on the sales tax legislation. I take part in all debates on sales tax bills and tax bills generally in this place. Firstly, I want to address the sales tax on building materials. Let us go back to recent history—2 1/2 years ago—around the time leading up to the last federal election. Mr Acting Deputy President, you could probably remember the cry that went up from the Labor government of the time at our suggestion that we would impose a GST on building materials. If you remember back that far, you will know that there was going to be a 15 per cent GST on building construction. But that did not include labour. I forget by how much that was going to put up the price of a house at that time, but I remember that it caused a great furore. The government made sure that it told a lot of lies about our intentions.Two and a half years down the track, what has this government decided to do? It has decided to do exactly the same thing and apply a sales tax to building materials. Perhaps it can get away with it for the moment—I will address this in my speech before I finish—by saying that the effect of its increases will be a lot less than what we had intended. Our rise might have involved costs in the vicinity of $2,000 to $3,000.When I questioned the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) the other day at a legislation committee hearing dealing with sales tax, I pointed out these things to him. I pointed out what the Labor government had to say at the last election. I asked him for a good reason why it should bring the building industry into it by adding a sales tax to building materials. All he could say was that housing in Australia has never been more affordable.I have not often agreed with Senator Kernot but I think she blew that argument out of the water just 20 minutes ago. On the figures that she has, housing is nowhere near as affordable as the minister told me the other day. Senator Kernot also has figures to show that the vacancy rate has gone down. If housing, new or otherwise, is as affordable as the minister told us, you would think that rental vacancies would be higher. That is what normally happens.I remember the situation in 1985-86 when there was a big boom in building and a lot of young couples, just as they did in 1983-84, moved into houses. I am involved in rental units in Perth and I recall that at that time the vacancy rate in Perth went up to six or seven per cent and that rent went down.Senator Kernot pointed out that rent is going up and that, nationwide, the vacancy rate is down to an average of 2.5 per cent, while in Western Australia it is down to about two per cent. So how could the minister have sat there last Friday and told us that housing has never been more affordable?He was not right but let us suppose for one minute that he was because that would put the lie to how well this government is going. If houses are more affordable, if the cost of construction is coming down because of demand, that means people, especially young people, have no confidence in the future, particularly of this government.The minister told us that there was an overrun in the building of new houses. If you take that together with this supposedly greater affordability, you would think that people would be moving into first houses left, right and centre, but they are not. You cannot have it both ways. Either people have no confidence in the government and in its economic future or houses are not more affordable.The governments impact statement said that this new measure would add only $400 to the cost of building a new house. There is plenty of evidence to the contrary, and Senator Tambling has just contributed to that. We had a submission from the Housing Industry of Australia and the Master Builders Association to the effect that this measure would add 1.1 per cent to the cost of a median house. A median house is presently costed at $95,000 by averaging the cost of the cheapest kit home up to the so-called luxury homes.By my calculations, using the estimate of an additional 1.1 per cent, that adds up to an extra $1,400 on the cost of a new home. Yet we were told by this government that this measure would add only $400 to the total cost, raising $215 million in revenue in 1995-96 and $249 million in 1996-97. That is totally wrong. The quantity surveyors have evaluated the situation with regard to the median house and have shown that this measure will raise a far bigger revenue figure than even I have estimated. The governments figure is a total lie.A circular was sent to all Labor members of parliament—not to us, of course—in which it was admitted that the rise in the cost of a house because of the sales tax increase would be around $1,200. The Labor Party members were also told how to explain it away. We have received evidence from the Housing Industry Association and the Master Builders Association of Australia. Builders employ quantity surveyors and are in a better position to tell us the facts than the people from Treasury who appeared before the committee last Friday. The government tells us that this measure will raise $249 million in a full year but we have evidence that it will raise $576 million.It is not going to be any different from any other new tax. At the last election this government told us that there would be no new taxes and no increased taxes. We can go back to the days when this government introduced the capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax. The estimation of revenue from those taxes was very much at the low end but it was doubled and trebled in good time. This government has a history of underestimating the revenue received from new taxes.The coalitions proposed GST may have caused the price of a house to rise by something like $2,000. When this government admitted that the increased cost of a house was around $1,200 it left something out. I believe it was left out by design because it comes under a different bill—the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill. This concerns the diesel fuel levy. We are about to be hit with another massive increase in taxes. The rebate on diesel fuel used in the mining of clay for bricks and for firing the bricks when the clay is in the furnace will be removed.","N/A","SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (EXCISE) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (CUSTOMS) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (GENERAL) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

73,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator PANIZZA","JI4","(Western Australia)","LP","N/A",1955,"—I was coming to that. I am glad you reminded me, Senator Tambling. When the legislation goes through the manufacturers of clay bricks will no longer have the diesel fuel levy rebate. The same situation applies to those who mine the clay.I do not read out a lot of letters that I receive from industrial unions in Australia, but I will read out one that I have here because it seems to stick out. It is a letter from the Federated Brick, Tile and Pottery Industrial Union of Australia. The letter was sent to the minister, but it was drawn to my attention as well. The letter reads:We understand that the Budget will result in a withdrawal of diesel fuel rebates for the Mining of Clay used in the production of Clay Bricks. As over 95% of houses built in Perth—that includes the whole state of Western Australia—are constructed of double brick, the vast majority of which are double clay brick, we consider the withdrawal of the diesel fuel rebates to be an unnecessary additional cost which will inevitably lead to increases in the cost of housing in Perth—as well as in the rest of the state because we have transport costs as well—Very clearly such costs increases will be an addition to the substantial cost increase for new home construction arising from the new 12% sales tax on builders hardware.This letter is from one of your own unions. The letter did not have the full quotation, so I then took the liberty of ringing the union—and it is probably the first time I have rung an industrial union in my life, except when I ring them now and again to tell them to get off the backs of my employees—and I found out that the union estimates the increase is approximately $2,000 for an average house.","N/A","SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (EXCISE) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (CUSTOMS) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (GENERAL) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

You have $1,200 that we have pointed out already—and there is another item that I have to mention—plus $2,000, which makes the increase $3,200. We are now well ahead of what was proposed by the GST, which was lied about so much when the election was on.There is another item that I have not mentioned yet, and this came out in evidence before the committee last Friday. When builders have to put something extra into a house or they have to make an extra charge—whether he pays on your behalf the rates or the building permits that you get from the shire council—they have to put that in their book work. Whether you are putting in an extra window, an extra cupboard or something like that that was not in the original plan, they generally charge a builders margin. The builders margin goes up and down, depending on what the state of play is in the building industry, whether or not it is buoyant. I can tell you, from my building experience, that it is 15 per cent. You have to add on another 15 per cent. If you put 15 per cent on the whole $3,000, you arrive at $3,450. In that quick summation, I have probably forgotten a few other things.There are some figures around from quantity surveyors, and we have the figures from a quantity surveyor from Queensland. A quantity surveyor has to be spot-on—he is expected to be within two per cent with his estimation. The building industry can be rather competitive, and a quantity surveyor who is out on his quotations, I do not think, will get too many more jobs.I have calculated already, without other things, that the increase would be up around $3,450. That is the situation as far as the sales tax on building materials is concerned. That is why the coalition decided on budget night that we would be opposing it.I would like to mention another point, and that is the effect of the building downturn on employment—and I am sure the government is interested in employment, as it believes it is going to get employment down to some reasonable level if it does happen to be in government much longer, which will not be the case. You must remember that the building industry has a multiplier factor of two. In other words, if one person loses their job in the building industry, one person down the line—whether it is in transport, manufacture or building materials—will also lose their job.I showed to the previous minister at the table, Senator Bolkus, two charts on the effect on employment in Australia.

It has succeeded, so now you are going to turn it around completely and undo whatever success you had at the time, plus add another one per cent. It is just like when the government—I think it was two budgets ago, or it might have been the last budget—increased the levy on leaded fuel to encourage people to change into newer, more efficient cars, which use less unleaded petrol and cause less pollution and all of that. What is the government doing now? Some people, especially young people, were saving to buy a new car. What did this government do? It put another five per cent tax on new cars, plus another one per cent because of indexation.I would briefly like to address the matter of air safety bags in cars. The air safety bag is a very efficient way of preventing loss of life in head-on collisions. Just like any other item in a car, they are taxed. The cost of an air bag will rise from 15 per cent to 22 per cent, adding over $100 to the cost of an air bag. There is evidence relating to the cost of road crashes in Australia. A minor accident costs $6,000, a moderate accident costs $25,000, a serious accident costs $58,000, a severe accident costs $201,000, a critical accident costs $427,000 and a fatal accident costs $479,000. There is evidence to show that air bags will bring down the amount of fatalities by at least seven or eight per cent. So it is very easy to see the cost benefit of fitting an air bag into a car, especially for the driver, to prevent those fatalities which happen as a result of a head-on collision, with the head hitting the steering wheel and killing people on the spot. At least the encouragement of fitting air bags would reduce the number of fatalities in Australia in road accidents and the cost to society.In summing up, the government stands condemned for the increase in the sales tax, especially on building materials. It stands condemned for the lies that were told about the effect of it. From what I have heard from the Democrats, that income will be denied to it, and that is what this bill deserves.","N/A","SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (EXCISE) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (CUSTOMS) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (GENERAL) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start[5]/para","N/A","N/A"
79,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COULTER","TF4","(South Australia)","AD","N/A",1959,"—I wish to pick up where Senator Panizza left off. It is untrue that the opposition is opposing all tax increases. The issue that I want to take up in this legislation is that the one tax increase—which is related to a very important environmental matter—that this government is imposing on recycled paper, from zero to 22 per cent, is the one the opposition is supporting. That is the point that I want to stress in my speech this afternoon.The opposition clearly has not been supporting the interests of small businesses, which are mainly involved in the recycled paper trail. It has bent to the pressure from the large paper manufacturers—the monopoly paper manufacturers in Australia—and is therefore supporting the increase in sales tax on recycled paper because those large manufacturers do not have a great deal of interest, which I will demonstrate in this speech today, in making paper from recycled fibre. The opposition is supporting that tax increase. The government is actually proposing that tax increase and moving against a very important environmental measure.When I spoke on the appropriation bills in this chamber only a few days ago and when Senator Margetts spoke yesterday in relation to competition policy, we were both emphasising the need to relate taxes to policy, to make taxes an instrument of policy and to use taxes as a way of guiding your society in a desirable direction so that you increase the taxes on certain activities which are regarded as undesirable—the activities that you want to discourage—and you place bounties in the way of those industries and those activities that you want to encourage. This is one of the principal ways you actually move your society in a desirable direction. Strictly speaking, it is also in accord with the proper interpretation of modern economics—as Senator Margetts, who was debating this point yesterday, said—that is, to internalise the externalities.In the making of paper we do very considerable damage to our forests. We cut down our forests, we make them into paper, send the paper to the tip or burn it and then we cut down some more trees. There is a very significant cost involved in doing that. There is a cost in terms of loss of resources and environmental damage, consequent upon the processes which are used in the manufacture of the paper, and a considerable environmental cost in the disposal of the paper if it is not recycled. Those costs have to appear somewhere in the product so that consumers will make the correct choices.Economics tells us that people are basically driven by greed; they will buy their goods and services for the least possible cost. While we do not accept that, that is the economic theory. If intelligent decisions according to that model are going to be made then the right price signals have to be given to potential consumers. The right price signals are the prices which include the full costs; not only the direct costs of manufacture and distribution but the environmental costs which are generally borne elsewhere in the community. Those costs include the costs of resource depletion, the costs of water and air pollution, the costs of collection of garbage and the cost of landfill in terms of the loss of amenity and space in the urban area. All those costs should be represented in a proper economic system in the price of paper.What we find is that this government does not accept that as a principle. This government has totally divorced the idea of taxation from the idea of furthering policy. The government sees tax simply as a way of raising revenue wherever it can get that revenue, irrespective of the consequences in terms of the direction in which it leads our society. It sees policy as something quite separate.Indeed, we have the ridiculous situation with respect to recycled paper in which the government is evidently saving somewhere between $5 million and $10 million depending upon the way the tax is finally rigged. Yet, it is spending approximately $5 million to encourage people to use recycled paper. If the government really believed its economic rationalist rhetoric it would recognise that if the cost of the recycled paper goes up as a consequence of the imposition of the 22 per cent tax, then it is asking people to act against their own self-interest, according to its own economic model.The government is going to spend $5 million of our money to encourage us to do something which is against what we are supposed to be doing; that is, behaving as economically rational people by buying paper for the least cost. I have a few figures here which indicate this fact. They also indicate the way the industry—which is being encouraged by the government and the opposition—has moved recently, not only to anticipate this increase in tax on recycled paper but to positively discourage people from using recycled paper.I have been written to by a constituent who pointed out that in his office in May 1994 recycled paper from Australian Paper was selling for $5 per ream. By February 1995 the cost had gone up to $5.81, an increase of 16.2 per cent. After the exemption is lifted, it will go to $6.91, an increase of 38.2 per cent; whereas, with non-recycled paper, just to take one example, Copyright paper in May 1994 cost $5.67. That was more expensive in May 1994 than the recycled paper, which sold for $5. By February 1995, the cost of Copyright paper had risen to $6.28, an increase of only 10.8 per cent compared with 16.2 per cent for the recycled product, bringing the prices closer together. After the sales tax exemption is lifted, it will rise to $6.28, an increase of only 10.8 per cent. In other words, it will be the same price as in February 1995.In that case, the recycled paper cost $6.91 per ream, whereas the copyright paper cost only $6.28 per ream. Which economic rationalist—I say `which because I would not say that these are fully human people who behave in this economic rationalist way—would pay $6.95 for recycled paper when the non-recycled product could be bought for $6.28? The $5 million which the government intends to spend to encourage recycling will be totally ineffective and a waste of money.Some years ago, on behalf of the Australian Democrats I first moved an amendment to remove sales tax on paper made from recycled fibre. The government and the opposition combined even then to vote against this eminently environmentally sensible move. Within only a few short weeks, the government, evidently wanting a few greenie points from the conservation movement, saw the pragmatic political stupidity of such a move and introduced legislation very similar to that which it voted against only a short time before. It removed the sales tax on recycled paper.Several years later in the 1993 budget, the government sought to reimpose the tax on recycled paper. Evidently at that stage it felt that it could do without the conservation vote. It did not genuinely care for the environment; it was simply using this as a measure to look good with the environment groups. As honourable senators will recall, in 1993, with the opposition opposing every part of the budget, the Democrats were in quite a strong position to bargain with the government. We went in and bargained with Mr John Dawkins, the then Treasurer, and we were successful in getting in place a bounty scheme which in the first year exactly equalled the sales tax. In other words, sales tax would be paid on recycled paper of 20 per cent and the manufactures would get in return a 20 per cent bounty. In the second year, that bounty was reduced to 15 per cent and in the third year 10 per cent. That bounty scheme has now ceased and is no longer available. The sales tax on certain of those products is now back at 22 per cent without any relief whatsoever. The government is seeking to increase the sales tax on those products to 22 per cent and for a range of other products which are currently totally sales tax exempt from nought to 22 per cent so that there is an across-the-board sales tax of 22 per cent on all paper, whether made from recycled material or not.Our record in this regard is absolutely impeccable. As was the case in the building materials debate, we have been absolutely consistent that the taxation measures put in place should reflect government policy. If you want society to move towards ecologically sustainably development, you must internalise those external costs. The one way open to government to do that is through the taxation system. The taxation system must be used as an instrument of policy and as a way of internalising those externalities, those environmental costs that do not appear directly in the cost of manufacture or distribution of a good or service.We will therefore be moving amendments when we get to the committee stage. I forewarn the Senate that we will put forward two sequential amendments. The first set of amendments—and this is our preferred position—will seek to remove the sales tax totally from all paper products made from recycled fibre. However, if the government and the opposition are not minded, as we believe they are not, to accept that amendment, we will seek to amend the legislation in such a way that there will be an across-the-board 11 per cent sales tax on all products made from recycled fibre. In other words, the concessional rate would apply to all those products which are made from recycled paper. This would still maintain a differential in the taxation between the products made from recycled paper and those which are made from virgin fibre, those products which have a very significant impact on the environment. So that there is no confusion in this rather difficult area of legislation, I foreshadow that that is the procedure we will follow. We will move one and then, if the first one is not accepted, we will move the other one.I make an appeal to the opposition, which has claimed very loudly in the community that it is opposing all tax increases in this budget, to honestly implement what it has claimed and not to differentiate between or drag out of that claim paper made from recycled paper. It should not accept the governments increase in this area. If the opposition is seeking, as the government did some years ago, to get some support from the conservation groups, this is a very low cost way of doing it—that is, to support the Democrats amendments, to be honest in what it has claimed and not to support this vicious increase in the tax on paper made from recycled fibre.Of course, as far as the government is concerned, its proposal is environmentally damaging, it is irresponsible and it is inconsistent with its proposed implementation of ecologically sustainable development. But we have known for a long time that the government is really not committed to ESD. The government is committed only to the rhetoric of ESD and not to implementing the hard decisions which would underline the implementation of ESD policies, one of which is to differentiate by way of taxation between products made from recycled materials and products made from virgin materials.I forewarn the Senate of those amendments which we will be moving. I plead with both the government and the opposition to see the good environmental sense in what the Democrats will be proposing by way of amendment and to support our amendments when the time comes.","N/A","SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (EXCISE) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (CUSTOMS) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (GENERAL) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/debate.sub1/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
80,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CRANE","UW4","(Western Australia)","LP","N/A",1962,"—I, too, would like to contribute to this debate on the sales tax legislation. I begin my comments by saying that I have just come back from the pork producers rally at the front of Parliament House. That industry is a good example of what happens to an industry through high taxing and high cost policies. Of course, this sales tax legislation is about putting further taxation imposts on people. We all know that the pork producers have problems with the importation of Canadian pork. I certainly believe that countervailing duties should be applied to those imports. Of course, the countervailing legislation in this country is not satisfactorily picking up those problems.What do the problems of pork producers have to do with this legislation? If this country had a cost structure comparable to that of the Canadian producers, they would be unable to afford to get that pork over here and put it into the market, despite their subsidies. Yet, while this nation continues policies which effectively tax out of business so much of our productive sector year after year, month after month, week after week and day after day, we will continue to see these sorts of problems.We have the ridiculous situation in this country where the `Made in Australia label does not mean made in Australia. That also applies to the imported pork. I know that pork production is subsidised in Canada, but even when it arrives here and is put on the Australian market, it wears the label `Made in Australia. What is going on?Last Friday at the estimates committee hearing a number of surprising aspects of the budget were raised. I refer to the imposition of sales tax on building materials. Apart from hearing evidence on the general items of taps, cupboards, hinges, locks, doors and a whole range of other items, I found it remarkable that the government is also imposing a sales tax on such things as safety items.The issue of sales tax on air safety bags in cars was raised by Lauchlan McIntosh of the motor car association or some such similarly named body. Why is the government taxing this safety measure? The government is also imposing a sales tax on safety locks fitted to medicine cupboards to prevent access by children and on safety locks for cots. Going through these issues, one must question the morality of the sales tax regime. Why is the government going down this path?Then there is the vexed question of what cost the increased sales tax on building materials will add to a so-called average home. I have not seen too many average homes that sell for much under $130,000. However, we were given evidence that on a house costing $95,000, item by item, the 12 per cent sales tax would increase the price by $1,040. There would be very few places in Australia where you could actually buy a new home for $95,000. In fact, looking at a family three bedroom home, you would pay much closer to $150,000 even in the cheaper suburbs of our capital cities.In Western Australia, Perth is not noted as being a high-cost housing place. One only has to go around and have a look at what is on the market to find that the figure of $150,000 is about the cheapest one will currently pay. One can get a one-bedroom unit for about $110,000 to $120,000, but that could hardly be classified as a family home. I challenge the figures that have been presented to us in this place by a number of ministers as they are very loose indeed. I believe they are, plainly, wrong. One can see that the impact of this measure will be much greater on a family with three or four children.Really, it comes back to a fundamental point. One has to look at this in the total context of the budget. We find in the budget, and it is worth repeating, that the total tax take has increased from $103 billion to $117 billion in round figures. In actual fact there is a total tax increase coming out of this years budget of $13.7 billion. The problem this government has is that it is not prepared to bite the bullet as far as expenditure is concerned. That $13.7 billion is the largest taxation increase in any one year in the history of this nation.I put it to the government in terms of this legislation, and the coalition has made its position absolutely clear on it from day one, that this is a very ill-conceived tax indeed. Although it took them some time to get to a position, I am pleased to see that the Australian Democrats are now supporting us in this area. Other evidence given to us stated that extra revenue would be in the order of $235 million in 1995-96 and $249 million in 1996-97, but the committee received research that demonstrated that the figure could well be double that amount.One could raise many aspects regarding this legislation, but there is one other thing I wish to raise. We need to have a fundamental change in direction regarding costs in Australia. To address that we need to look very carefully at the expenditure side of the budget. We need to take some action on the expenditure side of the budget so that the cost to industry, the cost to individuals and the overall structures under which we operate come more into line with those nations we compete with.I am glad to see that Senator Bob Collins has come into the chamber at this particular time because, as we know, he has the responsibility for primary industry.","N/A","SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (EXCISE) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (CUSTOMS) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (GENERAL) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/debate.sub1/speech[6]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

82,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CRANE","UW4","(Western Australia)","LP","N/A",1962,"—I am always pleased to see you. I will repeat what I said at the start. Despite the problem pork producers have with the dumping or countervailing—and I think there is a combination in that regard—if our cost structures in this country were similar to those of Canada, the Canadians would not be able to get the pork into Australia to sell it competitively.The taxing regime is part of the problem, the industrial and processing systems are part of the problem and our inspection arrangements are part of the problem. Those arrangements are currently being addressed, and I acknowledge that. But we have to attack all these fronts. Australia would not need to import pork if we had comparable cost structures for our producers.The diesel fuel excise legislation will come up for debate shortly. We have managed to claw back much of what was taken away, but not all. This is an example of our adverse cost structures. When we compare what producers overseas have to pay for fuel and the impact that that has on their cost, one has to question very strongly the direction that this government has taken in recent years to lower our costs across the board. The way we will beat imports is not by technical legislation, which will be contested in the courts; we can and will beat the problem if we get a cost structure that allows us to compete at the same level as producers overseas.","N/A","SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (EXCISE) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (CUSTOMS) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (GENERAL) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/debate.sub1/speech[6]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
83,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator SHORT","DJ4","(Victoria)","LP","N/A",1963,"—I want to say a few words on these sales tax bills that are before the Senate at the moment and to supplement and fully support the remarks of my colleagues who have spoken in this debate. These bills continue the lies and deceit in the whole area of taxation policy of this Keating Labor government. I am sure Australians will remember that, in the 1993 election campaign, Labors sole campaign strategy was opposition to a new indirect tax—remember the no GST campaign of the Labor Party?—despite the fact that that campaign ignored that the introduction of a GST was to be part of a major restructuring of the tax system which would make it more modern and more efficient and would lower the overall taxation burden.It is therefore amazing that we are today debating bills which increase and broaden the governments major indirect tax base, which is the highly inefficient and discriminatory wholesales sales tax. It should also be remembered that this is the second time in just three years that we have been debating in this place massive sales tax increases, despite the election promise of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in 1993 `not to put up tax.In these bills before us, sales tax on motor vehicles is increased. It is up from 15 per cent to 21 per cent, which is a six per cent increase. But it is six per cent on 15 per cent, which means that the sales tax is going up by more than one-third. From 1 July certain building materials, if the measure were to be passed, will be taxed for the first time, at 12 per cent. The bills also remove the exemption on certain recycled paper products, which means a further tax increase in that area. Taxes on safes, musical instruments and ornaments are going up to 11 per cent. The tax on scaffolding, racking and shelving will go to 22 per cent from 1 July. Even the tax on model aircraft will be going to 22 per cent from 1 July.Taking the last two- or three-year period, these measures cap off almost the greatest range of tax increases in Australias history. They certainly cap off the greatest electoral deceit in Australias history. Everything that this government has done in the area of taxation since the last election has involved virtually breaking off all the promises that it made prior to the election and on which it was elected. The government has no mandate for virtually any of these tax measures.In February 1992, the government cut the sales tax on motor vehicles from the then 20 per cent to 15 per cent. That cut at that time was stated quite categorically as being a permanent reduction. The government said that it would not be reversed after the election, yet it now has been. It is another broken promise from this government.In the lead-up to the 1993 election, Labor government ministers, including, in particular, the Prime Minister, promised not to broaden the indirect tax base. They would not have a broad consumption tax in any shape or form. In fact, they already did in the form of the wholesale sales tax. But, as I said at the start of my remarks, that wholesale sales tax is a nightmare of complication and discrimination between different items. Because of its discrimination, it is unfair, inequitable and very costly for the payers of sales tax to comply with. It leads to a huge range of anomalies, which, as we know, very frequently finish up in very costly disputes with the Australian Taxation Office. Those disputes frequently end up in the courts at great cost to all concerned and the overall efficiency of business in Australia.Having failed to get rid of the wholesale sales tax, and having done virtually nothing to improve its efficiency and reduce its inequities, the government has now added to the disaster of the wholesale sales tax system by expanding it to cover a number of items, which I have already mentioned, that are currently exempt from such tax. That does constitute the breaking of a seemingly very firm promise by the government before the election that there would be no new taxes.This extension and broadening of the wholesale sales tax system will result in new taxes to a range of goods that were not formerly taxed. There is no way that the government can avoid the charge that this is a broken promise and that it did lie to the Australian people before the election about its real intentions so far as taxation was concerned.Since 1992-93, which was the last election year, sales tax has risen from $9.3 billion, or $9,252 million to be exact, to an estimated figure for this next financial year of $14,160 million. That is an increase of $6,000 million, or 53 per cent, over a three-year period, and it has occurred in the life of just one parliament. We have to go back to the Whitlam years of economic infamy—those times that absolutely wrecked the Australian economy for many years thereafter—to find anything approaching the tax rip-off that has occurred in the life of this present parliament.I remind the Senate again that in December 1992 the Prime Minister promised to not put up tax. In real terms, sales tax has been increased in real terms in each of the succeeding three years by 11.4 per cent, 9.5 per cent and 18 per cent respectively. That adds up to an increase in the total tax take from indirect tax over that three-year period of 53 per cent, which is half as high again as it was just three years ago.This package of tax bills should be called the sales tax (broken promises, electoral deceit and government lies) amendment bill 1995, because that is what these bills represent. They are major contributors this year to the government increasing its revenue in percentage terms by the second highest amount since the Whitlam budget of 1973-74. Only once in the ensuing 22 years have we had an increase in total revenue of a higher percentage than we are having this year. That one exception in those last 22 years was the Hawke government budget in 1983, when the total revenue intake, due to a budget of massive tax hikes, went up by a whisker more than it has this year.Taking the total tax revenue for this year and last year into account, the total increase in revenue for the two-year period will be higher than at any time since those years of economic infamy and wreckage of the Whitlam government. It is a very serious matter because it increases the cost structure and makes business less competitive. It makes it very much more difficult for businesses to earn a profit, to be able to save, to invest and to create the jobs we need if we are to get out of the economic mire that we are in.I use the word `mire advisedly. Look at the underlying problems of this economy. We have virtually the lowest savings of any country in the industrialised world. We are at an almost record low with savings by our own historical standards. We have a huge debt to the rest of the world of $165,000 million that is mounting daily. When this crowd opposite came into office 12 years ago that debt was of the order of $20,000 million to $23,000 million, so there has been an eightfold increase in our debt to foreigners over that period. There is no single action that any government can take to lessen a nations independence and real sovereignty more than to put it into hock to the rest of the world, as this government has done.This government stands condemned on its performance record over the last dozen years. The great tragedy for the economy and for every Australian is that this budget, and these tax bills which are an important part of the overall budget package, will compound that problem. That is why the coalition, on behalf of the Australian people, will very strongly oppose the major items in this package of tax bills.Debate interrupted.","N/A","SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (EXCISE) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (CUSTOMS) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (GENERAL) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/debate.sub1/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

85,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator TIERNEY","O15","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A",1965,"—Today I rise on the very serious issue of long-term unemployment in this country. When voters are polled to find out what they see as the most important issue, unemployment comes out at the top time and time again. This was understandable during this governments long recession which extended from 1990 to 1993, but it is interesting that the public still quite correctly perceives that the greatest issue facing this country is unemployment. The most disadvantaged group within the list of unemployed is the long-term unemployed.According to the government, we have 263,000 people classified as long-term unemployed in this country. When we have come out of previous recessions the long-term unemployed have pretty much stayed long-term unemployed. However, on this occasion the official figures show that the numbers have been reduced quite dramatically.Today I want to expose this sham. The reality is that the numbers of long-term unemployed are not declining dramatically; they are declining to some extent. By a whole range of measures, including defining people off the list, the government has created a situation where we have the illusion of a reduction in long-term unemployment. This is extremely dangerous because it lulls people into a false sense of security. People think, `Oh, this major problem is at last being solved. We can stop worrying about that. They direct their attention away from it. That is very dangerous because long-term unemployment is creating an underclass of very underprivileged people in this country. If that persists, and if it grows over a long period of time, it can threaten the whole fabric of our society. That is what is so deceitful about the governments action.From his very close analysis of the figures, Dr David Kemp has been able to reveal that the governments white paper and the various programs on unemployment based on the white paper are currently in tatters. This came out very strongly in the budget. The government tried to put it forward as a victory by saying, `We have solved the problem. We dont have to spend as much on these sorts of programs.The reality was that the private sector was starting to reduce unemployment. In its attempt to come up with programs like case management, the government was not able to get the programs in place in time to spend the money that was actually there. What the government did was very deceitful. The government was not cutting real items in the budget; it was cutting off the forward estimates of what it thought it was going to spend and parading this as being responsible economic management. The government claims it will cut $1.2 billion from Working Nation over the coming four years.I remind the Senate that this program had been in place for only one year. The government is back-pedalling on a program largely because of its failure; a failure which it is trying to hide from this nation. Working Nation is not working. The only thing that is working is the ALP propaganda machine and its objective is to conceal the truth from Australians. It is an attempt to churn the unemployment queues, transferring people from one scheme to another and changing their official status. But that does not get rid of the reality. The situation facing the long-term unemployed—whether they be on official lists or hidden—still remains a disaster.Another feature of this governments strategy on this matter is to mislead the nation. That was driven home to me recently when I sat rather open-mouthed in a public auditorium in Brisbane, listening to a speech by a local member Wayne Swan, at a conference on unemployment. He was crowing about how successful the governments strategies were. He said, in opening the conference, `We are leading the world with our approach to labour market intervention. I thought it was absolutely amazing that at a conference on unemployment—that was the whole focus—this member, who, I think, is chair of the caucus economics committee, was actually misleading these voters, who are also the major players in the field, about the situation for the long-term unemployed. I could hardly restrain myself at the conference, but I did manage to do so.As the proceedings are being broadcast today, I thought the Senate would be a better forum in which to raise this matter, so that the whole nation can learn about this deception and we can put this permanently on the record. Allow me to clinically dissect how Mr Swan misled people on this issue. Labor claims that the number of long-term unemployed has actually fallen by 25 per cent in the last year. That is not only untrue but also is a dishonest misrepresentation. Labor keeps trotting out that the number of long-term unemployed has fallen from 351,000 to 263,200. It trumpets this as a huge fall of 44 per cent in the long-term unemployed, particularly that group aged from 15 to 19.Dr David Kemp, in particular, has nailed down this fraud. His persistent questioning of Minister Crean has revealed the stark truth. The Senate estimates questioning of DEET has played a part in exposing these facts. This ALP government has had to admit that about half of the so-called dramatic fall in long-term unemployment is shonky. It is the result of reclassifying people after they have been through a job program. They are reclassified, even though at the end of those programs those people are still out of work. This political scam is laid bare for all to see.About 70,000 of the long-term unemployed in this country are in short-term labour market intervention programs for about 13 weeks. That is the same labour market program as Wayne Swan was lauding in Brisbane the other day. When they participate in job training with skillshare, newstart or jobtrain, they are stripped of their long-term unemployed status. They lose the benefit of the extra assistance offered to the most disadvantaged if, at the end of that process, they still have no job.They go through a six months training and job program and if, at the end of that, they do not get a job they go back into the queue, but at the end of the queue. They are no longer part of the long-term jobless. Often these are people who might have been out of work for two or three years. They get six months of training and work experience but—guess what?—at the end of it, they are no longer classified as long-term unemployed. This is the way the government has managed to bring down this figure. It is artificial, and it is a sham.These people who have gone from the front of the job queue to the back of the job queue are given false hopes under these programs, and they end up being kicked in the teeth and are back in the dole queue. The only transparent winner in all of this is this ALP government, which has undertaken this exercise. It is able to then claim falsely that long-term unemployment numbers are falling.All of these Australians who are in this situation become demoralised pawns in this Labor governments pre-election plans to give the wrong impression that its job programs are working. So far I have discussed only the official unemployed. When you add in, as you must, the people who are the hidden unemployed—and those people have simply given up—the problem for this country and for those individuals becomes immense.The reclassification of people without finding them work is a cruel hoax. It destroys the will of these people to succeed. The long-term unemployed, who are stripped of that status after training for 13 weeks, are big losers. They lose out in the following ways: they lose the one-to-one case management because they are back on the job queue; they lose the first choice of jobs and further training placement; and under the jobs compact, they lose attractive job subsidies of up to $12,000 to employers who might take on the most disadvantaged. Having had their go at it, they go back to the back of the queue and they have to wait before they become eligible under the long-term unemployment programs again. Honourable senators can imagine the effect on the morale of these people. It is all because the government is out to create an illusion which will score them political points at the expense of some of the most disadvantaged people within the community.There was a story in the Sydney Morning Herald on 5 June reporting evidence given to the Senate estimates hearing when we questioned DEET earlier this month. That revealed another government deception in the long-term unemployed area. Up to 17,000 spouses will now be added to the unemployment numbers. The unemployment spouses will be transferred from their existing DSS payments and registered with the CES from 1 July. Finally, the spouses of the unemployed will now be properly identified as being unemployed as well. These are 17,000 unemployed people formerly hidden by the ALP government. This measure seems like some honesty from Labor, but when we look further, the hand of deception appears once again. Always on the lookout to distort the long-term unemployment figures, the government is unashamedly at it again with this matter.According to DEETs first assistant secretary from the employment program, a big percentage of the spouses will not be classified as long-term unemployed; they will only be said to be at risk of long-term unemployment if their spouses have been without work for 12 months or more. Even if their spouses have been out of work for many years or never worked, they will be denied the classification of long-term unemployed and therefore denied those programs and benefits that are associated with it. Why? Because this Labor government is determined to keep the long-term unemployment figure artificially down, totally for political reasons.Again, some of the most seriously disadvantaged people in the community go back to the rear end of the unemployment queue and are denied special help. This is a glaring example of Mr Swans world class labour market intervention program. The reality is that Labor offers a merry-go-round of deception. This government has proved masterful at concealing the truth and its cruel policies are a hoax on the long-term unemployed.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1[1]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

88,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator KEMP","WW4","(Victoria)","LP","N/A",1968,"—We have adjournment debates every night and we have the lunchtime debates. I have not heard one Labor member of parliament get up and discuss the serious problem of long-term unemployment in this country. It is an astonishing example of what the new Keating Labor Party is about. I certainly congratulate my colleague Senator Tierney for his continued interest in and pursuit of this issue.I rise to speak about the governments media hit squad, the National Media Liaison Service. Honourable senators would be aware that this has been a continuing matter of controversy in this chamber and elsewhere, with reference to the expenditure of $1.5 million per annum on the National Media Liaison Service, often referred to as `aNiMaLS. Its purported purpose is to provide accurate and timely information on government programs but, in actual fact, it seems to have spent much of its time, money and resources in following and attempting to embarrass the opposition. There has been a purpose in a number of Senate estimates hearings to inquire further into just what this service has been doing.During the Senate adjournment debate on 19 June I made a speech in which I outlined my very great concerns that Senator McMullan had misled this chamber and, indeed, misled the Senate estimates committee regarding the nature of Mr Epsteins employment and his title. By way of background, at an earlier Senate estimates hearing we had asked Mr Epstein to table his contract, which Mr Epstein claimed showed that he was the director of the Ministerial Media Group. As it turned out, when the document was tabled it showed no such thing.It is no coincidence, I suggest, that on the following day, 20 June, Mr Epstein received a letter from Mr Frank Walker telling him that Mr Walker had decided to establish a position of director, National Media Liaison Service, so the duties that Mr Epstein was performing in relation to the National Media Liaison Service would not continue. On 22 June, when we again pursued the matter of the National Media Liaison Service, Senator McMullan said among other things that the document which was tabled in the Senate, on Mr Epsteins contract, was not complete and that Senator McMullan regretted that.I think there have been some media reports on this issue, but the fact that Mr Epstein has been removed from his formal duties, at least, with the National Media Liaison Service, can be overstated. The reality is, as we discovered, that Mr Epstein still has complete access to the work of the National Media Liaison Service. When we look to see the real reasons why Mr Epstein was removed—or sacked—from his formal association with the National Media Liaison Service, we find that he was causing serious embarrassment to the government.Mr Epstein has built a bit of a career out of attempting to embarrass shadow ministers. What has happened in recent months is that Mr Epstein has embarrassed ministers. It is not surprising that, as a result of the embarrassment that clearly he caused Senator McMullan, within 24 hours Mr Epstein was sacked from his position in the National Media Liaison Service.It is the practice of this government when serious errors occur—and there was a serious error, as Senator McMullan recognised, of misleading the parliament and misleading a Senate committee—to hide behind public servants and staff members. Mr Epstein was just the latest in a long line of staffers that have had to take the fall for ministerial behaviour and ministerial incompetence.The real issue is not Mr Epstein and his particular activities. The real issue is: what has the National Media Liaison Service been doing? How has it been spending $1.5 million per annum of taxpayers money? Has that money been spent properly? All the evidence to date suggests that there has been an improper use of taxpayer funding. Mr Epstein was given a sleazy job to do by ministers. When the temperature got a bit hot, Mr Epstein was removed.It remains to be seen, of course, whether the National Media Liaison Service continues to act in the same fashion. I put it to honourable senators that the sacking of Mr Epstein is not the fundamental issue involved here. The fundamental issue involved here is that ministers have set up a unit, which cost the taxpayers at least $1.5 million, pretending that that unit does a particular task which is to provide timely and accurate information on government activities but, in actual fact, it is directed to do another task. So I wish to give notice to this chamber that this matter simply does not rest because of the sacking of Mr Epstein. In a sense, that is neither here nor there, but just acts as a warning to the staff of all ministers that, when the going gets too tough, they will be required to take the responsibility rather than the ministers themselves.As I said, the coalition will still be pursuing this matter. The question is: how has the $1.5 million which has been spent on the National Media Liaison Service actually been used? There are two particular courses of action which we are considering. We are planning to seek an amendment to the Audit Act, and there is a bill currently before this parliament to allow the National Media Liaison Service to be subject to an efficiency audit by the Auditor-General. I expect that motion to enjoy majority support in this parliament. Of course, that efficiency audit will have to look at the activities of the National Media Liaison Service in the last 12 months. So I put it to honourable senators that this may well help finally to determine just how this money has been spent. Alternatively, we have the option to establish a Senate inquiry into the use of taxpayer funds by the National Media Liaison Service.I signal that the sacking of Mr Epstein will not stop the inquiries by this Senate into just how the government has misused taxpayer funds. We now have a new director of the National Media Liaison Service, a Mr Michael Fishpool, I understand. I have given notice that we will be regularly seeking information from Mr Fishpool on the activities of the National Media Liaison Service. He, of course, has the option to ensure that this service performs in an appropriate manner to provide timely and accurate information on government programs. We will be checking very closely to see that that is done, and we would expect Mr Fishpool to maintain comprehensive records of the work activities of the National Media Liaison Service.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1[1]/debate.sub2/speech/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

I put on notice that, despite the sacking of Mr Epstein, the fundamental problem still remains. The government has not been willing to tackle that problem. We are determined to find out just how that $1.5 million has been spent. The new director may well have a chance to establish the National Media Liaison Service on a new and proper basis. If he does, good luck to him. If he does not, he will have to explain very carefully to Senate committees just what he has been doing.Also revealed as part of the massive media machine that this government has put in place, were further figures which were presented to the Senate estimates committee. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which shows how staffing entitlements have risen very sharply under the Keating government.

This will cost taxpayers upwards of $500,000. These people have been added to the political staff of Labor ministers, to offices which are already overloaded compared with any previous government. All those groups that have been seeking additional funding from this government and have received refusals should be aware that Mr Keating, at a wave of his imperial pen, was able to provide the Labor Party with an additional $500,000 for staffing resources. That is a very valuable resource to have as we approach an election campaign. The opposition will be looking closely at the additional staff which Mr Keating has decided to award to a wide range of ministers.I have again brought to the attention of the Senate the massive media machine and the staffing machine that this government has employed at taxpayers expense. There are very real concerns that some of that money is being misspent. I have signalled the intention of the coalition to continue its inquiries and, for the record, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard two letters signed by Mr Frank Walker: one to Mr Epstein and one to Mr Fishpool.Leave granted.The letters read as follows—MINISTER FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICESPARLIAMENT HOUSECANBERRA ACT 260020 June 1995Mr David EpsteinDirectorMinisterial Media GroupParliament HouseCANBERRA 2600Dear Mr Epstein,I have decided to establish a position of Director, National Media Liaison Service (NMLS).

94,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ABETZ","N26","(Tasmania)","LP","N/A",1971,"—I compliment my colleague Senator Kemp on his relentless pursuit of the National Media Liaison Service and point out to those who might be listening in the gallery or on the broadcast that the National Media Liaison Service spends $1.5 million of taxpayers funds. In the presence of a number of pork producers in the gallery, I acknowledge that in my state of Tasmania there are very genuine concerns in relation to the importation of salmon from Canada and North America. I trust both industries will be appropriately looked after.This afternoon I wish to undertake a brief analysis of His Excellency the Governor-Generals comments on the occasion of the Arthur E. Mills oration of 21 June 1995. There are two aspects of His Excellencys comments on which I wish to comment: firstly, whether the comments should have been made at all; and, secondly, whether the comments stand up to scrutiny.It is inappropriate for Australias head of state to speak on controversial and divisive matters whilst he is the holder of that office. If one expects and accepts all the benefits and, indeed, the privileges that are attached to the position of Governor-General, then it is encumbent on the incumbent not to immerse himself or herself in politically divisive issues. The role of Governor-General is designed to provide a unifying force; a symbol of what the country and its people stand for. That unifying force—that symbol—becomes tarnished and diminished once it is immersed in the divisive political issues of the day.His Excellency has done both himself and his office an unfortunate disservice, but every cloud has a silver lining. In this case, the silver lining provides to the people of Australia a foretaste of the type of intervention that will undoubtedly occur on a regular basis by the head of state if we go down the Keating path of constitutional change.The main purpose of dealing with His Excellencys contribution is not so much to discuss the inappropriate nature of his remarks but to join issue with him on the matters raised. Implicit in His Excellencys comments is a world view which is atheistic, selfish and harsh, and built on the shifting sands of trendyism rather than on the true and tested standards of the ages.His Excellency summarised his speech by talking about a whole lot of `rights which are allegedly key principles in a liberal democracy. I happen to be one of those old-fashioned people who was told that rights never come alone; they always come coupled with a countervailing duty. Indeed, the Liberal Party, in item 6 of its We Believe document, says:We believe that rights connote duties, and that sectional and selfish policies are destructive of good citizenship.His Excellency tells us that we should not have the state impose a narrow predetermined form of morality to which all are supposed to conform. The message sent out to the community is that there is no need to abide by the laws of the country. Why conform? Do your own thing. The message is that, if it feels good, it is okay. In case you think that I am doing His Excellency an injustice, listen to his comments and I will place particular emphasis on the aspect of self in the comments. His Excellency says:In short, I must rule myself by my own judgement and my own conscience. The authentic life is led from the inside by what one genuinely and decently believes, rather than having those things imposed from the outside . . .If that is the guide to ones life, there is no outside objective benchmark to enable the establishment or determination of the morality or appropriateness of your own or, indeed, somebody elses behaviour. As long as it comes from the inside and you feel it genuinely, it must be okay.Social conventions can be badly flawed, as stated by His Excellency, but, with respect, I would have thought that there is also the very real possibility that ones own views and approach to life can be badly flawed. I often test my views against the considered views of other people who have gone before me in order to see whether I can learn from them. Usually I come out on the side of accepting the social convention and mores built over years, decades and, indeed, centuries.Implicit in His Excellencys remarks is the concept that, if you are a genuine racist and if you feel from the inside that racism is right, then do not be dissuaded by the social convention that all people are equal. I am sure that Adolf Hitler and Stalin felt, and Saddam Hussein feels, passionately and genuinely that their cause was and is morally correct.The social guideposts which His Excellency has told us have been removed or replaced in this modern age are the objective standards by which we judge and determine the appropriateness of our own code of conduct and the code of conduct of others. When human beings have no target outside themselves, they turn inwards and focus on themselves as being the centre of the world and the focus of their constant attention.As one of the socially unifying forces within our country, the Governor-Generals message of self falls far short of the message of community focus that many Australians would have expected. A message of hope would have been more appropriate. A message to the unemployed, the aged, the infirm and the disabled that they are just as much a part of Australian society and just as much Australians as the Governor-General and other privileged people would have been most welcome. Instead, we hear in His Excellencys speech people described as `unproductive burdens of whom society ought to be `disencumbered. I find that phrase horrifying. I find it particularly horrifying that the government has seen fit not to dissociate itself from that highly insensitive, if not offensive, remark.How on earth can one describe any human life as being an unproductive burden? The callousness of that remark fills me with genuine concern for those who may have felt that the remark was directed at them. It also fills me with genuine sorrow for the person whose considered thought processes allowed him to make that remark. What is an `unproductive burden? Economically unproductive? Socially unproductive? Should the unemployed feel that they are a burden on society? Should the aged feel that they are a burden on society? Should the disabled feel that they are a burden on society?Rather than talking of `unproductive burdens, let us talk of hope and the future. To the unemployed, give the avenues to feel part of mainstream society. To the aged, give the feeling that rather than being a burden they are entitled to the benefit of the fruit of their labours. To the disabled, give the feeling that their disability is one we, from our more fortunate position, will share with them. Above all that, let us say to every Australian: `No matter what your lot in life, your life will never be a burden on society because you are an integral part of society. Your lot in life is also my lot in life. Your lot in life is also our lot in life.His Excellency talks of his own full life and his `apprehension facing old age. He then refers to a couple who apparently suicided together because there was nothing awaiting them but `the emptiness of death. That comment is a sad reflection of a life that has no hope. I genuinely feel for His Excellency, who appears to embrace this view of the emptiness of death. Let me quote a Ronald Reagan analogy. The then President of the United States said:Sometimes when Im faced with an unbeliever, an atheist, I am tempted to invite him to the greatest gourmet dinner that one could ever serve, and when we finished eating that magnificent dinner, to ask him if he believes theres a cook.I happen to believe that there is a cook—a chef.As soon as credibility is given to the concept that there is such a thing as a life not worth living, we start using terms such as `unproductive burdens. We set the scene for liquidating those lives that are somehow considered burdensome, unproductive or unwanted. As His Excellency said about abortion, it `is about unwanted children. If we can have unwanted children aborted, unproductive burdens euthanased, what stops the next and very easy step of ridding our community of antisocial elements by the death penalty? If we feel comfortable with getting rid of unwanted children, why not unwanted adults?His Excellency canvassed many other issues which I cannot respond to today, and, therefore, I have dealt with what I consider is the most important issue, the inherent God-given and created value of human life. If we no longer regard human life as special by reference to the old social guideposts, we are left with a void and a sense of meaningless for our lives and for those of our fellow human beings. If we want the fruits of the old social guideposts, we also need the roots, trunks and branches to sustain the fruit. Without the roots, trunks and branches, the fruits will wither.Personal freedom cannot exist in anarchy. Freedom can only exist in a shared basis of community, law and beliefs. I trust that His Excellencys foray into this public debate will allow many Australians and, in particular, legislators, to realise that, in the words of Dame Enid Lyons:The problems of government are not the problems of statistics but the problems of human values, human hearts and human feelings.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
95,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BOSWELL","YE4","(Queensland-","NP","Leader of the National Party of Australia)",1974,"—Before I start my address on the pork industry, I associate myself with the remarks made by Senator Abetz. The comments that His Excellency made concerned me very much, and Senator Abetz has put the matter of the Governor-Generals address very clearly.I acknowledge the presence in the gallery today of many pork producers who have come to Canberra. I rise today to inform the Senate of the parlous state and the most serious plight that the Australian pork producers find themselves in. At this very minute, apart from the people who are in the gallery there are probably another 800 or 900 strapped pork producers who have sacrificed important time and money to travel to Canberra to inform the federal government and the parliament that they need some attention and that they need it now. They cannot wait.Problems are attacking pork producers from all directions. These problems are intolerable because they are from areas which are totally beyond the control of pork producers and totally beyond their ability to manage. One of the problems is the high cost of grain feed as a consequence of the drought. Grain prices have risen to unheard of levels. Feed costs form 70 per cent of a pork producers costs, and, because pig farmers are deemed not to be directly affected by the drought, they are not eligible for drought relief despite the increased costs the drought causes them.Pork producers are presently the largest user group of grains and so the increase in prices is very burdensome to them. It is no wonder that 20 per cent of pig farmers have been forced to leave the industry in the last six months. Such steep rises in costs would, under normal circumstances, place a severe financial impost on producers. However, todays producers also have to contend with the historically high level of subsidised imports flooding into Australia which are selling at 30 per cent below the production cost for Australian producers.Canadian pork receives a massive boost from the subsidies given to Canadian grain producers, and, with grain forming the major import cost, this gives the Canadian farmer an unusually unfair advantage. These subsidies mean Canadian farmers can produce a kilogram of leg meat for $1 to $1.15 less than the Australian farmer. This is a huge advantage and it is one that the Australian farmers are finding very difficult to compete against. Canadian industries are coming in and securing long-term forward contracts with Australian buyers at 30 per cent below what Australians can meet.The danger for the industry arises because imports usually start hitting the industry in the peak Christmas period, and the high incidence of imports so early in the year can only result in further losses of producers to the Australian industry. Already we have seen 20 per cent of the industry reduced. In a last desperate stand, a last desperate plea for help, members of the industry have come down to plead their case to the government today. Senator Crane and I will be asking the government, at question time, to produce a policy that will be responsive to the needs of Australian pork producers.Imports are at their second highest level ever and are assaulting a weakened industry. The industry has already invested heavily in an anti-dumping action against Canadian imports. I know that because we in my office were instrumental in helping the industry prepare its case in many ways, even successfully moving an amendment that would have helped the pork producers to win their case. That amendment was made with the support of the Liberal and the National parties.The decision went against Australian industry on the basis that the massive grain subsidies were not direct enough to the pig industry, despite the reality of the enormous boost that subsidised grain prices would give to Canadian farmers. Having invested both years and hundreds of thousands of dollars in mounting an unsuccessful anti-dumping case, the industry has to ask itself what else it can do to fight against the unfair trading position in which it finds itself a victim.On top of this there lie two issues that the federal government can help with. The first is the delay that the government is creating in the introduction of a truthful origin labelling system. This would enable the Australian consumer to buy the true Australian pork product. Then there is the threat in the near future from the government introduction of more imports based on an expanded minimum risk disease policy. I do not have to tell the Senate of what happened yesterday, when the government allowed imports of pilchards into Australia. Such imports could have infected and been responsible for the huge kills of domestic pilchards right around Australia, not to mention the risk that it has put the salmon industry in, in the state represented by my colleague Senator Abetz, Tasmania.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1[3]/speech/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

97,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BOSWELL","YE4","(Queensland-","NP","Leader of the National Party of Australia)",1974,"—And the bee industry, yes. What I am saying to the government is this: overseas people want to buy our clean, green Australian product. We can demand a premium on our primary industries because our product is virtually disease-free. But when the government turns over all the time and lets imported products in as a minimum risk, it is exposing and putting at risk Australias primary industry.The second issue is that the inadequate labelling laws that are being maintained by the government mean that the Australian consumers are being prevented from being able to identify clearly from the label that the pork they are buying is truly ridgy-didge Australian pork product. When the issue of food labelling became politically too difficult, the government slung food labelling off for further investigation until October. I do not have to tell my colleagues on this side of the Senate, the Liberal and National parties and also the Democrats, that we have come up with a labelling protocol that would fully support the pork producers in identifying their product as an Australian product. When we came to that conclusion and we were prepared to amend the governments legislation, that legislation had fallen off the parliamentary lists. It is now languishing near the bottom among 33 bills and it will never see the light of day while this government is in power.As I said when I was speaking to the pork producers in Parliament House today, I made a commitment on behalf of the National and Liberal parties that one of the first bills that we would get into parliament when we came back as the government would be to introduce labelling legislation that would support not only their cause but the cause of all primary industry that is suffering similar needs for decent labelling.We have been discussing this labelling legislation for 18 months to two years since the government first introduced it. Before that, there were years of discussion, reports and recommendations. While the government grapples with its own political embarrassment, with a minister at odds with her own union, the ACTU, and all the consumer bodies that traditionally support the Labor side of politics, all Australian primary producers are forced to continue to suffer the disadvantage of imported products being sold and labelled `Made in Australia.The price of the governments delay can be seen today: pork producers cannot even rely on consumer goodwill and support to compete with subsidised Canadian pork labelled `Made in Australia. The government likes to claim that it cannot help because avenues such as anti-dumping actions have failed. The government washes its hands of drought relief. A case could certainly be established on behalf of the pork producers. The government could help; it could do it today. It could put forward the legislation; the legislation is already drawn up. It is listed in government business order of the day No. 34. The government could produce that legislation today. It is already there. It could put the legislation forward and we could debate it today. We could have the labelling, that is needed and required, up and running by the end of the week. The legislation would have to go to Yarralumla for the Governor-Generals signature. It is all there ready to go.The government could introduce a labelling system that reflects the true origin of product: imported products and Australian products would be labelled in a truthful way. It could also consider bringing an action under article 19 of GATT. When we receive a protest under GATT, we act like obedient signatories and quickly initiate actions—in other words, we bend over and allow people to give us a kick in the backside. But, when it comes to standing up for our producers, the government just goes to water.There are present examples of a 1994 Canadian government protest under GATT about our quarantine requirements for live salmon imports. Already, one year later, AQIS has responded with a draft paper recommending Canadian imports on a minimum risk basis. This same policy is to apply to other primary products such as chicken meat, egg products and pork. At the same time, our domestic labelling legislation can be delayed for many years and a GATT approach on behalf of an Australian industry, the pork industry, is falling on deaf ears.The facts are that the Australian pork producers are in a truly desperate plight. The Australian economy has lost the benefits of the economic activity of 800 of the industrys 4,800 producers because they have been forced out of the industry this year. The industry just cannot compete against the open flow of highly subsidised imports from Canada that are able to benefit from subsidies and undercut our price by 30 per cent. The industry predicts, under the circumstances, that similar numbers will leave the industry forever in the next six months.Over the last decade, all Australian farmers made enormous sacrifices in the belief that it would lead to fairer world trade in agricultural products. Some of the larger Australian industries may benefit from the Uruguay Round, although the cracks have appeared for wheat and dairy. The smaller Australian primary industries have really missed out.On the eve of the commencement of the World Trade Organisation agreement on 1 July, our industries such as pork should not be facing a death sentence because of highly subsidised exports from a fellow Cairns group country. I call on the government to take serious note of the 1,000 protesters in Canberra today on behalf of the entire pork industry and to come up with some solutions immediately.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1[3]/speech/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

Many of them are small farmers struggling to survive in a very hostile environment, one in which feed prices, of course, have risen substantially because of the drought. Also, there is no doubt that the governments economic policies and other policies have not really done them much good in recent times. What interests me about this industry, apart from anything else, is that it is an industry that even the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) professes to regard as a very sound one, one with a great future. In fact, I remember him saying that he thought the future for the industry was so good that he put his super on the future—I cannot remember the exact phraseology. Anyway, he was putting his super on the future in order to get into the industry.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1[4]/speech/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

I fear that if we can have such a disastrous crisis in an industry that, in Mr Keatings judgment, is a great and expanding one, either it does not say much for his judgment, or God help all those other industries that he is not supporting and does not think are great.

101,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MICHAEL BAUME","LE4","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A",1976,"—Many of them, as my colleague interjects, used to be big business. The way to get a small business in Australia under this government is to start off with a big one. The significance of this is that Mr Keating did have a controversial half-ownership in a piggery group. During that half-ownership, I think that most Australians, particularly those in the pig industry, know that that company was continually in breach of the Corporations Law, as is evidenced here. I have presented non-stop Australian Securities Commission documents demonstrating that. It also lost millions of dollars, and I demonstrated that from the same source.What is interesting though—and maybe the demonstrators outside should be aware of this—is that there is a real chance that the Prime Minister may still in fact have the prospect of having an interest in the pig industry. Perhaps the demonstrators, if they actually get to see him today, should put it to him that not only is it in Australias interests that this industry survives and prospers, but it may well still be in his interests too.The Prime Minister said that he had disposed of his holding in the industry. It was his half-ownership of a large piggery group, the Brown and Hatton Group Pty Ltd, which has since changed its name and its style and, I understand, its debt and its banker. But it may well be that, since he disposed of his interest, he could end up as the beneficiary of a remarkably generous option to repurchase one-third of the ownership of this piggery. It was part of the extraordinary transaction when Mr Keatings half-ownership was eventually sold through an intermediary to Indonesian interests.I do not know whether many people have focused on this, but Mr Paul Keatings half-interest in that piggery group is now owned by an Indonesian family operating through a company registered in Singapore; the directors live in Hong Kong. Apart from that, it does not have any international associations.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1[4]/speech/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

103,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MICHAEL BAUME","LE4","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A",1976,"—As my colleague interjects, it is a sort of sweet and sour piggery. The fact is that part of this arrangement to dispose of this interest overseas, which requires Foreign Investment Review Board approval—and I do not know whether that was the reason it was done through an intermediary rather than direct, I just do not know—is that there is an incredibly generous option for an unnamed person to buy back one-third of this piggery. Who is this unnamed person, I wonder? Who can it possibly be who will be given such an incredibly generous option? This person does not have to put any money in now and, any time over the next 10 years, to get back a one-third interest in this company, all he has to do is pay for the costs involved to the people who have made this company a success—if it is going to be a success—over the next 10 years.He does not have to risk any money himself. He just sees whether they succeed, and if they succeed he gets one-third of it. That is an incredibly generous option. Why would anyone—Indonesian interests, anyone—give such an incredibly generous option to anyone in a situation like this? That is a question to which Australians, particularly Australian pig farmers, have a right to know the answer.Is their Prime Minister likely to join them once again—perhaps after this crisis is over and after enough competitors have gone broke—and come back into the industry? That is a serious problem. How many people are going to go broke in this industry? It is a serious problem, and it is not simply one that is concerning the minds of the people outside, who are demonstrating for their livelihoods. It a problem that could affect the supply end of the pork industry, and ultimately the consumers if this industry ends up in the hands of a very few major players.Let us get back to this question of this option to repurchase one-third of what was the Prime Ministers piggery. It is incredible that under the terms of the sale arrangement to the Indonesians there is an option which can be exercised by someone to be nominated by Mr Keatings former partner in his piggery or, failing him, Mr Keatings solicitor—the man who is the company secretary of Mr Keatings family company. Would it not be curious if they decided that Mr Keating was the person who should exercise the option? It would be even more curious if they did not decide that Mr Keating was the man who would exercise the option! This option may ultimately be worth a lot of money.It seems to me that with the pig industry in crisis it is up to the Prime Minister to `fess up: to tell the parliament, to tell the people, to tell the piggery operators and pork producers of Australia who are in crisis whether he is with `em or agin `em. Is he likely to be one of them? Does he have the capacity? Is there a secret agreement for him to be the person who will exercise that option—that unnamed person? Will he be the person who will exercise that option to end up with one-third of what will be a major pork producing operation in Australia, or will he not? We have raised these matters in the Senate before, but we do not get an answer. Mr Keating does not even say oink! We just do not know whether Mr Keating is someone who may well have an interest in this industry which is struggling to survive.There are those of us who would say he does have an interest and does not care whether the industry survives or not, and others who would say that it shows he is not much of a judge of what industry to invest in. That is clearly not true. He is a good judge of what to invest in, because he invested in this industry at a cost of $430,000 for a half-share in the company. It lost squillions of dollars, was heavily indebted to the Commonwealth Bank, and breached most of the rules of the Australian Securities Commission; yet he sold out, at least doubling his money. There are many pig farmers who wish they could be in that situation. It cost him $430,000 to get in, and the Indonesians paid $850,000—$US600,000—to purchase their half-interest.The pig farmers, who are clearly in a serious position, might like to put a few questions to the Prime Minister about whether he is for `em or agin `em. If he is for `em, would not it be terrible to be an industry he was against? And if he is agin `em, maybe now we know what has gone wrong with this industry.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1[4]/speech/talk.start[4]/para","N/A","N/A"
104,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CRANE","UW4","(Western Australia)","LP","N/A",1978,"—I rise in support of my colleagues and the pork producers here today. To those producers who do not know me, I am a Liberal senator from Western Australia. I am in constant touch with the pork industry in Western Australia and hopefully there are a few Western Australians in here today but, if there are not—it is a long way to come—I want them to know that I take a keen interest in the industry in Western Australia. I have represented their views in this parliament on many occasions. I wish to deal with a number of aspects in support of the comments made by my colleagues, the previous speakers, Senator Baume and Senator Boswell.We have known for many years that the countervailing and dumping legislation we have is not satisfactory. It has not carried out what it should have carried out in terms of protecting Australian industry against dumping; that is, selling below the domestic price in the country of production. It has not done that for a number of reasons. One of the most important reasons is that the dumping laws in this country are too slow and the damage is done long before the action comes into effect.Countervailing impacts on the subsidisation of the inputs into the production of whatever it might be and we have seen the results of that. We made a commitment at the last election that we would tighten up the whole arrangement with the countervailing and dumping legislation. I intend to pursue that when we get into government. It has affected almost every spectrum of production in this country. I am primarily a wool producer and we have found that this particular legislation, and the lack of its capacity to handle particular situations, has even impacted on the wool industry.I want to talk about the attitude of the government to producers and, of course, pork producers are an integral part of that. We are dealing with legislation today in this chamber that deals with the increases in sales tax, and with the attempted decimation of the rebate on diesel fuel. They are two areas where this government could have eased the pressure on producers, rather than increase the pressure by putting our costs up.I put it to the people listening here today that the way that we can beat the pants off the Canadians, or anybody else for that matter, is to make sure that the cost structures in this nation of ours are at least equivalent to what they are in other countries. When we look at what we in Australia have to pay for fuel, whether it be on-road or off-road, and what those in other countries have to pay, we see that they are significantly advantaged. We could go through a whole range of cost structures. For example, the cost of the transport structure here is double what it is in Canada, or America or for most of our competitors.An enormous percentage arises purely and simply because the government has decided, in its taxation system, to make a milking cow out of producers and industry. Until that part of the equation is addressed, we are going to find it very difficult—particularly in times of drought, as now, but also at other times—to compete against imports coming into this nation. We should not have those imposts on our industries.Yesterday, I spoke on the cattle legislation. I made the point that, if we had had a decent cost structure in our processing and abattoir arrangements so that we were competitive with the Americans, or the Brazilians, or the Argentinians, or whoever, we would not have had developed the export of cattle to Indonesia. Why are our cattle going to feedlots in Indonesia? It is purely and simply because the processing and killing costs in this country force us to take that option. We are very shortly going to see the stupid situation where we will be importing our beef from Indonesia—that is, cattle that we have bred, fed and grown—purely and simply because this government has not got the guts to address that part of the equation.We have also been dealing with competition policy in this place in recent times with the Hilmer report. The government has picked up a lot of the Hilmer report but there is one area that it has not touched and that is the reform of the industrial relations system and the waterfront in this nation. It does not have the courage or the guts to tackle that particular aspect of it. Until such time as it is tackled, we are going to have these imposts upon us.One could talk about these particular aspects for hours; I do not have hours. As Senator Boswell said, we will be asking a number of questions today with regard to the pig industry. I also want to re-emphasise the points that have been made as far as labelling in this country. I would have thought that for anybody who is bringing forward legislation as a proposition, `Made in Australia would mean made in Australia. I would have thought that is a reasonable proposition.If we asked any of the students who are here with us today what `Made in Australia meant, they would tell us that it was produced in Australia, it was packed in Australia, it was Australian based. It does not mean that. It makes one ask questions as to why we want to give this in-built protection to imports in this country by not stating quite clearly on the label, for example, `This is Canadian pork. It has been boiled and fried—or whatever has been done—`in Australia. That is what it is. We do not do that. We have got to ask ourselves questions. I certainly support the comments made by Senator Boswell about the need for us to address that particular point, which we will do when we are in government.I wish to emphasise another point or two on taxation and imposts. Do people here today know that this year this government will collect another $14 billion of tax from taxpayers? Its tax take will go from $103 billion to $117 billion—the greatest single increase in any one year in this nations history. Why are we not looking at the wastes that occur in this nation as far as our public sector expenditure is concerned? That is what we should be addressing.On top of that, the government claims that it is balancing the budget; but it is selling the family silver to do it. One has to ask the question: what is going to happen when it runs out of assets to sell? Crunch time will come. On Friday, I think it is, we will see our current account deficit once again at somewhere round $2 1/2 billion. In fact, it is rumoured it is going to be the record current account deficit in the history of this nation. Of course, the impact of that will be absolutely devastating in terms of the flow-on impact on our costs. In due course, that current account deficit will catch up with interest rates and put enormous pressure on those.I wind up my comments in these terms: there are a lot of actions that this government can take. In terms of cutting the cost structures in this nation, those actions would benefit everybody—in particular, primary producers in the pork industry, the beef industry, the sheep industry and the grain industry. I put it to the government that it is about time it reorganised its priorities, had a look at what it is doing to the productive sector of this country, and gave that sector equity in its treatment through the taxation system or whatever else in this country of Australia.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1[5]/debate.sub2/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I ask: why didnt you use your much vaunted special relationship with Foreign Minister Alatas to convey the potential damage to the relationship between our two countries by the appointment of someone whose views are apparently so out of step with Australian values?

Since the new mood of vulgar opportunism and `wet finger in the air politics has overtaken the opposition, that perception now seems to have changed. I can understand that. This is a political environment. The opposition is engaged in the political business. It is clearly not engaged, however, in the business of acting in Australias national interests, which is the business that I am in and which is the business that the government is in.We were faced, as I have said on a couple of occasions recently, with a quite delicate situation so far as the appointment of the new ambassador is concerned. There is no doubt about General Mantiris ability. There is no doubt about his capacity to do the job. There is no doubt about his knowledge of Australia. There is no doubt about his relationship with a number of key people in the Australian government, particularly in Defence industry. There is no doubt about his reputation as a reformer within the Indonesian military system. There is no doubt about his non-involvement so far as the Dili massacre is concerned.What there is a doubt about is the particular exercise of judgment that he showed on one significant occasion in the middle of 1992, when he said a number of things that are obviously manifestly extremely regrettable. We did take the opportunity, through official channels, to express some concern about the implications of that and the degree of difficulty that would obviously confront an ambassador, having said that sort of thing. I knew perfectly well that that issue was in the minds of the Indonesian government. It was not something that needed to be further pursued in order to make that particular point.When the Indonesian government, clearly as a matter of President Suhartos personal decision, chose to proceed with the appointment of someone who is fitted in all the ways that I have described for the office, I do not believe in practice, taking into account Australias best interests, that there was any rational basis or sensible basis on which we could have refused agrement. Under the circumstances I have made publicly clear, as I have made privately clear to the Indonesians, that it would be extremely helpful if a very early opportunity were taken by the new ambassador to find some way of expressing regret for what were obviously very unfortunate remarks.If the issue can be approached in this way, with a little bit of good sense and a little bit of spirit of concern for the national interest and Australias regional relationships, rather than vulgar, opportunistic point scoring, we might actually be able to make some progress on that issue.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[1]/question.block/answer[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Did you express the view that the Australian-Indonesian relationship is particularly important and the appointment of somebody whose values are obviously so out of touch with Australian values would cause problems?

113,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator FAULKNER","5K4","NSW","ALP","N/A",1981,"—I did not, as a matter of fact. I acknowledge the interest that Senator Denman has shown in this matter. Senator, the short answer to the question you ask is, no. In my view it would be inappropriate and undesirable as a matter of principle for the Commonwealth government to be making sport funding dependent on whether an organisation voted in a certain way in a forum like the Council of the Commonwealth Games Association.The government cannot withdraw Commonwealth Games preparation funds from sports, because sports are not funded in that way. The government does not provide funds specifically for preparing athletes to the Commonwealth Games, nor does it financially support the Australian Commonwealth Games Association itself. Through the Australian Sports Commission, the government provides funds to sports on an annual basis for international competition. With the implementation of the olympic athlete program, the level of support for olympic sports was increased in 1994-95 but the focus is on preparation for the 1996 Atlanta and 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, not so much on the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur.With the exception of a handful of sports—bowls, cricket, hockey, netball, rugby and squash, some of which may not be on the program at Kuala Lumpur—all Commonwealth Games sports are olympic sports. Any benefit that aspiring Commonwealth Games team members receive from federal government support, therefore, is incidental to the main thrust of the olympic athlete program, which is the two Olympic Games that I mentioned. The Australian Commonwealth Games Association has its own rules; and matters such as the proposed organisational restructuring are subject to those rules.I believe it is time for the Commonwealth Games Association to bring itself up to date in its organisational administration, as other sporting organisations in this country have done. However, it will be up to the Council of the ACGA to determine its own destiny. This is the point that I made directly to officials of the Commonwealth Games Association, including Arthur Tunstall, and the President of the Association, Ray Godkin, when I met with them recently. I reiterated strongly the views that I have expressed in recent months about the need for their organisation to become up to date and to more accurately reflect the nature of Australian society. This very strong message applies equally to such issues as racism in sport and the professional administration of the organisation.Whatever the outcome, the government will continue to support Australian athletes at unprecedented levels through the programs of the Australian Sports Commission. Any organisational change that improves the professionalism and the public image of the ACGA would be welcomed by the government and by me as the sports minister. As always, I can say to Senator Denman that the government is committed to assisting sporting organisations in these endeavours.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[1]/answer/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

We have been closely monitoring that situation in Nigeria—one, incidentally, in which Mr Malcolm Fraser has taken a close interest, and I have had conversations with him about it. We are seeking confirmation and clarification of these reports.In March this year, following initial reports of his arrest, we called in the Nigerian High Commissioner twice to express concern about that arrest, to seek further information on the circumstances of his detention and subsequent house arrest. The initial press reports of that arrest in March referred to it as being linked by the Nigerian authorities to a planned coup against the government. Many serving army officers were arrested at the same time; 23 are currently before a closed special military tribunal investigating the alleged coup.On 13 June, General Obasanjo was transferred by security agents from house arrest to an unknown detention centre. In the last week the non-government press in Nigeria reported that General Obasanjo and his former deputy, General YarAdua, have appeared before the special military tribunal to answer charges of complicity in that alleged plot. The Australian government has joined other Western governments to make a demarche to the Nigerian government on the situation of all the political detainees, including General Obasanjo. Thus far, it has proved to be difficult for the diplomatic community to make effective representations on this issue.I put out a press statement this morning. Yesterday, I instructed DFAT, my department, to again call in the High Commissioner for Nigeria to seek an explanation of the basis for his continuing detention and to seek information on what charges, if any, have been laid against him. The High Commissioner has given a commitment to us to respond as soon as possible following communications with his government.I say again that we are deeply concerned about General Obasanjos position. I urge the Nigerian government to explain the basis of his continuing detention and to ensure that if any charges have been laid against him they will be considered in accordance with due process of law in public and with the right to legal representation of his choice.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[3]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Has the minister seen the article in this weeks New Scientist which says that the French nuclear tests are not related to ensuring the workability of existing weapons or for `bench tests, a euphemism clearly loved by the minister, but are related instead to the development of a `range of more robust warheads for submarine launched ballistic missiles?

131,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator GARETH EVANS","VD4","VIC","ALP","N/A",1984,"—The story about the uranium sales to France has been told often enough in the past for me not to need to repeat it here. Australian uranium constitutes only about three per cent, as I understand it, of the energy industrys fuel source supplies. The uranium is subject to very intense and close safeguards pursuant to the agreement that we have with France. There is every reason to be confident that no Australian uranium has anything whatsoever to do with the military establishment.There are technical arguments about flag swaps and which molecule finishes up where in the scheme of things, which we have had on innumerable occasions before. I will see whether there is any further information I can give you. I cannot recall your great `canister disclosure, I am afraid, of 1988—my memory has gone blank on that. But I will endeavour to refresh myself and see what more can be said on that particular subject.The second part of your question was about the article which appears in the press today from one source in France suggesting that these tests will, in fact, be directed towards the development of new generation missile technology rather than for the purposes of computer simulation development and associated stockpile reliability and safety ensuring measures. All I can say on that particular subject is that there was some ambiguity on this question left by the original statement by President Chirac in which it was said that the tests were for certain purposes (a) and (b), computer development and stockpile stewardship, but it was not expressly denied that they might be for some other purpose. I drew attention to that ambiguity in my discussions across the table with the French foreign minister in Paris last week and asked him for an unequivocal assurance that these tests would not be for the purpose of new generation technology development. He gave me that unequivocal assurance.All I can say is that it has not been my experience in the conduct of international relations for the past seven years now that ministers tell lies when they respond in that very direct way. There are innumerable ways of avoiding questions if you do not want to be pinned down by a direct and unequivocal question of that particular kind. This was not an occasion in which any such approach was offered in the answer I was given. It was a clear and straightforward answer, `No, thats not the purpose. That is as much as I can say by way of the assurance that I had been given. Other objective evidence—the fact that there are eight tests rather than many more than that—would suggest that the tests are for the purpose which is being now unequivocally stated by the French government.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[4]/answer[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

135,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BOB COLLINS","OF4","NT","ALP","N/A",1985,"—I thank Senator Boswell for his question. Indeed I am well aware that a large number of pig producers are here in Canberra at the moment. Over the last 12 months I have had a number of meetings with the peak organisations which represent them, and I do recognise the problems that the industry is currently facing. I might add that some of the problems the industry is facing, in common with other intensive livestock industries at the moment, are in terms of the input prices of the feed grain which constitute, and Senator Boswell is correct, such a high percentage of the input costs of pig producers, around 70 per cent of their total costs.In respect of the matters that Senator Boswell has raised about action that could potentially be taken under GATT and claims that are being made about the differential in prices between Canadian pork in Australia and Australian pork and so on, there is a course of action which I intend to propose to a delegation from the pig producers that I am going to meet shortly after question time this afternoon. I am happy to now canvass that for the Senate. I am sure that the delegation will not mind the discourtesy of canvassing that matter now, in advance of the meeting this afternoon, since you have asked the question, Senator Boswell.The industry is experiencing a severe cost price squeeze which is primarily due to high feed prices resulting from the drought. Both large and small producers are suffering large losses as feed accounts, as Senator Boswell said, for around 70 per cent of the total input costs of pig producers. The price of feed barley, to give an indication of the problem, has roughly doubled over the last year while saleyard prices for the end product have remained fairly constant.The situation with grain prices at the moment is that the prices are now beginning to show signs of improvement as the new season crop becomes available. In fact, I had a discussion this morning with the representatives of the grain industry about this. Imported grains and livestock feed are also entering the market. I might add that the governments simple announcement some time ago that it was going to allow imports of grain within a fortnight knocked the top off what was then a rapidly increasing price for feed grain.While the current costs for feeds are high, the outlook is now improving. My latest advice from ABARE is that feed prices for 1995-96 on the current crop projections will be back to or in fact below the 1993-94 pre-drought prices. These difficult circumstances for the producers have intensified the adjustment pressures on the industry, and the existing assistance through the rural industry adjustment scheme is currently providing help for the industry. My last advice was that about 110 specialist pig producers are currently receiving such support. Latest forecasts by ABARE are that pig industry profitability will improve in 1995-96 due to an improvement of five per cent in saleyard prices.In respect of the Canadian imports, my advice is that imports from Canada for 1994-95 will be about 4,000 tonnes of product. That is compared to the total domestic production of the industry of around 335,000 tonnes. That is, Canadian imports will comprise around 2.41 per cent of the total market. This is about the same level of imports as we experienced in 1991-92 when we also, I might add, had high grain prices.Canadian imports are in the form of boned-out, frozen product which, under protocol, has to be cooked on arrival and is then processed into products such as pressed ham. The industry has maintained in representations to me that although the imports represent less than five per cent of total production, which is the figure the industry has used, they do have a price overhang effect—","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[5]/answer[1]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

We indicated that we would not repeal the legislation unless both sides agreed to a new voluntary code. Initially, at the end of last year, both sides—the petroleum companies and the retailers—even refused to talk to each other about the concerns raised in that report.After several meetings I had with them, we finally got them to agree, without prejudice to each other, to have a number of meetings. As a result, last week they indicated to me that they had reached an agreement in principle. They will come back to me by 27 July with a detailed agreement—both sides signing a voluntary arrangement for the operation of the petroleum industry and its retail network. Once that is reached and agreed to, the government will consider it and, I would imagine, recommend the repeal of those two acts.One reason the petrol retailers are willing to go to a voluntary code is that they expect the government to strengthen the unconscionable conduct provisions of the Trade Practices Act. They believe that, if there were an attempt by the petroleum companies to use their market power to their disadvantage, they would have redress under strengthened unconscionable conduct provisions. Therefore, I am able to tell the Senate that that is part of the discussions I am having with the small business sector about strengthening that provision of the Trade Practices Act.This also relates to the recommendations by Mr Gardini on franchising generally. Again, the recommendations he has made and the discussions I have had with him indicate that we could have a voluntary code for franchising operations if there is strengthening of the unconscionable conduct provisions of the Trade Practices Act so that small business franchisees feel that they have a better chance of defending their economic position vis-a-vis big business and franchisors.Overall, this has been a very successful outcome. This is an industry in which there has been a lot of turmoil, argument and distrust from both sides. They have now come to the table to reach this agreement. It is a success for the arrangements on both sides to get so far down the track. I hope in mid-July to be able to announce the written details of the agreement and then proceed with a cabinet submission. I certainly want to place on the record my congratulations and thanks to the representatives of the Motor Traders Association of Australia, the Australian Institute of Petroleum and the Australian Petroleum Agents and Distributors Association, which are the three industry groups that took part in these successful negotiations.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[3]/question.block[1]/answer/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

We recognise that women in their adult lives will spend some time at home, particularly when children are little, and some time in the paid work force. Our policies, particularly our child-care policies but also our family payment policies, recognise this and support those choices.Women who stay at home with their children are able to receive the home child-care allowance of $30 per week. That will be incorporated into the parenting allowance from 1 July. The home child-care allowance will remain tax free, and it will remain means tested on the primary carers income only, which is usually the mothers. That is as it ever was when it was previously the dependent spouse rebate.Despite the oppositions lack of policies, we do know that its leader, Mr Howard, supports this policy. He said on 7 March 1994 about the home child-care allowance:There is a lot to be said for the new structure. It puts money directly into the hands of the parents at home. This assistance is completely targeted and it follows the pattern of family allowance.So we know that Mr Howard supports the home child-care allowance. But his spokesman on the family, Dr Kemp, does not agree with him. He calls the $850 million spent on the home child-care allowance a mere drop in the bucket. It is very interesting for a party that wants to slash spending to describe $850 million as a mere drop in the bucket.

169,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BOLKUS","XE4","SA","ALP","N/A",1990,"—Mr President, Senator Parer raises a question which is of concern not just to the government but to all sides of the parliament—the question of Australias universal visa system, how it is applied and how we can make the system better or change it to accommodate our national interests. Those national interests include not only encouraging tourism but also other aspects of this particular issue such as security interests and health interests when people apply to come into this country.We have some very rigorous settings for security, character, and health checks. These are all linked to the way that we have a universal visa system. In consideration of the importance of all these issues, I asked the Joint Committee on Migration, chaired by Senator McKiernan, to address this matter. The committee is undergoing that inquiry at the present time. Senator Short has been making a contribution on the committee to this particular issue.We have a universal system in place and that system is being addressed in terms of its range and operation. We are talking about an ever increasing number of visitors to Australia. We have had a massive increase in the last few years. Somewhere between 2.5 million and three million tourists visit Australia each year, whereas a few years ago the figure was about one million. By the year 2000 we can expect some eight million—if not 10 million—tourists entering Australia. The figures are still being worked out by tourism advisory boards.We have to address the issue. One way in which we are addressing it is by looking at whether we can use other mechanisms and new technology to make it easier for people to obtain visas. We want to generally make the process easier. To that extent we are looking at a number of alternatives. One alternative is to look at the paper-free visa. In recent months we have launched pilot projects in places like Korea to see whether we can make an agency arrangement with travel agents whereby when people buy tickets the selected agents will have access to immigration operatives in a particular country and a visa can be issued without paper. As I said, it is a pilot project and it is being pursued in a number of selected countries from which our high volume tourism is coming. These are also countries that have a low volume of tourism overstay rates. Perhaps that is the pilot project that Senator Parer is talking about.If Senator Parer has any queries as to how much agents are charging for these visas, I will take the question on board and pursue the matter to ensure that people are not being ripped off. We recognise the importance of tourism. We have mechanisms in place to review this area. Those mechanisms take into account not just the need to ensure that people can get into Australia quickly, but also the need to ensure that our national interests through health and security checking are maintained through our visa system.If you want to do away with universal visa systems, say so and put it on the record. That is not the position coming from Senator Parers side of parliament. In the meantime we have to look at methods such as paper-free visas and post-embarkation clearances of plane loads of people to see whether we can do it faster.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[3]/question.block[4]/answer[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We can control what happens within government, but quite often we cannot control what happens outside of government—particularly when it is in another country. Senator Parer should realise that. If Senator Parer has particular instances of this occurring he should let us know. When the agency arrangements are finally concluded they will take into account any evidence coming from Senator Parer. The agency arrangements are important. If agents and companies are able to access government equipment and facilities I hope we would be charging them. That would not necessitate a flow-on fee of $80.

I refer to the response the minister and the Inspector-General of Defences representative gave to my questions at a Senate estimates hearing about a defence contract relating to Indonesia, which I first raised with the minister last August. While welcoming the ministers intervention in this serious matter, I ask whether there has been any attempt within his department to cover up this issue and whether any of what the Inspector-General describes as `three potentially criminal matters he has referred to the Australian Federal Police involve any senior employees of the Department of Defence. Does the reference relate to any consultant to the department? What internal disciplinary action has been taken so far in respect of these matters, or is it being deferred while awaiting the outcome of the Inspector-Generals and the AFPs inquiries? In the meantime, how many senior officers have been transferred out of the section of the department involved in this matter?","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[3]/question.block[6]/question/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
180,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ROBERT RAY","UI4","VIC","ALP","N/A",1992,"—Senator Baume asks whether there has been a cover-up in the department. That is a very broad question. That can go from a conspiracy not to divulge information through to incompetence. I will not be able to make a conclusive view on any of that part of the question until the Inspector-General reports. The Inspector-General took up this matter after Senator Baume raised it in questions on notice and later at an estimates committee. The inquiry, as Senator Baume would know, was a little slow to start because we were awaiting information from himself and others, but it did get a fair head of steam up.The inquiry did find, in regard to the principal person who was hired as a consultant, that there were some anomalies. It required the Federal Police to look at those. They are properly described as criminal matters. These are not hanging offences, by the way, but nevertheless they required its intervention and that investigation is under way. I really do not want to comment on the details of that until the AFPs report is in.In terms of any internal discipline, such discipline may occur if the Inspector-General finds that there have been breaches of the code of conduct of the Public Service, irrespective of anything to do with the Federal Police.Finally, on the question of movement of officials, this is a very hard question to answer because people move all the time. People get promoted and people get transferred, all for good reason. I can say that it has been agreed that one officer of this section has been removed to try his expertise in another field.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[3]/question.block[6]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Minister, in your speech on land cover disturbance and vegetation clearance, you indicated that the largest area being cleared is in Queensland and that leasehold approvals were given to clear over one million hectares in one year. Recently we have seen clearing of rainforest in the Daintree, extensive clearing of mahogany glider habitat and clearing, leading to koala road kills, in the Burdekin. I ask the minister: what measures has the federal government taken in response to the loss of such significant habitats in the last month? Has he received a request for funding from the Queensland government and will he match the Queensland government money to purchase these habitat areas?","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[3]/question.block[7]/question[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
182,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator FAULKNER","5K4","NSW","ALP","N/A",1993,"—The mahogany glider, as Senator Woodley would know, is listed as an endangered species under the Commonwealths Endangered Species Protection Act. Its range is narrowly restricted to predominantly coastal eucalypt forest in North Queensland from near Ingham to Tully. Through the endangered species program of ANCA within my portfolio, significant research and habitat identification have been and are continuing to be funded for this species.The clearing of mahogany glider habitat is a serious issue and it is one that needs to be addressed. But the clearing of native vegetation in North Queensland, including mahogany glider habitat, is not occurring solely as a result of the sugar industry infrastructure package, as has been mentioned by some. There are a range of factors involved, including the fact that there is currently a high price for sugar—that has created favourable economic conditions—and the fact that land is rated on agricultural suitability, irrespective of whether it retains native vegetation or not. Of course, that means that land holders can be financially disadvantaged if they retain native vegetation. There are also significant other developments, such as residential subdivision, which are having an impact on native vegetation. There are a number of other issues, as I am sure Senator Woodley understands, where the Commonwealth has little jurisdiction—in fact, very little control at all.I am closely liaising with the Queensland Minister for Environment and Heritage, Molly Robson, to explore a range of mechanisms to protect native vegetation in North Queensland. The minister has raised the issue of Commonwealth financial support with me and has asked for the establishment of a working group of Commonwealth and state officials. I have responded to the Queensland minister agreeing to the establishment of the working group. That will, of course, identify priorities and develop an appropriate response, particularly to the protection of mahogany glider habitat. The working group is also planned to assess the likely budgetary implications, the timing and mechanisms of any proposed action. I have also written to my colleague Senator Bob Collins on these matters seeking a nominee from his department to participate in this working group.I am particularly interested to explore those mechanisms in addition to land purchase which have been identified in the environmental impact assessment process which has been conducted as part of the sugar industry infrastructure package. These include cooperative measures, in conjunction with local government and land-holders, to encourage and formally agree on the retention of native vegetation. I certainly welcome the fact that the Queensland government has acted to protect important habitat in the short term. I understand that it has placed some 16 interim conservation orders over critical habitat in the Ingham and Herbert River area.

Could you also confirm for me, because I was not quite sure what you were saying, whether or not you are going to contribute funds to the purchasing of habitat?","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[3]/question.block[7]/question[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
184,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator FAULKNER","5K4","NSW","ALP","N/A",1993,"—Very quickly, the sugar industry infrastructure package consists of 12 infrastructure projects, seven of which have been designated under the Commonwealths Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. Approval for those projects is conditional on satisfactory Commonwealth-Queensland environmental impact assessments being implemented for each of these projects. A number of initiatives have already been identified in environmental impact assessments commenced for these projects to assist in the protection of important mahogany glider habitat.In relation to the second part of your supplementary question, Senator, the suggestion that has been made that the Commonwealth has not provided any money to protect critical habitat is wrong. The Commonwealth has funded and will continue to fund the acquisition of habitat through our national reserves cooperative program. Just last week, for example, I announced $1.125 million towards the acquisition of property at Silver Plains in North Queensland. It is, in fact, home to over 100 rare and endangered plants and animals. It is an announcement that has been well received right across the community.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[3]/question.block[7]/answer[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Might I say by way of parenthesis that the actual book that was submitted for the prize was the blue book, Cooperating for Peace , itself. The article simply was a supplementary piece of material. The jury actually decided that the article, because it was in an American journal, I suspect, was the one that it wanted to particularly base the prize on. But that is neither here nor there.The story of the production of the article was this. Andrew Mack was one of those people from the ANU who was collaborating with me on the preparation of the original book Cooperating for Peace . He developed a strong view that the themes running through—","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[3]/question.block[8]/answer/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

188,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator GARETH EVANS","VD4","VIC","ALP","N/A",1994,"—Let me finish, Senator Hill. He took the view that the themes in that particular book deserved wider currency and publication and that I ought to write something for publication in an absolutely mainstream American journal, because there was a much better chance of getting the ideas out and about than would otherwise be the case.I responded favourably to that suggestion but asked him, because of the pressure of time I was under, to have a go at reducing the Cooperating for Peace book to its bare essentials in the form of a publishable article. That is the draft that was done for me. As discussion proceeded on the kind of article the publishers were looking for, the shape of the article—I had to remind myself of that from the files that I asked to be brought into the chamber after Senator Vanstone asked her question—really changed quite a lot. From being a general summary of all of the themes in the blue book, it narrowed down to a quite specific account, development or extension of the theme of the blue book, intrastate conflict, which was touched upon only relatively lightly in the book itself.So the article took a new form. Although I did draw on aspects of Professor Macks draft—which I found very helpful because he is an outstanding academic and scholar, and a very helpful collaborator—the article, as finally published, represents very much my own contribution to this debate. As proof, I table the manuscript as produced by me as the first draft of the article. The manuscripts went through a number of subsequent refinements, as things do. These are just corrected typescripts and do not have the impact of this manuscript copy.You will see, Senator Vanstone and anyone else who cares to examine it—and I hope a few do—that, overwhelmingly, the article in its construction and language is my own. There are something like 26 pages of manuscript, with just a handful of pages involving re-cuttings and re-pastings of that material. I am not sure whether I was quite accurate in saying that the proportion was 85:15—I might have been doing Professor Mack a bit of injustice in that respect. No doubt, Senator Vanstone will pore over the manuscript with a ruler. The truth of the matter is that the concept of the article, as it finally appeared, was mine and, overwhelmingly, the content was mine.

In those circumstances, Professor Mack said that he was delighted for the article to go forward without the normal attributions of input—however minor—that I have always been willing to make.While I am on my feet, I also table a copy of the accounts for Cooperating for Peace , which we would have submitted in estimates committee had anyone been interested in asking for them.

Next time Senator Forshaw tours the shearing sheds he might take Senator Neal with him.I wish to refer to the answer given by Senator Collins today to my question with regard to the worm known as Trichinella spirallis, which is in pork meat and which is particularly prevalent in Canada. My question related to the alteration of the protocols with regard to the entry of pork into Australia and what was required. Unfortunately, Senator Collins is not here. It is an incredibly important matter. I wish to inform Senator Collins and the chamber that a Pig Research and Development Corporation memo states:On 1 June 1995 advice was received from AQIS that following a request from Agriculture & Agri Food Canada the import requirements for pigmeat from Canada have been amended.So the first thing that tells us is that our protocols are being run from Canada and are not controlled by AQIS and the minister. It then states:Basically the changes remove the requirement that meat be frozen at minus 18 degrees C for at least 30 days providing that the meat is heated according to current specifications at 55 degrees C . . .It then states:. . . it appears—and I emphasise the word `appears—that the cooking process itself inactivates the Trichinella organisms . . .This is a very serious matter. It is human health that is at risk. I said in my question today that approximately eight people a year die in Canada from this, as well as other people elsewhere in the world. We now find under this minimum approach to the entry of imported goods into this country that the protocols are breaking down.An enormous debate has occurred in the grain industry about the import of grain into this country, and the minister was hauled back from his previous position. We have seen the problems in the salmon industry in Tasmania. We do not know what the hell is going on with the pilchards in this country. There was the case of the lupins that came into Western Australia which had to be totally destroyed because of a disease imported from Europe. They even went past the protocol system; they were not inspected. Once again we see that this minister is completely out of touch with his department and AQIS. We find AQIS making the decisions.In a previous answer to a question by Senator Boswell the minister made mention of the fact that before pig meat could come into Australia it had to be frozen. The facts are quite different from that. I noted in the answer to my question that Senator Collins said he would look into the matter and come back to the Senate if necessary.Senator Collins should have known that this was going to happen and he should have acquainted himself with the facts and the risks. He should have known, through advice from his own department, that this reference to cooking was referred to only in the context of `appears and not that it did.I put it on the public record that under the minimal approach to protocols that we are adopting in this country, enormous damage will be done to public health, industry and a whole range of people—and that those risks need not be taken. One of the reasons these things are getting passed is that we have a minister who is becoming very tired and is inadequate for the performances required to protect Australian industry and Australian people.I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the memo from the corporation. I have had this action cleared with the duty minister.Leave granted.The document read as follows—PIG RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CORPORATIONPO Box 4804, KINGSTON ACT 2604 Phone: (06) 272 5139Fax: (06) 272 5879MEMORANDUMDate:6 June 1995To:Mr Trevor HopeChairmanDr Rob Wilson DirectorMr Bruce MuirheadDirectorDr Roger CampbellDirectorMr Ian Farran DirectorDr Richard SheldrakeDirectorDr John Holder DirectorMr John GirdlestoneDirectorFrom:Dr Mike Taverner Executive DirectorRef:MRT:hra:069Re:Proposed Changes to Import Requirements for Canadian MeatOn 1 June 1995 advice was received from AQIS that following a request from Agriculture & Agri Food Canada the import requirements for pigmeat from Canada have been amended.Basically, the change has removed the requirement that the meat be frozen at minus 18(o) degrees C for at least 30 days providing that the meat is heated according to current specifications at 55(o) degrees C for not less than 60 minutes or reaches a pH of 5.2. The requirement for freezing was to inactivate Trichinella spiralis however, it appears that the cooking process itself inactivates the Trichinella organisms and therefore it is not necessary that the meat be frozen prior to export. There are some supporting technical references to this document, however, there appears to be little that can be done other than noting this change.If there are further actions or information required by Directors, please contact me.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[3]/question.block[9]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
214,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MICHAEL BAUME","LE4","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A",1998,"—I support what Senator Crane said. As Senator Crane pointed out, the word `appears is an incredible one in the circumstances because, as he said, the requirement for freezing was to inactivate trichinella spiralis. However, it `appears that the cooking process itself inactivates the organism and, therefore, it is not necessary that the meat be frozen prior to export.When you are making a serious change like that, you do not do it on the basis of an appearance. One would have thought you would do it on the basis of scientific proof. If there is scientific proof, then the word `appears should not appear there—it is shown to be. But for it to `appear to be, we are going to change the rules no matter what risks Senator Crane has pointed out exist.The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins) not only has to come back, as Senator Crane said, but also to provide this Senate with the scientific proof supporting the proposition that the cooking process itself inactivates the trichinella organisms. Without that proof, I think it is improper for this change to be made and to be done in a way about which not even the minister knows.This is even more extraordinary—on a day when the minister is meeting the industry, when Senator Crane asked this question, he did not know the facts about this change in the protocol which significantly affects the standing of this industry. I find it absolutely incredible that the minister was either kept in ignorance or failed to find out.The other point I want to make briefly about the minister is that he said in this answer and, I think, in the response to Senator Boswells question, that imports represented something like only two per cent of total pork products. That is a ludicrous and inappropriate measure—and the minister knows it.The cuts coming in from Canada are the prime cuts—the essential bits that have the big market. The whole of the pig does not make bacon. The minister has failed to note the proportion of imports in relation to the cuts of pork with which those imports compete.So it would be very nice and a pleasant change if this minister at last produced some figures which were honest and to the point: what is the relative significance of imports relating to those prime cuts that are competing with Australian pork?I can remember when I was in the beef industry people assuming that the price of rump steak should bear some relationship to the cost of buying a bullock on the hoof. If only the whole of the beast had been rump steak there might have been some relevance to it. But there are a whole lot of bits like brisket, for example, which earn you very little.So all I want is, firstly, for the minister to be well informed and a lot better informed about what is going on in this industry than he is; and, secondly, to produce figures when he is trying to argue a case in this chamber that bear some relevance to reality.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[3]/question.block[10]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
215,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BROWNHILL","RD4","(New South Wales-","NP","Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia)",1999,"—I support the remarks that were made by Senator Crane and Senator Michael Baume when taking note of those two answers. I do not think Senator Bob Collins, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, really got to the nub of the question. Senator Boswell was talking about the fact that 20 per cent of pig farmers have been lost to the industry in the last six months. He said that he recognised the problems grain prices caused for pig producers. Grain prices have risen because of a shortage of supply.I am also disturbed about the answer that Senator Collins gave about the grain industry when he spoke about imported grain. Of course that is of concern; it is a problem for people in the grain—I declare my pecuniary interests in that regard. He said that in 1995-96 grain prices will fall below or be at pre-1993 levels. That will mean that he will have a grain industry that will go down the chute because, if grain is produced at the levels of the cost of production in the 1995-96 year and if producers only get pre-1993 prices for it, they will be in a great deal of trouble.One of the problems that I do not think the minister has addressed is the fact that the government has imposed costs and charges on the farming community, whether they be pig producers, grain producers or whatever. We have wholesale sales taxes and fuel price increases and transport cost increases because of the wholesale sales tax increases. We have waterfront problems which have not been cleaned up. We have no labour market reform to make the cost in our abattoirs cheaper, or at least competitive with other countries, when killing our animals, whether it be pigs or whatever. I do not think that the minister has quite grasped that.The minister said that this afternoon he would be talking with people from the industry and that there may be an Industry Commission reference regarding the competitiveness of the pig industry. That is okay, but all those costs and charges, unless they are taken off, will still not solve the problems of the industry. He also said that they will look at what damage is being caused by the subsidies that have been given to the industry in Canada. He indicated too that he would look at the dumping problem but, as Senator Boswell made the point, it was proved some time ago that injury had been caused but nothing at all had happened about it.Basically, I believe that the minister missed the point with his answer to the question. I think it is high time that this government took note of the costs and charges associated with primary industry, whether it be in the pig, pork or bacon industries or whatever.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[3]/question.block[11]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

218,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COONEY","SF4","(Victoria)","ALP","N/A",1999,"—I know. Of course you were not criticising him. Those who suggested that the pig farmers should be here during question time so that they could hear what the opposition was saying on their behalf should not be criticised either. I am glad that Senator Crane raised that point. This minister, who has been criticised in other respects, I presume is at this very minute doing what he should be doing. He has gone off to speak to the farmers. The matter has to be talked through. I think that that is the thing that both sides of the chamber should be intent upon doing rather than criticising the minister for what he is supposed not to have done.We should be working through this problem because it is a more difficult problem than might have been thought. I am not sure whether Senator Crane is saying that any imports from Canada should be banned, that we should shut Canada out of the market, or whether he is saying that there should be fair competition. He has not made that clear.We should trade with Canada more and more if we can. There is benefit in trade with Canada, and that trade will be prejudiced if we use wrong tests to exclude its product. If the salmon and pig meat that Canada wants to bring to Australia are diseased, then they should be shut out, but they should be shut out on that basis and not on another basis. I think that much has been done by the high commissioner from Canada, Mr Berry, in this respect. I think he has taken a very appropriate approach to this, and it would be very good for our international relations with Canada—a great friend of this country—if we approached this problem properly. The government, through its minister, is out there at this very moment talking this through with the farmers so that our farmers, our trade with Canada and our relations with Canada may be properly looked after.The farming sector of this country is, as this government has said again and again, an integral part of the economy and an integral part of society. Senator Crane, I am glad that you have acknowledged that the minister is presently doing what he should be doing, that he can talk this problem through with the industry and that a proper and enlightened solution will be found.Question resolved in the affirmative.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[3]/question.block[12]/speech/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
219,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COULTER","TF4","(South Australia)","AD","N/A",2000,"—I move:That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), to a question without notice asked by Senator Coulter this day, relating to the announced resumption of French nuclear testing in the South Pacific Region.Yesterday, we debated a private members bill which would have had the effect of banning Australian uranium exports to France, and that debate was gagged on a motion by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) with the support of the opposition. We have seen further evidence since yesterday that the French have not even been honest about why they are conducting these tests. I referred in my question to an article in this weeks New Scientist , a very reputable science magazine, which said:France will use the eight nuclear tests it announced last week to design a new improved warhead, according to researchers who keep a watch on weapons development. The official line that France needs to carry out the tests to perfect its computer models of nuclear explosions—which will eventually replace the tests—is grossly exaggerated, they say.. . . . . . . . .CHIRAC claims that the tests are needed to ensure the `safety, security and reliability of Frances nuclear deterrent and to help it to develop a system for simulating nuclear tests in the laboratory. He says that after the tests, France will sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty `without reserve. . .Prime Minister Alain Juppe says the tests are not aimed at making a new type of weapon. But Christopher Paine, senior researcher at the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington DC is not convinced. `Why the French need to do the tests and why they say they need to do them are two different things, he says.Last year, Paine visited Paris as a member of a team investigating Frances attitude to nuclear testing. The team uncovered official concerns over the long-term reliability of the warhead installed in its submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Paine and other scientists monitoring nuclear arms say France will use the explosions to test a more robust design of warhead. Marc Launois, deputy director of the military applications division of Frances Atomic Energy Commission, says only that the tests will be used to `perfect French weapons.Here is the denouement:Chiracs mention of laboratory simulations refers to a planned 10 billion-franc—that is $3.5 billion—programme, called PALEN. This will include a giant laser, called Megajoule, which will be built near Bordeaux and should be ready by 2003. Weapons scientists can use lasers to recreate the conditions at the heart of a thermonuclear explosion. They train the beams of light on frozen pellets of hydrogen, forcing the pellets to implode and the hydrogen nuclei to fuse. The results will help to build computer models of nuclear blasts.There we have the explanation for the term `improving the computer models. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the tests in the Pacific. It goes on:But Paine says French officials have `vastly overstated the need for more tests to design simulation methods. Patricia LEWIS, director of the Verification Technology Information Centre in London, goes further. She says the French need no more tests because they could simply use models developed by the US and apply them to data collected during past tests. But Launois argues that insufficient data were collected at earlier tests.It goes on to say:`France has always jealously guarded its nuclear independence.My God, it jealously guards its nuclear independence at the expense of the whole world.Again, I make the plea that this is further evidence that Mr Chirac, the French president, is quite deliberately misleading the rest of the world in relation to the nature of those computer modelling tests. He is referring to something quite different from the nuclear explosions. He is misleading the rest of the world.We have seen seven heads of government in Europe go to the French president and complain. We have seen the French president ignore those complaints. We have seen the French president ignore the complaints of the Australian government, the New Zealand government and a number of governments in the South Pacific area. The arrogance of this man really needs to be brought to book.I believe, as I said yesterday, that the only action the Australian public will accept as reasonable for the Australian government to do in relation to these French tests is to ban the export of Australian uranium to France. We indicated in 1988 that well over 2,000 kilograms of Australian uranium was mislabelled and could have found its way into nuclear tests. That is quite contrary to what the minister said in his reply when he indicated that only three per cent of Australian uranium is used by France. A danger lies there. We think that strong action needs to be taken.

220,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator HARRADINE","6H4","(Tasmania)","IND","N/A",2001,"—I move:That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), to a question without notice asked by Senator Harradine this day, relating to comments made by the Governor-General on 21 June 1995 concerning euthanasia.Senator Gareth Evans was not intentionally misleading the chamber when he responded to me, but he said things to the chamber which were in direct contradiction to what he said to the chamber on 20 October 1983 in respect of the very matter about which I asked him. I referred to section 9 of the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act and the inappropriateness of the Governor Generals pro-euthanasia statement in light of the fact that that section enables the Governor-General to disallow that legislation within six months of its being affirmed by the administrator.The minister, Senator Gareth Evans, told the Senate this afternoon that that would need to be on advice. Nobody doubted that that would need to be on advice, but on advice from whom? The minister said that it would be on the advice of the Northern Territory government. That is quite different to what he told the Senate on 20 October 1983. I will read what he said to the Senate then:I understand that section 9 of that Act—that is, the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act—allows the Governor-General acting, of course, on the advice of the Executive Government of the Commonwealth to disallow a Territory law or any part of a law within six months of the Territory Administrators assent to it.As I said, the minister has probably only unintentionally misled the chamber, but it is a very important point because this government should grasp the nettle on this issue. Not only did the minister not accept my invitation to consider as proper the Governor-Generals statement; he actually described it as `controversial. In government parlance, that probably means `improper but why not come out and say so directly? This matter relates not only to the current situation with the Governor-General; it is also a question that the government, the parliament as a whole, and the people of Australia have to face in considering whether to have a president and how that president will be appointed or elected. Consideration of these matters is essential now before we get into further trouble.This is a situation where the Governor-General used his office to promote the legalisation of the intentional killing of one innocent human being by another human being. Not only is that improper; it also demeans the office of the Governor-General. That office is a symbol of the power of the state, and the state has the duty to uphold the right to life and liberty of all. For the occupant of that position to advocate the legalisation of the intentional killing of one innocent human being by another human being is to demean that office.The government should not leave it at `controversial. It should be straightforward in saying that the statement demeaned the office of the Governor-General and was entirely improper.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[3]/question.block[14]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
221,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ABETZ","N26","(Tasmania)","LP","N/A",2002,"—I want to congratulate Senator Harradine on his question. It is a pity that we cannot congratulate the minister on his answer. The matters raised in Senator Harradines question go to the very heart of why His Excellency should not have addressed such a controversial issue.There is legislation on the statute book, passed by this parliament, which officially requires His Excellency to exercise a judgment in relation to Northern Territory legislation within a period of six months. How on earth can he undertake that duty and that obligation when he has pre-judged and, in effect, broadcast his own personal views before he can be appropriately petitioned by the people or approached by the government, as it should approach him to cancel that legislation. That is the nub of this matter, which the government refused to address until recently.We had the giveaway line from Senator Gareth Evans that His Excellencys comments were controversial. I fully agree with Senator Harradine: if you listen to the poli-speak of Senator Evans and others, a word like `controversial in relation to one of their mates clearly means that the statement was highly inappropriate and improper. I am glad we got that admission out of the government since I spoke about this in the debate on matters of public interest earlier today.The Labor Partys silence on this matter to date has been absolutely appalling. In effect, it has given de facto support to the lack of value placed on human life by His Excellency in his speech. Indeed, when I asked a question about this matter earlier this week, the Minister for Family Services, Senator Crowley, said that it was inappropriate for the government to become involved. But the government found it quite proper to get involved when Arthur Tunstall made a comment completely unrelated to the government.

But the government cannot hide behind the fact that His Excellency was expressing a personal view. The government comes out on other occasions and attacks people who were also expressing a personal view, albeit that that person held high office—Arthur Tunstall. I suggest to Senator Faulkner that the Governor-General holds a lot higher office than Arthur Tunstall and therefore he should be even more restrained in the comments that he makes.The other part of this hypocrisy is that when the Western Australia governor made some controversial comments recently the Australian Labor Party in Western Australia was into him like a rat up a drain pipe. But that was okay because it was the Western Australia governor. The Australian Labor Party is happy to criticise him for his comments, but not the Governor-General—undoubtedly because he was a former mate of the Australian Labor Party. There is one thing about the Western Australia governor: he had the decency to apologise for having offended people. His Excellency the Governor-General ought to do the same.

238,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator HARRADINE","6H4","(Tasmania)","IND","N/A",2003,"—This report of the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Electronic Technologies gives to the chamber an update of the activities which the Senate committee is engaged in. It deals with our references relating to R-rated material on pay TV; the regulation of bulletin board systems; and the question that has been occupying our attention as well, program standards for free to air television. All of these matters, and others, are of vital interest to the public. I can say that the committee has addressed these matters with those concerns in mind.I also would like to say that the committee goes about its work in a very open way and has taken the opportunity to invite persons interested in particular subject areas referred to the committee to speak to the committee. For example, in regard to the operation of codes of practice in the television industry generally, the committee held a public seminar in Sydney on 18 May 1995, to which all players were invited. It was a very well attended meeting. It would be of interest, I am sure, to other senators and to the public at large to receive a transcript of the evidence and the discussion that took place at that public seminar.As a result of the work of the committee, when the broadcasting services legislation was dealt with by this parliament, a statement was made by the then Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Bob Collins, that it was the intention of the government not to allow on free to air television material that went beyond the former AO classification. The committee has referred to that in its report. I am glad to see that the chair of the committee, Senator Reynolds, has entered the chamber. She, like me, was probably under the impression that this would be coming on at about 20 minutes past 4.We have adverted to that matter in this report. It is a matter that the committee wishes the government to ensure occurs. There is also reference to the fact that the various program standards of content, et cetera, are not readily identifiable as uniform between the various free-to-air television stations such SBS, ABC and the commercial broadcasting stations.As the committee indicated, it awaits the response by the government in respect of its recommendations relating to R-rated material on pay television. As honourable senators will remember, we recommended against that. We indicated that we may reconsider our recommendation if the Attorney-General tabled a revised R classification to ensure the appropriateness for broadcasting of such material into the home environment. We had indicated in our report that our recommendation that R-rated material should not be permitted on pay television was based on the evidence of the community concern about the levels of violence in the media, especially depictions of sexual violence and realistic, degrading, demeaning or exploitative sexual material.The regulation of bulletin boards is a very topical issue at present. Many parents and, indeed, many people in the community generally are concerned about the material which is excessively violent or sexually explicit to be downloaded off Internet. Those who are involved in the Internet system may well have concerns about the integrity of that system if this is allowed to continue. We held a seminar on this matter, to which a number of people were invited. I am sure it would be of interest to honourable senators and members of parliament generally and the public generally to read the discussions that took place at that seminar. The volume is available from the committee on request.We noted in our report to you, Madam Deputy President, that the next meeting of the Standing Committee of Censorship Ministers is scheduled to be held in July 1995 at which a national approach will be discussed. The committee is most interested to hear what the decisions will be. We expect to hold public hearings with government representatives and technical experts on the adequacy and technical feasibilities of the ministers decisions. We also hope that the ministers will take particular account of the need to protect minors from material which could cause them harm—material that is readily available to any computer literate child. Many of them are very computer literate, especially the children that I know, in how they are able to handle that technology. That material needs to be addressed and action taken to ensure that the rights of children and parents are protected from that material and, indeed, the integrity of the system is upheld.I notice that Senator Reynolds is in the chamber.

239,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator REYNOLDS","XI4","(Queensland)","ALP","N/A",2004,"—I thank Senator Harradine. I am sorry I was not here for the tabling of the report because I think it is a report about issues that are of major concern out there in the Australian community. The issue of how to balance the new technology and management of the new technology against the standard of expectation in the Australian community is one that concerns all of us. I think the key is education. I am not convinced that it is a question of censorship, as such, but it is certainly a question of a sensible approach to education and appropriate regulation, be it self-regulation or regulation that is more prescriptive from government.The report covers three major issues. First of all, it covers our report on the issue of R-rated material on pay TV. This has created considerable interest in the community. During our year-long inquiry, we took evidence from experts in the fields of psychology, media studies and communications, as well as from a wide range of concerned community groups. The committee also closely examined the attitudinal research of the Australian Broadcasting Authority and found that, despite high levels of support for R-rated material on pay TV in principle, it is clear that media predictions of violence, and particularly sexual violence, are of major concern to the majority of Australians.In the ABA research we found that when we asked people, `Do you think R should be available on pay TV? everyone said, `Yes, that is okay, but later, in answering questions, they contradicted that view by expressing grave concerns about levels of violence already in the media and the possible impact that extreme depictions of violence, especially sexual violence, may have on certain personalities. Everyone felt that, while it would not affect them, it may affect other people; it may affect their behaviour and impact on society negatively.We found the ABAs research quite contradictory. That is why we finally came down with a recommendation to the government that there should be a review of the R category. There is R and there is R. It seems to have become a dumping ground for all material, a catch-all. When material cannot be classified in any other category, into R it goes. It means that there is certain material within the R category which we believe would be totally inappropriate to be, as Senator Harradine has put it, freely available and going into the home environment.I was in New Zealand on Monday and they are dealing with precisely the same issues. We know it is of concern in many countries. How you get the right balance between freedom of the individual, freedom of speech and the right of adults to see and read material of their choice, and the protection of children is no longer the old censorship debate of the 1960s, which is when I first became involved in the debate.We have taken on a new way of working on our committee. I think it is probably because we are committed to the promotion of an educated approach to these very complex issues. We ran two seminars, one on self-regulation in relation to codes of practice, and one on bulletin boards. We feel that a great deal of benefit came out of each of those seminars. The material will, we believe, assist not only us in making future recommendations but also censorship ministers as they consider the vexed question of how to regulate bulletin boards.We do think that the decision of censorship ministers next week is of critical concern to many parents, teachers and others who are concerned about the potential impact of young people having access to totally inappropriate material—they have even been put in touch with paedophiles through this new medium. But that is not to say that we should criticise the medium continually because the Internet has enormous opportunities for entertainment and knowledge. It is not appropriate for us to continually blame the medium but we do have to learn how to get the right balance between controlling the way in which the medium is used and appropriate community standards. That is where we come back to education.The seminar on programming in the television industry held in Sydney in May was the first parliamentary review of the effectiveness of the self-regulatory initiatives of the Broadcasting Services Act of 1992. All sectors of the industry were represented and the large public gallery indicated the interest in the topic in the general community.While the pay TV sector is still more concerned with technical and marketing issues than programming, free to air television has had nearly three years experience with self-regulation. In the Spring sittings the committee will present its report card on the state of the industry. It is fair to say now that there are aspects of the current system about which the committee does hold a number of concerns. I just want to flag those because the committee is still considering these issues.Over the next six months the committee will be continuing its inquiries into the regulation of bulletin boards and into television programming. We await the governments response in regard to two major issues: R-rated material on pay TV and overseas sources of audio tech services. The committee also foreshadows the conduct of further public seminars into major topical issues as its workload permits.One issue that I know a number of members of the committee are interested in pursuing is the question of the extent and availability of child pornography in Australia, notwithstanding the fact that it is illegal. Nevertheless, we know the material is available. There have been reports of just how many items have been seized by Customs. Of course, with every respect to Customs—and I note the minister is in the chamber—you have to wonder how much material may not necessarily be recognised at the border and how much material is circulating in the general community. That is of major concern. The Senate can be assured that the committee is still active and is, in my opinion—and I hope in that of other members—fulfilling a very important role. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.Leave granted; debate adjourned.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[3]/debate.sub2/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

241,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CALVERT","5F4","(Tasmania)","LP","N/A",2006,"—I move:That the Senate take note of the reports.The committees 16th and 17th reports for 1995 relate to joint venture housing developments to be undertaken by the Defence Housing Authority—DHA—in partnership with the Delfin property group in Darwin and Townsville. The committee, while recommending that both projects should proceed, has made a number of comments on each.The Darwin project, which is the subject of the committees 16th report for 1995, relates to the development of the Golf Course Estate at Palmerston, Northern Territory. The government decision to increase the army presence in the north involved a need to expand infrastructure works at Robertson Barracks and to provide additional housing in the Darwin area to accommodate army personnel and their families. The site to the north of University Avenue will be known as Fairway Waters in the suburb of Durack.The Defence Housing Authority proposes to develop a 132.9 hectare site in a joint venture project which will integrate service and private sector housing and yield some 1,400 units, of which approximately one-third will be retained for service families. The site is well located for army personnel working at Robertson Barracks and is in close proximity to the educational, community, recreational and commercial facilities of Palmerston.As part of the negotiations for this site, DHA has undertaken to extend the existing golf course at Palmerston to an 18-hole course at a cost of $4.7 million. Half of this cost will be borne by the joint venture partner. For a time the committee has been concerned that some DHA housing is being built too close together, with resultant lack of privacy for the occupants. The chairman made the comment that one TV would do the whole street. The committee, therefore, recommends that the Defence Housing Authority considers increasing the size of its housing blocks, so that more privacy is afforded to occupants of its houses.At the time of the public hearing, the Defence Housing Authority was not able to provide the committee with definite plans of the types of houses it intends to construct. The committee recommends that once housing plans are finalised, and before construction commences, the Defence Housing Authority formally briefs the committee on the types and cost of houses it intends to construct and the size of the blocks intended for the Golf Course Estate.The committee also recommends that the Defence Housing Authority includes in its contract documents a clause stating that subcontractors must be paid before progress payments are made to contractors. The committee was advised at the public hearing, that a site on Marjorie Street, approximately one kilometre to the north of the proposed estate, was used for many years as a Commonwealth, and later private, analytical laboratory. That site has elevated levels of lead, zinc, arsenic and cadmium.The committee was advised that preliminary investigations of this now vacant land indicate that there is a potential for the elevated levels to have extended along the drainage line onto the proposed site. However, the precise extent is unknown at this stage. It is therefore necessary to ensure that the site does not pose an environmental or health risk. In order to prevent such occurrences in the future the committee recommends that the Defence Housing Authority ensures that its sites have been examined and cleared of any possibility of contamination prior to referral of projects to the committee.The committee recommends the development of the Golf Course Estate at Palmerston Northern Territory, at an estimated cost of $144.02 million to the Defence Housing Authority, subject to confirmation that the Defence Housing Authority would build on the site only if any contamination has been remediated to the satisfaction of its expert advisers. The recommendation is also subject to the briefing of the committee by the Defence Housing Authority on the types and costs of houses it intends to construct, and the size of the blocks intended for the Golf Course Estate.The second report which I have just tabled, the committees 17th report for the year, deals with the development of land at the Willows in Townsville. The DHA identified a need to provide adequate housing for service families in Townsville. Originally, DHA formed a joint venture with Delfin Property Group to tender for a parcel of land at Douglas in Townsville. The tender was unsuccessful. Soon after, on behalf of the joint venture, DHA successfully negotiated the acquisition of 107 hectares of land at Kirwan, known as the Willows.Development of a portion of the land on the eastern side of the main stormwater drain has already taken place. The proposal examined by the committee involves the development of the balance of the land. It is planned that DHA acquire approximately 25 per cent of the lots from the joint venture at a reasonable discount and construct new houses for service families, specifically designed for the local climate.The DHA owns 833 houses in Townsville which are classified as being substandard and, of these, 309 will be disposed of and the balance will be upgraded over the next three years. I know that my colleague Senator Ian Macdonald, who is in the chamber this afternoon, has been very concerned about the standard of service families housing in Townsville for quite some time. The committee concluded that there is a need to provide additional houses in Townsville as a consequence of existing substandard housing, the DHA disposal program and planned relocations of Defence personnel to Townsville from southern states.The site which the joint venture will develop is 107 hectares, which will yield 1,000 blocks, of which no more than 20 per cent will be courtyard lots. DHA and Delfin will share the development costs and any profits equally.The DHA will acquire a minimum of 200 blocks during the life of the development, with the balance being offered for private sale. Traditional suburban blocks will be 650 square metres and courtyard lots 450 square metres. As was the case with the Palmerston report, the committee has recommended that the DHA should consider increasing the size of its housing blocks so that more privacy is afforded to occupants and advise the committee of the size of the blocks intended for the Willows development.The committee has recommended that before any site works commence a comprehensive resource inventory should be undertaken, including vegetation, soils and the presence and location of any cultural sites of significance. Measures designed to protect endangered or rare species and cultural sites found on the site should be implemented.The committee has made a number of recommendations concerning the design of the houses. The first is that the DHA, having gone to the expense of commissioning a portfolio of tropical housing designs, should retain ownership of any plans commissioned from local architects and engage tropical design experts from James Cook University to review any designs before they are accepted. When these plans are finalised and before construction commences at the Willows, the committee has recommended that the DHA should formally brief the committee on the types and cost of houses it intends to construct and the sizes of the blocks to be provided.Another matter relating to the design of houses involves the provision of solar hot water heaters. DHA advised the committee that it is not proposed to provide the houses with solar hot water heaters on the grounds that it not the community standard in Townsville. The committee believes that the stance taken by the DHA is at variance with the governments policy to nationally reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and the reasons for not installing them in Townsville are out of touch with national interest considerations.Current estimates suggest there are 250,000 solar hot water heaters already installed in Australia. The committee believes it is difficult to determine what community standards are with so many installed and strong growth expected as a consequence of Commonwealth initiatives such as the energy card.Community standards are dynamic and the committee believes the stance taken by the DHA should not be reactive. Accordingly, the committee has recommended that DHA houses in the Willows estate should be provided with solar hot water heaters. When referred to the committee the estimated cost of the proposed joint venture development was $37 million while land acquisition cost was $5.6 million, a total of $42.6 million. Being a joint venture DHA is responsible for 50 per cent of the broad acre development costs—a total of $21.3 million. The cost of the acquisition of allotments and the construction of 200 houses amounts to $38.517 million giving a total cost to DHA of $59.817 million. I commend the reports to the Senate.Question resolved in the affirmative.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[4]/debate.sub2/speech/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

244,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator IAN MACDONALD","YW4","(Queensland)","LP","N/A",2010,"—I suppose I should declare an interest in the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Modification (Excise) Bill 1995 and cognate bills before the parliament at the moment. Unlike a lot of Labor senators, I own my own home. It is an old Queenslander. It is one that regrettably constantly requires roofing and guttering. It is a big old wooden place which constantly requires painting. On the rare times that I have some spare time I do some painting, some sealing, some puttying and little odd jobs around the house, like every other Australian who owns a home and like those who would like to buy a home. I enjoy doing that sort of thing.In the future, if this bill is passed, it will cost me more every time I want to do some of those repairs. We have wanted our guttering repaired for months now. It is a bit hard to get a tradesman in my town at the moment. They left us alone for three months but fortunately—and I exerted no influence—they came along a couple of weeks ago and did my guttering. Unfortunately, the painter that we organised three or four months ago will not be there before 1 July. If this particular bill is passed, I will have to pay that much more. But will I? Senator Schacht might answer that question. As the minister for small business, he has been in Townsville telling the contractors how they will get on. My contractor has given me a fixed quote. He has not come yet. He will have to pay more for the paint that he uses on my place because of the wholesale sales tax that you want to charge him. What will he charge me? Will I have to pay it? My quote is a pretty fixed one. Someone is going to miss out. It may well have to be the small businessman that Senator Schacht is supposed to be looking after. I just hope that Senator Schacht, as the small business minister, will come over our side of the chamber and vote with us when this iniquitous tax on home owners and small businessmen is put before this parliament.I am looking at new carpet for my house, which will require adhesives. I am looking at new aluminium windows and joinery, which will need facings and sealants. I am looking at some additional joinery if I happen to get new kitchen cupboards. The Labor Party will ensure additional taxes if I want to put in some more tiles, and regrettably I do. If I have to put in a few electrical points, it will cost the small businessman money who will then pass the cost on to me. I declare an interest in this bill, but I emphasise that every other Australian house owner has an interest in this bill. That is why there has been such absolute outrage by Australians everywhere at this tax on housing. As my colleague Senator Gibson said, the slogan for the Labor Party will be, `If you want your house taxed, vote Labor. What better slogan could there be? That is obviously the way it will be.My colleagues have been through this bill, and I do not want to repeat too much of what they have said. But I point out that in the year 1989-90, just before the recession, sales tax raised $10.132 billion or 11 per cent of taxation revenue. That fell for a little while, but this year, should these bills be passed, the government will obtain $14.16 billion from sales tax or almost 12 per cent of the total taxation revenue. So much for the Labor Partys promise last election that taxes would not go up! In 1992-93, the government raised $47.5 billion in revenue from income tax on individuals. In 1995-96, the government has forecast that it will raise $62.25 billion from the taxation of individuals.I again ask: what happened to the Labor Partys promise not to increase taxation? In this budget the Labor Party is trying to put up the price of building materials by 12 per cent on those hardware and building material items which are subjected to this tax. They also want to put up the cost of a motor vehicle, the family car for ordinary Australians, by 30 per cent. So when you hear the Labor Party at the next election saying, `This is in legislation, this is law, we promise, we guarantee, we give an assurance, well cross our hearts and hope to die, we promise you all these things, you can understand what the Labor Party means by that. You have only to look at the last election to realise that their promises are not worth the ink on a scrap of paper.I do not really need to waste any of my time elaborating on that. The people of Australia have shown quite clearly in opinion polls recently that they have given up believing Mr Keating or any member of the Labor Party. Mr Keating has come out with all these major policy announcements that were supposed to boost him into an early election, clearing the decks, getting all these so-called beaut statements out. But the people of Australia just do not believe him any more. You know that, Madam Acting Deputy President, and Senator Schacht knows that. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is even very slowly starting to realise that the people of Australia do not believe him.","N/A","SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (EXCISE) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (CUSTOMS) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (GENERAL) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[1]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

246,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator IAN MACDONALD","YW4","(Queensland)","LP","N/A",2010,"—They were prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt. That was his first go as Prime Minister but they know from that that he simply cannot be trusted. You can laugh; you think telling lies is funny. Your Prime Minister thinks telling lies is funny. But the people of Australia have woken up; they understand.The Housing Industry Association has quite clearly shown that again this Labor government lies when it talks about its assessment. It talked about a $200 million receipt from this wholesale sales tax on building materials. The real figure, according to genuine assessments, is closer to the range of $500 million. They are not our figures; they are the figures of the Housing Industry Association. It might be remembered that is the group that was petrified by this governments policies last year so they took an active part in the campaign. The Prime Minister, in a democracy, simply shut them off, the sort of thing Hitler used to do—`Disagree with us, disagree with the government of the day, and youre finished; youre sacked from any boards, you dont get any help from the government. That is the way it goes. In a democracy, that is absolutely atrocious.As my colleague Senator Tambling mentioned, it is pretty interesting what encouraged Mr Howe to resign. Mr Howe, from the Left, had indicated he would stay as Deputy Prime Minister until the election. But somewhere along the line the heavies in the right wing of the Labor Party moved him on—that is, Mr Keating and his apparatchiks. As Senator Tambling said, it is interesting that Mr Howe had given a commitment of about $200 million for the better cities program mark 2. That was going to provide a fairly worthwhile campaigning tool for the Labor Party—$200 million. The money to be gained from the wholesale sales tax increase on housing was about the same figure.It seems quite likely that Mr Howe was now left in the position of having to convince the government to give another $200 million to the better cities program. That was going to be paid for by this tax on building materials. It seems fairly clear that, if you can believe the Democrats—I, for one, will not believe them until I see them on our side of the chamber when this matter is being voted on—that $200 million is not going to be there as revenue, leaving a huge $200 million hole in the Labor Partys budget.This wholesale sales tax exercise has been something that the Labor Party knew would cause it some political flak. So, like any good political party, it set out to manage it. How did it manage it? By telling its members to go out and tell a few more lies, like they did at the last election. The Assistant Treasurer, Mr Gear, sent out a statement, first of all saying—The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Reynolds) —Senator Macdonald, I have been listening very carefully to how you have been using the word `lie. I feel it is appropriate for me to say that it is unparliamentary to keep using that word. You have now named a minister in the other place. While you did not literally accuse him of lying, I would just indicate to you that the use of that word is unparliamentary.","N/A","SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (EXCISE) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (CUSTOMS) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (GENERAL) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[1]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
247,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator IAN MACDONALD","YW4","(Queensland)","LP","N/A",2010,"—Madam Acting Deputy President, I do not want to put you in any difficult situation. I am not sure if you are asking me to withdraw, but if you are, I withdraw saying Mr Gear told lies, or whatever it was that I said.Mr Gear issued a briefing note to Labor members telling them to go out and say there is no sales tax on services. Senator Schacht found out when he was in Townsville—your town and my town, Madam Acting Deputy President—that there is a sales tax on services. He might remember that he was in the office of the member for Herbert, Mr Lindsay, saying, `There is no tax on services. This is not a GST. They then rang the Taxation Office and found that, if you are building some kitchen cabinets, the price you pay for those kitchen cabinets is the material plus the labour costs—the services cost. When you sell that kitchen cabinet to someone you add the wholesale sales tax to it.It was clearly pointed out to Senator Schacht in Townsville that there is a sales tax on services. Mr Gear would have known that. I do not know what you would want to call it when Mr Gear knows that there is a sales tax on services and tells his members to go out and say that there is no sales tax on services. You need to find the word which explains that. In this briefing note to Labor members Mr Gear said, `Go out and tell them that for new houses the impact is expected to be in the range of $300 to $1,000. He then said:For a median house costing $155,000 . . . the impact may be around $500 to $800.He said that, for a modest home, it would be around $400. That is typical Labor Party stuff: talk about median, modest, normal, average—confuse the issue as best you can. Mr Gear in his note said:This measure will only add 0.02% to the price of a new home.Across Australia it will add approximately $300 to the price of the average home.In Perth, where the average new house costs $132,000, it will add around $260.Yesterday in the Senate, I tabled a certificate.

I will talk about the document I tabled yesterday which is from the Mike Corrigan Consultancy, dated 23 June. Mr Corrigan is a building cost consultant, quantity surveyor, project manager and contract administrator—a professional independent quantity surveyor. Mr Corrigan selected two types of houses that are fairly commonly sold in Townsville. I am not absolutely certain but I think they are in a building estate area where there is a range of houses within the same price range. One cost $100,000 and the other cost $136,000. Mr Corrigan said:The houses selected are typical examples from each price range and reflect the most common materials and finishes used in this region.That is your region and mine, Madam Acting Deputy President, but it would be the same in any part of regional Australia. He went through item by item—this is a professional cost consultant—and listed them all. If I get leave to incorporate the certificate they will be in the Hansard for everybody to see what the additional costs are.No challenge has been made to that.

255,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator IAN MACDONALD","YW4","(Queensland)","LP","N/A",2010,"—Those are all the figures. They are not my figures. As I say, I would not know what the figures are. But an independent professional quantity surveyor has listed those figures.That shows, Madam Acting Deputy President, that in yours and my town, for those wanting to buy a $100,000 house the price will go up by $1,950; and if they are building a house worth $136,000 the price will go up by $3,445. You might remember that Mr Gear said in his briefing note that an average house in Perth was $132,000 and he told Labor Party members to tell people that the tax on that would be $260—$260! And here is a professional quantity surveyor saying that the real additional cost is $3,445.I will not say that Mr Gear or Labor Party members who use that example are telling lies. But the facts are there for themselves: Mr Gear says that the sales tax on building items on a $132,000 house will add $260 to the cost; and the professional quantity surveyor, who has an actual house in Townsville that he has been through and costed, says that the tax on that $136,000 house is $3,445. So call it what you want.When I raised this very serious matter in the parliament yesterday, what sort of response did I get from the senior ministers of the crown? Madam Acting Deputy President, in answer to a very serious question that will mean another $3,500 to people in yours and my town of Townsville, Senator Faulkner said:What about the grand vision, you hypocrite?That is the sort of response we get from the Labor Party. That is the sort of thing you expect from a government that has been in office far too long, has lost the plot, has become arrogant and does not care about ordinary people in my town, your town, or any other part of regional Australia—just does not care.What did Senator Cook say when he waffled on about it? First of all, he said, `No-one has ever given us the figures. We have given them to him now. Then he babbled on with this idiocy, saying that if we knock off these tax increases then the interest rates will go up.What about the government knocking off a couple of hundred million dollars from the Qantas float? Would that raise interest rates as well? It seems that it is only things that we knock off that will cause interest rates to rise, but if it is something the government knocks off then that will not cause interest rates to rise at all. So the absolute hypocrisy of the answer, again, is breathtaking.No less august body than the Australian Institute of Quantity Surveyors in its press release of 27 June quite clearly estimates that there will be a one per cent increase in the initial cost that would wipe out the advantage of interest rate falls. Even if interest rates fell by one per cent, the prime cost rise caused by the new tax would offset any interest saved. All of the other experts in the market have said the same thing and the institute is saying the same thing, that this pretty trite argument of Senator Cooks has no basis—and this has been exposed everywhere.Finally, Madam Acting Deputy President, because I have nearly run out of time—and that is of some regret as I had a lot more to say—I do mention that—","N/A","SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (EXCISE) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (CUSTOMS) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (GENERAL) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[1]/talk.start[7]/para","N/A","N/A"

258,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MARGETTS","DX5","(Western Australia)","GWA","N/A",2015,"—The sales tax exemptions and classifications related bills have a number of issues of concern. I will outline some of the key issues and in the committee stage I will give more details on the specifics. For example, passenger motor vehicles: not necessarily the rate of tax but the mechanism by which the tax was charged from budget night—which I know was charged on a lot of small items generally so as not to give undue benefits to some people and cause a rush on certain items—the problem is that obviously a number of people in our community, before there were any rumours of an increase in sales tax, were committed to the purchase of a motor vehicle. The problem is that those people are locked in.The government is saying that those people have access to the Trade Practices Commission. This may well be true, but the average persons ability to utilise the law may be limited. It may also mean a feast for lawyers in this case. But there is no indication from the government that it may make this mechanism a little easier. There may be occasional rorts in the system. There may also be a number of people who have been caught. For most people, the second most valuable purchase that they make is a car. Of course, the family home is the biggest financial stake. It means that, if they have signed a contract to purchase a car, then an increase of this nature is substantial, especially if they are scraping to make the repayments.There needs to be some mechanism other than a wipe of the hand saying, `Let them eat cake, or in this case, `Let them go to the Trade Practices Commission, to enable those people to more easily seek redress, or to allow some justice for people who are linked into a contract. A contract is a binding document.I know the government will say, `People dont complain if we give them a tax reduction. They are not usually the same people. We are talking about substantial amounts of money. We are not talking about very small amounts of money. It is really not good enough to say, `They will not complain if they get a tax decrease. It is not a sufficient answer.There are problems in the impost of a sales tax on building materials. The problems here seem to stem from the government suddenly realising that, in making a two footed jump to appear purer than pure in the Uruguay Round of GATT, we have gone from a 35 per cent import duty on such things as tiles to eight per cent—and that will go down to seven per cent.Under the Uruguay Round of GATT the import duty was not required to go down from 35 per cent. But the government did it just to prove how wonderful we are and to try to assume that the rest of the world would be just as wonderful. Well, they were not. The point is that now, to make up the revenue, we are doing things like increasing taxes on the things that everybody needs—the basic parts of houses.Everybody needs tiles. Now the Australian tile industry, which at this stage is producing about 20 per cent of tiles, will find it a lot more difficult to survive because tiles, for instance, as an item will become more expensive. It means that, once again, this measure will have an adverse impact on local industry and local joiners—and tiles are a basic part of a house. The reality is that the measure will have a greater effect on those people building a basic house than on those people building a very large house. Although you might have two bathrooms, it does not mean that you have a bigger percentage of those particular items.Perhaps the least defensible of all—although the building materials section was obviously fairly poorly put together—in my opinion, in terms of logic, is the change in the tax treatment of recycled paper. The reason is that even American economists who have used the real economic rationalism—not this pretend fundamentalism—will say that if you are going to have a `market economy what you do is even up the uneven playing field by looking at what the real costs of economic decisions are and using such things as the tax system to enable that playing field to at least be level. If you do not do that you are not creating a market, what you are doing is creating market imperfections. This is classic economic theory. We are assuming that that does not exist, and we are assuming that there is a level playing field; well, there is not.The government makes certain commitments to the industry in order to enable recycling industries to get off the ground. It is quite true that the big players in the game—who mostly use organochlorines and who mostly continue the majority of their operations in ways that we think are very detrimental to the environment—dont mind about this increase. And why dont they mind? They dont mind because it means the little players—the people who are actually setting up their industries to produce recycled products as an entire industry—are going to go under.I wonder about a government which sometimes pretends in international fora to be worlds best practice, environmentally sensitive and so on, yet is standing by and allowing the big players in this industry in reality to stomp on the small players who are trying to do the right thing.There are a lot of areas within sales tax which cannot be defended. There is not even a GATT excuse in relation to recycled paper. I asked very carefully during the committee hearing on the World Trade Organisation bills whether the governments move to remove this tax differential was to do with GATT. The answer from the government was that it was not to do with GATT; that we were not required under GATT to remove this, but we were doing it anyway.So if there is a GATT excuse, it was not admitted before. If there is no requirement under GATT for us to remove this differential on recycled paper, there is no excuse whatsoever to remove the commitment the government gave to this industry, and no excuse at all, I believe, to be putting back the disadvantage companies will have by doing the right thing by the environment and avoiding the cost that otherwise the community ends up paying. The community ends up cleaning up the river system; the community loses the amenities of the forests; the community ends up paying those otherwise external costs.Until governments, on whichever side of politics, recognise, firstly, that those external costs exist; and, secondly, that as a government they have a role to play in seeing that those external costs are built into the equation, you can talk all you like about the market but it is certainly not an even playing field, it is an uneven playing field, in that the government is loading the dice towards those who would continue to pollute the environment and inefficiently use resources.There are a lot of issues here; there is obviously going to be an interesting committee stage, and you will be hearing more specifics as we go on.","N/A","SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (EXCISE) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (CUSTOMS) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (GENERAL) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
259,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COOK","RF4","(Western Australia-","ALP","Minister for Industry, Science and Technology and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Science)",2017,"—The Senate is debating the second reading of three sales tax bills—the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Modification (Excise) Bill 1995, the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Modification (Customs) Bill 1995 and the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Modification (General) Bill 1995. We are now concluding the second reading debate in which honourable senators have dealt with the broad purposes of the legislation. They have debated how well the legislation addresses that purpose. On behalf of the government, therefore, I conclude the debate by replying to the views expressed by, I think, 16 members of this chamber who participated in the debate.It is perhaps in its own way right that there should have been a number of participants in the second reading stage of this debate because these are significant items of legislation. The bills themselves are probably unexceptional in the detail that they contain but what they signify is indeed very important. They spring from the budget this year—the 1995-96 budget—which was brought down on 9 May. The budget is a budget for its time.This year the budget, which is a major event in Australias annual economic calendar, addressed a number of important elements which are necessary to maintain the economy of Australia on a sustainable growth path. The budget addresses ever improving living standards. It addresses the need to cut unemployment, to improve the growth prospects of the economy, to keep inflation low and to ensure that Australia is able to hold its head up in the world economy as a model to others. It does so by, for the first time, putting in place a medium-term program to enhance national savings.The linchpin of that program is, of course, the superannuation provisions that the government has made in this budget. On the one hand, these provisions guarantee Australians a dignified and decent retirement at levels above the age pension. On the other hand, they ensure that Australia builds up a pool of national savings capable of being tapped to reinvest in the growth of the Australian economy; that we do not have to borrow from foreigners in order to finance our own growth.One of the most striking features of this budget is that it engages in what all of the commentators and the opposition were encouraging us to do but which we, in our own way, believed was right—to tighten the fiscal parameters of the budget. We have done so in a responsible way, in a balanced way and in an appropriate way. That is, we have sought to tighten them in a manner in which the social obligations of a government to provide proper education, health and social security are protected and maintained at worlds best level. Nonetheless, we have sought to find savings. We have cut back government outlays in a variety of ways.One of the features of this budget is that it is a fiscally tight budget. As I say, the responsible commentators have been calling on us to do that. This tightening also involved the further additional step of putting some Commonwealth assets up for sale.The net effect of what we have done is to bring the budget into surplus in this coming year—a surplus of $718 million. Although this is not the first surplus for this government, it is indeed an important surplus; a surplus that in economics terms is an important provision in the counter-cyclical nature of economic management. It is an appropriate time to bring the budget into surplus. The surplus next year will be one of $3.4 billion. In 1996-97 it will be $7 billion plus, and that will be a structural surplus. We will have started to lift off with our pool of national savings, which are so important to the future health of our economy and so important to addressing the nagging questions of the current account deficit.So far so good. Everyone agrees in theory that these things should be done; they applaud that these things should be done. The government has had the courage, the determination and the foresight to do them.","N/A","SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (EXCISE) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (CUSTOMS) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (GENERAL) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[3]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

261,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COOK","RF4","(Western Australia-","ALP","Minister for Industry, Science and Technology and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Science)",2017,"—We debated last years budget last year. We are in a responsible position this year. I accept the interjection and say that, if Senator Kernot disagreed with our budget last year and thought we should have been tighter, last year was the time to say so. I would be grateful if Senator Kernot could tell me which areas of the budget she believes we should have cut last year. The important thing here is that, irrespective of what she thought of last years budget, the proposition before the chamber now is this years budget. This years budget delivers on fiscal tightening and achieves a surplus. To unmake that is to swim against the tide of your own interjection—the inference that we are not fiscally tight enough. The question that is coming forward is the position of the other parties.Let me conclude my narrative. The actions taken by this government are broadly endorsed by the OECD, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. In the private sector, the international ratings agency Moodys has recently expressed itself about the Australian economy, maintaining our credit rating but observing the major fiscal tightening that we have undertaken, and, indeed, coming to a lower forecast than our budget papers suggest on what the future track of the current account deficit might be and urging further fiscal tightening—something which we have heeded and which will take place next year and the following year. I am saying that there is a great deal of endorsement for what the government has done.What does it mean to ordinary Australians? Governments answer to their people, so that question is an important consideration for this Labor government. For ordinary Australians, the significance of this budget means downward pressure on interest rates across the board but, for most Australians who are borrowers, on mortgages to finance their homes, the significance is downward pressure on those home loan interest rates. If interest rates were to fall one per cent, it would boost the ability of average Australians to purchase a new home, and it would increase that affordability by eight per cent, which would mean a reduction across the board in the price of an average home to the average Australian of $9,500.This budget brings downward pressure on aiming and achieving those and better gains on interest rates, and they have those massive across the board benefits. I do not think anyone queries that. Given the speeches in the second reading debate by several honourable senators opposite and on the crossbenches, we have in this chamber the proposal to unmake the budget, to relieve that downward pressure, to take the pressure off interest rates and to do a number of other things which work against what everyone in loud chorus has said is the most important issue—attacking the current account deficit.But when it comes to the point of having a macro-economic strategy which does those things positively, which is acclaimed around the world and approved of in this budget, and when it comes to the point of taking the responsible steps to deliver, what do we have from the opposition? We have obstruction. It wants to punch a $1.5 billion hole in this years budget and take the downward pressure on interest rates off. One can only assume that those opposite are therefore quite happy to see interest rates in Australia remain stable or increase. That is the only logical consequence of what they are saying. No matter how you cut the cake and no matter how you throw the dice, that is the absolute outcome of the position from the opposition.We have a slightly more sophisticated intervention from the Australian Democrats and from the Greens: not to oppose all of our revenue measures but to oppose those parts of them that they think have a popular mandate for—that is to say, applaud broad, responsible macro-economic management but play to the gallery and tamper with the budget, undermine its bottom line by trying to get a few claps of applause, or maybe a few votes in the ballot box for staggering minor parties by attacking some parts of it for which they think there is some public concern.I know that there have been discussions between the various parties and the Treasurer (Mr Willis). I have seen the letter of the Treasurer to the minor parties indicating the governments response to their recommendations and to their suggestions about how the budget of the Australian government should be remade. The government is determined to push through and deliver this budget, given the massive advantage it gives to the Australian economy, the massive prospects it gives to the war against interest rates, the massive shot in the arm it gives to the attack upon the current account deficit and the real values that it implies for Australians in finding more and better work more easily and more often; less people will be unemployed; a high standard of living will be maintained; and disposable income for the ordinary Australians will be growing. It is also delivering across the fronts of health, education, social security and social value services.The government is now in a position of saying—and I say it here—that we will fight for the provisions in this budget, irrespective of the views that have been put in this chamber. As a last—and I hope not forlorn—request, I again ask honourable senators not to be in a position of toeing their party line. When I first came into this chamber as a senator, this chamber was regarded as a chamber in which a degree of independence existed between the Senate and the House. When the leader of a political party in the House spoke on behalf of a party, independent senators here, even in the same party, would hold up as a right of freedom within their party—this is the coalition—that they were not necessarily bound by it. We now find that Mr Howard speaks for the senators in this chamber. I ask you on your side, the coalition side, to reconsider what he says and to act on behalf of the wider interests of the Australian economy.","N/A","SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (EXCISE) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (CUSTOMS) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (GENERAL) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[3]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

265,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator KERNOT","XW4","(Queensland-","AD","Leader of the Australian Democrats)",2019,"—The Australian Democrats do not support this request for amendment moved by the opposition. I want to talk about the general condition of the car industry and revisit an argument that Senator Coulter has run in here over the years concerning an approach to taxing motor cars generally.Go back to 1992 and the reduction in the wholesale sales tax. It was one of a number of counter-cyclical measures, as we see them, in the One Nation economic statement that were designed to assist the Australian motor vehicle industry. It helped restore the level of sales. Look at what has happened since 1992. Between 1992 and 1994, sales rose from 406,000 to 461,000. In the first quarter of 1995, sales have continued to rise. The April figures are up 10 per cent on last year. We consider that this is reasonable evidence that the motor vehicle industry has recovered in line with the general economy.Generally, it is important to review this kind of measure when fiscal tightening is needed to slow down the economy. Having broadly supported the general thrust of the legislation, I want to revisit an argument that Senator Coulter has been pressing for some years. We think it could be done differently. We could achieve the same outcome but in a better and different way.Take the combination of tariffs and other measures. Since January 1992, tariffs on imported cars have fallen 10 per cent from 37.5 to 27.5 and will fall another two per cent in January to 25.5. As customs duty is added into the wholesale sales tax bill, imported cars have become about 12 per cent cheaper since 1992. In response to that, the market share falling to imported cars has risen. Last year, it rose from 40 per cent to 47.5 per cent, and it is still rising.If the government sought to raise $330 million from cars, it could have been entirely appropriate for imported cars to take the bulk of the burden. The argument that we should be reducing tariffs to increase consumer welfare would not wear in this case; the government has decided to increase the price of cars. But the question would be whether it would be all cars or imported cars. Cancelling the 10 per cent cut in tariffs since One Nation would have raised $280 million. That is quite close to the full cost recovered in the way that the government has chosen to do it, which is via this tax rise.We always argue that the government should use the tax system more effectually to encourage better environmental outcomes. We have often floated the idea of a sliding scale of sales tax based on fuel efficiency. The Australian Conservation Foundation has, in the past, suggested five categories ranging from the lowest taxed cars in the 6.5 litres per 100 kilometres category to the highest taxed cars in the 10 litres per 100 kilometres category. This idea has some merit. We keep raising it.We have heard arguments backwards and forwards. It is important to keep this idea on the agenda. It would need to be phased in to allow Australian manufacturers to move towards producing more fuel efficient cars. The government should also consider the tax anomaly on four-wheel drive passenger vehicles. Four-wheel drive passenger vehicles are not very fuel efficient. Take a Mitsubishi Pajero. It operates on a fuel efficiency of 14.5 litres per 100 kilometres. This compares with a Mitsubishi Magna on 10.5 litres and a Lancer on 7.4 litres. The Lancer is almost twice as efficient as a Pajero, but it is taxed at a much higher rate than the Pajero. From 1 July, it will be taxed at the rate of 35 per cent.","N/A","SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (EXCISE) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (CUSTOMS) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (GENERAL) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[2]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

267,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator KERNOT","XW4","(Queensland-","AD","Leader of the Australian Democrats)",2019,"—Okay. They did not accept it then. Senator Panizza should get his party to support it. We will then have the numbers to do something about it. This is because the tariff rate on four-wheel drives is 10 per cent compared with the motor vehicle rate of 27.5 per cent. The government ought to address that anomaly. It could be done by raising the sales tax on four-wheel drive passenger vehicles from 22 to 32 per cent. About $60 million would be raised by doing that. The government ought to at least consider these ideas. They show how the revenue from motor vehicles can be raised in a more environmentally friendly and economically responsible way. We think this is a second-best tax, but we will still support it.One aspect of this that I need to raise—we raised it with the Treasurer (Mr Willis)—which is an unfortunate part of how the sales tax increases operate is that it is legislation by press release. I totally concede that it is hard to overcome it, but the impact of it is that there are hundreds of new car buyers on budget night with an unexpected new sales tax bill of $1,000 or more. Many car owners had made a contract to buy a car, but the car was yet to be delivered after the budget decision.I asked the Treasurer to investigate this situation and to consider a proposal to exempt from the taxes motor vehicles purchased but not delivered prior to budget night. Advice from the Australian Taxation Office suggests that such an amendment would create serious difficulties. In a legal and practical sense, it would give rise to opportunities for tax evasion. I understand how backdating works, so I accept that advice. I will not be proceeding with such an amendment. But always on budget night there is a slug on a number of quite unlucky Australians who have made a decision in a whole range of areas. I wish that we could find an administrative way to cope with those people.","N/A","SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (EXCISE) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (CUSTOMS) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (GENERAL) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[2]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
268,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MARGETTS","DX5","(Western Australia)","GWA","N/A",2021,"—There certainly is a number of issues. As Senator Kernot has said, it is a vexed question. Some people would say that new cars have fewer emissions than old cars. That is true; there is no doubt about it. Once again, we are now seeing the government scrambling for revenue in areas where there used to be revenue available through import duties. The measures will obviously fall hardest on any vestige of locally produced cars, although anyone who really thinks we have an Australian car industry is probably a little misguided.The reality is that it would certainly be preferred. Given more time and staff, it would certainly have been good to fly the flag to the government, be it via a Democrats amendment or a Greens amendment—we both had the same thing in mind—that it is no longer acceptable on a major item like a car to make no distinction in relation to engine size, engine efficiency or emission levels, whichever approach is more effective. On every area that we have talked about in terms of regulation, we have been told that we cannot be prescriptive. We were told that there could not be a carbon tax. It gets down to what on earth one can do.If the stick approach will not be taken up by government, perhaps the carrot approach will; the consumers will end up making a choice. If we do not include some sliding scale based on these kinds of social benefits and disadvantages, in the end, the community pays anyway. It is not government and generally it is not industry that pays; the community pays. It is well overdue that any decisions like a major new tax impost on cars be scaled in relation to the environmental impact of that item. The car is a major item and a major producer of pollutants, including CO2 emissions.If Australia is going to be able to hold its head up in the future in international fora, it will have to show that it is at least taking something seriously by doing something about it. It is a notice to whichever side is in power in the future that it is now expected from society that governments play their part in areas where markets will not or cannot play their part. They need to start making changes that will impact on what we do in the future.","N/A","SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (EXCISE) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (CUSTOMS) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (GENERAL) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
269,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator HARRADINE","6H4","(Tasmania)","IND","N/A",2021,"—Another notice that should be given to the government is that the parliament, and particularly this chamber, will keep it to the undertakings that it has given to the electorate. Quite clearly, this matter has been canvassed previously. I believe that that is a function of this Senate, no matter which government is in power. In another debate on another reqest, I will be adverting to the matter again.A number of questions have been raised about environmental factors and I will deal with them briefly. This government is proposing to squeeze another $400 million from motorists by increasing the sales tax on cars. We must remember that not long ago the government depreciated the value of hundreds of thousands of existing cars by selectively increasing the excise on leaded petrol. Now it is becoming harder for people to trade up to newer vehicles because of the increased sales tax on new vehicles. It is quite clear that once you raise the sales tax on a new vehicle you will up the price of its immediate predecessor. That makes it harder again for those who are driving leaded petrol vehicles to upgrade because they have to overcome the discriminatory burden of paying an additional amount for leaded petrol in their older cars.If the government believed its own rhetoric on the environment it would be making it easier for people to trade-in older leaded petrol vehicles for newer family cars, but it is doing the reverse. It is making it harder for families to trade up from their older cars to newer cars which can take lead-free petrol. Fewer and fewer families can afford new cars anyway, and this is just another revenue raising measure which will flow on to affect the standard of living of ordinary families.A particular problem with the increase in the sales tax on motor vehicles is the retrospective effect that it has on the car rental industry. I raise it as a matter that concerns me, and probably everyone else in this chamber, but I am not sure how you would overcome it. It will require wiser and more bureaucratically inclined heads than mine to attack this. I raise it here because many of the contracts for longer term hiring of cars are based on prices as they currently exist. The car rental industry will effectively be caught out with an unfair lump sum tax that it cannot pass on to consumers.Senator Kernot and others have mentioned the situation of those people who have contracted for the purchase of new cars but have not actually paid the money. Suddenly, after budget night, they have found that the price has gone up a thousand bucks. That is another problem that needs to be looked at.I will be supporting the request moved by Senator Gibson requesting the House of Representatives to delete that section of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Modification (Excise) Bill which has the effect of increasing the sales tax on new motor vehicles. I do so for the reasons I have just outlined.","N/A","SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (EXCISE) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (CUSTOMS) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (GENERAL) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
270,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator KNOWLES","TH4","(Western Australia)","LP","N/A",2022,"—I would also like to support the request that has been moved by Senator Gibson in relation to the sales tax increases on motor vehicles. This is a further classical example of the way the people were deceived when the government, prior to the last election, said that they would not incur sales tax increases and would be better off with its tax regime than under any other form of taxation. That was a great fraud.I ask the minister how this government can possibly justify such an increase when our motor vehicle fleet is aging at such a rate and when the purchase of new motor vehicles is being put further out of reach of ordinary Australians. Why are you not encouraging people to buy unleaded vehicles? You are consistently increasing the tax on leaded fuel, making the older cars more expensive to run. Nothing you are doing is friendly to the environment—and this is just the thin edge of the wedge.Will the minister explain why there have been so many other sales tax increases from a government that, prior to the 1993 election, promised no increases in sales tax. So many things have already gone up or are about to go up on Saturday. One would have thought that prior to the last election we had no sales tax whatsoever on food but, as of Saturday, there will be 12 per cent on biscuits, cordial, ice cream, confectionary, savoury snacks, flavoured milk, fruit and vegetable juices, and so on. This from a government that said there is no tax on food!Then there are the increases in the fuel excise and the motor vehicle sales taxes. They all add to the cost of these particular products. At a time when any sensible, sane, responsible government would be encouraging people to consume low alcohol wine, you put up the tax on it. On Saturday the tax on low alcohol wine and cider goes up to 14 per cent. You deceived the people prior to the last election about everyday products—cars being but one of them. How about the everyday products that from Saturday will be taxed at the rate of 22 per cent: toilet paper, soap, ballpoint pens, writing paper, cosmetics, toothpaste, shampoo, detergent, batteries, soft drinks and disinfectants? The list goes on. These are things that people use every day of the week.Prior to the last election the government was saying there would be no increase in sales tax. We now have a 22 per cent flow-on; the fuel excise and everything else flows on through. Ordinary wine and cider you are putting up to 26 per cent. Then there are things such as watches and clocks, binoculars, cameras, video recorders, radios and televisions, costume jewellery, and so forth, which will be at 32 per cent. I might add that this does not include antique clocks, nor do the food items include something like caviar, but they do include orange juice and flavoured milk. Is that not extraordinary from a government that told people they would be so much worse off with a one tax rate that scrubbed out seven others? Here we have six taxes being retained while the other one has been increased time and time again since the 1993 election.How can you honestly justify that to the Australian people? It is a most monumental deception when we consider that families are going to be taxed 22 per cent for pet food, tents, tarpaulins, car covers, household insecticides, polishes, glues, starches, lawn mowers, travel wear, handbags—all the sorts of things that I would not consider luxuries. I would not consider that a hairbrush is a luxury. You are whacking the tax up to 22 per cent on a hairbrush, a toilet bag, toys, games, amusements, umbrellas, musical instruments, oils, and lubricants. You are putting the tax up on everything you can think of. You are coming from a position of saying that there will be no tax increases.It is about time that you explained to the people of Australia why you deceived them at the last election and why you are doing it again in this budget. Clearly you are making a mockery of any election promise. You had no intention whatever of keeping that promise. You knew it at the time, we knew it at the time, but sadly the Australian people—many of whom voted for you—believed you. Here you go with taxes on luxury motor vehicles. Who terms something a luxury?Large vans fall into that price category and they are not luxuries; they are a necessity. Families need to be able to go out and buy a larger vehicle to take their families out in one hit. But you never seem to care about that. Car tax is but one section of a million-section budget where everything has just gone up. At some stage the government needs to be responsible for that deception of the Australian people.","N/A","SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (EXCISE) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (CUSTOMS) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (GENERAL) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
271,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator WATSON","VJ4","(Tasmania)","LP","N/A",2023,"—The clauses before the Senate this evening relating to increases in sales tax, particularly in relation to vehicles, display very vividly the great deception by the Australian Labor Party towards the Australian people. I remind the Senate that during the GST debate prior to the last election there were a number of sensitive issues. One issue was sales tax on cars. There was a possibility that under a GST regime people would be getting their cars a lot cheaper. The Labor Party, somewhat fearful of this, fairly cynically decided, `In order to beat them we will have to reduce the sales rate from 20 per cent to 5 per cent. The Labor Party did reduce the rate to 15 per cent.In order to get the business vote the Labor Party decided to reduce the corporate rate of tax from 39 per cent to 33 per cent. There are other measures, but I think these two stand out on their own as a vivid illustration of the length to which the Labor Party will go to deceive the Australian people in order to achieve power. The rates were only brought down for expediency. They were brought down temporarily. The Australian Labor Party did not tell the electorate that the reductions in company tax and sales tax on cars were only short-term measures. In fact, everybody thought that the rates were going to be reduced for the long term.But having won the election, a budget or so later the Labor Party decided that it needed more revenue. So the corporate rate rose and the motor vehicle rate went up from 16 per cent to 21 per cent, and it will increase to 22 per cent from 1 July. The Australian people deserve better treatment and a greater degree of honesty from this government.I think it is pretty poor when the government says to us, `If you destroy our budget you will be responsible for increases in interest rates. I remind the minister that the government has not pegged back sufficiently the gap between the ratio of GDP to savings and investment.Undoubtedly, there might have been a few minor reforms to narrow the gap. Savings raised 1.5 per cent, but despite these initiatives a gap of five to six per cent still remains, which is rather frightening. The lack of commitment will come home ultimately to haunt Australia—if not in the immediate future, certainly by the end of the century. Unless governments do something a lot stronger to bridge the savings dilemma, the dollar exchange rate will continue to fall. The dollar cannot improve in the environment that the government has created. The government has not done enough.These indirect taxes are a deceit by the Australian Labor Party to try to retain government. To raise revenue under these circumstances is most reprehensible. The government has not done enough to increase savings. True there are some indicators—e.g., 1.5 per cent for superannuation. The government still have to bridge this big savings gap completely, otherwise it will result in increased pressure on the Australian dollar.Money is flowing out of this country at a time when it should be remaining here. The pressure is on the government for action. The government has to deliver on fiscal and monetary fronts. Our standards of living are going down—everybody who goes overseas realises this when spending on necessities—in terms of their purchasing power in the countries they visit.I leave it to you, Minister. Australians are entitled to something a lot better than you are dishing up at the present time.Question put:That the request for amendments ( Senator Gibsons ) be agreed to.","N/A","SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (EXCISE) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (CUSTOMS) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (GENERAL) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

273,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator KERNOT","XW4","(Queensland-","AD","Leader of the Australian Democrats)",2024,"—This request for amendments by the coalition is identical in intent to those proposed by the Democrats. I want to revisit a couple of the arguments I made in the second reading debate, because I think our rationale for opposing the extension of the sales tax on building materials is an important one, and I gave three major reasons.The first reason is, we believe, that the extension of the sales tax in this way is a breach of an election commitment by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) not to tax housing. I gave specific quotations in the second reading debate. The second reason places a tax on shelter, which we still consider a necessity of life. The third reason is that the timing of the tax is particularly inappropriate, in our view.I would also point out to the government that people have not accepted the argument that this is a one-off cost of about $400 because, in fact, it is a cost which trebles over the life of a mortgage. The very fact that it is added on to the total cost and continues over the life of the mortgage means that it probably amounts to something like $3,000 on the life of an average mortgage. I think that is a substantial cost to be considered.I think there are other reasons why we should also oppose this building materials sales tax extension in the context of other things which have happened to make housing less affordable for young families, and I will quickly run through those. We have the highest interest rates in the Western world, up by 2.75 per cent in the last year. With banks, deposit requirements were tightened last year by the Reserve Bank in a belief, which, I think, was later proven to be wrong, that housing lending had not yet peaked.On the matter of banking competition, we have a home lending market that clearly is not competitive, where the banks have been able to resist passing on a one per cent fall in wholesale interest rates since January. This affects about 90 per cent of their customers who actually have variable rate mortgages.If you look at the other option, public housing, you will see a cut in real terms of over $100 million over the last two budgets. All of these things together, I think, make it much harder for young families to move into a new home. Rents are rising in Sydney and Melbourne. To a lesser extent in Perth and Brisbane, there is a shrinking rental vacancy.Over the last two weeks I have been able to table petitions signed by 21,342 people objecting to this tax. That might not seem a lot to you, but I think it is a lot in one week. I can assure you they are still pouring in.I want to address another aspect of the governments rhetoric on this matter. It says, `One of the main reasons we have to do this is that we are just fixing up some anomalies. We say, from experience, `Beware the grip of the creeping anomaly. Go back to 1988, when the government extended the sales tax to bathroom fittings. It said, `Were only fixing an anomaly. I do not think it is really clear to this date what that anomaly was. The opposition, mind you, voted for that at the time. In 1988 it was okay to vote for that sales tax extension, but in 1995 it is not. I am glad you are saying it is not, but I wonder why it was in 1988.In this particular budget, it is anomalous that the bathroom is taxed and the kitchen is not. There are a couple of options there. You could stop taxing the bathroom but, no, the tax office view of the world with respect to fixing anomalies is to keep taxing more things. It is clear, I think, that the shrinking list of items that are tax exempt would be very shortly caught up, probably when the election is nicely out of the way.I also think you can see evidence that this bill actually creates a whole lot of lovely new anomalies for the tax office to address next year or the year after that, when the government says, `Excuse me, weve got to extend it a little bit further because we have to fix up a few more anomalies.Let us take kitchen cupboards, for example. If they are prefabricated, they would be taxed. If the builder builds the kitchen on site—and builders argue that that is a less efficient use of resources—they are not taxed. Nails would be taxed, but the wood they are hammered into would not be. Floor and wall tiles would be taxed, but roof tiles would not be. Light fittings would be taxed, but electrical fittings would not be. Taps and nozzles would be taxed, but the pipes they are attached to would not be. Eventually all of that will be brought under the sales tax net—a total haul of $2 billion plus—bit by bit and anomaly by anomaly.Today the Democrats continue to say that housing should continue to be exempt. For all of the same reasons that the current Treasurer, Ralph Willis, gave in opposing this very tax in 1981 and for all of the reasons that Prime Minister Keating gave in opposing a GST on housing in 1993, we still believe buildings should not be taxed.","N/A","SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (EXCISE) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (CUSTOMS) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (GENERAL) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

278,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator HARRADINE","6H4","(Tasmania)","IND","N/A",2026,"—Whatever it is, it is too much. I note that in this document on Australias future, Poles Apart— the Labor Partys official critique of the GST—the opposition was criticised for proposing increased taxation on housing. I agree with the governments view in 1993 that housing should not be taxed because housing is a necessity of life. It has long been a very valid principle that necessities of life should not be taxed. Unfortunately, that principle is being eroded time and again both directly and, might I say, indirectly as well.We could look at the failure of governments to maintain dependent spouse rebates and so on and in refusing to set thresholds for each dependent child, whereby the income earner is not taxed for those thresholds. The fact that there are certain amounts of money required for necessities of life for dependants shows that the government is not living up to the principle that has been the ideal principle and should now be the ideal principle that the necessities of life should not be taxed.Much has been said about what the government promised in the last election. On this particular occasion the Senate ought to hold the government to its promise that was given to the people of Australia in 1993. I have heard what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has been saying. I had a bit of a chuckle because, looking around at the senators who are currently in the chamber, there is only one who was present in 1981—that is, Senator Jones. In the 1981 budget, the then coalition government proposed a 2 1/2 per cent tax on a wide range of consumer items which were previously exempt, together with an increase in the sales tax levy. Lo and behold, one of those related to building materials for the construction of private dwellings. I remind the Senate that the Australian Labor Party and I voted against that. At the time the Labor Party had no problems about voting against that measure.Somebody said that the Prime Minister was cynical and hypocritical. As we get on, we forget things. My memory was jogged on this, and the Prime Minister probably forgot about that. That is a bit unfortunate because he has since been reminded of it.","N/A","SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (EXCISE) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (CUSTOMS) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (GENERAL) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[9]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

To cut a long story short, there was no problem at that time in opposing such a measure. I feel that we should not have a bucket tipped on us for opposing it on the grounds that we are traducing democratic principles and all this sort of nonsense. Let us look at it face to face. I strongly feel that necessities of life should not be taxed. I believe that shelter happens to be one of those necessities of life, and building materials fall into that particular category. To propose an increased tax on building materials presents me with a problem and should present the government with a problem because of its undertaking not to increase taxes.

281,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator WATSON","VJ4","(Tasmania)","LP","N/A",2026,"—Listeners to this debate might recall that the coalition lost the 1993 election after proposing a large shift in tax from the direct to a uniform indirect GST. This was perhaps the greatest reform ever put before the Australian people. In a sense, the Australian people rejected that change. Perhaps one of the focal points of attack by the Labor Party at that time was the impact it was going to have on building and homes. Two budgets away and the government has walked away from its election promise not to widen the sales tax base. The government has not only walked away from its election commitment but also miscalculated in a very significant manner the cost impact on building a home of the sales tax impost on building materials. The estimates in the budget papers were only half of what all the reputable people in the industry were saying and what Mr Willis now concedes is a more correct figure, that is, that it will add at least $1,000 to the cost of building a family home.There are going to be a lot of problems associated with this tax. Allow me a few minutes to enumerate some of these difficulties. The changes will, to a large extent, affect people who are not used to dealing with sales tax and who do not have the systems in place to cope with it. Also, there will be a number of transitional problems in determining what transactions are subject to sales tax and who, as a matter of commercial reality, bears the brunt of the tax on contracts entered into—but not completed—prior to the changes.In the long term, the problem revolves around what I term the classification issue. That is a major headache for anyone in the sales tax area. For example, the classification of non-timber benchtops is unclear. The Australian Taxation Office seems to be accepting that they might be taxed at 12 per cent but, arguably, they could be exempt as architectural building units or even taxable at 22 per cent, as they are not covered in any other schedule in the Sales Tax (Exemption and Classifications) Act.While the tax office seems to be interpreting the provisions to make them administrably easy for taxpayers to deal with, the result could be l-o-r-e rather than l-a-w. The industry may well end up being segmentalised. There is concern that the big players in the industry may be disadvantaged because of their overheads structure. From a revenue perspective, it is difficult to know what difference the proposed changes will make, because it depends on economic activity and the interpretation of the provisions by both the Australian Taxation Office and the courts.I am very concerned that in my home state the level of building activity has really slumped. When I read the mainland press I find that activity in the big Jennings home group is down by about 30 per cent. On top of this drop in economic activity, particularly in the building area, the government decides it is timely to impose a new tax and also to tell the Australian people that the tax is only about half what it really is going to be. That is pretty reprehensible. The government has not thought out the consequences, it has broken election promises and it is going to cause a lot of difficulties for people in this area.The minister and other honourable senators will recall a contribution I made here earlier in which I said that the people who will be particularly disadvantaged will be the joinery workshops. I am concerned about the impact it will have in my home state and the shift it will cause towards what I call a cash economy. The small builder without overheads and without a joinery factory will build the cupboards, and as much of the construction work as he possibly can in the home with the explanation that, `This is an installation cost, because installation costs, apart from material components, will not be subject to sales tax. However, the work in the joinery has a material component, plus labour and overhead components—to which a margin is added. In effect, the tax is going to make this whole area of activity quite uneconomic and, to avoid the impost of this tax and to keep the cost down, the pattern of how work is done will change from the joinery workshop to the home site.There are also problems with classifications. For example, the benchtop, the bathroom vanity unit, the kitchen sink and all these other sorts of items are now going to be subject to sales tax and will require a lot of new people—who have not been involved with sales tax—to register for the very first time. Therefore, initially there will be confusion, particularly for those people who have contracted at a contract price to build or to renovate. Builders will not have built in these sorts of costs in the contract price. There is also going to be disputation about such items as slate tiles. For example, a slate tile that is greater than eight millimetres in average thickness and is normally used as a floor tile is taxable at 12 per cent, whereas a slate tile less than 8 millimetres is usually used as a roof tile and is sales tax exempt.The industry is going to have to put up with all these classification sorts of difficulties. There is also the question of timber floor coverings, including parquetry blocks, which will be taxed at 12 per cent after 1 July 1995. However, polishes, mop oils, paints and other coatings in liquid paste or powder form—if they are not of a kind marketed principally for application to buildings or fixtures—pigments, thinners and dryers will be unchanged and taxed at 21 per cent, rising to 22 per cent on 1 July 1995, whereas glues and grouts for tiles, fibreglass and liquid sealing and bonding agents for application to building or fixtures, silicon based bonding, setting and sealing products, taps, nozzles, tap handles, shower heads, arms, brackets, rails and flexible hoses for showers will become taxable at 12 per cent. It is not surprising that the government did not realise the scope of the tax on building hardware.What does worry me is that the tax will extend to what I will term child safety features and latches, which for the first time will come under this building hardware sales tax provision. I believe it is a reprehensible imposition and quite inappropriate. When one looks at the sorts of building materials involved, one sees it is not going to be easy to determine whether they will be exempt because, obviously, a lot of items are still exempt—such as metal roofing and skylights—whereas door handles, hardware, light fittings, ovens, hotplates and hot water services will be taxed at 12 per cent.Then there are other items, such as spa baths, timber, free standing fences, scaffolding and so on, that will be taxed at 22 per cent. It is not going to be easy for those in the trade to determine the classification involved in such a tax grabbing exercise, an exercise which I believe is very cynical. It is a deception and, effectively, the Australian people were cheated at the last election.","N/A","SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (EXCISE) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (CUSTOMS) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (GENERAL) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[10]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
282,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MARGETTS","DX5","(Western Australia)","GWA","N/A",2028,"—The request we are being asked to support has merits. The Greens WA are inclined to support it. The issues are many, as has been mentioned by previous speakers. It is true that some small businesses have never had to collect sales tax before. If you are in a small business, it is an extreme time impost; and there is a cost involved.A committee was looking into the impact of our taxation system on Australian small business. It makes us wonder when that sort of committee is looking into those impacts and what is going wrong. With more and more individuals and small businesses being required to do the job of the tax office, why is there a change that has exactly the opposite effect? It requires more small businesses—they are not all small businesses, but quite a number, including joiners, fit in that category; and they would not normally have been required to collect sales tax—to collect sales tax.Why is the government taking a direction that will require more and more people to use unproductive time to do the job of the tax office? It does not make sense. It also leads inextricably to the fact that the kinds of problems mentioned by Senator Watson of delineation between what is and is not taxable over each period—and what stock is included—inevitably will lead to an anomaly being considered. At some stage it will be said, `There are areas that are not currently covered by the tax and, because there is a confusion about what is and is not taxable, we might as well put the rest in, just to make it simpler: there being an anomaly.The reality is that it is GST by stealth, and that is a problem. This is not totally in line with the tax situation, but Australia is a very indebted country. Each person in Australia has a very high level of personal debt, and a very large portion of that personal debt is related to housing. Instead of schemes to suddenly artificially boost this by a private superannuation scheme, which is fraught with difficulties as it stands, it is important that government look at ways of assisting people through various schemes, incentives and so on to simplify housing plans.The market says that a new house even for a first home buyer should have three or four bedrooms, a study, an en suite, a family room, a formal dining room and so on. The reality is that the people on the smallest income try to get those as well and end up with poor quality housing. If this scheme goes through, such people will end up with tiles that you can see through, which will not last very long and which will end up costing them more in the long run, and houses with no floor coverings and so on. The reality is that what we should be doing as a nation is looking at incentives to encourage the industry and consumers to look towards meeting their needs in a way that does not impose this huge cost to the environment and other areas. This probably needs a rethinking of how we use tax incentives.Perhaps the governments own housing program can look at this issue. I have seen government housing in Broome, where people got together and helped design their own houses. For the same price as normal government houses, they included a very reasonable sized living area which everybody in the house used, the number of bedrooms that were needed plus a work area for those people with hobbies. Studies have been carried out that show the majority of most houses in Australia, especially the new design houses, is hardly ever used. We are creating a culture of excess in terms of housing and housing expectations. Therefore, when people are first married and set up a house they get into huge debt. Maybe part of the problem is the excessive consumer ethic that is around. Maybe governments have a role to play in taxation in leading the way in terms of their own housing programs.This particular measure by the government in simply slapping a tax on the basic materials for building a house will not help this particular housing debt problem that we see at the moment. Over time, perhaps what is needed is a very concerted program to help people find that the quality of life is not associated with the number of rooms, no matter how often they are used, and that community housing and other methods can solve housing problems and work to solve environmental problems as well. This is what we need to do in terms of the choice of housing in the future. That is only vaguely associated with this particular measure, but it is associated with the quality of life. A lot of people have two jobs in order to support their mortgages. We will not be supporting the governments proposal to increase tax on building materials at this stage. In the future we will certainly be looking at ways that governments in general can look at schemes that enable people to look at their consumption levels regarding housing choices and look for environmental solutions. That is something that we will flag for the future.","N/A","SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (EXCISE) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (CUSTOMS) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (GENERAL) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[11]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is a compounding figure; it must be there. On top of that you have to add your builders margin.The government has not given any reason whatsoever why our figures are wrong, even though Senator Ian Macdonald quoted figures supplied by a building surveyor. I said this afternoon that a building surveyor who is worth his salt has to be accurate within two per cent. A building surveyor does the quantity surveying so the builder does not have to do it himself, and then quotes on that basis. Sometimes a surveyor will do quantity surveying for more than one builder. If three builders quote for a job and they all had the same quantity surveyor, it should be fair across the board.But it does not always happen that way, particularly with small buildings. Senator Jones was a builder previously, so he would know what I am talking about. There are different quantity surveyors, so each one has to be pretty spot on. Not only might they not get the next job, but also they could be sued by the builder that they are working for. They have to work in a very tight margin. They have to be very accurate. That is why it costs a lot of money to employ these people. I cannot see why we cannot take note of the one building surveyor who did give us an opinion. The government has not answered that one bit.Senator Cook asked me the other day at a legislative committee: `If I give you all those answers will I convince you to vote for the bill? I told him that I listen to all debating points that he and others give me.","N/A","SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (EXCISE) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (CUSTOMS) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (GENERAL) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[17]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

300,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator PANIZZA","JI4","(Western Australia)","LP","N/A",2030,"—I did not say that. I will tell you what I said. I said I always debate matters vigorously in my own party room and when the majority decision comes down I adhere to that decision, just like you do in caucus. When you get rolled in caucus you have to go along with it. I do not know how often you get rolled but you must do so now and again. You go along with it, just like I will go along with it. You have not given me any material or figures as to why I should have gone any further on this matter in the party room.Let us get back to what you call past history. I do not call it past history because it was only 2 1/2 years ago that you were saying that the GST would have added $2,000 to $3,000. I came up with the figure of $3,500 which would be added by your proposal regarding the diesel fuel rebate levy on manufacturing bricks and mining clay. I said $4,500 in the second reading debate but I have amended that figure. Your proposal will be far beyond the GST estimate. We are back in a situation where you slammed us 2 1/2 years ago on what it would do to the cost of building.Senator Cook told me the other day that housing affordability has never been better than it is at present. If that is the case, why is the vacancy rate so far down? If the affordability is there, the vacancy rate goes up because young people go out and buy their own homes. But that has not happened. They have no confidence in the economy of Australia and they are not confident that interest rates will not blow out. Maybe that is the reason, but the government has not debunked any of our theories; it has never given us any answers on it. I am not going to use the term `lied to the Australian people on this occasion; I am just saying that the government told the Australian people and the Australian people obviously believed it because about 1,252 more of them voted for your side of politics than ours. That must have had a big bearing on those 1,252-odd voters, which was the difference between whether or not we won government.They must have taken a lot of notice. Having said that two and a half years ago, how can you even look at yourself in the mirror in the morning? And, Madam Temporary Chairman, that is quite a valid question under the standing orders. Then there were the promises of no new taxes. I do not know how you gave the excuse the other day that housing affordability has never been higher so you would grab the opportunity to tax people further.Senator Margetts referred to ordinary floor tiles. I do not think anyone would dispute that this is the first time tiles have been subjected to a sales tax. We heard evidence from the tile manufacturers of Australia that this sales tax will increase the cost of a house. However, I would like to be told whether that is counted in the $1,200 increase in the price of an average house because, normally, tiles are something extra that you put down yourself after the house is finished. My experience of house building and property development has told me that.Senator Margetts pointed out that this will probably lead to unfinished houses. Anyone wanting to build their dream home gets the structure up and lives without a few of the nice finishes like catches on the cupboards and so on. They will quite likely leave the tiles out and make do with other things to get to the position one day when they can afford them.I heard Senator Cook, somewhere along the line, say today that Australia is aiming for increased employment by cutting unemployment. This afternoon, I submitted two charts for incorporation in Hansard . Those charts definitely show what this sales tax will do to kick the cyclical situation of house building. House building rises and falls. History shows that when you cop a sudden rise in something, whether it be bricks, transport, the imposition of sales tax or anything else, building activity takes a dive. It is already on its way down at the present moment, so this increase will accentuate that fall. This will cause more unemployment. The government has not refuted that whatsoever.These charts were prepared by the Housing Industry Association and the Master Builders Association and I know the HIA is not flavour of the month with the government. The government has not answered any of those points, yet they expect us to pass this measure which, on their figures, will raise an extra $249 million in a full year when we know full well that it will raise a minimum of around $650 million extra.Looking at the capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax, the government brought in all of those taxes telling you that they would not raise very much and that they would be at the very lower end of the scale. Over the years everything has blown out. That has been the history of this government.It is not only affluent people who build houses. When people talk about houses, they talk about these luxury houses that are being built. In remote areas it costs people twice as much to build a house. Going into the far regions, 500 or 600 kilometres from a capital city means that you have to double the median price of a house in the capital city. I know that from bitter experience. So what will this sales tax do to regional Australia?If the government had any sense, even at this stage, it would think twice before proceeding with this measure to impose a sales tax on building materials.Progress reported.","N/A","SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (EXCISE) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (CUSTOMS) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (GENERAL) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[17]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

Well, it is only $12.77 million! They forgot about it! They did not realise they had actually to pass a law to pay it. This is just another example of this governments crass incompetence. The ministers have been there too long and have been too fat—one cannot be sizeist—just too lazy to know what on earth they are doing.It follows, of course, the previous situation where I think Senator McMullan, who is in the chamber, had a little problem with the export market development grants. They forgot about the fact that parliamentary action had to take place.We have Senator Cook with his research and development grants. Actually, they were paying those illegally because they failed to table the appropriate documents. Fail, fail, fail! They do not know what they are doing.In the latest lot this mistake, this error, this incompetence, has been rescued. This mistake by the then Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe) has been corrected because there has been an application for funds from the Advance to the Minister for Finance to cover the mistake.We can understand why the minister would make a mistake. After all, he was the Deputy Prime Minister and he has been so busy protecting his back for the last year or so that doing things like this administratively are a bit beyond him—making certain that $12.8 million is properly made available for supported accommodation assistance.To help him in his arduous tasks, he has had the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Ms Crawford) to help him. She has been busy trying to protect herself in the seat that the Labor Party has left her in. I understand it is next to unwinnable. She is still on the list of Labor candidates so that the Labor Party can meet its targeted quota, which it is missing anyway, for the number of women in parliament. After redistribution, her seat has changed its character dramatically and she sought to move, unsuccessfully, to another seat. She has obviously been too busy protecting her political life to get involved in looking after the law.This failure to provide the money is quite an important matter because the object of the Supported Accommodation Assistance Act is to grant financial assistance to the states to administer the supported accommodation assistance program, which is to be implemented principally through common form agreements between the Commonwealth and the states. It received royal assent on 16 December 1994, and the state of Victoria signed the agreement in May 1995. By the agreement itself, it was deemed to have come into force on 16 December 1994. The agreement committed the Commonwealth to provide financial assistance to the state for the financial year for the purpose of meeting the reimbursement expenditure. It is now urgent because of the error. In signing the agreement, the Commonwealth committed itself to the provision of this money. But there is no provision for payments under Appropriation Act (No.2) or Appropriation Act (No. 4). So the necessary amount is required from the Advance to the Minister for Finance. This is just another example of monumental incompetence.

304,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator WATSON","VJ4","(Tasmania)","LP","N/A",2034,"—I want to give a few more examples of the nightmares that these bills will cause within the trade. I refer firstly to administration. A nightmare will be caused for those building operatives working on government projects, which are exempt, and those working on private sector projects which will be subject to sales tax. Builders will have to distinguish between the nails and the screws for exempt and non-exempt buildings. Also, the plaster fittings but not the rosettes or the plasterboard will be subject to tax if sold to the private sector. For the larger builders, a storage classification difficulty will be incurred in determining where builders segment their nails and all these materials for government projects, which are exempt, and those for the private sector, which are not exempt. In times of the private sector trying to be more efficient and trying to keep our costs down, this government tax is not the right way to go.There will also be a problem for small shops. A number of them will bypass selling kitchen and bathroom requirements because they simply will not want to get caught up in the sales tax system. Further, merchants will not want to give a breakdown of their sales tax to builders as it could discount their buying price.One thing that concerned me during the earlier debate was that at least one or two senators on the Labor Party side believed that this hardware tax was not going to have a flow-on effect into labour costs and factory service costs. I will quote again from the tax office bulletin. In manufacturing cabinets, the tax is applied to total manufacturing costs—plus, a margin. With regard to the manufacturing cost, it is true that sales tax is not applied to installation. This is where the black economy will come in, because there will be all sorts of underhand shuffling by some shifty builders to try to call joinery related costs on the job installation costs rather than the costs of manufacture.The tax office bulletin further states that manufacturing cost refers to the `cost of manufacturing, which is calculated on the basis of full absorption costing. That has three elements: labour, materials and factory service costs.The bulletin further gives an example. If a cabinet-maker or a joiner produces a kitchen at a fully absorbed manufactured cost of $10,000 and sells the kitchen to a builder for $13,000, without installation charges or tax, then the taxable value will be $10,000—the total manufactured cost—plus one-third of $13,000, which is the selling price, minus his cost of $10,000, which equals $1,000. Therefore, the notional wholesale selling price for joinery would cost $11,000—that is, $10,000 for the manufacturing cost, plus the notional wholesale margin of $1,000.Earlier, I mentioned that there is a problem concerning the thickness of the tile, which is important in determining whether the tile is going to be taxed at 12 per cent or exempt. For example, those tiles which are less than eight millimetres—an average thickness which is commercially regarded as roof tiles—are exempt from tax simply because of their particular size.If we look at slabs of stone, there are further size complications. One must be particularly careful in measuring the slab of stone to determine whether it is going to be subject to tax or whether it is going to be exempt from tax. For example, slabs of stone of 10 millimetres or less—an average thickness and normally for tiling purposes—are taxable at the rate of 12 per cent. But slabs of stone in excess of 10 millimetres, which are not commercially regarded as tiles, are exempt from tax because they are regarded by the tax office as structural or architectural building units. Senators could just go on and on giving examples of difficulties that will be incurred within the trade as a result of this unnecessary and untimely tax.","N/A","SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (EXCISE) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (CUSTOMS) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (GENERAL) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
305,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COULTER","TF4","(South Australia)","AD","N/A",2035,"—Senator Watson is always extremely useful in bringing out the detail in these debates. I was reminded while he was speaking that in this budget and over several budgets we have seen the government move away from a diesel fuel rebate system because of the conflict that arises between fuel which is held by an operator who has both on-road vehicles and off-road vehicles and the possibility that the person could use the on-road vehicles but use fuel on which a tax had not been paid or for which a rebate was claimed. Because of that anomaly, the government is choosing to move in a different direction.Senator Watson has put his finger on precisely the same anomaly that the government is now going into with respect to a simple thing like nails. The reason I have risen is that the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) is not responding to any of these important points which are being made. The question is quite simple. This comes out of what Senator Watson has just said. If a builder is working on two buildings and has nails and screws which are tax exempt on one building and nails and screws on which tax is paid on the other, how will the government be sure that those nails and screws do not get mixed up? I would like an answer from the minister.","N/A","SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (EXCISE) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (CUSTOMS) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (GENERAL) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
306,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator PANIZZA","JI4","(Western Australia)","LP","N/A",2035,"—The Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) has not replied to anything said this evening. I was going to address a couple of other points about building surveyor Mike Corrigan, who is from North Queensland, but Senator Ian Macdonald is here, so he might like to further that matter.I want to speak further about something that came out of a legislation committee hearing last Friday. I asked about the effect of this housing downturn on employment in Australia, even if these extra sales taxes were not implemented. This is what I discovered in a letter from the HIA:The Indicative Planning Council has forecast dwelling starts will fall from 178,000 in 1993-94 to around 130,000 in 1995-96, a reduction of 48,000.We estimate that the full year impact of this decline, from an economy wide perspective, to be in the order of.job losses of about 72,000.This is what will happen even before the imposition of this sales tax; there will be job losses of 72,000. A minister like Senator Cook should be interested in this. It continues:split equally—I have said before that a multiplier of two in the work force, including those involved in the supply of materials, applies—between housing and the rest of the economy;. loss in income and company tax of around $400m;. losses in commodity taxes (sales tax, fuel levies) and indirect taxes (payroll, fringe benefits, land tax and stamp duty) of about $220m;On top of that, having hosed down the industry and demand for housing, there are other losses. Perhaps those losses are to the state government, so this government and this minister are not interested. But there will be a loss of stamp duty on associated property transfers. The rates charged vary between different states. All up, the HIA estimates that loss to be around $75 million. These sorts of imposts will apply to the building industry in Australia, irrespective of the imposition of the increased sales tax.I will now consider the governments estimation of the $249 million that it will raise. I have a letter from Hettich International which came out of the inquiry we had last Friday. I will read part of it into Hansard :Following our conversation earlier this morning I confirm in writing that there is every indication and our firm belief that the proposed sales tax impost on housing/hardware will be far greater than stated in the budget papers.I do not know how far the government inquired into the effects of this when it drew up the budget papers, but going on the non-answers we received from the Treasury representatives that attended with Senator Cook last Friday, I am not surprised at them. The letter continues:In fact the stated figure of $215 million—that is, in 1995-96—will be exceeded by the tax on kitchens alone—aside from all other items now to be included.It explains that statement by listing items that are included in renovations. Renovations have not been addressed too much in this debate. Those who cannot afford a new house or renters who cannot afford to buy a house are affected by renovations. From my experience, renovations are carried out far more in rental properties than in houses that are owner occupied.One could say that renovation is the landlords job so it need not be worried about. But the landlord does not stand in the place of social security; he or she will invest in rental property that will be paid for in rent by tenants. From my knowledge, investment in rental properties in Australia is certainly declining. I heard Mr Howe say the other day—this is a side issue—that there should be a federal law to cover all renting in Australia. The federal government would apply certain conditions, et cetera. If federal government gets into that sort of thing, I do not know what will happen. The fact is that renovations paid for by landlords have to be added on to the rent. There are no two ways about it. So it affects low income earners.I will read the list of items included in renovations in this letter. In 1987, cupboards were involved in 83 per cent of renovations. In 1994, they were involved in 68 per cent of renovations. In 1994, bench tops were included in 65 per cent of renovations; sinks and taps were 47 per cent; electric range ovens were 34 per cent—they are not really subject to this legislation—gas range ovens were 17 per cent; rangehoods were 31 per cent; and dishwashers were included in 81 per cent of renovations. About 358,000 renovation contracts were done in 1994-95 at a total value of $1.698 billion.The major kitchen suppliers in New South Wales and Victoria estimate a median price of $9,000 to $10,000, excluding appliances, for a kitchen renovation. From my experience, $10,000 spent in a kitchen on cupboards is quite moderate. One would not spend that in a luxury house. The letter continues:This also agrees with the average cost of kitchen cabinet hardware/inclusions which we estimate at $400-$450 per kitchen. Hardware is usually estimated at about 5% of total kitchen costs.The government should listen to this. On this basis, the total taxable base for kitchens would be as follows. Of 358,000 home renovations, the average base value would be an estimated $4,000, making a total of $1,432 million. The average tax would be $480, making a total tax take in one financial year—do not forget that this is only for kitchens—of $171.84 million. New housing starts in 1995-96—again, do not forget that this is for kitchens alone—have been 135,000, which is down from the 160,000 that we have had in the past couple of years. The estimated base value is $7,000, making a total of $945 million. The average tax is $840, giving a total revenue take of $113.4 million.That is a total, at 12 per cent sales tax, of $285 million, yet the government maintains that this measure, when applied to the whole housing sector, will raise only $215. We have provided evidence from this building crowd, who are no slouches, but the minister sits there and has not responded one iota to our concerns. We have shown that this measure will raise $285 million on kitchens alone. Remember, this is the government that gave us the FBT and the capital gains tax.This is a very serious situation. I urge the government to look at it again. I see that Senator Ian MacDonald is looking to rise, so I will give way to him.","N/A","SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (EXCISE) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (CUSTOMS) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (GENERAL) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Like most other parliamentarians, I was approached by representatives of the building industry and the cabinet-making industry who said, `That is rubbish. It is closer to $2,000 or $3,000. I said, `Its no good just telling me that. I need an assessment of what this tax will cost that I can take to the government and get its response to it. That assessment is the document I tabled in the parliament yesterday and had incorporated in the Hansard today.Mr Corrigan is a very reputable quantity surveyor. I have no reason to doubt that the document is his honest and professional assessment of what the additional cost would be. He said he would go to the housing estates and pick out a house in the $100,000 price bracket, which is very popular, and another in the $135,000 to $140,000 price range, which is also very popular. He costs houses every day of the week. Builders and purchasers rely on him. I said, `You go through this line by line and item by item and come back to me with something that I can table in the parliament. It will be subject to heavy scrutiny. You tell me what figure you come to. Minister, this document is what he gave me and his assessment is quite a dramatic shift from what your advisers originally told you.That document was tabled yesterday. I wonder if you have had the opportunity to have it checked? Are you in a position to comment on it? Is it correct? Do you argue with it somehow? It is the work of a professional and independent building consultant who, with a group of others, came to see me. I said, `You go out and do the sums and give them to me. If he is right, it makes a mockery of your original assessment of $300, which rose to $1,000, went down to $800 and then went up to $1,000 again.I would appreciate your comments on this document.

If this bill is passed it will significantly push up prices, as Senator MacDonald has just indicated, and homes will become less affordable for young couples.

Senator Coulter asked how we would distinguish between what nail and what type of building; whether it is something for which tax is not applicable or something for which tax is applicable. I am advised that the answer to that question is that this process operates on the basis of self-assessment and builders would make that determination, being aware of the circumstances in which those items of building construction would be applied.There was a range of questions about what the true impact of this tax might be. The answers are contained in the Hansard of the Economics Legislation Committee which sat all day last Friday.

313,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COULTER","TF4","(South Australia)","AD","N/A",2038,"—by leave—In relation to each of the bills, I move:That the House of Representatives be requested to make the following amendments:1.Schedule 2, page 9, after item 11, insert the following item:11B. After subitem 108(5):Add:(6)Toilet tissue or facial tissue...I found it rather interesting listening to the debate we have just had, in which Senator Panizza was saying of the government that not two years ago it had said things about increasing tax. Not two months ago, Mr Howard said in an interview—and this comes from his office—`Look, were not going to start talking about things that have not happened. We will vote against increases in taxation. I repeat, `We will vote against increases in taxation.These requested amendments seek to remove the tax on recycled paper. The government is seeking to put the tax on recycled paper up to 22 per cent across the board. At the same time, it is disingenuously going to spend somewhat over $5 million convincing the public that they should buy recycled paper at an increased charge. It is trying to convince the people to act against their own interests, to act against the very ideology which drives this government and this opposition. That, as well as the nails and screws matters that we have just debated, indicates the gross inconsistency of this government.In support of the government position, the government recently provided some background material from the large paper industry from which, I guess, the government and the opposition have been taking their advice. There are some remarkable statements in this document. Just take this for a load of logic. We read here, and this comes from the industry, that 34 per cent of total production of paper in Australia is 100 per cent recycled paper. Forty-five per cent of paper production has at least 80 per cent recycled paper content—note that figure. In other words, the total amount of recycled fibre going into paper must be less than 45 per cent. The very next sentence says that waste paper currently comprises 48 per cent of the fibre used in the production of paper in Australia.So much for the documentation provided by the industry, which wants a 22 per cent tax imposed on it. It wants a 22 per cent tax imposed on it because it wants to squeeze out the small producers who are producing the recycled paper. That is the sort of mathematical nonsense that the industry is presenting, and it is the mathematical nonsense that the government has swallowed.Further on in the same document we find the statement that recycling has no long-term advantage in terms of saving trees. If 34 per cent of the total production of paper in Australia is 100 per cent recycled paper, taking the industrys own figure, on each round of the use of that paper, 34 per cent fewer trees are being cut down. That is its own logic. So much for the sorts of arguments on which both the industry and the government are relying.In the history of this whole matter, we find that the government has been quite inconsistent in the way it has dealt with recycled paper. As I indicated in the second reading debate, many years ago we moved an amendment to remove the sales tax from recycled paper. That was defeated by the government and the opposition, voting together—and neither the government nor the opposition likes any taxes related to anything that will encourage anything to do with the environment.","N/A","SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (EXCISE) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (CUSTOMS) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (GENERAL) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1/speech[7]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

317,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COULTER","TF4","(South Australia)","AD","N/A",2038,"—He is here, but he is not sitting in his right place. The environment spokesman for the opposition, like the environment spokesman for the government, will vote for an increase in the tax on recycled paper, as I understand it. I hope I can convince them otherwise.Shortly after my original amendment was defeated, the government saw the wisdom of its error and it then moved to remove the tax from recycled paper and, for a short while, we did not have the tax on recycled paper. We then had the reintroduction of the tax accompanied by, because of the pressure which the Democrats were able to bring to bear on the then Treasurer, a payment of a bounty scheme, which in the first year exactly equalled the tax on the recycled paper—a 20 per cent sales tax accompanied by a 20 per cent bounty payment. So effectively it negatived the tax. In the next year, it was 15 per cent. In the final year, which was the last financial year, it was 10 per cent. Since then, there has been no tax encouragement to recycle paper.In addition to that chronological inconsistency, we also had the inconsistency between different sorts of paper. When the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Act 1989 introduced a sales tax exemption with effect from 5 October 1989, it did so for the following goods made from recycled paper: writing paper and drawing paper; pads of writing and drawing paper; books of writing and drawing paper; paper for use in accounting ledgers and journals, envelopes, toilet and facial tissue; and paper bags marketed for household purposes or for use in marketing goods sold by retail. We now have in this definition of paper re-run of the nonsense we heard about earlier with nails and screws used for different purposes and treated differently under the tax law.The amendment was originally announced by the Prime Minister in his environment statement on 20 July 1989. The expected cost to revenue in a full year of this amendment was expected to be less than—wait for it—$500,000. That was in the second reading speech. The Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Act 1992, as I have indicated, then removed the sales tax exemption with effect from 26 June 1992 for the following: books of writing and drawing paper; toilet and facial tissues; and paper bags marketed for household purposes or for use in marketing goods sold by retail. Thus, the following goods remained exempt: writing and drawing paper, pads of writing and drawing paper, paper for use in accounting ledgers and journals and envelopes. So we had this quite arbitrary distinction between the various uses to which paper could be put.The reason for the removal of the exemption was that high quality waste paper was used in the manufacture of those recycled goods but, due to their nature, they were unlikely to be recycled again. The removal of the exemption was expected to result in increased revenue of—wait for it—$12 million. That was in the second reading speech. The difference between this revenue effect and the 1989 revenue effect would imply a massive increase in the supply of and demand for such recycled goods. Of course, the more likely explanation would be a very poor original estimate.In order to ensure passage of the amendment through the Senate, however, it was necessary for the government to agree—I gave an indication of this before—to Democrat demands for transitional assistance to the Australian manufacturers affected by the bill. As I have indicated, the assistance varied over three years between 20 per cent down to 10 per cent. Any continuation of these payments beyond July 1994 would be subject to review of the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency. In this regard—I note these figures again—$5.97 million was appropriated for the first payment, $10.26 million for the second and $5 million for the third.Interestingly, in mentioning the Environment Protection Agency, it has looked at this matter and it has recognised the value of using bounty arrangements, sales tax arrangements or differential price arrangements to encourage people to act in environmentally responsible ways. When it completed its review of the bounty arrangements for recycled tissue products, it concluded that there remained a continuing need for financial assistance to manufacturers of paper products containing recycled paper on the basis of the quantity of post-consumer high grade waste used by the manufacturer. We have the situation where the governments own advice is to continue with some such arrangement.Finally, we also have a document which comes directly from the paper manufacturers—I referred to it earlier—in which they say:Between 1992 and 1994 the Paper Manufacturers Association member companies invested $150 million in facilities to make recycled paper. The amount of new investment in recycled paper facilities announced in the 1994-95 financial year is $285 million.It then goes on and lists the actual amounts that were expended. However, what do we find in anticipation of this increase in the sales tax from Amcor? We find that the day after the budget—this was in the Australian Financial Review of 9 May 1994—it will make a decision to go ahead with a new $200 million fine papers plant, using non-recycled paper, in October. Coincidentally, the next day the budget virtually eliminated recycled paper as competition by taking the tax exemption off recycled paper in November. While the large part of the paper industry is claiming virtue for itself in some of its investments in recycled paper, its investments are dwarfed by the investments it is making not in recycled paper but in paper based on virgin fibre.It is for those very sound economic and environmental reasons that we are seeking to remove the sales tax on products made from fibre which has been recycled. Honourable senators will note that if this request is defeated and the opposition—against the clear promise which has been made by its leader, Mr Howard, that he would not support any increases in taxation—does not support this amendment by the Democrats, I will be moving a further request which seeks, instead of a zero rate of tax, the 12 per cent rate of tax, which is the new concessional rate after the changes occur.I will briefly explain why this is a fall-back position. Those parts of the industry which recognise the intransigence and inconsistency of the opposition have looked at the possibility of some halfway situation and have said that they could live with an across the board 12 per cent tax regime, but a 22 per cent tax regime would wipe them out. That is exactly the motivation of the large paper producers. A 12 per cent rate of tax would still maintain a 10 per cent differential, which would essentially make recycled paper of the same order of cost as paper made from virgin fibre. Those people, who were minded for good environmental reasons to buy the recycled paper, would not be disadvantaged.In conclusion, I thought it was a principle that was established long ago that in politics one does not rely on conscience to get things done. One does not say to people, `You must act against your best interests and use guilt as a strategy to get things done. You should put in place economic measures which encourage people to do the right thing and reward them for doing the right thing rather than penalise them. The imposition of this tax penalises people who have a conscience—the people who will continue to buy the recycled paper. In a futile attempt to address that, the government is spending of the order of the same amount of money to encourage people to act against their self-interest as it would expend if it adopted the middle course—the 12 per cent sales tax on recycled paper.I strongly commend this request and ask very strongly that the opposition is consistent with its stated position and with what its leader has said and will support this by the Democrats.","N/A","SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (EXCISE) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (CUSTOMS) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (GENERAL) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1/speech[7]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

320,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator PANIZZA","JI4","(Western Australia)","LP","N/A",2041,"—Senator Coulter can wave it around as much as he likes, but if we are talking about consistency, let us be consistent. Waste paper is not the only commodity that is recycled. A massive amount of steel and aluminium is recycled. When aluminium is manufactured into new windows or steel is used in new cars, they are not sales tax free. Even tyres are recycled by being re-capped. I can remember once upon a time when there was no sales tax on re-capped tyres. Can Senator Kernot remember back that far? She would not have bought a tyre in her life or got one re-capped, so she would not know. Batteries are recycled for their lead. Is sales tax paid on new batteries? That is a valid question. Has Senator Coulter or Senator Kernot ever stood up in this chamber and said that batteries should be recycled for their lead? No, they have not. They have not said it while I have been around, and I have been in this Senate longer than they have.The Democrats can plug as much as they like when they are zero rating on recycled paper—that is up to them—but, when they question my consistency and the consistency of John Howard, I question theirs. I have never heard them stand up and talk about any of these products.The environment question is valid for products made from steel or lead because the more these products are recycled, the less mining needs to be carried out and there is less damage to the environment and less generation of electricity. Have they ever heard of what generation of electricity may or may not do? If the Democrats want to be consistent, they should get away from the fairies at the bottom of the garden and get into the real world, and then I will believe that they are consistent.","N/A","SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (EXCISE) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (CUSTOMS) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (GENERAL) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1/speech[8]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
321,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CHAMARETTE","SN5","(Western Australia)","GWA","N/A",2042,"—I rise to indicate the support of the Greens (WA) for the request moved by Senator Coulter for the Australian Democrats, in the anticipation that we may not gain support for the alternative motion either. The underlying motivation for this government budget measure has two stories attached.The first is attached to some small, local Australian-based companies, two of which are AusTissue in Western Australia—interestingly, in the Assistant Treasurers electorate—and Cosco in Queensland. They are two small local companies employing local people and having local collection points for office paper recycling. They are enormously impressive as a community response to concern about the environment and the impact that our wasteful lifestyle has on the environment. I would like to share part of a statement by the Australian Recycled Paper Manufacturers Association, of which these two companies are a part. On 7 December 1994, Mr Head from ARPMA stated:In every other country in the world, governments have created incentives for the manufacture of 100% recycled paper products. Australia made that commitment in 1988, but appears to be weakening in its commitment.He also said:Our industry cannot afford to carry the 21% WST at this point in our development. Weve invested more than $75 million over five years in the technology, R & D and collection networks to produce products that have a positive impact on the environment.The arguments that have been made against the support of these businesses sometimes blind government and other people with science, saying, `Because they are going mainly into toilet tissue, they are only single recyclers. They go from fine office paper to toilet paper. We really need to promote other recycled products. However, that argument is pulled from under anybody who uses it with the realisation that at the moment we have 600,000 tonnes of waste paper still going into landfill.We, as Australians, need to ask the federal government why it is not committed to a 50 per cent reduction in all waste to landfill by the year 2000. This was outlined in the national waste minimisation and recycling strategy, and by the Australia and New Zealand Environment Conservation Council agreement. But it appears that the government has reneged on its commitment and is much more interested in gaining revenue through the tax. I think there is another story to this: it is not simply a critique of those small, local Australian based industries and the very good work they are doing. The minister will probably think up other arguments along those lines; but let us remember the industries that this amendment is urging us to maintain our commitment and support for.The second story that underlines the need for this amendment is about some bigger players amongst which are Amcor, Kimberly-Clark and Bowater-Scott. The real story of the need for this amendment lies with the forest industry. Most fibre used for manufacturing paper in Australia comes from native forests. The approximate proportions are imported pulp at 12 per cent; recycled content, eight per cent; domestic plantation-grown, eight per cent; domestic native forest grown, eight per cent; and other, three per cent.Companies like Amcor form a mixed industry. They have said they are starting up recycled components. That is only a very small part of their industry. They have a vested interest in not wanting to see the small, lively competitors that are working on 100 per cent recycled paper gaining some kind of foothold in their market. That is the real story underlying the governments switch from small players to big players.The way these big players appear virtuous is to have made a commitment—for this we commend them—to plantation sourced pulp. That is okay if it does not involve a kind of predatory view towards other industries that are helping us to reduce the 600,000 tonnes of landfill that could be used in 100 per cent recycled paper products. That is the reality of the second story. I will quote again from a statement by the Australian Recycled Paper Manufacturers Association. Its representative stated:The forest industry companies have not involved themselves to any great extent in the manufacturer of 100% recycled paper products and will comfortably survive any decision by your Government to agree to a policy of favouritism for these products. Our industry cannot survive a decision which imposes equal Sales Tax on our product and the non-recycled product, especially where the non-recycled product is not required to contribute to landfill costs on a polluter-pays basis, contributing to the real costs of landfill yet there is no recognition for our companies taking waste out of landfill.It is an extremely valuable contribution that is going unrecognised. Just in case senators would need to hear the position of Australian Paper, Amcor, I would like to quote from a 2 December 1994 letter to me. It states:Amcor is an Australian company with a share market value today of about $6 billion and traces its origins back to the 1860s to Australias first paper-making ventures.What is paper made from? It is made from forests. The letter continues:The company has operations in every State and employs over 14,000 people.The companys pulp and paper business, Australian Paper, has grown to become the largest business of its kind in the western Pacific.Australian Paper is Australias major forest plantation owner and the countrys largest paper recycler, collecting more waste paper than all other recyclers combined.Australian Paper is firmly opposed to the sales tax exemption for recycled papers and does not support subsidies for recycled paper producers.A wholesale tax exemption for certain 100 per cent recycled paper products came into effect in October 1989. The aim of the exemption was to encourage the recycling of paper.The letter goes on to argue against the validity of that. I do not want my citing of the letter to be taken as a criticism of all the activities of that company. I merely want to show the different motivation that is operating. That is the position the government has chosen to move in favour of. It feels those big arguments, the 14,000 people, the $6 billion, and being the biggest company of its kind in the western Pacific, are reasons to listen and do something which Australian Paper has said is of no concern to it: the removal of the exemption. Of course it is of no concern; it is in that companys favour.The decision eliminates its small, growing competition which is doing a very valuable job. There are plenty of people who will not buy toilet tissue containing other than 100 per cent recycled paper products. They are investing in our future and supporting environmentally sound practices. This failure of the government to recognise that is a disincentive for local companies.I would like to say shame on the opposition for indicating that it will support the government on this measure. I warned the shadow minister for the environment, Senator Kemp, that I would be pointing out to him a document in which a series of correspondence appears from various members of parliament across all the parties. I think Senator Kernots letter is the first one in here. There is Tom Barton, the member for Waterford, Robert Tickner and any number of people from many parties supporting the need for the continued support of the these 100 per cent recycled products. There is also a letter dated 20 November 1994 from the Western Australian Liberal state governments Minister for the Environment. The then environment minister, Kevin Minson, said:Western Australia stands to lose an important green industry and hundreds of jobs in recycling if the Federal Government prematurely removes its assistance from the recycled tissue paper industry . . .There are very few product differentials on environmental issues between the federal government and the federal opposition, but here is one. I therefore urge the opposition to reconsider its position and to support the Democrats amendment, as the Greens intend to do.","N/A","SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (EXCISE) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (CUSTOMS) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (GENERAL) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1/speech[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Therefore, we are against any general tax measures. The government wants to make changes in the budget for other reasons, and we will not stand in its way.As I said earlier this evening, we will not stand in the way of changes that have been made to these sales tax bills as a result of court decisions—that is, to safes, model aircraft, scaffolding, et cetera. It is consistent with our principles. The things that we did oppose and what we will oppose in the next level of amendments include motor vehicles, which have already been dealt with this evening, and building materials, half of which has been dealt with already.

323,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator KEMP","WW4","(Victoria)","LP","N/A",2044,"—I listened with great interest to the debate, particularly to the views put forward by Senator Coulter and Senator Chamarette. Senator Coulter made a long speech, but I do not think he did the analysis. The analysis simply is what will best encourage the use of recycled paper in this country. I think Senator Chamarette did weigh up some of the issues. On the one hand, Senator Chamarette recognised that a number of the very large users of recycled paper have strongly urged the removal of this exemption. She recognised this particular view. On the other hand, she attempted to weigh it against a view put by some companies that the removal of the exemption would be damaging to them.I think all of us share a view that it is important that the use of recycled paper be encouraged. I do not think anyone would stand up in this chamber and oppose it. In fact, it is my strong view that everything should be done to encourage the use of recycled paper. However, from the material which has been brought before me and after listening to the debates, it seems to me that the removal of this particular exemption will not effectively, certainly in the medium and long term, discourage in any way the use of recycled paper. In fact, all the information that I have seen is that large investments are currently being made to use recycled paper. I think Senator Chamarette listed some of those investments.I listened to the analysis given by Senator Coulter. I was intrigued that he quoted peoples promises and statements. I think my colleague Senator Gibson effectively responded to that issue on behalf of the coalition. I am delighted that the Democrats are getting up and saying that promises are important. I have been saying that to Senator Kernot for a long time. Australia would be a significantly different place if she had stuck by the view that government promises are important and that governments should be held to their promises.

As a consequence, the Australian people are wearing far higher taxes as a result of the actions of you and your party. I understand that the debate is a complex one. Everyone wants to encourage the use of recycled paper. We read the claims from a wide variety of companies that are involved in this sector. Some of the major users of recycled paper have strongly argued that this exemption causes a distortion in the market and they support the governments measures. Other companies, the smaller ones as pointed out by Senator Chamarette, believe the exemption they currently have is of benefit to them. I think we have to weigh up the arguments.The report of the Industry Commission recommended the abolition of sales tax exemptions. Its study found that it had a limited impact on recycling rates. That is an important point. We may well differ on that, but the Industry Commission carried out a study on it. I am intrigued that both Senator Coulter and Senator Chamarette did not draw attention to a point which I regarded as quite significant. In order to finance changes in the environmental budget, as a result of these changes the government is saving of the order of $45 million over the next four years. I was surprised that you did not contrast this with the additional $5 million that the government is proposing to put into various programs to encourage the use of recycled paper.","N/A","SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (EXCISE) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (CUSTOMS) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (GENERAL) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1/speech[11]/talk.start[6]/para","N/A","N/A"

All of us are convinced that there should be as much encouragement as possible to the use of recycled papers. It seems to me on the weight of arguments that this concession is not achieving that goal. Therefore, the question arises: what other programs should have been put in place?If you read Senator Faulkners budget statement, you will see that it is very skimpy as to what the additional programs, which cost in the order of $5 million, are going to produce to encourage greater use and demand by consumers of recycled paper.In conclusion, and to support my colleague, I do not think the requested amendments that have been proposed by Senator Coulter are the way to go. I do not want to pretend that I do not understand the arguments, but I have to say, on balance, from the evidence that has been presented to me, that this concession is not producing the results. As my colleague said, it is one of those changes which removes some distortions in the tax system which we are not opposed to.

336,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COULTER","TF4","(South Australia)","AD","N/A",2045,"—We are debating the increase in the tax rate on recycled paper. Again, I have before me this statement by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard: `We will vote against increases in taxation. To me, those words are simple and they mean that the opposition could not support what the government is proposing.The issue of consistency has been raised by several opposition spokespeople. Senator Panizza confused two quite separate issues, as he often does. The first is consistency in relation to policy and the second is consistency in relation to the philosophy which lies behind that policy. In relation to consistency, we are saying that, to be consistent with what the Leader of the Opposition has said, the opposition should not support this increase in taxation.In relation to the fundamental philosophy, it is simply untrue, as Senator Panizza asserted, that we have not spoken about the relative importance of taxation on virgin materials and a lesser tax rate, or a bounty scheme, on recycled materials across the board. We have spoken at great length and in great detail on this matter. On many occasions we have pointed out how this would work. Virgin materials, particularly non-renewable materials such as the specific metals that Senator Panizza mentioned, in our view should attract a tax. That tax should not be applied to those metals when they are recycled. There should be encouragement to recycle those things to the maximum extent possible. We have been absolutely consistent in that respect.Senator Kemp said that does not do that. I will give Senator Kemp some figures. In May 1994, just over a year ago, the figure for recycled writing paper from Australian paper was $5 per ream; the non-recycled Copyright, $5.67; Reflex, $5.74; and the imported, $4.99—almost exactly the same price as the recycled.Senator Kemp, under those circumstances and given that you want to buy Australian, which would you buy? Recycled costs you $5; Copyright is going to cost you $5.67 a ream. As an economic rationalist what would you do? You would buy the recycled paper, would you not, because it was cheaper. Let us look at the figures after the government has placed its impost. That recycled paper from the same manufacturer will cost $6.91 per ream. Copyright will cost you $6.28 per ream. Senator Kemp, which would you buy—the recycled for $6.91 or the non-recycled for $6.28? As a pure economic rationalist you would go for the non-recycled paper every time.I say that without any blush or fear of contradiction. The $5 million approximately that the government is going to put in place to encourage you to act against your best interests will not cause you to buy the recycled product. That is the argument. It is a very simple, straightforward, rational and economic argument. For those reasons I believe it should be supported.","N/A","SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (EXCISE) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (CUSTOMS) BILL 1995 SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (GENERAL) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1/speech[12]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

343,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator HILL","BH4","(South Australia-","LP","Leader of the Opposition)",2048,"—The coalition is supporting these amendments which are basically designed to overcome very severe administrative failure within the Department of Industry, Science and Technology. It is very important to recognise the responsibility of ministers to ensure that the form of delegated legislation is complied with. In this instance the government failed to table guidelines, and thus properly bring into ongoing effect the guidelines under the powers in the principal act. The result was that these guidelines under the IR&D scheme became invalid. They became invalid in four different instances. The default dates back as far as 1988.It is hard to imagine how the failures within the department could reach such proportions that it was not until 1994 that it was first recognised within the department that such errors had occurred. Regrettably, even when that came to the notice of certain officers, action was not taken. It was not until April of this year, from memory, that the seriousness of the omissions was recognised and the administration started to address the remedial action which should be taken.It is not limited just to the IR&D scheme because, regrettably, in the course of this matter it was found that there were also omissions under the export market development grants scheme, which is now administered by Austrade. At the time, at least some of these administrative failures in that regard were administered by this department. When an investigation was mounted at the request of the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) it was found that omissions had occurred in relation to the Bounty (Computers) Act. At the very least, what has been demonstrated is very severe administrative deficiencies within this department.The minister, in the immediate term, sought to play down the consequences and accused us of beat-ups and all sorts of things. For a while he was hopeful that the making and tabling of further guidelines would resolve the difficulties. After further advice, he decided to take the sensible path, which was the more cautious path, which we advocated from the start, and this legislative change was made retrospective to cover the decisions made over the past years under invalid guidelines.That was the course we suggested. I am pleased that the government and the minister came to the recognition that it was the sensible path to follow. Naturally enough, we on this side who are interested in providing confidence to those investing in the scheme and to industry are prepared to support the changes. They are changes which should never have been necessary. This bill should never have been necessary.I still do not know whether the minister and the department understand the consequences of their default. They put in jeopardy very large sums of money. Investment applications have been made and have failed, at great expense to parties, on the basis of invalid guidelines. There are question marks over the validity of grants that have been approved. That was all basically because of the elementary failures within the department, occurring to such an extent that one might even refer to them as a systemic failure.The question is: who takes responsibility? Following these embarrassing revelations, the minister caused an investigation to take place. Principally, the fault has been marked down to the bureaucrats, which is very comfortable for the minister. The bureaucrats appeared before the estimates committee and accepted responsibility for the errors. When the default occurs so often within the administration of a department; when it continues for so long, even when it default is discovered; and when the consequences of the default were not understood and remedial action was not taken, somewhere along that road the person in charge of the administration has to accept some responsibility.This government has been marked by ministers who have been all too quick to pass the buck to their officers and have been reluctant to accept that they are ultimately responsible for the competent administration of their department. This minister is one of those who is not prepared to accept that responsibility. He is prepared to blame his servants rather than accept that the master occasionally has to have the stomach to accept that failure ultimately rests with him. I suppose, at the very least, we can say that after the Jacobs inquiry there will now be improvement within the systems in the department that hopefully will result in recurrence being much more unlikely. That is to some extent comforting.I think it is important for ministers to recognise that delegated legislation is not just simply a matter of form. It is a responsibility to be accepted seriously. This responsibility has been passed from the parliament to the person given the power to make the rule, regulation or guideline—that subordinate legislation has the effect of law—and to ensure protection, as in this instance. Under the Acts Interpretation Act it is obliged to be tabled in parliament. We have the opportunity and the responsibility to consider it. In some circumstances we have the right also to move for disallowance. The law is such that it provides a safeguard. In this instance the safeguard was not given. The minister has therefore failed in meeting that responsibility to the Australian people.So there was a failure of process—a process that has been taken far too casually by this minister and this department; there was a failure to those who invested in this scheme and who had a right to expect certainty; and there was a failure to the board and others who were given the responsibility to administer it for the department and who had the right to expect that the prerequisites to legality would have been complied with. All of these are failures for which the minister must take ultimate responsibility but for which he is not prepared to.Nevertheless, we hope that some lessons have been learned. I think over 2,000 pieces of delegated legislation now become law each year in this country. If this is a precedent, one can only wonder in how many instances the requirements of the law have not been met. The consequences that would flow from that would be really quite astonishing.I said the coalition will support this legislation to restore confidence to the industry and to investors. We have moved quickly to do that and to process this piece of legislation through our party room. The only reservation we have in doing so is that, whenever an attempt is made to pass retrospective legislation, obviously careful thought must be given to whether any party might be detrimentally affected by that retrospectivity.In this instance it is not easy to see who might suffer damages as a result of our attempts to put the law right and to overcome the deficiencies in the ministers administration. Nevertheless, we believe it is better to err on the side of caution. We will propose at the committee stage an amendment that has the effect of ensuring that the legislation which gets passed tonight in an effort to overcome the administrative failures to which I have referred will not have any inadvertent consequence that is detrimental to any party. To save time at the next stage of the debate, I will read the terms of that amendment, which states:In spite of anything in this Act, the validations provided for by this Act do not affect any right of action of a person in relation to:(a) a decision of the Board; or(b)an act or thing done by any person or body;that was adverse to the person in relation to whom the decision was made or the act or thing was done and such rights of action may be pursued as if this Act had never been enacted.I understand that that amendment has been circulated. I hope that it will be supported by all parties. I hope that it will also be supported by the government. I would be particularly concerned if it is not.This is a night when, unfortunately, the minister cannot hold his head high. This is a night of embarrassment for him and his administration. Nevertheless, the consequences to the public, including investors, and industry are more important than the ministers embarrassment. I am pleased that, at least after tonight, the law will be made certain. Those who invest in this way will have certainty in their investment.","N/A","INDUSTRY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
344,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator SPINDLER","0X4","(Victoria)","AD","N/A",2050,"—The Senate is debating the Industry Research and Development Amendment Bill 1995. The bill has two purposes: firstly, to implement the budget decision to extend the ability of the Industry Research and Development Board to enter into new grant agreements from the current expiry date of 31 December 1995 until 30 June 1996; and, secondly, to validate the guidelines for the 150 per cent R&D tax concession, which were not tabled in parliament two years ago and which were dealt with by Senator Hill at great length just now.Since the guidelines became invalid, 14 companies have had their applications for concession rejected. Another 29 syndicates were withdrawn and 135 were approved. The Democrats are also concerned that this administrative oversight has occurred. We believe that the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) must take responsibility for it. However, the purpose of the scheme is too important to be allowed to suffer through this administrative oversight. Certainly the Democrats will lend their support to the amendments that will validate the guidelines.We will also support the opposition amendment, which is very similar to the one that was moved in a similar situation which developed over the EMDG guidelines. We believe that the rights of those companies or syndicates which have been rejected must be preserved in a substantive way so that they do not suffer any disadvantage, should they wish to take action.I am not aware in this case whether they have run out of time. I recall that, on the previous occasion, the minister made a commitment that, even if they have run out of time, any objections or appeals that they wish to lodge on substantive grounds will still be dealt with even though technically the time had elapsed during which those appeals could be made. I call on the minister to advise the chamber whether he is prepared to follow this precedent on this occasion. I am not aware whether any of those 14 companies wish to make appeals. But it is clear in this situation that the least the chamber can do is to preserve their rights, should they wish to do so.I turn to the most substantive aspects of this bill. The Democrats are firm believers in the importance of research and development, which we believe is extremely important for the future of our economy and for our country as a whole. That belief is grounded in the understanding that, in the modern globally integrated economy, knowledge and skills rather than capital are the source of wealth. We are, therefore, strong supporters of the governments intervention to support R&D. In particular, we are supporters of this 150 per cent tax concession for R&D.For many years economic policy has been dominated by believers in the traditional so-called neoclassical model of economic growth. In this model the only way to double the output of the economy was to double inputs into the economy of land, labour and capital. In this view of the world, governments were not supposed to intervene in the economy. Free markets would see resources find their way to those productive uses where they would be most efficiently used. So it was wrong for the government to attempt to push those resources in other directions through active policy. We may be reaching a stage where that policy has outlived its usefulness, if it ever had any. In that view of the world, technological progress was something that just happened. It was not something that was itself an outcome of economic activity.More recently a group of economists led by American Professor Paul Romer have overturned this view of the world, with the insight that knowledge is what now drives an economy and generates economic growth. As Romer points out, in the age of knowledge you do not need to double all inputs to double all outputs. A new idea plus the same amount of material inputs can double output. Take the example of producing computers. You can measure the output of a computer company by the amount of computer power it generates. To double the number of computers a company produces you would indeed need to double the number of workers, double the materials, double the inputs of capital and power.But if someone comes up with a new idea, a new technique, a new piece of knowledge which means that every new computer will, with some slight adjustment to chip design, produce double the computing power, then the same number of computers will be producing double the actual output of the company. Same inputs, one new idea, and output is doubled. Unlike other inputs, like capital and labour, if I make use of a new idea that does not stop you or anybody else from using it. Ideas do not get used up. That is why the generation of new knowledge is important for growth.Romers second insight was that there are many industries which produce new knowledge as a by-product of the main activities. The aerospace industry, for example, produced the knowledge that led to teflon and kevlar. This new knowledge coming out of such industries is often referred to as a knowledge spillover or as a positive externality. Most people acknowledge that manufacturing industry, in particular manufacturing industry based on advanced technology, tends to generate more of these knowledge spillovers than other industries.Accepting Romers view of the world, the hands-off approach to industry policy no longer makes sense. Letting the market direct resources wherever they might fall no longer makes sense. Resources devoted to an industry that generates new knowledge as a by-product are many times more valuable to an economy than resources devoted to industries which do not. But markets do not take this added value into account because the knowledge generated by an industry is not necessarily captured by that industry. To use my previous example, it was not the aeronautics industry which made the profit out of Teflon.New growth theory tells us that the market left to itself will underinvest in industries which generate knowledge spillovers. Hence government intervention is required to encourage research and development to support venture capital to help commercialise new technologies and to divert resources toward the manufacturing sector. It is no coincidence that the high growth economies of the past decade, Japan, Korea and the other Asian tigers, have all followed policies of targeted government intervention to develop strategic positions in manufacturing, computers and other technologies.For many years now the Australian Democrats have argued that the rapid dismantling of assistance to Australias manufacturing industries has been poor and counterproductive policy. Because of the nature of political debate and the overriding interest of the Australian Democrats in social justice and equity, the public face of that criticism has been an emphasis that too rapid change was poor social policy; obviously it was. It has caused massive unemployment and dislocation, the virtual disappearance of job opportunities for blue-collar workers, rising inequality of income, suicides and family breakdown, and the death or near-death of many regional towns built around manufacturing. Hardest hit has been my own state of Victoria.The point I am emphasising today is that those policies were also poor policies from the standpoint of maximising long-term growth. The disappearance of much of our manufacturing base is tied directly to the loss of the knowledge spillovers that we need to generate growth. The percentage of people employed in high-tech manufacturing has actually fallen by 10 per cent over the last 20 years, while in the OECD generally the proportion has increased by 23 per cent over the same period.Our poor performance in private sector research and development—we still rank in the bottom half of the OECD league table—is directly related to the dismantling of our manufacturing base and the failure of our high-tech sector to grow at the rate of our overseas competitors; not forgetting the assistance that sector has had in other countries.Another result of our short-sighted unilateral deregulation has been high levels of foreign ownership of Australian firms. This has meant that much of the R&D is carried out in head offices offshore, with the result that once again we lose the benefit of any knowledge spillovers. The deregulationist policies of the last two decades have not only damaged the very social fabric of our country but have also undermined our capacity to generate new wealth.Recently, the government has appeared to grasp much of the rhetoric of new growth theory. It speaks at great length about the need to develop a culture of innovation and about the need to make us a clever country. To date, however, it has been just rhetoric. Apart from a few schemes, the government has generally failed to put its money where its mouth is and really get behind the development of a high-tech manufacturing base in this country. There is still no significant support for venture capital. There is still no commitment to industry planning for our strategic manufacturing industries. There is still a determination to drive more of our motor vehicle industry—long a major source of knowledge spillovers—out of the country through a program to reduce tariffs to 15 per cent, while we still do not get access to competitors markets.I look forward to the ministers forthcoming innovation statement. I trust he will use it to reverse the governments policy of non-intervention. I have had a look at the interim paper and I find it rather disappointing: it has more of the same and not enough strategic emphasis, which is what we need at this time in research and development and to generate investment. I commend to the minister, in particular, Derek Sicklens proposals in his latest paper, `A Fresh Look at Industry and Trade Policy. The idea of linking performance conditions to industry incentives has proved a winner in programs such as factor F, partnerships for development, and the industry innovation programs. It allows self-selection by industry, avoiding the governments ideological aversion to picking winners. I would have thought that the wrong thing is picking losers.My aim today has been to emphasise the importance of research and development as a source of future growth, and the value the Australian Democrats place on such activities. Because of that, it is vital that the governments bill to correct its own administrative incompetence is passed, and passed quickly, to allow the important R&D tax concession program to continue in a climate of certainty and with minimal disruption to industry.In the budget, the government removed private sector tax exempt bodies from access to the 150 per cent tax concession. In doing so, it unfairly wiped out many research projects which were already well into the process of putting the final touches on syndication arrangements. Moreover, the value of the research involved, particularly that being undertaken by some of our leading medical research organisations, suggests that the government has been very short-sighted. I signal now that when the government brings the relevant legislation before the Senate in the next session, the Australian Democrats will be looking for action to correct this apparent inequity.In closing, may I reiterate that the Australian Democrats strongly support the continuance of this particular 150 per cent R&D tax concession program. We do believe that it can be improved. We do believe that it, as well as incentives for investment, should be increased and should be tied to performance criteria of industry to come together in a targeted and strategic program for the economic and industrial development of this country.","N/A","INDUSTRY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
345,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COOK","RF4","(Western Australia-","ALP","Minister for Industry, Science and Technology and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Science)",2052,"—in reply—We are debating the Industry Research and Development Amendment Bill 1995, and I am speaking to close the second reading of that bill. The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Hill, and a Democrats spokesmen, Senator Spindler, have addressed this bill. I thank both of the senators for their contribution. This bill is aimed at providing a speedy remedy for what is a case of administrative failure in order to restore certainty and to provide that the error that has been committed is remedied as quickly as possible so as to minimise any disruption the administrative failure may have caused.When I and the senior officers of my department became aware of the problem that had been created by the failure to table these particular instruments, immediate remedial action was taken by us. At the instigation of the Secretary to the Department of Industry, Science and Technology, there has now been an independent inquiry into the events—what happened and how they arose. A second report has been filed as well stating what actions can be taken to ensure that administratively this problem is never repeated.I refer the Senate to the statement I gave to the estimates committee on Monday night. It is probably the most full and complete statement from the government as to the nature of these things and what we have done to act thus far to repair them. I also note for the record that, with the names of particular officers referred to in the report blanked out, the report of the independent reporter, Mr Jacobs, has been lodged with the estimates committee and a full unexpatiated copy of the report has been lodged with the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Hill. The estimates committee which has been referred to here took evidence from a number of departmental officers as well.In the case of this unfortunate and unhappy administrative failure my first obligation was to ensure proper investigation, analysis and recommendation of remedial action and to properly attend to my responsibilities as minister to this parliament by making available to it all the relevant documentation and, in the form of the estimates procedure, the relevant officers of the department as well for examination and consideration. That has been done. I believe that is an obligation on ministers. The secretary to my department has indicated to the estimates committee that he is taking a number of administrative steps to prevent this issue ever being before us again and to improve the systems operation of the department.I have before me the report of Mr Jacobs, the independent reporter, and the comments on that report by the secretary. I have not yet this week been able to lend my mind to an analysis of that report from a ministerial point of view, but I intend to do that promptly—hopefully by the end of this weekend. I will make available, by note to the estimates committee, my further consideration as minister based on the actions that have been taken by the department so the estimates committee can be aware in full of the governments response to all of this.This bill corrects the oversight and it does it in a most cautious and careful way. There are legitimate contending views as to how the oversight could have been corrected, but, in sum, it comes down to the fact that the one way that all the thinkers on the subject believe that it can be corrected so that it is beyond any doubt is the way we have corrected it. As a consequence, we have adopted this course of action.In this debate, the questions of what is ministerial responsibility and whether I should take ministerial responsibility have been raised. I take ministerial responsibility for my actions. I think the facts of this matter show that my actions have been immediate and proper in all of the circumstances. This has been described colloquially `as a model cock-up.I know that the department has directed its attention, as I have, to making sure we put in place a model remedy. While life is an experience that is not lived without mistakes—and one regrets and is always chastened by mistakes when they occur—I think the true measure is to admit them frankly and openly, allow independent investigation, be satisfied from outside advice that you have acted properly and also remedy the situation as quickly and fully as possible. That is what we have tried to do on this occasion.An amendment has been foreshadowed for the committee stage of the bill. I have had a look at that amendment. I say for the record that the government invited comment on the bill from all parties before it was lodged to make sure that the form of the bill was appropriate. I have sought opinions from various parties as to whether or not there would be amendments and until tonight I understood that there would not be any and that the bill did meet the purposes for which it was framed.I have been given no notice of the amendment. Nonetheless, it is an amendment to which I have to respond. Produced on the spot as it is, it seems to be similar in terms to an amendment accepted by the government in relation to the EMDG scheme. It appears that this amendment does not do anything new in terms of the bill. The purpose of this amendment is encompassed by what is already included in the bill. However, it can be held that this amendment more clearly expresses that purpose and for that reason the government will accept it. I commend the legislation to the Senate.Question resolved in the affirmative.Bill read a second time.","N/A","INDUSTRY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

405,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator PARER","KI4","(Queensland)","LP","N/A",2055,"—In the Senate a week or so ago, the opposition and the Australian Democrats supported a number of amendments to the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 [1995]. There were very good reasons for our supporting those amendments. They predominantly recognised that the tourism industry, particularly the inbound tourism industry, was a very major industry in Australia. It is up there with primary industry, mining and manufacturing. In fact, it brings into this country in the order of $11 billion a year in foreign currency.During the debate on that bill in the Senate, I mentioned that Senator McMullan, who is here tonight, has been one of those who have proclaimed the tourist industry as being the biggest part of the service industry not only because of the foreign currency it brings in but also because of the number of people it employs in Australia, particularly young people. It has the potential to employ a lot more.In the House of Representatives, the government with its numbers rejected the amendments passed by the Senate. I could not help looking at the reasons why the government in the House of Representatives rejected those amendments. I will touch on those amendments.The first of those amendments by the Senate was that the government allow the tourist industry to claim the cost of samples of tourism services given away to overseas visitors. There is a very good reason for that. Any other person or business in the exporting business is able to take their samples overseas so the customers can see them, feel them, touch them, eat them or whatever they do with them and thus promote their particular industry. That is impossible with tourism. With the tourism industry, the customer must be brought to the product.The government in the House of Representatives said, and I quote from the explanation of reasons, `No industry sector is allowed to claim free samples given away in Australia.That is either deceptive or shows a total lack of understanding, because samples given away overseas for exports are allowable when claims are put together for export market development grant purposes. I thought we made it very clear, both ourselves and the Democrats, that there was only one way that sampling could be provided for tourism and that was to bring the customers, the wholesalers from overseas, to see what product was being offered and then market it in an overseas country to attract overseas tourists to Australia.The second amendment related to allowing joint ventures, consortia, to get together to apply for export market development grants. We gave very good reasons for that. The reasons were that this was of great benefit to regional Australia. Farming communities, whether they be small bed and breakfast places or small resorts, would be able to get together as joint ventures and market their particular region.I could not help but note, and again it shows a complete lack of understanding by the government of what tourism is about, that the government says the export market development grants scheme should promote things which otherwise would not occur. A classic example of how to achieve that is to allow joint ventures. You must allow joint ventures for those small operators. There are lots of parts of Australia where there are small operators who do not have the money at their disposal to promote their particular resort. Yet if they join together they are able to do so.Some of those places in Australia are, for example, the Yarra Valley in Victoria, some of the Hunter region in New South Wales, the wine growing areas of South Australia and other parts of Australia. In my own state, the various farm holiday facilities that are available, particularly when you get out towards places like the Longreach Hall of Fame, could go together with the Hall of Fame as joint venturers and try to attract people from overseas to come to their facilities.So the arguments do not hold water. The claim is made that it would cost in this particular instance about $2 million per annum down the track. That ignores the fact that this is the classic economic industry—the one we all learn about, that really does not apply in most practice. This one does apply. It is an industry in which if money is to be earned money has to be spent on promotion.It is the classic industry in many respects. You have to have a good product, you have to give good service but you must promote it. Assuming you have a good product and you give a good service, which most Australian tourist industries do—and I think everyone would agree with that—it must be promoted. If you do not promote it, you will not get anywhere. Even having succeeded, if you do not continue to promote it, you will not survive. It is the classic industry.A good example was given to me last year when I was overseas in Japan. I was given the analogy of a very well-known beer, I think it was Kirin beer, that had 70 or 80 per cent of the market and it did not think it had to continue advertising. It cut its advertising right back and I think the share of the market dropped from 70 per cent to 40 per cent in a very short period of time. That is basically what tourism is about.Still, the government does not see it that way. It is claiming a $2 million cost to export market development grants. It is not really $2 million or $3 million. Assuming these businesses make a profit, they probably give 36 per cent back to the government, anyway. It is just a method of enabling them to get together and promote their industry.I refer to the last of the amendments the government will not accept. I think this shows the great discrimination of the government. The House of Representatives committee that looked at tourism found that inbound tourism is an industry, the same as every other industry in this country. In fact, it has more benefits.With the mining industry, for instance, minerals have to be mined out of the ground, processed and sent overseas. In return, in comes foreign currency. But you had to take a bit out of Australia and give it away to get the foreign currency in. With tourism, people come here, they stay in hotels and motels, they view the things they wish to see—the great splendours of Australia—and they leave their foreign currency behind. They leave it in the region. It is a wonderful way to actually distribute income into areas that really need it.I think we have seen the benefits of that in places like Far North Queensland, parts of Western Australia and the Gold Coast of Queensland. I have often said that Sydney is a lucky city because people tend to feel that if they are coming to Australia they either come in or go out through Sydney. The Sydney region has the benefit of that, but other parts of Australia do not have that benefit and they must be able to market.This particular amendment would have treated tourism in exactly the same way as every other industry. It would have enabled single tourist operators to claim a grant of 50c for every dollar they spend on marketing their product overseas. The government in its original legislation allowed that industry to get only 25c in the dollar, which means it was half recognised.I said in my speech at the second reading stage that at least it was a step in the right direction. It was a step in the right direction because it recognised single tourism operators. Up until now, the single tourism operators could not make any export market development grant claims at all. The multiple tourist operators, the big ones, were able to claim and they still can. The multiple tourism operators still get 50c in the dollar; the single tourism operator does not. We tried to rectify that situation.I indicate that, notwithstanding those arguments, the coalition will not be opposing the governments amendments. The reason we will not be opposing the governments amendments, I am sad to say, relates to the Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee). The minister claims to be the friend of tourism until the chips are down. He is very quick at claiming credit for what the industry does. If the number of bed nights goes up, he puts out a press release almost claiming he did it. If international tourism figures rise, he is there with a great press release. But when the chips are down he is not there.The minister was not there when the Port Hinchinbrook fight was on with Senator Faulkner. Irrespective of the rights or wrongs of that, he is supposed to be the Minister for Tourism and he should have been in there battling to make sure that the fiasco that occurred at Port Hinchinbrook did not occur. He was not there when this particular legislation was brought in by the government and he was not there when the government amended it in the House of Representatives to reduce the benefits available to the industry.Sadly, the reason we are not opposing the amendments is that the minister has been running around the industry with threats. Those threats are that if the Senate continues to support the Senate amendments which gave the tourism industry the same recognition as applies to every other industry, he would withdraw the recognition of single tourism operators. We are not prepared to put that at risk.Eighty per cent of the tourism industry is classified as small business. There is no justification for not accepting the amendments passed by the Senate previously. There is no logic in the government discriminating against one of our few growth industries, which brings in $10 billion a year in foreign currency.This government has shown by its actions that it has discriminated against the industry. It has never ever, even as yet, recognised it as a real industry, notwithstanding the comments I have seen in the past, including those in the recent past from Senator McMullan congratulating them on their achievements as the major service industry in Australia, a major income earner and one which, in fact, has the potential to take up a lot of the unemployed, particularly the young unemployed.Finally, I would state on behalf of the coalition that, on election to government, the coalition would recognise tourism as our largest single earner of foreign currency; and it will give tourism the same access to export market development grants and to any other facilities as are applicable to any other industry. This is a coalition commitment which will be delivered; it is not an empty Labor promise which no-one believes anyway.","N/A","EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS AMENDMENT BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

408,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator SPINDLER","0X4","(Victoria)","AD","N/A",2058,"—Senator Parer says, `To the industry. I would have thought that senators in this chamber have a responsibility to make decisions on what they believe is right, not on what they think outside people do or do not expect.I believe that we have been elected to make decisions that produce the best results for the country and for industries. We did not support the oppositions amendment because we appreciated Senator Parers blue eyes, his well-cut suits or the flow of his rhetoric. All of these are appreciated and make it a pleasure to work with him. However, it was not for that reason we supported the opposition. We supported it because we thought there was a very good case made on behalf of the tourism industry. Now what has changed? The minister has called Senator Parers bluff; the coalition has caved in.I would inform Senator Parer and the minister that the Democrats will not cave in; the Democrats will not accept the governments rejection of these amendments. I will not go through those two amendments again and the reasons why they should be supported. We have put those reasons once and Senator Parer has repeated them twice. I will not delay the chamber.Let me just address the third one. The third amendment was to make sure that the tourism industry gets the 50 per cent reimbursement, just as does every other industry. Here we have a case which, again, has been very ably made by Senator Parer, very ably put forward by the coalition as a whole and very strongly made by the Australian Democrats. In fact, the history is that we announced that particular amendment before the opposition did. We made a commitment to it before the budget. I believe that this is an important amendment.We have heard that the tourism industry is one of the growth industries of Australia; that it produces significant—in fact, of any industry, just about the highest—foreign revenue compared to investment in industry. It is something that is a matter of equity; it is also a matter of economic policy. Now, because the minister said he will treat the industry even more unjustly, to simply say that we should give up an amendment that equalises that industry to other industries is simply unacceptable.I do not believe that the opposition has covered itself with glory in this particular case. It has simply gone to water, unjustifiably. It has left the tourism industry in the lurch. It has not stood up to the government. I am afraid we will not follow the opposition down that particular slippery slope. The Australian Democrats will be opposing the governments position.","N/A","EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS AMENDMENT BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
409,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator McMULLAN","5I4","(Australian Capital Territory-","ALP","Minister for Trade)",2058,"—Let me respond briefly to the substance of the points made by Senator Parer and Senator Spindler. Both those senators were properly succinct in their arguments because this is a reiteration of a debate we have had before and, at a time when the chamber is under time pressure, we do not wish to reiterate known positions.Let me make it clear that what we are trying to do here is strike a balance—a balance between the legitimate interest of the tourist industry, which was not previously being recognised because it was getting zero, and the legitimate concern of the taxpayers over whether their dollars were being used responsibly and, in my view, equitably.The key amendment is the third amendment. The arguments about the first two were made in the last debate and again in the House of Representatives. I would just waste the chambers time if I mentioned them again, although I do not want to brush everything aside so quickly that the governments arguments are not heard at all.There was a major review of the EMDG scheme, which was at the core of the governments decision to extend the scheme. The first thing to remember is that the central feature of this piece of legislation is that it continues this massive support for our export industry for a further five years—about $250 million a year worth of exports. That is the core of this bill and is not in contention. The overall majority of senators support it.The report which recommended the continuation of the EMDG scheme suggested that it be extended to the whole tourism sector in view of its high export earnings potential. However, it also said that, in view of there being an element of promotion by tourism companies to a captive market and the interrelationship between the generic and single service promotional activities, the government might choose to lower the grant payable to tourism claimants.What that means when you cut away the jargon is that a massive amount of taxpayers money is already being spent in our major markets to attract people to Australia. Much of the expenditure by tourism companies is competition between them to determine the destination of people once they have made the decision to come to Australia. That is a perfectly proper legal expense. I am not criticising them for spending their money like that, but it does not add to our exports. The fact that so much money is spent is obviously true as soon as you look at any of the advertising that takes place. It is self-evident. It is a sensible thing for an individual company to do, but not necessarily a sensible thing for a government to subsidise. It is not a point I want to argue at length, because I did so in the second reading debate and the committee stage when the bill went through the Senate the first time.Let me say two things. First of all, the 25 per cent extension is a very major victory for the Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee). We have been debating this question for a long time, and the government had not been able to find the funds to proceed in this direction and had not even decided to proceed in this way. Minister Lee has succeeded where no-one before him had. It is a very major victory for him and, through him, for the tourist industry.Secondly, once again, we have an opposition which has an overall economic policy of commitment to massive cuts in public spending, but the only thing it ever says is where it is going to spend more money. The whole equals the sum of the parts—if you keep saying that you are going to spend more money in every area, you cannot wind up with a conclusion that says you are going to spend less. It is just a bit of a stunt by the opposition. Somehow or other, at the end of the day, the opposition arithmetic will have to add up. For that reason, the government welcomes the indication of support for the legislation and is proud to propose it. The bill will extend this important assistance to our tourism industry for another five years and open up a new area of assistance to the tourism industry.Question resolved in the affirmative.Resolution reported; report adopted.","N/A","EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS AMENDMENT BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

415,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator TAMBLING","6E4","(Northern Territory)","NP","N/A",2060,"—I welcome the opportunity to participate in the Senates consideration of the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Bill 1995. The bill replaces the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1986 under which federal financial assistance grants are approved to local government.The bill continues current arrangements under which the grants are provided to councils in two separately identified categories. The first of these is general purpose grants which are paid on a per capita basis to each state and territory and distributed between councils on a horizontal equalisation basis. The second category is identified local road grants which are distributed between the states and territories according to an historical formula based on their relative road needs.This is one of the most important pieces of legislation affecting local government to come before this chamber in many years. It contains a number of useful features which improve on current arrangements. The introduction of national principles to govern the intrastate distribution of financial assistance grants is a welcome attempt to introduce more consistency in the allocation of these funds.The draft principles, which may or may not be the version finally declared by the minister, do seem, however, to have been framed with a view to ensuring that there is as little change as possible in the current distribution of funding. While this has the support of the states and local government, it does appear that the national principles are essentially just a continuation of the current arrangements.The coalition is pleased that councils will now be receiving earlier advice of their annual allocations which will only assist them in forward planning and framing their own budgets. This is a long overdue reform.For the first time, funding for the Australian Capital Territory will be included in the local government financial assistance arrangements. This will replace local government type funding for the territory currently provided through other legislation.The coalition is also pleased that the government has seen the light and decided not to propose the absorption of the untied local road funds into the general purpose assistance grants. Absorption of the local road funds, which would have automatically occurred under the current legislation, would have meant that for the first time interstate distribution of the road funds would have been made on a per capita basis. This would result in major reductions in the proportion of local road funding provided to Western Australia, Queensland, Tasmania, the Northern Territory, and the Australian Capital Territory. In the Northern Territorys case this would have meant a cut of nearly $5 million, or nearly 60 per cent, in the territorys share of federal local road grants.The government has accepted the advice of the recent review of the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1986 which found that absorption of local roads grants into the horizontal equalisation process would cause major disruption. However, while recognising the positive features of the legislation, there are a number of aspects of the bill which do concern the coalition. Indeed, they are of great concern to local government itself.The various state local government associations have recently written to federal members of parliament to voice their concerns about the bill. According to the councils, `the bill is seriously flawed in a number of respects. Some of these concerns relate to the omission of consultative requirements in the bill. To the governments credit, some of these concerns have been dealt with in the other place, where the minister accepted a number of coalition amendments.These were designed to require the government to consult with local government on the preparation of the national principles for the intrastate distribution of financial assistance grants and to consult with the states and local government in the preparation of the report to parliament on the operation of the legislation. We expect this will have resolved many of the concerns raised about the consultative and reporting framework enshrined in the bill and ensure the minister honours at least the spirit of the undertakings reached with the other levels of government.Regrettably, the government did not accept an amendment designed to enable parliamentary oversight of the federal ministers power to declare the national principles. I am pleased, however, that the government has reconsidered its position on this issue and will itself at the committee stage move an amendment designed to correct this defect in the bill. The coalition, with the support of the Australian Democrats, had already resolved to insist on the passage of such an amendment. The government is, in a sense, just recognising the inevitable.Turning now to the remainder of the legislation, it is apparent that the bill still has many flaws. Firstly, it will do remarkably little towards achieving its stated objectives. The second reading speech of the Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe) is long on rhetoric but, when you read the bill, we quickly discover that the cupboard is bare.A major failing of the bill is that it continues the parlous level of funding for local councils that local government has become used to. In 1983, when the government came to office, the federal general purpose assistance grants to local councils comprised 1.03 per cent of total Commonwealth tax revenues. By 1995-96, this share will have declined to 0.67 per cent. While total federal tax revenues increased by 49 per cent in real terms over this period, the real level of financial grants fell by three per cent.The fundamental problem which confronts councils is that the present government has built into the budgetary framework a level of funding for local government which will be difficult to retrieve in the short term. Although the government has foreshadowed a real terms per capita maintenance of local government funding commencing 1997-98, this has not been enshrined in the bill. The impact of the funding decline is most felt by rural councils which struggle to be able to provide the essential services that their ratepayers come to expect.The worsening condition of our local road network, declining standards of community services and rising property rates are all consequences of the federal governments shabby treatment of Australias third sphere of government. Other federal programs which assist local government in carrying out its functions, such as the road safety black spots program and the federal urban public transport program, have been abolished since Mr Keating became Prime Minister.A major feature of the bill is the inclusion for the first time of specific objects. These objects include improving the provision by local councils of services to Aboriginal communities and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of local councils. No senator could disagree with these aims.When one reads the legislation to try to discover how these objectives will be achieved, one is left none the wiser. The bill provides no strategy to promote the achievement of these objectives. However, the minister will be required to report to the parliament annually on how councils have met these objectives specified for them in the bill.For the first time in relation to local government payments, the federal minister will be required to table in parliament an annual report on the operation of the financial assistance grants legislation. This will include the extent to which the funds have been allocated on a horizontal equalisation basis and on the performance by councils of their functions, including their efficiency and provision of council services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.The Australian Local Government Association and the state and territory ministers believe that the government has breached a firm undertaking that any reporting arrangements are to be made to the local government ministers conference. The government had agreed that reporting on councils performance would be dealt with under the auspices of the regular local government ministers meetings, rather than to parliament in the first instance. Moreover, these issues were to be the subject of further investigation by officials and advice to ministers the next year.In relation to the issue of improved services to Aboriginal communities, the local government ministers conference decided that agreements would be negotiated between the states and territories, state local government associations and the Commonwealth on how best to deliver improved council services to Aboriginal communities. These agreements would involve complementary action by other spheres of government where necessary and additional assistance provided to councils identified and as needing to improve their performance.None of this, however, is reflected in the bill, which puts the onus on councils to redress problems of many years standing without one cent of additional federal funding. It is tragic that the government has sought to pass the buck in this way. The problems faced by Aboriginal communities require an expanded whole of government effort. Local government does not have the capacity to do a great deal more without substantial additional funding, none of which is provided in this bill. It is also not appropriate to focus on just one disadvantaged group in the community. Other groups with special needs could have been singled out for attention, such as migrants from non-English speaking backgrounds, people with disabilities, people in remote communities, the unemployed and so on.This bill also runs the risk of compromising the whole basis of federal local government funding. Federal grants to local government are currently untied. The principle has always been until now that what councils do with the money must remain a matter for the democratic process at the local level. Instead, this bill, in effect, converts the general purpose funding to tied funding, rather than establishing a targeted program to achieve the sensible objectives specified in the bill. To quote the Australian local government association, this aspect of the bill `seriously undermines the concept of untied, general purpose grants.To address these issues in the bill would require substantial amendments and an additional funding commitment, neither of which is likely to be acceptable to the government at this stage. We are also conscious of the need to ensure passage of the bill by 30 June to guarantee the continued separate identification of the local roads grants.The broken promises I have referred to cast in a poor light the special arrangement between the federal government and local government supposed to be heralded by the proposed Commonwealth local government accord. It is ironic that, in the same week the minister announced his intention to develop the accord, local government was telling the world that the government had broken key agreements on the content of this legislation, including failure to incorporate key consultative mechanisms in the bill. In the words of the Australian Local Government Association:The bill fails to implement agreements reached at conferences of local government ministers, including the ALGA President.But this is symptomatic of the governments whole approach to this portfolio. On so many issues of concern to Australias 741 municipalities, the governments promised consultation is revealed as just empty promises. It would be bad enough if the governments dismissive treatment of local government were confined to this bill. But it is just one of a long series of occasions on which the government has ignored or disregarded the interests of local government.The coalition notes that the proposed accord is likely to address local governments role in progressing the national competition policy. It seems to us that the governments position on this issue is pretty well fixed and local government does not fare well. Local government has not been included in the system of competition payments agreed at the Council of Australian Governments. Moreover, the intergovernment competition principles agreement does not provide for state and Commonwealth government business enterprises to pay local government rates and charges.The threshold problem is that the government refused to allow the Industry Commission to investigate the extent of local governments contribution to the benefits flowing from the competition policy reforms or to examine the impact of the reforms on local communities. It is also reflective of the shallowness of the governments commitment to consultation that local government had an enormous battle just to gain representation on the intergovernmental working parties set up to progress a mechanism to implement the Hilmer initiatives.I note the belated announcement a couple of weeks ago by the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), in response to coalition pressure, that he will seek a parliamentary inquiry into how community service obligations can best be continued under the Hilmer regime. This is a sign that the government is starting to listen to the concerns of local, particularly rural, communities concerns on how the benefits of national competition reforms can most fairly be distributed.The government would have been better advised to have consulted with local government much earlier about the Hilmer reforms and this could have allayed some of the anxiety felt in local communities, particularly in rural communities. With this background of official neglect, councils could be forgiven for being more than a little cynical about the governments wish that the accord establish common ground between the Commonwealth and local government on competition policy.One of the difficulties faced by the coalition in considering its approach to this legislation is the complete lack of any explanation provided by the government on the rationale for many of its provisions. The whole question of federal funding for local government was addressed in two recent reports by the Australian Urban and Regional Development Review, namely, Financing local government and local government funding methodologies . These reports made a whole series of recommendations, some of which have apparently been adopted by the government; many of which have not. This is of more than academic interest.At a local government ministers conference last year, the Minister for Housing and Regional Development was advocating arrangements to encourage and improve local council efficiency which were very different from the damp squib presented here today. These recommendations float out of the first of the reports I have just mentioned. However, the minister was comprehensively rolled by the states and local government on these proposals. They have since vanished without a trace and without any public explanation by the minister of why.The government has had before it for more than 18 months now the findings of a House of Representatives standing committee on road funding, to which it has still not provided an official response. This report entitled Driving the road dollar further was prepared by the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. The report made a number of recommendations about federal untied local road funding, most of which have not been incorporated by the government in this bill.I understand that primary responsibility for tabling the governments response rests with the Minister for Transport. The coalition is also concerned at the apparently fragmented nature of the governments local government assistance programs. We commend the government for incorporating a number of these disparate programs into the local government development program but the cost has apparently been a substantial increase in staffing levels in the Office of Local Government.Scarce local government resources should be devoted to providing services at local level, not expanding the Commonwealth bureaucracy. Some local government associations have expressed the view that this represents a further attempt by the government to extend its control over the activities of local government. The coalition finds it difficult to disagree with this assessment. We also have concerns about the local government development program which, as it is funded under a one-line entry in Appropriation Bill (No. 1), is administered with very little parliamentary supervision.It is not clear why the funding for and administration of this program would not be more effectively dealt with in the local government financial assistance legislation. This is a matter the coalition intends to pursue. The opposition will support the passage of this bill and the amendment which has been circulated by the government.","N/A","LOCAL GOVERNMENT (FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
416,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BELL","7U4","(Tasmania)","AD","N/A",2064,"—The Australian Democrats also support the passage of the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Bill 1995 and the amendment which has been proposed by the government. We are aware of some of the matters that Senator Tambling has raised tonight that the Australian Local Government Association and individual local governments have been concerned about some aspects of this proposed legislation. There was concern about the omission of a consultative process. As we understand it, a number of amendments were proposed during the negotiation process, and the Minister has accepted some of those suggestions which, as Senator Tambling says, have gone some way to alleviating those concerns, especially the parts which require consultation with local government and the states in preparation of the report that the minister is required to present to parliament.Quite rightly, Senator Tambling revealed that the governments own amendment is a recognition of the reality of the numbers in this place—numbers which now require that parliamentary scrutiny be considerably more thorough than what had originally been planned. Having agreed with Senator Tambling on a number of matters, I would like to refer to some other matters that he raised in his address tonight. I picked up one mention of the worsening of road conditions in Western Australia and the declining standards of community service. It surprised me to hear that tonight, when yesterday the coalition was unable to see, as the Australian Local Government Association had been able to see, that this bill was a direct threat to local governments capacity to deliver in these areas—areas of community service and the maintenance and provision of roads.I mention this briefly in passing because I rehearsed this completely yesterday. For the sake of those who did not participate in the debate yesterday and who were glorious in their absence, I will repeat it. One example which immediately comes to mind is the concept of a preferred local supplier to local government—a concept with which I am sure my Tasmanian colleague Senator Calvert would be familiar. That concept can be deemed anti-competitive under the new legislation which the coalition supported. Such a policy, which in many communities has enabled the survival of local contractors, would now no longer be possible.Once local contractors have disappeared, councils will be at the mercy of larger enterprises, with their larger overheads and reduced capacity to meet the sorts of needs typical in local councils—needs which require immediate attention or emergencies to be met and which arise particularly in local areas. If a protective rail around a remote hillside has been subject to an accident, you will need a local contractor to prepare it overnight or during the weekend. With the disappearance of favoured local contractors, imagine the plight of local government in not being able to get a flexible, immediate and properly costed response from the larger enterprises which will remain. Therefore, services will decline and Australias rural communities will suffer and decline. These are the very communities which the coalition would purport to support.While making these sorts of points yesterday, I was astounded to see the lack of speakers from the opposition. Now we hear Senator Tambling speaking of Hilmer, but yesterday he supported the whole package without a squeak. To hear him speak tonight in support of the Australian Local Government Association makes a mockery of its direct approach to the coalition, an approach which was ignored in yesterdays debate.But that is another matter. I did want to reiterate it. I do not want to delay the passage of this legislation, because we support it. More particularly, we support it now that it will be accompanied by the amendment which the Local Government Association requested, anyway. With that amendment, and foreshadowing that the Democrats are favourably entertained by the amendments which are being circulated by Senator Margetts which we believe will make this even more equitable, we will support the legislation.","N/A","LOCAL GOVERNMENT (FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
417,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator PANIZZA","JI4","(Western Australia)","LP","N/A",2064,"—I rise to take part in this debate tonight with some pleasure because of the 13 years that I spent in local government. Many senators on this side of the chamber have spent time in local government. Basically, the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Bill replaces the previous arrangement that we had for 10-odd years which was passed in 1986 to provide financial assistance to local government, generally known in the trade as FAGs.Finance was distributed under two categories: one was by way of a general purpose grant on a per capita basis. That was on a fully horizontal equalisation basis; that is, to give everyone the same sort of standard of service right around Australia. The other category was by way of identifying local road grants. These were distributed around the country according to a historical formula based on their relative road needs.Until 1990-91, road grants were tied to roads. Then, from 1991-92, they were untied, although they were expected to be spent on roads. Some local councils then treated that sort of assistance rather differently. But I am happy to say that in my state of Western Australia, country shires, especially, did keep spending it on roads. If any blame could be attributed to some country shires, it would be that they spent too much on roads, but there is nothing wrong with that.This bill gives a total amount of financial assistance of $1.165 billion, made up of $807 million in general purpose grants and $358 million for local roads, identified but not tied. I have said plenty of times in this place that I believe grants for roads should still be tied but that is quite an area of debate in my party room, let alone in this place.At this hour of the night I would like to concentrate on putting on record the fears of the Western Australian Municipal Association with regard to this legislation. They said in a letter to me that they welcomed the bill and acknowledged the extent of consultations that had occurred with local government during the drafting. They continued:Regrettably, however, the Bill is seriously flawed in a number of respects. It fails to implement various agreements reached at conferences of Local Government Ministers held in October 1994 and this April, and contains provisions which are inconsistent with a system of untied, general purpose grants.I will read into the record the objects of the new legislation. They are: improving the financial capacity of local councils; improving the capacity of local governments to provide their residents with an equitable level of services; improving the certainty of funding of local councils; improving the efficiency and effectiveness of local councils; improving the provision by local councils of services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders—and I will come back to that a bit later; improving the transparency and accountability of the states in the allocation of FAGs to councils; and promoting consistency in the methods by which grants are allocated.Those are very nice words indeed. But does that occur in practice? After all, a lot of agreements that were reached at the ministerial council have not been translated into legislation.The Western Australian Municipal Association said that the following sections of the bill cause grave concern: the procedure to establish national principle guidelines to guide the allocation of grants amongst councils; annual reports to parliament, which does not sit too well with the WA Municipal Association; and the intended objects of the legislation.In principle, local government ministers, both state and federal, agreed at the conference that I spoke of last year that the principle should be formulation in consultation with state ministers and the Australian Local Government Association to take the form of a disallowable instrument. The bill failed to get anywhere near this agreement. I could find nothing in the bill on consultation with the ALGA and, on my reading of the bill, the minister can simply formulate, revoke, or vary principles in writing. In other words, it is up to what the minister thinks. There is no requirement for consultation at all when the minister revokes or varies a principle.So the basis around which they reached agreement has fallen far short. The idea is that the federal minister can set the principles for local governments in faraway states. Although groups of local governments in a regional situation are able to sort out the allocation of grants amongst themselves, the minister is able to come in with his overriding principles.In this case I can see another Ros Kelly whiteboard situation. A minister at this distance setting principles for my state of Western Australia does not sit well with me. The minister may have great objectives of his own that may work in the more populous states, cities or whatever but at that distance—and I do not think many on this side of the chamber or on that side of the chamber will argue with me—it should not be up to a federal minister to have such powers.The requirement to report to parliament at a federal level seems far out of kilter with what should occur. The ALGA and the states took the view that reporting on the performance of councils should be to the local government ministers conference—in other words, the ministerial council of local government and not to parliament. I have no problem with that. As yet there has been no agreement on the form which such reports should take and the issue was to have been the subject of further investigation by officials and advice to ministers next year. As WAMA, the Western Australian Municipal Association, says, the provisions of the bill are therefore at best premature.Under these guiding principles, local government will have to adhere to the spending of ATSIC councils and communities. The association does not disassociate itself from the need to improve the situation with ATSIC communities. They reached that agreement last April, according to the Western Australia Municipal Association.They believe there is simply no reason why that should be addressed in the bill. After all, ATSIC communities are the same as any other community. As disadvantaged as they may be, there are other disadvantaged communities in Australia as well. ATSIC communities believe that should not be part of the bill. Once we set a precedent that it is part of the bill, other disadvantaged groups may believe they have the same need and in no time we will have four or five more disadvantaged groups. The same can be said for remote rural communities, so it is not only Aboriginal communities that are in this situation.I return to the issue of general purpose grants. They are untied. That is the principle behind them. Why all of a sudden has the government brought in a bill which will direct, in relation to ATSIC communities, local councils to do so much beyond what they normally do for everyone else? If the government thinks it needs to allocate further funds to overcome its problems—in this case it may be to do with the supply of roads, sewerage, water and maybe electricity in certain remote areas where communities believe they meet the special need clause—why can the government not make a special allocation perhaps via local government? Local government is the most efficient government that can handle finance. By all means it should do so, but why try to direct an untied general purpose grant in any particular direction?The government did exactly that. We have not dealt with the relevant legislation, which relates to the diesel fuel levy being imposed on remote communities which generate their own electricity. The government has done just that and made a special allocation to Aboriginal communities that will be hard hit by having to now pay the diesel fuel levy in generating their own power. The government could quite easily have done that. After all, only a very small part of what is allocated to councils by way of general purpose grants is to go towards those communities. If we want to make a marked change in any community, I believe there has to be a special purpose grant rather than a general purpose grant, which is untied.Those are the main concerns of the Western Australian Municipal Association regarding this bill. I believe a couple of amendments are floating around in relation to them. Before I close, in a general context I point out again the decreasing amount of funds going to local government. With the ever increasing revenue this government is collecting, in real terms less and less seems to go to local government. That is all I have to say in relation to the concerns of the Western Australian Municipal Association. I will be happy to listen to what my colleagues have to say. I listened to the shadow minister for local government speak. I will listen with interest to the shadow minister for regional development and infrastructure, who will be speaking next.","N/A","LOCAL GOVERNMENT (FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
418,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator IAN MACDONALD","YW4","(Queensland)","LP","N/A",2067,"—I hope that in the brief contribution I want to make to this Local Government (Financial Assistance) Bill 1995 I can give a Queensland focus to it as my colleague Senator Panizza has given a Western Australia focus. I also want to briefly mention the importance of local government to the regional development of our nation. As Senator Tambling, who led this debate for us, indicated, local government is the sphere of government that is absolutely closest to the people. It is the most democratic form of government and one that really represents to the minutest degree the wishes of the constituents it serves.The coalition has always been very committed to local government. I suppose one does not have to look further than the people taking part in this debate. Senator Tambling, who led the debate, was for many years an elected member of the Darwin City Council, which is the local authority looking after Darwin. My friend and colleague Senator Panizza, who preceded me, was for many years the shire president of a council in Western Australia. Senator Calvert, who is to follow me, was for many years the warden of the Clarence council in Tasmania.In this coming election, a number of our candidates are currently serving councillors. Their credentials are in local authority. They have been elected and have a real community understanding. Les Glover is our candidate for Franklin. He is currently the deputy mayor of the Clarence shire council in Tasmania, which is Senator Calverts old council. Certainly Les Glover, the deputy mayor and our candidate in Franklin, will be an excellent representative for his part of Tasmania when he joins the House of Representatives, as he surely will, as the next member for Franklin. I know that Joanna Gash, our candidate for Gilmore, is currently a serving member of a council in the electorate of Gilmore. She is another person who is well respected in her community. She has the support and trust of her community from the work that she has already done there. The coalition has always had a very great commitment to local government in Australia.Labor has used local government in a fairly crass political way. I remember before the last federal election when I was the shadow minister for local government that the Labor Party made a lot of political capital about the fact that it had a minister for local government. I used to appear with Mr Simmons. He is a lovely fellow; it is a pity he is not hanging around with the Labor Party. As with most of the good Labor Party people, he has seen the writing on the wall and he is getting out. He has given it away. He knows that the Labor Party of today is made up of right-wing thugs from New South Wales. He wants to get out. Mr Simmons is a good man.Everywhere we used to go, he would ask whether the coalition was going to have a minister for local government next time. I would say yes, that of course we would. He would say that the Labor Party would have a separate ministry for local government. What happened? No sooner was the election over than local government disappeared from the ministry line-up in the Labor Party.The department that Mr Simmons used to head—the ministry of local government—disappeared. It was not even mentioned. It became a very minor office within the mega-department of housing and regional development and a multitude of other things. It was taken over by the then Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Howe, who has also retired. He has seen the writing on the wall. Mr Howe, a fairly genuine sort of fellow in his own area, has no interest in local government. He never knew local government, never really understood it and never had much commitment to it.It was interesting that this great commitment that the Labor Party had to making local government a separate ministry before the election, like its l-a-w tax promises, just disappeared after the election.","N/A","LOCAL GOVERNMENT (FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

425,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator FORSHAW",656,"(New South Wales)","ALP","N/A",2068,"—Last night in the adjournment debate Senator Tierney launched an attack upon my friend and colleague Senator Carr over Senator Carrs role on Senate committees. Senator Carr is big enough to look after himself, but tonight I want to respond to some of the remarks made by Senator Tierney last night, particularly his comments about the conduct of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, of which Senator Tierney is the chairperson of the references committee. I want to bring to the attention of the Senate the lack of responsibility and the lack of objectivity adopted by Senator Tierney, in particular, in his role as chairman of that committee and also by other members of the opposition.In his speech last night in the adjournment debate Senator Tierney referred to some proceedings of the committee that took place in Tweed Heads and in Campbelltown, New South Wales, on 3 and 4 May. At the hearing of the committee in Tweed Heads on 3 May there were three senators present: namely, Senator Tierney, Senator Troeth and me. During the day we received advice that unfortunately Senator Denman, who was originally going to attend the hearing scheduled for the following day, could no longer attend the hearing and that as a consequence of her absence there would be a lack of a quorum for that hearing the following day.The committee met in a private session. I still have some doubts about the efficacy of that, given the way the meeting was called, at such short notice and without advice to any other members of the committee, but anyway a private meeting was held. At the private meeting a proposal was put forward to establish a subcommittee comprising Senator Tierney, Senator Troeth and me. I objected rather strongly to this proposal. I particularly objected to being included in the resolution as a member of a subcommittee when I was not available to attend the hearing the following day, and when that was well known to the members of the committee.I pointed out that subcommittees should be appointed in a proper manner and clearly should not comprise senators who are not able to attend hearings. After all, the purpose of a subcommittee is to enable the committee to function with a smaller number of members and certainly where those members of that subcommittee are able to attend. In any event, this proposal was railroaded through despite my objections and I was actually included as a member of this subcommittee in the full knowledge of the other members of the committee, Senator Tierney and Senator Troeth, that I would not be able to attend the hearing the next day and that only two senators would be present, both opposition senators.The hearing went ahead the next day with Senator Tierney and Senator Troeth in attendance. Subsequently on 9 May a meeting of the full committee, its normal weekly meeting during sitting weeks, was held here in the House. The minutes of that meeting in Tweed Heads were presented. I pointed out that my objections to the subcommittee that I had earlier raised had not been incorporated into the minutes. There was much discussion at that meeting, which I will not go into, except to say that as the discussion ebbed back and forth recollections of Senator Tierney and Senator Troeth as to what had actually occurred at that meeting changed.The actions adopted by Senator Tierney on that day in Tweed Heads were most provocative. They were completely contrary to the concept of procedural fairness and to the proper functioning of committees and subcommittees. It was nothing more than the brutal use of numbers to establish a subcommittee in the full knowledge that only opposition senators would be in attendance when that subcommittee met. It was done without the knowledge of other members of the committee and no notice was given to any member of the committee that the meeting would be called.I was quite content to leave this matter rest with the committee because it did occupy some time in discussion. But last night Senator Tierney came along here and waxed lyrical, professing pious indignation over Senator Carrs membership of that committee and his non-attendance at a particular hearing in Melbourne. I point out that at an estimates hearing of the same committee on 26 May, here in this building, Senator Tierney and Senator Troeth walked out of the meeting and deprived it of a quorum. The minister was in attendance, government members of the committee were in attendance, and an array of departmental officers were in attendance but Senator Tierney and Senator Troeth walked out, depriving the committee of a quorum. Then Senator Tierney comes into this chamber and complains about people not attending committee hearings.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/debate.sub1[1]/debate.sub2/speech/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

427,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator FORSHAW",656,"(New South Wales)","ALP","N/A",2068,"—I also point out—Senator Bell would well remember this—that, when this same committee visited the Aboriginal settlement at Yuendumu in the Northern Territory last year, not one opposition member of the committee bothered to attend that hearing. That committee hearing was held to look at the issues of education for Aboriginal people and the availability of open learning. The visit occurred in the very same week as the then Leader of the Opposition, Alexander Downer, was lecturing the government and the country about Aboriginal education. Yet when there was a specific meeting of the committee to look at the same issue, the opposition members of the committee could not be bothered to attend.I raise another matter. Last Friday, a private visit by the Senate Select committee on Aircraft Noise in Sydney took place. During those proceedings—of which there was no Hansard record because it was a private visit—there were two occasions when the chairman allowed the media to take over the proceedings. We had a resident outside his house in Kurnell answering questions from the media on television. This was supposed to be a visit by the committee to look at the issue of aircraft noise—a very important issue for the residents of Kurnell and a matter I have particularly taken up in representations to the minister.The chairman of that committee, Senator Parer, should have conducted those proceedings properly. He should not have allowed them to be taken over by the media and turned into nothing more than a political stunt whereby the opposition candidate for the seat of Cook, Stephen Mutch, spent most of his time standing in front of the camera endeavouring to ensure that he got on TV. It may have suited the oppositions purpose but it clearly meant that the committees function in visiting the residents houses and talking to those residents became a bit of a farce. So before we get these hypocritical tirades from the opposition, it should have a good look at its performance on committees.The government is prepared to cooperate with the proper functioning of committees. We are prepared to do that recognising the clear disadvantage the government has because it has fewer senators available to serve on committees than the opposition.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/debate.sub1[1]/debate.sub2/speech/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

430,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CALVERT","5F4","(Tasmania)","LP","N/A",2070,"—As chairman of the coalitions waste watch committee, tonight I wish to highlight yet another area of government waste: ministerial consultants. What does this government spend on consultants in general, specifically ministerial consultants—that is, those appointed by ministers for which, for the public, there is little or no accountability of the work they do?We know the government has just appointed half a million dollars worth of new ministerial staff, at the same time reducing the budget in the Senate by $1.6 million. We know all that, but that is another story. Tonight I wish to highlight one member of this special class of ministerial consultants, which my waste watch committee has been tracking over the last couple of years.Brian Courtice represents another classic case of waste by this Labor government for its own political ends. Brian Courtice was elected to the House of Representatives in 1987 and 1990 as the federal member for the Central Queensland seat of Hinkler, one of the most marginal in Australia. At the March 1993 election, Mr Courtice was defeated by the National Partys Paul Neville. After the poll was declared, the former canefarmer and failed politician was out looking for a job. He did not have far to go to find one.He turned to the then Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development, the member for Maribyrnong, Mr Griffiths, for a job. On 24 May 1993, Brian Courtice commenced work as a consultant to the minister on regional development issues. His initial term was to 23 September 1993. However, it was soon extended to take him through to 23 August 1995. Mr Courtice received an annual salary of $73,360, or over $1,400 a week, which at the time was more than a backbenchers salary.As we all know, the member for Maribyrnongs ministerial career was cut short by the embarrassing sandwich shop affair when he resigned in December 1993. So valued was Mr Courtices advice that the new minister, Senator Cook, did not take on Mr Courtice, and his consultancy on regional development was ceased a month or so later on 21 January 1994. However, during his eight months with former Minister Griffiths, Brian Courtice managed to clock up travel allowance worth $16,773.30, air fares totalling $23,472 and extras including taxi fares and mobile phone charges totalling $2,685. If we annualise Mr Courtices salary and expenses over a 12-month period, we see that his consultancy would have cost the Australian taxpayer around $137,000.Despite his highly paid advice, Senate estimates also revealed that Mr Courtice had little or nothing to do with two major investigations into regional development, even though he was supposedly a highly prized consultant for that area. He had little or no input to both the Industry Commissions inquiry into impediments to regional industry adjustment or the governments own Kelty task force inquiry and report on regional development, headed by ACTU Secretary, Bill Kelty. Quite extraordinary when you consider he was the ministers regional development expert.After being dumped by the disgraced Griffiths, Brian Courtice did not have to wait long to pick up another ministerial job. On 21 February 1994, Mr Courtice commenced work with his old Queensland Labor mate, the Minister for Resources, Mr Beddall. Literally overnight, Mr Courtice went from being an expert on regional development to being an expert on resource issues. Mr Courtice was initially employed from 21 February 1994 to August 1995. However, it, too, was later extended to 7 February 1996, taking his term out to about a month or so before the latest possible federal election date.His salary was listed at $73,360 per annum, which has now risen to $74,460. Examination of his travel records show that Mr Courtice spends a lot of his time outside parliamentary sittings back in Bundaberg and, presumably, unsupervised. How does Mr Courtice spend his time? Roaming the electorate of Hinkler of course, playing the ALP candidate—attending functions, turning up to meetings, being photographed with other visiting ministers who have nothing to do with his portfolio duties, yet we were told in Senate estimates that the position is considered the equivalent of a full-time posting. Interestingly, Mr Courtice continues to be based in his home town of Bundaberg, but his minister is in Brisbane.To help him get around his important functions, the Commonwealth has also provided him with his own personal car also based in Bundaberg. In fact it was granted from 5 March 1994. Nothing less than a Falcon GLI. Car costs, up to mid-June 1995, have so far amounted to $9,233.81.Senate estimates have also revealed that since starting with Minister Beddall, Mr Courtice has rung up the following expenses with his new minister, up to 16 June this year: travel allowance worth $20,027 and airfares worth $32,500. So over the last 16 months with Minister Beddall, Brian Courtices salary and expenses have cost the taxpayers of Australia around $161,042. If we project Mr Courtices salary and expenses through to the end of his term with Mr Beddall, 7 February next year—a total of 23 months—we find that his consultancy will conceivably cost taxpayers around $231,498—almost a quarter of a million dollars.Senate estimates also revealed that between March and August 1994, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy supplied Mr Courtice with a mobile phone, faxstream access, semi-official telephone, modem line, laser printer, computer and modem—that is not bad for a self-confessed non-typist—and a very handy taxpayer funded campaign office.On 24 October 1994, ALP nominations for the seat of Hinkler closed. It was no surprise that our consultant Mr Courtice was preselected unopposed. From that date—some eight months ago—Mr Courtice was the official ALP candidate for Hinkler, though one could say that he had spent much of the previous 18 months masquerading as one.Since then we have seen Mr Courtice quoted in the Hinkler media—newspapers, radio and television—commenting on everything from road funding, water, employment, local industry, youth, university places, the budget, the drought, the environment and, most particularly, attacking the coalition and the local member. But then Mr Courtice may have been too busy being a candidate rather than a consultant.The worse three embarrassments around this place in recent times have been the miners rally, the timber demonstration and the pig producers protest. They have all affected resources and the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. It invites the question: what sort of advice was Mr Beddall receiving from his highly paid consultants? Was it that Mr Courtice was too busy being a candidate and not a consultant?In conclusion, let us look at the total projected cost of Brian Courtices career as a ministerial consultant. Between when he first started with Mr Griffiths on 24 May 1993 and the end of his proposed term with Minister Beddall on 7 February next year—a period of some two years and eight months—Mr Courtice will have milked the public purse for around $323,335 in salary expenses. That does not include the car, the mobile phone, the computer, the fax and the other perks, provided by the Commonwealth.This is quite extraordinary when you consider Mr Courtices own rhetoric. As a member of the parliament, Mr Courtice was scathing of the federal coalition and the Queensland National Party and on many occasions accused them and others in the rural community, including industry leaders, of jobs for the boys, cronyism and the rorting of public funds. It seems Mr Courtice has failed his own test—or is it that there is one rule for the Labor Party and another rule for everyone else when it comes to accountability of government.Like the Kevin Rudd affair, which recently embarrassed the Queensland Goss government, this sort of misuse of public money appears to be rife in the ALP at all levels. Such over-indulgence of this Keating government in ministerial consultants is a terrible and blatant waste of taxpayers money.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
431,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator WOODLEY","HX5","(Queensland)","AD","N/A",2072,"—The pork producers came to Canberra today to voice their concerns. The Australian Democrats welcome them and say, `Good on you. One of their purposes was to urge the government to move on stronger origin labelling laws, and they were totally right in doing so. This government has gone weak at the knees on labelling. Australians want to buy Australian. City and country people are strongly united on this. We all know of the quality of Australian produce and recognise the improvements that producers have worked for in the last few years.As consumers, we are prepared to pay extra for an Australian produced product when we know that the higher costs are due to droughts and the like. But Australian consumers need the chance to give Australian producers a fair go. They need proper, honest and clear labelling of Australian produce. The Democrats have supported toughening of the labelling regulations for a long time. We trialled our own proposal in South Australia in the Foodland stores and we discovered that, when Australians know clearly what Australian products are, they will buy them. We proposed a four-tiered labelling program—A, B, C and D—in which A represented totally Australian products and D represented totally imported products.We distribute—Senator Bell is probably almost a champion in this area—a booklet that lists products and brands that are made in Australia to help make up for this inadequacy of labelling. We are ready right now to change the laws on labelling. The Democrats fully support what the pork producers were asking for today and have been pro-active in working to change not only Australias origin labelling laws but also GATT related trade laws.The time has come for leadership on this issue. I wish it was not the case, but the coalition and the government have deserted primary producers on this one. When they had the opportunity to vote for amendments to the World Trade Organisation legislation that would have improved the situation, they refused to even listen to the arguments put to them.The Democrats pushed for a Senate inquiry to define how adversely affected producers would be compensated. We explained to them that, if they wanted to have a level playing field, it would have to be a commonsense level playing field. The playing field would have to take into account that some of the worlds major trading nations were, and still are, not prepared to remove some of their own subsidies. In some cases they are not prepared to remove any of them. Other nations would have extremely long phase-in periods for subsidy reduction programs. But I am afraid that rational argument could not persuade those who were set on implementing an ideological agenda. Unfortunately, Australian farmers were chosen as the lambs for slaughter. Australia was to be one of the first nations to pass legislation allowing GATT to come into force. Both the coalition and Labor voted in favour of that unamended legislation.I might just digress to reassure you of that. I recently heard of a parliamentarian who attempted to make out that the level playing field was created by a treaty that they and their party had no real chance to vote upon. This parliamentarian is a member of a party that, along with the Democrats, is opposed to the ridiculous and undemocratic process of allowing signatures on a range of international treaties without any parliamentary scrutiny.However, let me make it clear that the World Trade Organisation legislation was just that—legislation. It was not a treaty. In the House of Representatives and in the Senate, all the major parties voted for the World Trade Organisation legislation. The problem was that National, Labor and Liberal parties passed this legislation and ignored the amendments that were put up to make it more realistic. They rejected the claims the Democrats made about how some primary producers would be affected by bringing GATT in too soon. Now the people who are being forced to suffer the consequences of this legislation, the very people who worked so hard to improve this countrys balance of payments, are coming to Canberra to haunt those parliamentarians who voted for the unamended GATT legislation. It is difficult for us not to say to those parliamentarians, `I told you so.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/debate.sub1[3]/speech/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

Why are the coalition and the government blindly following this policy? I do not know why. I would like to know why. It simply does not make any sense.Like the pork producers, the Democrats can see the argument for levelling off the playing field, for reducing subsidies when we are trading with countries that are also reducing theirs. But it is simply farcical and plain stupid to allow subsidised overseas products unnaturally to force down the price of Australian products in our home market. I urge pork producers to join the Democrats and keep on asking why the coalition and government are doing this. The Democrats will continue working to ensure that governments take into account the real situation of Australian people to implement commonsense laws and to ensure a fair go for all.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/debate.sub1[3]/speech/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
434,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MICHAEL BAUME","LE4","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A",2073,"—I must say I am intrigued to hear Senator Woodley in this new role. I was particularly intrigued to see the ABC news tonight when, despite the fact that there was a great gathering of coalition members and senators at the pig rally outside—and I must say I wore an appropriate tie for the occasion—the only politician shown on the ABC news attending that rally was someone called Senator Woodley, that well-known rural expert. This was despite the fact that, as I said, there was a whole host of Liberal and National Party members and senators there. I must say I did not see any government members and senators there at the time, but no doubt they had other business to attend to rather than to spend their time talking to pig farmers.I would have thought that what the Leader of the National Party of Australia, Mr Tim Fischer, had to say at that rally would have been of slightly more substance than the meanderings of Senator Woodley, at least judging by tonights speech. Still, that is a journalistic judgment that the ABC has made, and I trust it is of the same high standard of so many of its journalistic judgments.However, I met a friend of mine at that rally who is a chicken producer. He pointed out to me that there are problems affecting that industry as well as the pork industry, relating to threatened changes and problems relating to quarantine matters, particularly the question of whether or not imports of cooked chicken meat should be allowed. Senator Crane pointed out today that there is a change proposed in the protocol relating to the freezing of pork imports, which the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Bob Collins, did not know anything about, which naturally concerned pig producers and certainly Senator Crane.The point made to me by my chicken producing friend was that, if we allow in cooked chicken meat from some Asian countries, we run a series of real risks because the residues of chemicals and other types of material left in the chicken, even after they are cooked, may well, in the view of some experts, create a risk. He gave me a little dodger which says:It doesnt make sense to allow imports of cooked chicken meat into Australia from countries such as Thailand where health officials dont even know the full extent and status of dangerous diseases such as Salmonella enteriditis in poultry flocks.It doesnt make sense to import foodstuffs from countries where therapeutic drugs which are banned in Australia for public health reasons have been used in the growing process.It doesnt make sense for the National Food Authority to class cooked chicken meat imports as high risk and then for the Government to allow such products into the country.Public Health is a key issue in the opposition of Australias chicken growers to the lifting of bans on imported cooked chicken meat.If its a choice between international trade agreements such as GATT and protecting the Public Health of Australians—then there is no choice at all. The bans on imports must stay.I am no expert in this matter. I have no knowledge of the technical matters involved. All I want to relate here tonight is the fact that this is an industry which is expressing the same sorts of concerns relating to health matters as the pig industry expressed today.I now deal with another matter altogether. That relates to the Election funding and financial disclosure report for election 1993, details of which were presented to the Senate this week. We did not get the opportunity to deal with it. I am particularly interested in the return of electoral expenditure which is by third parties—in other words, someone taking part in the election campaign if expenditure of more than $200 is incurred while not in fact being one of the political parties or a candidate.It is without the written authority of a registered political party, a state branch of a political party, a candidate or a member of a group. This is expenditure by people like trade unions, for example, who took such an enormous role in the last election—putting in their own advertisements, pushing their own barrow which, of course, came back full of sandwiches after the election when the ACTU, having bought the right to dictate to this government, received the benefits from this government.This return includes broadcasting of an advertisement relating to the election; publishing in a journal of an advertisement; display at a theatre; production costs of advertisements broadcast, published or displayed; consultants or advertising agents fees in respect of services; or carrying out an opinion poll or other research in relation to the election.What intrigued me significantly—apart from such quaint matters as the Eros Association spending $10,000 on somebodys behalf; I am not quite certain what that was all about—is that the ACTU and ACTU Future Strategies, according to this document, spent $600,000 as a third party on electoral advertising. It was not for the Liberal Party. It was not for the National Party. That was all for the Labor Party, in addition to whatever donations it made.It the interesting to see that the ACTU did not give any donations—you will be shocked to know this—to the Liberal and National parties. But it did give a $10,000 donation to the Australian Democrats.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT Pork Industry","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/debate.sub1/debate.sub2/speech/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

I am not suggesting that there should be any link between donations to the Labor Party and that kind of association. But it is interesting, particularly when we see that Australis Media Pty Ltd spent $148,366.20 on electoral expenditure—certainly not on behalf of the Liberal Party—at the 1993 election. Of that amount, $135,000 was in publishing and $12,500-odd was for research.These matters might be of some interest to many people. Perhaps there are some who would say, `Well, we oppose this kind of revelation. They may ask why I am revealing it. I want to dramatise how serious the consequences are for many people of the exposure of this kind of information.If we look through this document, we get a clear view of the enormous contribution that the Maritime Union and the union movement overall make to the Labor Party. This is done not by giving donations to the Labor Party but by advertising on its own behalf. The list of these parties includes the Maritime Union, $40,000-odd; the Public Sector Union, $16,000; the Public Service Association, $16,000-odd; the Queensland Teachers Union, $17,000-odd—and the list goes on and on. There is also the Victorian Trades Council, $33,000; the United Trades and Labour Council of South Australia, $112,000; the Trades and Labour Council of Queensland, $152,000. This is on top of donations to political parties.This is the activist involved role of people who appear, one way or another, to have been able to influence this government, too. It is quite reasonable for people to contribute to political parties; I have no objection to that. All I am saying is that there is the fear that in many of these instances there might be an expectation, particularly when it is in connection with the Labor movement itself, the industrial wing of the Labor movement. I would think in many unions the bulk of the members are not Labor Party members or supporters.The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator McGauran) —I call Senator Wheelwright.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT Pork Industry","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/debate.sub1/debate.sub2/speech/talk.start[4]/para","N/A","N/A"

465,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Senator Robert Ray","UI4","TAS","ALP","N/A",2077,"—The answer to the honourable senators question is as follows:(1) No. The information relating to RAAF VIP flights is tabled in Parliament every six months. Details relating to VIP flights by the Prime Minister and his staff after I March 1995 will beincluded in the Schedule of Special Purpose Flights tabled in Parliament in December 1995, after all records have been recorded.(2)(a) No.(b) Yes. A Falcon 900 aircraft from Canberra to Melbourne on 31 March 1995.(c) Yes. A Falcon 900 aircraft from Avalon to Canberra on 4 June 1995.(3) The Prime Minister was attending functions which were significantly closer to Laverton and Avalon airfields than either Essendon or Tullamarine.(4) Yes. See answer to question 3.(5) Laverton airfield, located at RAAF Base Williams, is no longer maintained at full operational readiness. Occasional RAAF flights to Laverton are made following local inspection of the airfield and its facilities. Point Cook airfield has the same state of readiness as Laverton and could be used under the same conditions. However, the short runway makes this option unlikely. Avalon airfield is a privately owned, fully-operational airfield used for airline training and regular passenger services. It is suitable for military and civil operations.(6)(a) While in-flight changes to VIP flights are not a routine occurrence, they do occur and can be accommodated by aircrew, providing appropriate authority for the change is obtained.(b) Yes.(7) Diversions to alternative airfields, for reasons including changing weather conditions, equipment malfunctions, illness or other authorised reasons, are a normal feature of flying operations for RAAF aircrew and air traffic controllers. There is no safety risk involved, providing the aircraft captain is aware of the conditions at the new location. Some extra workload for the aircrew may occur, but this is not a safety risk.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
