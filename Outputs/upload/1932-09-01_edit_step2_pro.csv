The national income had fallen from £650,000,000 to £450,000,000. Oversea loans to the States and the Commonwealth which during the ten years ended 30th June, 1930, amounted to £216,000,000, or an average of £21,600,000 per annum, had been abruptly cut off. The combined deficits of the Commonwealth and the six State Governments for the year 1930-31 amounted to the huge sum of £27,202,000, and it appeared as if that amountwas likely to be increased to the colossal total of £40,000,000 for the financial year upon which Australia was about to enter.It was therefore abundantly evident that unless drastic steps had been taken immediately, Australia must have met with disaster. Had a policy of inaction been followed there is no doubt that this country would have been plunged into a condition of financial chaos, involving all our people in loss the magnitude of which no one could compute, from which recovery would be long delayed, and only effected after the most bitter suffering.This question is very fully dealt with in the committees report, and my Government concurs in the views that are expressed. It, however, very strongly holds the view that the rate of exchange should not be a matter controlled by governments, nor should governments be entitled to dictate to those who are controlling the exchange what the rate should be. Were such a position allowed to grow up, the exchange would be governed by political and not by economic considerations, and the result would inevitably be disaster to the country. The Government agrees with the committees report that the exchange rate should bc controlled by the Commonwealth Bank, which is now, in fact, the central reserve bank of Australia. In controlling the exchange, the bank should be, in the words of the committees report,  free from both the fact and the four of political control .In exercising that control, however, it . is necessary for the bank to take into account economic conditions. The present world crisis, and the chaos into which price levels and exchanges have fallen, have placed upon the shoulders of central banks new and difficult obligations.No longer can exchanges be determined by the relatively simple and well-defined principles which operated when the currencies of the nations were based upon gold. Many new and complex problems have arisen involving the relation of exchanges to the economic circumstances of countries and the level of costs and prices. These difficult questions are being faced the world over by central banks, and have to be faced by the central bank in Australia.By the manner in which the board of the Commonwealth Bank has discharged the onerous and difficult duties that have rested upon their shoulders during recent years, they have earned the trust of the people. The nation will look to them with confidence to carry out in the best interests of every section of the community the grave responsibility of determining the level at which the exchange rate should from time to time be fixed.","In Committee of Supply:","BUDGET, 1932-33","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[1]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I wish to supplement his remarks in that connexion, and to lay certain papers on the table. Honorable members will recollect that primage duties were imposed originally by the previous Government with the approval, to some extent, of honorable members who were at that time sitting in opposition, purely for the purpose of obtaining revenue to assist in balancing the budget and maintaining the services of government. The revenue from these duties has become very substantial, the total in 1930-31 being £3,657,426.Considerable agitation has occurred from time to time for the exemption of certain goods from primage duty, but it can be readily understood that in the face of the difficult task of balancing the budget for this year the Government could not agree to any action which would seriously jeopardize the revenue from this source.The Government has on various occasions taken action to ease the burden of the primage duties in certain directions. For instance, at the first opportunity after assuming office it exempted draught horses, cattle, sheep and pigs, for stud purposes, from primage duty by proclamation.","N/A","PRIMAGE DUTIES AND IMPORT PROHIBITIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Many other minor concessions were also authorized. With a desire to grant further relief from primage duties, the Government has very carefully examined the incidence of these duties, and it is my pleasure to announce to the House that a special proclamation has been gazetted providing for the exemption from primage duty of many lines of goods, the principal of which are -Fencing wire.Barbed wire.Wire netting.Galvanized iron.Agricultural implements and appliances.Machinery to be used in the mining industry.Milking machines.Cream separators.Annatto, cheese cloth and rennet to be used in the cheese industry.Agricultural, horticultural and viticultural spraying and dusting materials and preparations to be used in the checking of plant and seed insect pests and of plant and seed diseases.Rabbit poisons.Sheep shearing machines.Sheep washes and sheep dips.Farm tractors and parts thereof.These exemptions will operate from 9 a.m. to-morrow, the 2nd September, 1932. Honorable members will receive a copy of the proclamation, together with a statement of items, which will make them au fait with the details of the latest exemptions.It will be noted that the important agricultural, dairying, grazing and mining industries will benefit from these concessions.The Government would like still further to curtail the operation of the primage duties, but the revenue position effectively precludes any more concessions, at least: until the financial situation definitely improves.I have also to announce that action has been taken to-day to revoke the proclamation prohibiting the importation of the following goods : -","N/A","PRIMAGE DUTIES AND IMPORT PROHIBITIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The resolution covering import duties provides for reductions in duty in respect of 23 classes of goods affecting 34 items and sub-items. A memorandum which has been distributed to honorable members, shows fully the alterations in detail. The variations have been made on the recommendation of the Tariff Board in conformity with the policy previously announced by the Government of following in broad principle the recommendations of that body. I shall briefly refer to some of the items in the schedule.Since assuming office, many representations have been made to the Government, particularly by or on behalf of country municipalities, seeking the admission, at concessional rates of duties, of crude oil engines. In order that the Government might be fully acquainted, with the position of this industry the matter was referred to the Tariff Board, and the industry thoroughly investigated. As a result, the schedule now tabled makes provision for reduced duties on crude oil engines. The duties on engines not exceeding 100 horse-power have been brought back to 45 per cent. British, and 60 per cent, general, which rates are in accord with those imposed by the Bruce-Page administration. Provision is also made for duties of free British, 15 per cent, general on crude oil engines exceeding 100 horse-power, and by-law items have been framed which will give the Minister power to admit crude oil engines of foreign manufacture free of duty when in his opinion such action would not be detrimental to British manufacturers.The duties on galvanized iron have been reduced from 110s. per ton British, and 150s. per ton general, as imposed by the Scullin Government validated tariff to 90s. per ton British, and 130s. per ton general. The Scullin Government added a proviso to the item, that when the Minister was satisfied that in any one year the Australian requirements of galvanized iron had reached 60,000 tons the duties should he reduced to 90s. British, and 130s. general. The Tariff Board has since held a further inquiry into galvanized iron, and has recommended that the duties of 90s. per ton British, and 130s. per ton general be imposed provided that the present gross list price ex store he reduced from £26 10s. per ton to £25. The local manufacturers have agreed to this reduction, which is to operate from the 2nd September, 1932. This reduction in price following on the £2 reduction already in operation is substantial, and will be of considerable advantage to the primary producer.An inquiry has been conducted into the electrical machinery industry, and the duties previously operating have been considerably revised. The maximum duties now provided on this class of machinery are 45 per cent. British, 60 per cent, general, which are again in accord with the duties prevailing under the Pratten tariff. An innovation in the method of application of duties has been made by the provision in the case of induction type alternating current motors exceeding 150 horse-power of a sliding scale which gradually reduces the duties from the maximum of 45 per cent. British, 60 per cent, general, to a minimum of free British, 15 per cent, general. A similar principle has been adopted in connexion with transformers.I draw particular attention to the very substantial reduction in the duties imposed by the Scullin validating tariff on dairy coolers, pasteurizers, jacketed vats and tanks. The proposed duties are 22^ per cent. British, 35 per cent, general, as against 45 per cent. British, 60 per cent, general, previously operating.By the adoption of a different basis for the collection of duty on plain clear sheet glass, the duties will be considerably decreased. This will benefit the users of horticultural glass, such as tomatogrowers, while at the same time being of advantage to the building industry. Provision has been made for deferred duties, which in accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the customs tariff, may be applied when the Australian manufacturer is in a position to supply reasonable quantities of plain clear sheet glass of satisfactory quality.Deferred duties, which were provided in respect of vessels over 1,000 tons gross register, and of certain pipes and tubes not exceeding 3 inch internal diameter have been deleted. In its report on vessels the Tariff Board expressed the opinion that the commercial manufacture in Australia of vessels over 1,000 tons gross register is not likely, in the near future, and there is therefore no reason for the inclusion in the tariff of a deferred duty on such vessels.The Tariff Board is also of opinion that the continuance of the provision for deferred duties on pipes and tubes would lead to further unwise efforts towards local manufacture when under existing conditions this industry would be uneconomic. Information elicited at the public inquiry held by the board, demonstrated that with the present limited demand a protection of 75 per cent., made up of an import duty 40 per cent., exchange 25 per cent., and primage 10 per cent., against the United Kingdom, would be insufficient in some cases. The board does not consider that local manufacture will not be a commercial proposition should the demand revive, but the increased demand can only be brought about if costs of production are brought more- into line with costs in other parts of the world.Honorable members will notice that an alteration has been made in the wording of the sub-item covering cotton yarns; but this has been done solely for administrative purposes, to give effect to what was originally the intention of the item.Duties have been reduced on cotton tweeds, which resemble woollen piece goods in pattern, design or appearance, but the weight limit in the sub-item has been altered from 5 oz. to 3 oz. per square yard, which brings the weight into line with the weight of woollen piece goods. This will result in increased duties on cotton tweeds between these weights.An examination of the memorandum supplied to honorable members will indicate that, in many cases, such as woollen piece goods, apparel n.e.i., churns, cheese presses, &c., cement-making and roadmaking machinery, &c, machinery n.e.i., motive power machinery n.e.i., refractory bricks, and plain clear sheet glass, the duties have been brought down to the level of the duties in force under the Bruce Page Government, whilein other cases, that is to say, matches, cotton tweeds, and knitted piece goods, the duties have been reduced below those imposed by the 1921-28 tariff.This definitely indicates that the present Governments tariff policy tends towards lower duties, but it must not be construed as indicating that the Government intends to depart from the policy of protection. In no case, in the schedule just tabled, has the Government reduced duties below those recommended by the Tariff Board as being necessary for the protection of the particular industry. This Government believes in the protection of industries which can be economically established and efficiently carried on in this country, but favours the minimum protection necessary for that purpose.The resolution dealing with special duties has the effect of removing those duties from the following lines: - 105 (aa) (2). - Knitted piece goods. 109. - Artificial flowers. 1 10. - Apparel. 116. - Parasols, sunshades and umbrellas. 231 (c).- Putty. 231 (g). - Paints and colours. 232 (a). - Varnishes, lacquers. 325. - Leather manufactures. 326. - Belting. 328. - Rubber sandshoes, goloshes, &c. 32!). - Leather boots and shoes, &c. 338 (a). - Advertising matter, &c. 340 (a) (b) (c). - Stationery and Manufactures of paper. 376 (a) (b) (c) and (f). - Bags, baskets, boxes, &c. 380 (a) (1). - Brooms, whisks, mops. 381 (f). - Brushes, hair, cloth, tooth, nail and varnish. 430. - Straw envelopes.The previous Government imposed special duties on 58 lines of goods, and it will be remembered that previously the Government removed this restriction on 22 lines. Action taken to-day removes the special duties from a further seventeen lines. Based on the import figures for the year 1930-31, the value of the goods affected annually by the special duties in operation prior to the present resolution was £2,237,183, while the value of the goods which will now be affected, again based on the 1930-31. figures, is £1,176,410.The special duties have been retained on what might be termed luxury goods and on goods imported principally from countries with which Australia has an adverse trade balance.Progress reported.","In Committee of Ways and Means:","TARIFF PROPOSALS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1[2]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

121,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CORSER, Bernard","K6Q","Wide Bay","N/A","N/A",124,". - This item has been the subject of a certain amount of criticism by honorable members. Whatever may be said on general principles in regard to a tariff item, it is generally admitted by all sections of the House that, if a commodity can be produced without an excessive degree of protection, and so as to permit of reasonable importations, that aspect of the matter ought not to be overlooked. An inducement recently was held out with the object of promoting the manufacture of this article. It is known that the manufacturing side is not hampered because of a shortage of finance. The industry was established under protection given by a recent government, and it appeared that the funds necessary for its expansion were assured. A firm reputed for its business methods assumed a controlling interest in the manufacture of pearl buttons in Australia. Here is an industry that is converting into a finished secondary product raw material obtained in Australian waters, and we are asked to abolish it on the pretext that we shall be offending Japan if we do not allow it to exploit the Australian market. The manufacturers of shirts and pyjamas assert that an injustice would be done to Japan if we do not deprive of their employment 65 men now engaged in the manufacture of buttons and render idle machinery installed at a cost of £20,000 - the first unit of the plant necessary to supply all the requirements of the Australian market and a surplus for export. We are told that buttons can be produced in Japan more cheaply than in Australia. If that contention were carried to its logical conclusion, we should prevent the manufacture of shirts and pyjamas in the Commonwealth. The honorable member for Wentworth (Mr. E. J. Harrison) stated that a duty of 1,100 per cent, is imposed on Japanese buttons. Those buttons are produced, not from pearl shell such as is obtained on the Australian coast, but from shell almost as fragile and worthless as egg shell or snail shell. Such rubbish should not be admitted to the Commonwealth, and the manufacturers of garments who use it are robbing the workers. It would be more just to the consumer to use a serviceable Australian button, even at greater cost. But the manufacturers demand the opportunity to use a rotten Japanese product so that they may make a greater profit out of the unfortunate workers who wear their garments. This committee should protect the Australian consumer against the introduction of worthless buttons that may hold together in the factory but will scarcely survive the washtub. Honorable members have clamoured for efficiency in Australian secondary production. I have visited the button factory and seen proof of its efficiency. The operatives are being trained by five experts engaged from Europe. The honorable member for Wentworth has not been fair to this promising enterprise. He has not given credit to the firm for what it has already achieved or. for its readiness to agree that buttons made in Great Britain shall be admitted free of duty. Apparently he insists upon cheap Japanese stuff. If the policy of encouraging secondary industries is to continue, we should at least assist to consolidate an enterprise that has been started under those conditions of efficiency which the Government has stipulated. There is no justification for rendering idle the employees and plant of this factory. As for the pretext that the Japanese might be offended by a heavy duty on their buttons, they continue to buy our wool, although members of their race are not admitted to Australia except by permit. They are not likely to be offended by a resolve on the part of this Parliament to preserve to Australian workmen the industry of manufacturing a local raw material into a finished product. I appeal to the committee not to destroy an industry of great promise, and do an injustice to Australian workmen and a firm that has invested capital in the establishment of an enterprise which is already a credit to all concerned.","Item 106 (Buttons)","TARIFF PROPOSALS (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
122,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"DEIN, Adam","JUD","Lang","N/A","N/A",125,".- As a result of my visit to the button factory and the discussion which has taken place on this item, I am convinced that the duty imposed by the Scullin Government in 1931 was excessive, and that the duty imposed by the present Government early this year is totally inadequate. An intermediate rate would probably do justice to the industry. When this matter was brought to the notice of the Minister some months ago, he was sufficiently impressed to promise to refer the item back to the Tariff Board. If the case presented by the manufacturers had been without merit he would not have given that undertaking. Unfortunately, although the item was referred back to the board it was not made the subject of further public inquiry. This industry was commenced about eighteen months ago. A few hands were employed immediately. At the present time the number- of those permanently engaged is 65, and no vote of mine in this committee will deprive them of their positions unless they can be established in some other walk in life. According to the honorable member for Wentworth (Mr. E. J. Harrison), this industry is uneconomic. But can the honorable member tell me of any secondary industry in Australia at the present time which is economic? All our secondary industries are passing through a time whey they are being hard pressed, and the fact that at the moment the pearl shell button industry may seem uneconomic to the honorable member for Wentworth, is no justification for throwing a number of employees on the industrial scrap-heap. The honorable member for Forrest (Mr. Prowse), who waxed eloquent in his admiration for the Japanese, is remarkably consistent in his inconsistency. A few months ago we heard him holding out for the highest possible duties on tobacco. To-day he is . a rabid freetrader.The existing duties on pearl shell buttons are totally inadequate, and I am opposed to the Governments proposal in this respect, as I am in regard to other proposals contained in this schedule.","Item 106 (Buttons)","TARIFF PROPOSALS (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I move -That the item be postponed.If that motion should be carried,I want it to be regarded as  an instruction from the committee to the Government to impose rates of duty as follows: - British, free; intermediate and general, up to 40 line, per line per gross id. and 25 per cent, ad valorem. I am suggesting a compromise between an extremely high duty and an extremely low duty, and if my proposal is accepted it will be carrying out the decisions arrived at by the Imperial Economic Conference at Ottawa. The Governments proposal imposes a duty of 15 per cent, on British importations. I would allow them to come in free. I feel, however, that the committee is justified in affording the local manufacturers sufficient protection to keep out foreign buttons, particularly the rubbish from Japan, and thus maintain in employment those already engaged in the industry. It may be that the industry itself has been wrongly set up, but we cannot rectify that position by doing another wrong. Two wrongs will not make a right. The industry is already here, and we should allow it to live, in the interests of those who are employed in it. After what I regard as a fair and unbiased examination of the position, I have come to the following conclusions: The industry is conducted upon sound financial lines, its equipment is modern and efficient, it affords full-time employment to 65 employees, and, given adequate protection, the extent of employment could be increased by as much as 400 per cent. Plans have already been prepared for that .future development. A continuance of its activities would provide a market for raw materials that can be supplied in any quantity from Australian waters; The manufacture of pearl shell buttons having already been well established inAustralia, it is our duty to encourage its development rather than let the industry disappear, and inflict great hardship on persons already employed in it, at the same time depriving hundreds of persons of the prospect of employment.","Item 106 (Buttons)","TARIFF PROPOSALS (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[2]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It must be borne in mind that, although the ad valorem rates of 15, 20 and 25 per cent, appear to some honorable members to be low, primage and exchange have to be added to them. Actually the protection against Great Britain is 52£ per cent, instead of 15 per cent., with primage, exchange and the statutory addition of 10 per cent, on the f.o.b. price made by the Customs Department. I should like to know from the Minister in charge how the Government reconciles these duties of 15 per cent. British and 25 per cent, general with the undertaking given at the Ottawa Conference that in no case would the duties on British goods be higher than were recommended by the Tariff Board, which, I understand, recommended that the rates of duty on pearl buttons should be British free and foreign 15 per cent. The rates proposed by the Government are a welcome reduction, but they are still higher than were recommended by the Tariff Board.I understand that the exchange against Japan is 15 per cent., which really means that on the present proposals Great Britain has no preference against Japan. If to the 15 per cent, duty against Great Britain is added 25 per cent, exchange, and 10 per cent, primage, and to the 25 per cent, against Japan, plus 15 per cent, exchange and 10 per cent, primage, the gross amount in the two columns of the schedule are equal. I do not understand why some honorable members appear to think that we are engaging in an almost immoral practice if we buy a few buttons from a country like Japan. We must remember that Japan buys over 600,000 bales of wool from Australia. Last year, Japan was our second largest customer for wool.Great Britain purchased about 32 per cent. and Japan 20 per cent.","Item 106 (Buttons)","TARIFF PROPOSALS (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The honorable member for Gippsland (Mr. Paterson) did not tell the committee that duties of £8 per ton on onions, 6d. and 7d. per lb. on butter, 2s. 6d. per cwt. on potatoes, and suchlike duties on primary products, are excessive. I remind the honorable member that he cannot have things both ways. The possibilities of the industry covered by the item under consideration are tremendous, and it is well for the committee to understand something about the industry. The report of the Administrator for the Northern Territory shows that the value of the mother of pearl exported from Darwin alone for the year ended the 30th June, 1931, amounted to £81,520, and Darwin is the smallest centre of production in Australia. More than three times the quantity of shell now produced could be supplied, if the embargo were lifted. The primary industry is in a difficult position. Last week news came from the United States of America, which is one of the principal buyers of Australian pearl shell, that the banks had refused to finance the purchase of shell.Australia meets 80 per cent. of the worlds requirements of mother of pearl, and in that respect the industry needs no assistance in competing in the overseas markets ; but protection is urgently necessary against the importation of the spurious stuff that is placed on the Australian market. The average number of buttons on a working mans shirt is about four, and, therefore, the additional cost of each garment due to the use of Australian-made buttons of high quality is infinitesimal. This Australian industry, if adequately protected, could supply 80 per cent. of the worlds demand for the finished product. The superiority of the Australian article is beyond doubt. Those engaged in pearling activities in this country now dump hundreds of tons of shell into the sea, because they have a restricted market for their output. Sometimes pearl shell is found to be worm eaten in the heel, and this defect renders it second class. Owing to the restrictions imposed by the Commonwealth authorities, this otherwise perfectly good shell is wasted, although it is infinitely superior to any trochus shell that the world produces.","Item 106 (Buttons)","TARIFF PROPOSALS (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

132,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"NELSON, Harold","JVT","N/A","N/A","N/A",127,"- I was in touch with the pearlers all the time; but even if I had remained quiet, the restriction would not have been justified. Some of the pearlers lost as much as £2,400 on last years operations, because of the restriction placed upon them. I suggest that the pearlers themselves should be allowed to decide what quantities they should export. Since the primary industry is capable of supplying the whole of the raw material required for the secondary industry, and the shell is superior to that produced elsewhere, it should not be hampered by the importation of cheap and nasty articles from overseas.If honorable members are consistent, they will give the industry at least sufficient protection to enable both the raw =material and the finished article to be exported. It can be proved positively that foreigners fish for shell within three miles of the coastline, instead of confining their operations to international waters. They take all the shell they require, and yet the Australian pearler is not allowed to take more than a fixed quantity. .Can such a position be justified? The fact remains that our pearlers could obtain thousands of tons of shell, and market it in London and on the Continent of Europe, if they were permitted to do so. It should not be imagined that the greater part of the shell is used for the manufacture of buttons for the shirts of the -workers. Shell is also employed extensively in the manufacture of many other articles, including -womens wear. Those who require good buttons will always prefer those made of mother of pearl. Buttons of the  egg-shell  type are most inferior. We should make up our minds that the Australian pearl shell industry can, and must, dominate the worlds market, and that result can only be achieved by assisting both the primary and the secondary industries. I am sure that if adequate protection were afforded this industry, it would soon become established on such a sound basis that it would require no protection at all. I trust that the committee will agree to the restoration of the rates provided in the Scullin tariff.","Item 106 (Buttons)","TARIFF PROPOSALS (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[4]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In giving evidence before the Tariff Board, the representative of this company stated that it was impossible to establish the industry with less than 500 per cent, protection, and the present protection is equivalent to 1,100 per cent.

Working on the basis of the price list of the Pearl Button Manufacturing Company Limited of the 10th June, 1.931, the cost of the same quantity of buttons of local manufacture would be £5,540.

140,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"PARKHILL, Robert","KXQ","N/A","N/A","N/A",128,"- The honorable member would have us believe that he has ari intimate knowledge of the industry, but his interjection is not a true statement of the position. The board states -In conclusion the witness said - While I am, as a manufacturer, an advocate of protection for secondary industries, I look upon the present duty, as one that is outside the protectionist class, and is really prohibitive, and results in special consideration being given to a very small section of trade at a cost quite beyond the ability of the larger industries using the products to carry, and is one of those duties which is a factor in making it necessary for secondary industries in Australia to seek higher and still higher protection. . . . Because of the absence of competition from either within or without Australia a monopoly will be created, which will be able to take practically full advantage of a prohibitive duty equal in some cases to 1,100 per cent., and to increase the price to the wearer of shirts.Full weight must be given to the evidence of this witness, who is a protectionist and a manufacturer. He stated that the duties brought in by the Scullin Government would mean the imposition of an additional burden of £5,000 a year on his firm. Another witness, Mr. E. Grotjan, senior member of the firm of Grotjan and Company, of 3 Hosier-lane, Melbourne, informed the board that the protection afforded by the duties brought, in by the Scullin Government in respect of the cheaper class of button, namely, the sazae ken, dobu and tamagai ranged from 375 per cent, to 1,100 per cent, and in respect of the trochus shell button from 260 per cent, to 280 per cent. Still another witness, Mr. A. T. Palmer, representing Dudfields Proprietary Limited, of 19 McKillop-street, Melbourne, and also of Sydney, informed the board -The pearl button industry would provide only a small measure of employment. On the other hand, the cost of such an industry would be borne by the important manufacturing clothing industry which employs 41,000 persons.This means that to encourage an industry giving employment to anything from 50 to 70 persons, the clothing manufacturing industries, employing over 41,000 persons, would be unfairly penalized. Mr. R. 3ST. Shimmin, the production director of Pelaco Limited, shirt and pyjama manufacturers, Richmond, Victoria, stated in the course of his evidence: -When the duty was 15 per cent., the company paid approximately £2,000 for imported buttons, which represented .56 per cent, of the companys turnover. Under the new duties, the cost of imported buttons would be about £5,000. If locally made buttons were used, the cost would be about £6,000, representing 2.5 per cent, of the value of the companys turnover.In the year 1930, Pelaco Limited showed a substantial loss. The increased cost of buttons will mean a greater loss for the current year.If honorable members wish to avoid a loss of employment in the clothing industry they should take the broader view, and consider the position of those industrial concerns which, under existing conditions, are losing money from year to year. Many of them have been compelled, by stress of circumstances, to restrict their activities. Another witness before the board, Mr. L. W. Torode, a director of T. A. Maxwell Proprietary Limited, manufacturers of shirts and pyjamas, Carlton, Victoria, told the board that -The cost of the buttons under the former rate of duty of 15 per cent, was about £500 per annum. Under the proposed rates of duty the cost of imported buttons would be increased to £1,900. If local buttons were used, the cost would be £2,250 per annum. In the latter case the garment manufacturers cost would be burdened by an additional £1,750 per annum.Surely that should be sufficient to convince honorable members of the wisdom of adopting the new duties imposed by ; the Government. I come now to the following comments made by the Tariff Board itself : -Based on the figure last-mentioned, and taking the landed duty paid cost of importations under the former duty of 15 per cent, at £40,000 per annum, the quantity of pearl buttons represented by the Australian requirements would be 640,000 gross per annum.The above table shows that imported buttons which previously cost £2,012 would, under the proposed duties, cost £5,265. If Australian mother-of-pearl buttons were used, the cost would be £6,272. If, however, Sharks Bay shell buttons were used to replace the Same buttons, the total cost would be £6)128, which represents an increase in cost of £4,1.16 or over 200 per cent.These views, I remind the committee, are opinions expressed not by manufacturers but by members of the board, and I submit that they clearly indicate that the Scullin tariff would impose an unduly heavy burden upon the companies concerned and, through them, upon the general public. The board went on to say -Taking all these aspects into consideration, the board is forced to the conclusion that the Australian company cannot succeed in displacing more than half of the imported pearl buttons, i.e., even with the assistance of the proposed high duties. The effect of the smaller output would obviously be higher cost of production which would militate against possible increase of production as time goes on. Another effect would be the reduction, by half, of the quantity of shell which the applicant company estimated it would use, a reduction in the employment which the company expected to provide, and a general lessening of the anticipated value of the industry to Australia. At the same time the disadvantage to users of buttons would not be diminished.I direct the attention of the honorable member for Northern Territory (Mr. Nelson) to this statement. Naturally enough, the honorable member is anxious that the wealth in the vicinity of the Darwin waters should be utilized to the fullest extent, but I put it to him that if ho votes for the higher duties, he will, in fact, be doing something to restrict the use of Australian pearl shell, and to that extent will do a disservice to the people he desires to assist.","Item 106 (Buttons)","TARIFF PROPOSALS (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[6]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Tariff Board goes, on to state -Having regard to all the factors mentioned, the board is convinced that the -project to manufacture pearl buttons in Australia is ill conceived. It aims at making a class of button which is higher in price (in world acceptation ) than the vast majority of buttons in usual demand, and even the proposal to utilize Sharks Bay shell to manufacture a somewhat lower priced button does not justify its existence.It concludes with this recommendation -The proposed duties are excessive, and vary in terms of ad valorem equivalent from 160 per cent, to 965 per cent. The evidence shows that the local manufacturers would require to take advantage of the duties to their full extent.The effect of the operation of the duties will be to increase the cost of pearl buttons to garment manufacturers by approximately 250 per cent.The increased cost must dislocate industry and tend to create unemployment.While the locally-made button is of good quality, it is considered that manufacturers should not be forced to use costly buttons when cheaper buttons have proved satisfactory for their purposes.It is a matter of the most poignant regret to me that I am not able to remove the burdens which press harshly on the public at the present time, and I will certainly never be a party to imposing further burdens on the people by means of duties which, as in this instance, range from 200 per cent, to 900 per cent., and of which the local industry would take full advantage. It must be evident to any one who has the welfare of the workers at heart that they cannot afford to bear impositions of the kind suggested. One honorable member opposite, speaking in support of high duties, said that low prices were of no account. The idea that cheapness was something to be sought after was, he said, entirely exploded. I wonder whether the honorable member puts that principle into operation in his own private shopping. I venture to think that he buys where he can get what he wants at the lowest price, and he is wise to do so. The theory of honorable members opposite is that the more a man pays for a thing the better it is for him. We have heard a good deal about the need for bringing back price levels to what they stood at in 1929. Apparently, the honorable member for Darling (Mr. Blakeley) believes that he will be doing his bit towards bringing prices back to the 1929 level if he insists on the workers paying twice as much for the pearl buttons used on their clothes. That is not my opinion.When the company which manufactures these buttons in Australia began operations it did not install the most up-to-date machinery. Now it claims that, having established itself, it is entitled to the Australian market, and suggests that when it has made sufficient money by selling its product at excessive prices it will put in modern plant. Surely it does not expect the Government to support a proposition of that kind. Honorable members opposite have claimed that the buttons imported into this country during .the last half -century have been rubbish. They speak as if all buttons except those made in Australia were of the worst possible quality. They overlook the fact that they themselves, and their parents before them, have been using such buttons for years. Only now, after a most assiduous canvass by the representatives of the local manufacturers, have they become aware of the demerits of the imported article. This argument has no weight with me, and it is evident that it has had no weight with the Tariff Board. The recommendation of the board cannot be overlooked. A very complete investigation was carried out, and the boards recommendations in respect of this industry are most emphatic. The Assistant Minister stated that representations on behalf of the industry were made to him, and that he was sufficiently impressed to forward those representations to the Tariff Board. Having perused that information, the chairman of the board has stated that there is no reason for altering the previous decision.","Item 106 (Buttons)","TARIFF PROPOSALS (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[6]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Seeing that buttons would continue to be imported irrespective of the operations of the local manufacturers, the Government fixed the rate of duty so as to obtain some additional revenue from this source. Most of the pearl buttons imported come from Japan, and I join with the honorable member for Gippsland (Mr. Paterson) and other honorable members in supporting the principle that we should give favorable consideration to those countries which buy goods from us. I am a native of Australia, and I am just as keen as any one else to support Australian industries, but I am not prepared to support them merely because they are Australian. I claim the right to use my intelligence to determine whether an Australian industry is being conducted on a sound, economic basis. If it is, I shall support it as strongly as any one. The pearl button manufacturing industry in Australia is not on a sound, economic basis, and I will not support it unfairly, nor can any one do so who has at heart the interests of the Australian public.Mr. WATKINS (Newcastle) [8.25 J.One might be pardoned, while listening to the debates on this item, for believing that this Parliament was anything but an Australian assembly. A good deal has been said about the report of the Tariff Board. That body inquired into matters relating to both trochus shell buttons and mother-of-pearl buttons. The only reason why the board has recommended that the duties be reduced is that Japan buys some wool from Australia. The comparisons of prices which have been made are not comparisons between one pearl button and another, but between pearl buttons and the cheapest rubbish that can be put on the market. Honorable members opposite have spoken of helping the working man. Their idea of helping him is to compel him to wear shirts on which the buttons will not last a week. The imported rubbish which they favour will not stand washing or mangling. The only imported pearl shell buttons which we see in Australia come from America. Cheap trochus shell buttons are brought here from Japan, but no pearl buttons come from that country. We are asking for a reasonable duty to protect the local industry, not from imported pearl buttons, but from the rubbish that serves only to cheat the public. This is an industry which could be established in every capital throughout Australia. The supply of mother-of-pearl round our coasts is unlimited, as the honorable member for the Northern Territory (Mr. Nelson) has told us. At the present time the shell is often dumped back into the sea, because there is no market for it. The industry provides employment for skilful operators, it uses the product of our own waters, and supplies an article for our own people.","Item 106 (Buttons)","TARIFF PROPOSALS (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[6]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Pearl shell is obtainable in large quantities in Australian waters, and, by using it for the manufacture of buttons, we should be giving employment to our own people, as well as providing Australians with good buttons, instead of asking them to buy articles which are not fit to place on a shirt. The question for us to decide is whether Australians shall continue to dump pearl shell into the sea or make it into buttons for our people to wear. My vote shall be cast in favour of this industry, which I hope will spread until eventually the whole of Australias requirements of pearl buttons are being produced in this country.

In its summary the Tariff Board merely states that, in its opinion, the proposed duties are excessively high as against trochus shell, and that practically the whole of the buttons which are imported into Australia come from Japan, and. that country is a large purchaser of Australian products. Yet do honorable members think that Japan would no longer buy our wool if we made our own buttons in this country? . I shall support these duties, because I believe that this industry should be established in order to provide employment for Australians.","Item 106 (Buttons)","TARIFF PROPOSALS (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[7]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I rise in the interests of the Australian industry. One of the reasons advanced against these duties is that Japan buys Australian wool. Do honorable members think that Japan buys our wool because of her love for Australia ? Were Japan able to produce wool, she would not buy our wool; similarly, if we can produce buttons we should not gp to Japan for them. I was surprised to hear the Minister for the Interior (Mr. Parkhill) say that because Japanese buttons were good enough for our mothers and grandmothers, they should be good enough for us. Such a statement is in keeping with the honorable gentlemans politics generally. Yet despite the Ministers advocacy of bullock-dray conditions, he flits about the country in a beautiful limousine of the most up-to-date type. In this National Parliament we should endeavour to cultivate an Australian sentiment, and to foster Australian industries with a view to making this country self-supporting. I agree with E. J. Brady, the great poet, who, when speaking of the potentialities of this country, penned the following beautiful lines : -Her destinies are ours to shape,Her land is ours to hold;The plastic clay of nationhood is here to shape and mould.In spite of strangers, Tory bred; of foreigners, or fools,Id write Australia on the walls and teach it in the schools.We in this group believe in placing Australia first; we want this country -to go forward, not backward.","Item 106 (Buttons)","TARIFF PROPOSALS (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I would not care to estimate the cost of the debate which has taken place on this item; it must be considerable. I shall not add greatly to that cost, for I shall not say much. I am informed, from a source which is generally reliable, that a German gentleman came to this country with a proposal to manufacture buttons in Australia, and was successful in interesting a certain group in the matter. He said that buttons could be made in Australia for a certain price, and was able to persuade the members of the group to commence their manufacture. They found, however, that his predictions were not realized, and they are now endeavouring to recover on their investments by means of high duties.","Item 106 (Buttons)","TARIFF PROPOSALS (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

159,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MARTENS, George","KMZ","Herbert","N/A","N/A",133,".- Every one knows that the firm to which reference has been made is an offshoot of Burns, Philp and Company. As for the four Austrians referred to by the honorable member for Wentworth (Mr. E. J. Harrison), I can only say that if they are not better Australians than he is, they are not of much use to Australia. The honorable member spoke of the much greater cost to the wearer of a shirt if mother-of-pearl buttons were used instead of trochus buttons. Presently, I shall give some figures to show that there is not much in that argument. Yesterday, the honorable member for Wentworth said that Shark Bay mother-of-pearl buttons are objectionable because they are too dark. It may be that some buttons made of this material are dark; but in that respect they are not worse than buttons made of trochus. The honorable member for Adelaide (Mr. Stacey) complained that pearl buttons will not pass through a wringer without injury. I am prepared to take the honorable member into the factory where these buttons are made, and I challenge him to break one of them. According to the Minister for the Interior (Mr. Parkhill) buttons of trochus have been in use for 40 or 50 years without any complaint having been made concerning them. I can imagine that the Minister would indulge in a considerable amount of grumbling if he had had to use those buttons. Buttons made of trochus shell are practically worthless. I can understand the interest of the honorable member for Wentworth in this matter ; the firm which he represents sells buttons made of trochus shell. The statement of the honorable member that in the case of Shark Bay mother-of-pearl buttons, the increased duty was 1,100 per cent., was denied by the Minister for the Interior, who pointed out that the difference between the duty on these buttons and on trochus shell buttons is about 200 per cent.The net landed cost of Maru sazae shell buttons, excluding duty, is 5s. 3d. a gross, as against a selling price of1s. 9d. a gross for Australian motherofpearl Shark Bay buttons. The difference between the costs of shirts fitted with the different buttons is negligible, as will be seen from the following figures : -N/AWhile the difference between the cost of the two buttons is so little, the greater worth of the Australian product is tremendous. When a person sends to the laundry a shirt that has Maru sazae buttons, it is returned with the buttons in a sadly mutilated condition, whereas our own product comes back intact. The honorable member for Wentworth (Mr. E. J. Harrison) is connected with the shirt-making business, and he should know something about the matter. I challenge him to prove that my figures are inaccurate.Now let me compare the cost of takase shell buttons with Australian motherofpearl Shark Bay buttons. The net landed cost of the former, excluding duty, is 2s. per gross, while the selling price of the latter is1s. 9d. per gross. This is how the cost works out when they are attached to a shirt -The slight difference is in favour of the Australian article. Again, dealing with  line 28  buttons, the net landed cost, excluding duty, of the fresh water pearl shell product is ls. 11.61d. per gross, while the selling price of the Australian mother-of-pearl Shark Bay button is 3s. 9d. per gross. The relative cost of four buttons of each type on a garment is 655d. against 1.205d., the cost of our own article being .55d. higher than the fresh water pearl shell button. The net landed cost, excluding duty, of takase shell buttons of the same line, is 3s. 9.76d. per gross compared with the selling price of 3s. per gross for Australian motherofpearl Shark Bay buttons, the respective costs of four buttons on a garment being 1.27ld., and 1.205, or .016d. in favour of our buttons. The superiority of the Australian mother-of-pearl Shark Bay button is so pronounced that it outweighs any slight difference in cost.I suggest that the honorable member for Wentworth should induce the company in which he is, interested to use Australian buttons on the shirts that it makes. At present his company uses trochus shell buttons, which are cheap rubbish. One can break nine-tenths of them in ones fingers, for there is no grain in the shell. It is urged that because Japan buys certain of our commodities we should allow this trade to remain in the hands of that country. The industry is said to be worth £64,000 a year to Australia. If I had my way no one would fish for trochus shell.. The honorable member for Wentworth (Mr. E. J. Harrison) gibed at the honorable member for Newcastle (Mr. Watkins) and stated that the Japanese fish for trochus shell. I may tell him that there are no Japanese on the boats that fish for trochus shell, a product which is not used to any considerable extent in this country. I am aware that a certain proportion of the shell sent to Japan comes back to Australia in the form of manufactured buttons. On the other hand, granted proper encouragement, we could enormously increase our trade in the Australian mother-of-pearl Shark Bay product. Unfortunately, the American firm of Girdau and Company, our greatest buyer, has notified pearlers at Thursday Island, that it can no longer finance our shell buying and selling. I hope that efforts to find another avenue of marketing our product will be successful.I have gone through the factory in Sydney to which reference has been made, and I know that the work performed there is highly efficient, and is carried out under Australian labour conditions. The allegations that the machinery is obsolete are unfounded. The machinery is first-class, and the young Australians employed in the factory are turning out worthy articles. In addition to manufacturing buttons, that firm is also making buckles and other dress ornaments which appeal to women, and the industry, although not very big, is capable of considerable extension. It is significant that when we introduced the tariff schedule a comparatively few months ago, there were only eight employees in the business, whereas they now number 65. Unfortunately, an unsuspecting public has been sold trochus shell by unscrupulous dealers under the guise of pearl shell. Until quite recently it was almost impossible to buy the genuine article in Australia. The amendment moved by the honorable member for Lang (Mr. Dein) warrants support, as the industry is worthy of protection. It is claimed that it is uneconomic. I should like to know what Australian industry is conducted on economic lines. Every one has sought government assistance.","Item 106 (Buttons)","TARIFF PROPOSALS (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[10]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

161,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MARTENS, George","KMZ","N/A","N/A","N/A",134,"- The wool industry has been asking for government assistance for as many years as the honorable member has lived. The pastoralists of Australia are known to governments as among the keenest in this direction, and are always seeking reduced freights and other concessions - with considerable success. There can be no harm in keeping this industry going. In hie budget speech the Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons) urged that private enterprise should do everything possible to assist the Government to overcome its difficulties, a view that is also held by members of the United Australia party. Here is an opportunity for the Government to avail itself of such assistance. Despite what the honorable member for Denison (Mr. Hutchin) said, the man at the head of this firm is capable and shrewd. The industry has produced 80 per cent, of the worlds supply of pearl shell, and it can produce on a greater scale when the market warrants it. I admit that on a previous occasion I, and other honorable members, did not urge the extension of the industry, but. we acted on advice from the buyers of pearl shell that it would be useless at that time to produce any more shell, as the- market was not available. The opportunity now presents itself to expand the industry in Australia. Incidentally, in addition to the other lines I have enumerated, our mother-of-pearl shell can be used for motor number plates and name-plates for homes. That may not appeal to the motor speed artist, as number plates made of this material are particularly conspicuous, but they are also durable and handsome. If that section of the industry is exploited, an enormous quantity of pearl shell would be used. I sincerely trust that the Government will either accept the amendment of the honorable member, or postpone the item in order to give further consideration to the suggestions that have been made during this debate.","Item 106 (Buttons)","TARIFF PROPOSALS (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[10]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
162,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"HARRISON, Eric","KNX","Wentworth","UAP; LP from 1944","N/A",135,". - I rise principally to clear up a few misunderstandings and to refute certain mis-statements. Particularly do I direct my attention to the remarks of the honorable member for Wide Bay (Mr. Corser), who is a member of the Country party, and, allegedly, a low tariffist. He comes from Queensland, the State that exports something like £64,801 worth of trochus shell to Japan. Yet he advocates a duty increase of 1,100 per cent, to protect a secondary industry that is of no economic value to Australia ! If he were consistent, he would select an industry of greater importance to the country, such as wheat or wool, when he asks for such heavy protection. The honorable member for Herbert (Mr. Martens) is in a similar category. He comes from Queensland, yet he would definitely cut the throat of this exporting industry, to pander to a few interests that have approached him for his help. The honorable member for Wide Bay has asked me What do you call this stuff; how do you pronounce the word? So much for his knowledge on the subject. The arguments that I have heard in this chamber this evening speak strongly in favour of the retention of the Tariff Board. Members of that body hear evidence from manufacturers, importers, and consumers, and arrive at an unbiased conclusion, upon which they base their recommendations. Thank God we had a tariff board to deal with these matters. It would be a poor look out for the country if they were left for determination by a crowd of union secretaries and organizers, such as the honorable member for Darling (Mr. Blakeley), whose only desire is to add to the number of our factories so that they may continue their work as organizers and extort the pennies of girls and men in union subscriptions to keep them in jobs. They evidently realize that they are incapable of earning a living in any other trade or calling in this country. If honorable members opposite are ever fortunate enough to again place a government on the treasury bench, I trust that they will take every care to put in charge of our various departments practical men who understand what they are doing. It is of no use to put in charge of important government departments mcn who have spent their whole lives in trotting round various factories and organizing various unions with the object of stirring up strife. Men with business experience and wide outlook and not pursons with narrow and intolerant views should have the administration of our public affairs.It was characteristic of the honorable member for Darling that he should refer to coolies, wearing loin cloths, making shirts as good as Australians, but I assure him that even coolies would definitely object to the exploitation of their fellow; workers as practised by union secretaries and organizers. The honorable member made certain requests for information as to the number of buttons, on a shirt, and tried to throw doubt upon the accuracy of my statements. I suggest that he should consider, not the fashionable coat shirt but the shirt of the working man whom he is supposed to represent. Such a shirt has seven buttons. The honorable member said that the Scullin duty added only a fraction of a penny to the cost of the buttons on such a garment, but his information was very much astray. I can substantiate my statement that the duties imposed by the Scullin Government added 3fd. to the cost of each shirt. Before the Scullin tariff was imposed the price of sazae buttons landed in Australia from Japan was approximately 4s. per great gross. I presume that the honorable members who have spoken to this subject have sufficient knowledge of the industry to know what a great gross is. It would take seven dozen buttons for one dozen shirts, which would equal 2½d. per dozen shirts. The price of the local button was 4s. 3d. per gross, which equalled 2s. 5fd. per. dozen shirts. Subtracting the cost of the imported button at that time we get 2s. 3:Jd. per dozen shirts. If there be added to this the usual manufacturers profit of 25 -per cent., 6$d., and the retail profit covering all other charges, say 50 per cent., making ls. 5d., we get a total of 4s. 3d., which makes 4Jd. per shirt. It will be seen, therefore, that my last nights estimate of 3fd. per garment was on the conservative side. I am amazed that honorable members opposite, who have so much to say about the plight of starving women and children, can face their constituents after endeavouring in this chamber to force up the price of garments in this way. The amount of protection which they wish to afford this industry is in the neighborhood of £100,000 per annum. Let us look at the wages sheet of this button manufacturing company to see whether there is any justification for such a degree of protection. The fact is that this company pays only between £7,000 and £10,000 a year in wages. In these circumstances it is ridiculous to suggest that protection to the extent of about £100,000 should be granted. It would pay the Government and result in a big saving to the com- munity to give the employees of this company their wages and allow them to sit down, and twiddle their thumbs, rather than impose these extraordinary duties.We have had a good deal of experience in Australia in regard to the button industry. I draw attention to the parallel case of ivory buttons used in the manufacture of mens clothing coats vests and so on. The tariff imposed by the Scullin Government lifted the duties on these buttons from 15 per cent, to 50 per cent. This immediately increased the cost of the buttons on a mans suit from 4-Jd. to 2s. 2d. Now let us look at the experience of the individual who applied for and so easily obtained this increased duty. He brought out one machine for the manufacture of these buttons, but could not handle the business and had to close down. But the increased duty of 50 per cent, is still being imposed, although the individual it was designed to assist has gone out of the business.Something has been said about the quality of the trochus shell buttons that are put on manufactured garments. One would imagine that these buttons were rubbish, but I doubt whether many of the honorable members who have participated in this discussion could distinguish a good trochus shell button from a pearl button. Trochus shell buttons have been used by our grandmothers and mothers for upwards of 40 years, and I have not until recently heard any serious objection to the quality of them. But even if the buttons are rubbish, it is the intention of this wonderful . Australian firm - managed by Austrians and giving employment to Austrian workmen - which is supplying the Australian public with such excellent pearl buttons, to install a plant for the stamping of buttons from trochus shell. It actually is using Queensland trochus shell for the manufacture of buttons to supply the Australian market!The honorable member for the Northern Territory (Mr. Nelson) made an interesting contribution to this debate, but when he was asked several pertinent questions with relation to the limitation of exports of trochus shell he was considerably upset. He said that the bottom had dropped out of the pearl shell market in the United States of America.Does he not realize that it will not help the position by taking action which will cause us also to lose the Japanese market ? That would be the result of the imposition of a prohibitive duty. The Japanese manufacturers will not buy Queensland trochus shell if the duties imposed upon their manufactures are too high, and we shall lose that market just as we have already lost the American market. Surely the £64,000 trade which we do in trochus shell with Japan is worth preserving. The honorable member is not consistent in his arguments.I direct the attention of honorable members to the effect of the Scullin tariff. The price list of the Pearl Button Manufacturing Company, dated the 7 th May, 1931, shows that eighteen line buttons were then 3s. Sd. per gross, but on the 10th June, 1931, after the new duties had been imposed, the same buttons were priced at 4s. 3d., per gross. This shows that the company took the fullest possible advantage of the higher duties to the detriment of the Australian consumer.I am quite agreeable to the imposition of a moderate duty on this item. I do not want these buttons put on the free list, but I am totally opposed to the imposition of a prohibitive duty. I am not prepared to accept the amendment, because I believe that it would have the effect of automatically restoring the duties imposed under the Scullin tariff. I warn honorable members who are tempted to support the amendment that this may be the effect of their action.If this button manufacturing industry were valuable to Australia it is reasonable to expect that the Australian Industries Protection League would support it, but I place before honorable members a letter written by Mr. J. Hume Cook, the secretary of the Australian Industries Protection League, under date the 9th July, 1931, which reads as follows : -In reply to  Interested Merchant  permit me to say that in all human affairs a margin must be allowed for special circumstances and for errors. No one contends that the present tariff is perfect; nor that it represents the Protectionist ideal.  For financial reasons, the Federal Government has been compelled to impose duties which, in other circumstances, would not be countenanced. Ho far as the imposts upon pearl buttons arc concerned, I have to say that they were neither recommended nor supported by the TariffBoard nor the Australian Industries Protection League. It may be that  Interested Merchant  considers the word  goods  in the statement made by Mr. Paterson, M.P. - which statement I criticized - referred to pearl buttons. I do not think so; but if it does, then I suggest that my remarks be treated as being within the  margin of error  abovementioned. Otherwise they stand.Even this league is not prepared to accept this industry as a bona fide Australian enterprise. If honorable members opposite, who are agitating for a higher duty on this item, were not class biased, they would realize that their action is quite inconsistent, but, unfortunately, they imagine that everything that comes from this Government must be wrong. They are not at all tolerant in their outlook. This industry is not worth protecting, yet honorable members opposite are prepared to support it even though to do so would mean penalizing the Australian public to the extent of £100,000 per annum. As an indication of the way in which this firm is prosecuting its activities, I may say that it has travellers soliciting orders for indents of trochus shell buttons from Japan, thereby placing the Japanese exporters in direct opposition to their own factory. The company, which, we understand, has 65 employees, has taken full advantage of the privileges which it enjoys, and indents freely. It is manufacturing other articles, such as buckles, that Are manufactured from mother-of-pearl, and is undertaking the production of buttons as a side line. The conclusions of some honorable members opposing the reduction in duties are illogical, and I have sufficient confidence in the intelligence of honorable members generally to believe that the duties recommended by the Tariff Board will be adopted.","Item 106 (Buttons)","TARIFF PROPOSALS (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[11]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Harrison) must have sat in fear and trembling while he addressed them on this subject. The honorable member for Wentworth reminded me of a professor debating a matter of which he alone possessed expert knowledge. He suggested that he was the only member of the committee who has any knowledge of the value of this industry to Australia. He endeavoured to magnify his own importance.Although the honorable member for Wentworth is a new member of this Parliament, he should have sufficient experience to realize that other honorable members have some knowledge of the subject under discussion. I have been associated with the electrical industry for some years, but I would not suggest that I am the only honorable member who has any knowledge of the trade, and lecture other honorable members on the subject. I recognize that there are other honorable members who know a good deal about this industry, and I would not dare to attempt to lecture them. It is wise to approach a consideration of all these matters in a humble way. It is frequently found that the person who knows most concerning a particular subject is the one least inclined to speak in the way in which the honorable member for Wentworth did. He has severely criticized the utterances of the honorable member for Wide Bay (Mr. Corser), and the honorable member for the Northern Territory (Mr. Nelson) ; but those honorable members are quite capable of answering for themselves. The honorable member for Wentworth discussed this matter, not from the view-point of his constituents, but in the light of the advantage which a lower duty would be to the firm with which he was or is still associated. I could pardon the honorable member if he debated it from the view-point of his constituents; but, to support a lower duty merely from the view-point of his former or present employers, is to adopt an attitude which is not expected of a representative of the people. I feel satisfied that the retail organization of Murdochs Limited, in Sydney, whose interests, no doubt, he has been representing in this instance, is anxious that the prices of certain commodities used in the business in which it is engaged shall be kept as low as possible. I do not suppose that that firm cares whether the articles it requires are imported from China, Japan, Russia, or anywhere else, so long as it can obtain them at a low figure. That firm is not concerned with the interests of those employed in the industry, or with the attempts of others to build up Australian manufacturing concerns. The honorable member for Wentworth referred to the extra cost of buttons manufactured in Australia; but I would suggest that, in order to reduce retail prices, the distributors should forgo some of the 50 per cent. profit which he admitted they are making. I do not profess to have any extensive knowledge of retail business establishments such as Murdochs Limited; but I have been informed that these rag shops are the best profit-making establishments in the country. We have only to see the extent to which businesses such as Myers, in Melbourne, have developed even during periods of depression to realize how profitable they must be. Surely it is unnecessary to put forward a plea on behalf of retail business establishments such as these in an endeavour to answer the case brought forward by the honorable member for Lang (Mr. Dein). In view of what I have heard from those who have an extensive knowledge of the industry, I intend to assist it by supporting the additional protection proposed. The honorable member for Denison (Mr. Hutchin) also endeavoured to lecture the committee with respect to the duties, and as to the time that is being taken in discussing this subject. He may be amused, as he says, at the timethat has been occupied, but he should realize that the members of this committee are entitled to discuss the subject from every possible angle. We hardly need to be lectured by the honorable member for Denison.","Item 106 (Buttons)","TARIFF PROPOSALS (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[12]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Surely we are not justified in refusing to render assistance to an industry merely because several foreigners are engaged in it. We are justified in supporting it to enable it to produce a commodity now imported from Japan. The experience I gained in the electrical trade justifies me in refusing, whenever possible, to be associated with Japanese productions. I have found that in most cases they are most unreliable and inferior. The honorable member for Wentworth quoted a letter dated July, 1931, written by Mr. Hume Cook, the secretary of the Australian Industries Preservation League. I noted that the letter was written over * twelve months ago. There have been many changes during the last twelve or eighteen months. Matters that were regarded as in keeping with proper policy have since been denounced. There have been remarkable changes in public opinion in connexion with current topics, public policy, and tariff matters during the last twelve months. Notwithstanding the statements made by the secretary of the Australian Industries Preservation League, I am inclined to take the opposite view. The opinion expressed by that league strengthens my determination to assist to protect this industry to the fullest possible extent.Mr. BERNARD CORSER (Wide Bay) [9.28 | . - I shall not endeavour to soar to the oratorical heights attempted by the honorable member for Wentworth (Mr. E. J. Harrison), who, perhaps quite unintentionally, mislead the committee in connexion with certain facts which should be apparent to him. He referred in flowery language to the pearly beauty of buttons on a night-shirt, and endeavoured to make honorable members feel that they should apologize for having expressed themselves in the interests of the workers engaged in this industry. The honorable member is the representative of a firm engaged in the manufacture of shirts. He endeavoured to criticize me, as a member of the Country party, for saying that workers are entitled to hold their jobs. I wish to be consistent. I claim that those secondary industries that are of value to Australia should be protected. Those engaged in them provide a market for the products of primary producers. The members of the Country party realize that if our secondary industries went out of existence, an attack would then be made upon those engaged in primary production, and butter, maize, and other primary products produced by black labour would be allowed to enter this country to compete with commodities of Australian production.","Item 106 (Buttons)","TARIFF PROPOSALS (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[12]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This is an illustration of the operation of the freetrade policy as advocated and pursued by a number of urges in Australia in an effort to break down the industries of this country. The attack on this industry is in line with the attack on Australian industries generally. It might be asked - why waste so much time discussing this industry? Let me say that we are fighting for a principle, and if we do not take a firm stand now respecting this industry, we might just as well place in the hands of the freetrade exploiter the future control of Australian industry generally. If the honorable member is fair, he must admit that the Australian workman is entitled to a reasonable wage. I read in a newspaper a few days ago a statement by the Right Honorable Stanley Bruce to the effect that what the world wanted was not cheaper commodities, but higher prices for commodities; not lower wages, but higher wages throughout the world. Some lon.orable members in this House take an opposite view. They want to encourage the use in Australia of Chinese and Japanese cheap labour commodities, and to deprive the Australian worker of any opportunity of employment. Because I am a member of the Country party, the honorable member . for Wentworth considers that I should assist in depriving the Australian workmen of employment.","Item 106 (Buttons)","TARIFF PROPOSALS (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[12]/interjection[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The honorable member referred to the Australian Industries Protection League, and quoted a letter which he had secured from a friend. I have with me a letter from an opposition firm - Pelaco Limited - which was written to the proprietors of the pearl button industry on the 1st December, 1931. It reads -Referring to your recent delivery of mother of pearl buttons in 28 line. We desire to congratulate you upon the out turn of these goods, hoth in appearance, finish and durability. We may state that we have tested these buttons, and have had them subjected to a pressure of 4,000 lb. hydraulic pressure.Some one wanted to know whether these buttons would break if they were put through a mangle. Let me say that the buttons, the use of which the honorable member for Wentworth is so strongly advocating, would burst off the garments of the wearer if he attempted even a decent sneeze. The letter continues -This, we consider, a very severe test, and as the buttons themselves come in contact with steam heated beds and have lost none of their lustre, it speaks well for the prospect of your Industry. It is our intention to use mother of pearl buttons almost exclusively on Pelaco guaranteed products in future, and look forward to continued business relations with your company.The honorable member for Wentworth, who represents an opposition firm, is anxious to close down this industry, yet Pelaco Limited desires to increase its business with it. That absolutely refutes the statement of the honorable member that the industry with which he is connected will not use these buttons, and does not want them. The figures quoted by the honorable member were taken from the report of the Tariff Board, but they were out of date even before the report was written. The Tariff Board stated that there were 25 persons employed in the industry. Today, 65 persons are employed in the industry. According to the report the selling price of 18-line buttons, at the time the evidence was taken, was 3s. 5£d. per gross. To-day the price is ls. 9d. per gross.","Item 106 (Buttons)","TARIFF PROPOSALS (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[12]/interjection[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

175,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,"CORSER, Bernard","K6Q","N/A","N/A","N/A",140,"- I have already shown that the honorable members statement is wrong. The whole argument against this industry is based on inaccurate figures. It may be said that the decrease in price has been considerable, but it must be realized that when the industry was in its infancy, the men employed at the works in Sydney were unaccustomed to the work. The whole of the cutting and polishing is done by hand. While the employees were becoming familiar with the work, naturally costs were high. The honorable member  also stated that this industry was worked and managed by foreigners. I have visited the works and ascertained for myself that only three foreigners are employed there, and that the management is directly under the control of Burns, Philp and Company. The three foreigners were imported so as to teach Australian workmen to make buttons. Any Australian industry that is willing to operate and at the same time to give Great Britain an opportunity to export certain articles to Australia free of duty in competition with it, is- at least acting fairly, is deserving of every encouragement, and should be protected from foreign countries which manufacture buttons under cheap-labour conditions. It is only by building up our industries and encouraging other countries to pay decent wages that we shall be able to solve many of the problems with which we are confronted to-day. The statements of the honorable member for Wentworth are not in accordance with fact, and have done considerable harm to the industry. I hope that honorable members will insist on giving it fair protection so that it may become established on a fair and reasonable basis.","Item 106 (Buttons)","TARIFF PROPOSALS (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[12]/interjection[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
176,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"DEIN, Adam","JUD","Lang","N/A","N/A",140,".- There are one or two points which I wish to make clear. The Minister stated definitely that the new duty was not protective. I am more- or less a strong protectionist, and I contend that any industry which has been started in Australia is entitled to a certain measure of protection. When moving my amendment, I said that the duty under . the Scullin tariff was excessive, that, on the Ministers own admission, the new duty afforded no protection at all, and that the object of my amendment is to avoid the two extremes. Having listened to the debate, I feel more convinced than ever that it is necessary for the amendment to be accepted by the committee. The Minister for the Interior (Mr. Parkhill), in the course of his  remarks, said that he had a great deal of sympathy for the workers. I believe that he has, but the fact that my views are different from his is no reason why he should infer that I have not the same degree of sympathy for the worker as he has. He mentioned the class of machinery in operation at the factory. There is a good deal of truth in what he has said, but the industry, being at the moment in its infancy, needed a certain type of machinery to enable its employees to learn to manufacture pearl buttons. Different machinery will be required when the men become thoroughly accustomed to the work. The honorable member for Wentworth stated that if the amendment were carried) the duty under the Scullin schedule would operate. Perhaps that is so, but if the amendment were carried, there would be nothing to prevent the Minister from laying on the table of this chamber to-morrow a schedule providing for a new duty that would immediately become operative. It has been said that the industry enjoyed a protection of up to 1,100 per cent.; now the Minister admits that it has no protection at all. If the amendment is carried, we shall avoid the two extremes. I ask honorable members to consider the position of the employees who rightly or wrongly have been engaged for the last eighteen months in an industry that is working full time, and producing a 100 per cent. Australian article. If we give the industry some encouragement, it will increase its efficiency, and reduce its prices. Its output will expand, and ultimately, it will employ an additional 200 hands.","Item 106 (Buttons)","TARIFF PROPOSALS (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[13]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
177,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FORDE, Francis Michael","F4U","Capricornia","N/A","N/A",141,".- Those who are opposed to the amendment have endeavoured to prove that this industry is uneconomic. So far as I can remember, every exponent of freetrade has used a similar argument against every Australian industry that has been established. When industries were set up for the manufacture of shirts and pyjamas, about which the honorable member for Wentworth (Mr. E. J. Harrison) knows so much, it was said that they were uneconomic; that cheaper garments could be imported from Japan, Europe and Great Britain, and that Australia should be content with exporting the raw materials and purchasing the finished products from the factories of the old world. But a new generation of Australians decided that charity should begin at home, and that, if Australia was to increase her population substantially, she must have, not only primary, but also secondary, industries. Consequently, shirt factories and other factories were established, and gave employment to a considerable number of our people. If the honorable member for Wentworth carried his argument to a logical conclusion, he would say that we should remove all tariff barriers and allow every finished article to be purchased in the cheapest market. In that event, whence would they come? They would be supplied by the factories of Japan and China, in which child labour is employed to turn out shirts, pyjamas, cotton piece goods and tweeds. I recall an eloquent speech that was delivered some years ago by the right honorable member for Flinders (Mr. Bruce), in which he castigated that type of Australian manufacturer who wanted 100 per cent, protection for his products, but at the same time wished to purchase his raw materials in the cheapest market in the world in preference to Australia. The right honorable gentleman then said  We must have consistency . If he were here to-night, he would probably ask the honorable member for Wentworth to be consistent; not to come, cap in hand, to the Government, as some one-eyed manufacturers did while I was Minister for Trade and Customs, asking for a virtual prohibition with respect to their products, and at the same time strenuously resisting the suggestion that they should purchase their raw materials in Australia. I have had quoted to me by manufacturers cases in which they could procure their material from Japan, Europe and England at a much cheaper rate than that at which it could be obtained in Australia. They wanted all kinds of duties taken off those raw materials. The honorable member for Wentworth is a sample of that type of inconsistent Australian manufacturer. What do we find that other countries are doing? This mornings Canberra Times publishes a cablegram from Calcutta, which reads -Mainly as a result of abnormal imports at low prices by the Japanese, through the depreciation of the yen, the Indian Government yesterday increased the import duty on cotton piece goods, not of British manufacture, from 20 per cent, to 50 per cent, nd valorem.","Item 106 (Buttons)","TARIFF PROPOSALS (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[14]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

179,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FORDE, Francis Michael","F4U","N/A","N/A","N/A",142,"- I am endeavouring to show that, instead of reducing the duties on goods imported from Japan, India is increasing them. Because of the depreciation of the Japanese exchange, the 25 per cent, duty imposed on these buttons will be completely counterbalanced and will prove useless to the Australian industry. let us examine the assertion of a threatened retaliation by Japan because of the imposts on her products. The total imports of buttons amounts to £35,000 per annum. Yet we are told that Japan is going to retaliate, and that she will not purchase Australian wool if these high duties continue to be imposed. The duties on silk, as well as on piece goods and shirts and pyjamas, hit Japan very much more severely. In 1921 the duty imposed on apparel from Japan waa 40 per cent, ad valorem. In September, 1925, it was increased to 60 per cent, ad valorem, by a political party of the same brand as that which now sits behind the Government. The value of the imports of apparel from Japan fell, as a result, from £126,000 per annum to £39,000 per annum. The value of the imports of shirts, collars and pyjamas,, which as apparel pay the rates of duty I have just mentioned, fell from- £32,000 in 1922-23 to £859 in 1926-27, when the- higher duties imposed under the Massy Greene tariff commenced to operate.","Item 106 (Buttons)","TARIFF PROPOSALS (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[14]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

181,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FORDE, Francis Michael","F4U","N/A","N/A","N/A",142,"- I was replying to the argument that we mud dispense with the duty on pearl buttons lest Japan should refrain from purchasing our wool.Notwithstanding all the nonsense that is talked by freetrade advocates of  hands off the products of Japan  it will be found that in 1930-31 that country purchased  from Australia 1,535,000 centals of wool, valued at £6,477,000 - the largest quantity ever imported by Japan from this country. The assertion that Japan will retaliate is merely a subterfuge that is resorted to by the advocates of freetrade, or the big softgoods merchants in Australia, who are opposed to the establishment of Australian factories because they wish to purchase in the cheapest markets of the world their apparel and everything else that they sell. Any one who has followed the debate impartially must come to the conclusion that this young industry, which to-day is employing 65 persons, needs reasonable protection in order to develop and increase the number of its employees to 250. It is not necessary that it should be given , the protection afforded to it by the Scullin Government, because to-day it is on a better footing than it then was, and could manage on one-half of what was then afforded to it, as the honorable member for Lang (Mr. Dein) proposes. The honorable member for Wentworth says that it is not worth protecting, because there are in it three foreigners who were brought to this country to teach Australians the trade. Is it not a good thing in the case of new industries to bring foreigners to this country to teach our artisans? The boys and girls who are now being trained will one day be able to do without the advice and the tutelage of these foreigners. No case has been made against the amendment.

That is not the case. Honorable members need have no fear that, by voting for the amendment, they would revive what they regard as excessive rates. All that is asked is that the debate shall be postponed.. The honorable member who moved the amendment stated that it was his intention that there should be a revision of the excessive rate previously imposed, and indicated a lower rate of duty.I have listened to the debate throughout the day, and have considered the matter very carefully. I liked the tone in which it was introduced by the Minister. He practically informed the committee that the matter had been before the Tariff Board, which made a report upon it, and that it was then referred back to the board, which stated that it could see no reason for altering its recommendation. The honorable gentleman, in effect, left it to this committee to decide whether something ought to be done. His was not an attitude of rigid opposition, but a particularly fair one. Therefore, I was rather surprised when, later, another Minister intervened, and spoke strongly against any alteration of the proposal submitted by the Government. He left the impression that no other idea could be entertained. I prefer to pin my faith to the Minister who is in charge of the business of the committee. Having listened to the debate, and having read carefully the report of the Tariff Board, I am satisfied that under existing conditions the duty asked for by the applicants is excessive. I can understand the reason for the tariff that was imposed by the Scullin Government, though I might not agree in detail with their proposals. At the time that Government commendably had in view the object of reducing imports and thus obtaining for Australia a favorable trade balance.","Item 106 (Buttons)","TARIFF PROPOSALS (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[15]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

That Government was perfectly justified in taking whatever steps it considered necessary to put Australia on a sound basis. Its example, I remind the committee, was followed by Great Britain. But in the circumstances of to-day the rate then imposed has become excessive. Therefore, we are perfectly justified in asking for its revision in a downward direction. I consider that this Parliament, having deliberately imposed a duty, issued an invitation to those who had capital and were willing to establish an Australian industry, to invest their money in such a venture. These people, on the faith of the action taken by Parliament, established this industry, and induced a number of working men to invest their capital, which is their labour, in it. Consequently, it seems to me that Parliament cannot say  Having induced you to erect this structure, we shall destroy its foundations regardless of what happens to your capital. I shall vote for the amendment, not for the purpose of indicating the particular duty that should be imposed, but so that the matter may be further investigated with a view to seeing whether justice cannot be done to those who have put their capital and labour into the industry.

The honorable gentleman stated that that effect would be a reversion to the Scullin tariff. That is not correct. The schedule that has been tabled would continue to operate until another was brought down. Honorable members should thoroughly understand that that is the position.I wish to reply briefly to the interjection of the honorable member for Fawkner (Mr. Maxwell) concerning the employment of Japanese in the pearling industry. Japanese divers are employed solely because white divers will not do the work. One diver in a season may produce 30 tons of mother-of-pearl . shell, which would be sufficient to keep eighteen or twenty Australian workmen engaged for a year in the manufacture of buttons. The Pelaco Company, the leading Australian manufacturers of shirts, collars, and pyjamas, has gone out of its way to pay a tribute to Australian pearl buttons, and has undertaken to use them. The Minister for the Interior (Mr. Parkhill) said that I .was endeavouring to bolster up the pearl shell industry in North Australia. That is true. I believe in encouraging any industry which I think can be operated on an economic basis. That is the case with the pearl button industry, because the raw material is produced in Australia. Eighty per cent, of the worlds output of pearl shell comes from Australian waters, and our manufacturers of buttons should be in a commanding position to capture the local market and export extensively. Great Britain will not give concessions in respect of Australian meat, because it can obtain its supplies more conveniently and more cheaply from Argentine; but it is obliged to buy pearl shell from Australia. Many Australian industries are being bolstered up by bounties and other means, but the pearl shell industry, in both the primary and secondary branches of production, will not need such artificial assistance. Once manufacture has become established with the aid of reasonable protective duties, it will be able to stand on its own feet. If the honorable member for Wentworth (Mr. E. J. Harrison) had his way, Australia would soon see a reversion to those deplorable conditions which have caused some of our leading citizens to form anti-sweating leagues in the various cities. Australia has an opportunity to establish a profitable natural industry and to supply buttons to the world. This committee has to decide whether that valuable opportunity shall be taken or neglected.","Item 106 (Buttons)","TARIFF PROPOSALS (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[16]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
188,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"GREGORY, Henry","KFE","Swan","N/A","N/A",144,".- I hope that the Government will not depart from the attitude it has adopted. One is tempted to wonder how many honorable members have been  buttoned  by the representatives of the manufacturers. How many representatives of the workers have read this paragraph in the Tariff Boards report -Witnesss firm has an extremely large output, manufacturing approximately 10,200 garments weekly in the shirt and pyjama section, requiring the employment of 200 operatives, with a total weekly wage of £450.The total cost of imported buttons used by the firm in twelve months is £967. Working on the basis of the price list of the PearlButton Manufacturing Company Limited of the 10th June, 1931, the cost of the same quantity of buttons of local manufacture would be £5,546. The use of locally-produced buttons, would, therefore, impose on the firm an additional burden of £4,579 per annum.The difference in the price of buttons would increase the cost of the workers shirts and pyjamas by £4,579 for no other purpose than to help an industry which the Tariff Board has declared to be ill conceived. The granting of a concession to one firm of manufacturers would treble the cost of buttons required by the shirtmakers, and add to the cost of living. The honorable member for Capricornia (Mr. Forde) spoke of the number of people who would be employed by the pearl-button industry. I do not forget the huge importations of galvanized iron and other commodities before the honorable member imposed embargoes on exports in order to increase employment. Ever since 1920 we have been told of the increased employment which high duties would give, but each little addition to the rates has added something to the cost of living, which is now higher than in any other country in the world. The higher cost of cotton yarn is an illustration of the consequences of the high protection policy. The Tariff Board reported strongly against the claims of the pearlbutton company. Out of consideration for honorable members, the Minister referred the item back to the board, which has since declared that it sees no justification for altering its recommendation. I hope the committee will endorse that attitude.","Item 106 (Buttons)","TARIFF PROPOSALS (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[17]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
189,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"ROSEVEAR, John","L08","Dalley","N/A","N/A",144,".- It is obvious that the industries at present established in Australia are incapable of providing work for all our people, and all honorable members profess to be deeply interested in increasing the avenues of employment by the development of new industries. Although the amendment before the committee will reduce by 50 per cent, the protection previously afforded the manufacturers of pearl buttons, it will at least give to the industry an opportunity to continue and expand. It would mean a new avenue for the absorption of surplus labour. If honorable members accept the Governments proposal the industry will go out of existence. Our choice to-night is not between protection and free trade, but between a white Australian labour and cheap coloured labour - between keeping in existence an industry capable of giving clean employment to many of our growing youths, and letting it disappear. The .people engaged in it are not afraid of competition from buttons manufactured by white labour in any other part of the world, but they say that they cannot face the competition of the cheap labour products of Japan under the rates proposed by the Government. Some honorable members say that Japan will not buy our wool if we exclude cheap Japanese competition. But that country does not buy Australian wool because Australia buys Japanese buttons. Japan buys our wool because it needs it and will still need it, no matter what tariff we impose on buttons. The honorable member for Wentworth (Mr. E. J. Harrison) is opposed to this new industry because he says that if we afford it adequate protection the price of a few buttons used on a shirt would be increased.","Item 106 (Buttons)","TARIFF PROPOSALS (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[18]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I hesitate to think that the workers of this country, badly placed as they are to-day, would not pay Id. more for a shirt if they realized that the buttons on it were produced by Australian labour instead of cheap foreign labour. Although many eulogies have been uttered about the Tariff Board, it is a notable fact that even the Government itself, when it suits it to do so, departs from the recommendations of that board. The members of the board cannot rid themselves of their political leanings, and it is quite probable - although they may not make the fact public - that they allow those leanings to influence their judgment. I give the honorable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory) every credit for his views.","Item 106 (Buttons)","TARIFF PROPOSALS (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[18]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

195,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"ROSEVEAR, John","L08","N/A","N/A","N/A",145,"- That board was dealing with the whole of the output of Australia, involving millions of shirts, when it assumed that shirt-buyers would be called upon to pay an extra £5,000 because of the duties on pearl buttons.I pass now to the attitude taken up by honorable members of the Country party. There is an analogy between the tobacco-growing industry and the pearl button industry. Both were encouraged to expand under a high tariff wall, but that tariff wall has suddenly been knocked away, and both are now at the mercy of unfair competition from cheap labour countries. In other words the arguments that appealed to honorable members of the Country party to preserve the tobacco industry, apply with equal force to the need for preserving the pearl button industry. An attempt has been made to belittle the latter because of the importation of a few foreigners to instruct Australian workers. But many industries now carried on in Australia have been successfully established by the importation of overseas craftsmen, both British and foreign, to instruct Australian workers. The Minister for the Interior (Mr. Parkhill) quoted from the Tariff Boards report to show that the effect of the operation of the duties asked for by the industry would be to increase the cost of pearl buttons to the clothing manufacturers by about 250 per cent. As I have already said, the cost of the buttons on a single garment is so trifling, compared with the total cost, as to be almost negligible. If the inferior buttons made in cheap-labour countries were used on the shirts of the workers they would be wholly unsatisfactory, because they would probably disappear after the first washing, and theCOSt of replacing them would outweigh the initial advantage of the cheapness of the article.I am concerned not so much about the establishment of a new branch of private enterprise as about the preservation of an avenue of employment for the workers. Ample proof has been afforded in the last few years of the incapacity of the present industries in this country to provide sufficient work to keep our people employed. . Honorable members who oppose the companys request might reasonably be asked to sacrifice even something of their freetrade principles in the interests of the workers. Even if this industry has been established by means of high protection, it will open up a further avenue of employment, if its continuance is made possible by adequate duties. The amendment submitted by the honorable member for Lang (Mr. Dein) strikes the happy medium between an extreme protectionist policy and an attempt to break down the tariff wall.","Item 106 (Buttons)","TARIFF PROPOSALS (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[18]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
196,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"GREEN, Roland","KFA","Richmond","CP","N/A",146,". - I have risen because of the remarks of the Minister for the Interior (Mr. Parkhill). He quoted extensively from the report of the Tariff Board; but I point out that that report is considerably out of date. It was presented many months after the examination of the witnesses who appeared before the board, and it contains errors on major matters, with regard to both the number of men engaged in the industry and the prices stated. The honorable member for Wide Bay (Mr. Corser) gave instances of that to-night. It was unfair for the Minister to suggest that the industry was receiving protection equivalent to 1,100 per cent. The board, in mentioning that figure, was comparing the thin and cheap Japanese shell with the first-quality mother-of-pearl shell which was then, being manufactured by the Australian company. The honorable member for Wentworth (Mr. E. J. Harrison) , adopted similar tactics to those employed by the Minister. The Australian-made button is far superior in quality to the inferior article usually imported, and it is unfair to compare the prices.The local company is different from many others, which have admittedly indulged in profiteering practices on the Australian market. It introduced three overseers from abroad to teach Australian workers how to make buttons. Naturally some time elapsed before our workers gained any degree of efficiency; but, with increased experience, their output correspondingly grew, and the company was able to reduce its prices. The honorable member for Wide Bay showed to-night that the price of one class of button had been lowered from 3s. 5id. to ls. 9d. per gross. Some honorable members unwittingly, perhaps, have been quite unfair to the industry. As was pointed, out by the honorable member for Darling Downs (Sir Littleton Groom), the British preferential rates under the Scullin tariff were ½d. per line per gross and 15 per cent, ad valorem up to 20-line, and -Jd. per line per gross and 30 per cent, over 20-line. Under the general tariff the duty was Id. per line per gross and 25 per cent, up to 20-line, and Id. per line per gross and 50 per cent, exceeding 20-line. The request of the company is for exactly half the general rate validated under the Scullin tariff.We are told that, as a gesture of goodwill to Great Britain and the Empire generally, a further tariff schedule will be brought down after the return from ( Ottawa of the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Gullett). This company, as I have explained, has already made this gesture of goodwill. It asked for a general tariff of about one-half the protection already given and offered no objection to British preferential tariff being, free, as against the present rate of 15 per cent.I appeal to the committee to agree to the postponement of the item so that the Government may give it further consideration and, possibly, alter the duties in the direction indicated. I leave this matter to the good sense of the committee, believing that honorable members will appreciate the generosity of the company concerned.","Item 106 (Buttons)","TARIFF PROPOSALS (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[19]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
197,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"RILEY, Edward Charles","KYX","Cook","N/A","N/A",146,".- This item affects an industry which was established by an enterprising Australian firm under protective duties introduced by the Scullin Government and accepted by this Parliament. In the circumstances the committee has a tremendous responsibility, for while the industry concerned may be comparatively small it gives employment to 50 or 60 operatives, and there are encouraging possibilities of expansion. The opinions expressed by honorable members of the respective parties in this chamber justify the acceptance of the amendment. Much has been said for and against the industry, and I regret that many statements entirely foreign to the debate have been imported into it. We have been informed by the Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons) that important tariff changes will be made following the return of the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Gullett) from the Ottawa Conference. To what extent those tariff alterations will affect this and other items in the schedule before us I do not know; but, in view of the early possibility of Parliament being called upon to consider further amendments to the tariff as a result of the Ottawa Conference decisions, the Minister might very well agree to the postponement of this item. Like other honorable members, I desire to do all that is possible to foster industries which will utilize Australian raw material, and I am convinced that if further consideration is given to this item our trade with Japan and other countries will not be prejudicially affected. Japan is one. of our best customers in the wool trade; but as we all know, Japan buys our wool because she needs it for her manufacturing industries.The honorable member for Wentworth (Mr. E. J. Harrison) went out of his way to oppose the views of honorable members on this side of the committee. I regret his general attitude to the item. He is identified with a branch of the clothing industry that enjoys adequate protection, and I suggest that if protection is necessary for the manufacturer of articles of mens, boys and womens wear, it is equally necessary for those engaged in the manufacture of articles required by the clothing trade. This industry, I repeat, is capable of expansion. I am looking forward to the time when it will embark upon the manufacture of a vast range of buckles and fancy lines which at present are imported. I hope that the Minister will sympathetically consider the points of view that have been advanced. The committee, I believe, is fairly evenly divided upon this item. It will not be satisfactory to the Government if it is passed by only two or three votes, nor, on the other hand, will it be satisfactory to those interested in the industry to know that its continued existence depends on the same slender margin of votes. For this reason I appeal to theMinister to accept the amendment of the honorable member for Lang (Mr. Dein) and agree to the postponement of the item so that it may receive further consideration. I am not satisfied with the way in which this matter was referred to the board. No fresh evidence was placed before it, and the board could not be expected to vary its recommendations in the absence of such evidence. If a new inquiry were ordered, I feel confident that the information which would be placed before the board would induce it to bring in a recommendation different from the last.","Item 106 (Buttons)","TARIFF PROPOSALS (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[20]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

201,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"GREGORY, Henry","KFE","Swan","N/A","N/A",148,".- On several occasions I have drawn attention to reports of restraint of trade. Yesterday I made a request of the Assistant Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Perkins) and have since received the following reply: -Yesterday the honorable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory) asked what action had been taken in respect of certain allegations of restraint of trade in connexion with the sale of wire nails and barbed wire. The honorable member referred to an allegation that, unless the manufacturer refrained from selling his goods in New South Wales and Queensland and raised his prices £6 per ton, reprisals would follow.I take it that the reference is to a manufacturer of wire nails and barbed wire in Victoria, and to reprisals by the New South Wales manufacturers of wire from which wire nails and barbed wire are produced.There are a number of manufacturers in Victoria of wire nails and of barbed wire. These are dependent on the New South Wales manufacturers of wire for supplies of the wire from which the nails and barbed wire are made. The New South Wales manufacturers mentioned also make barbed wire and nails.Some time ago complaint was made by the Victorian manufacturers that the New South Wales makers had reduced their prices of nails and barbed wire considerably, but had not reduced their prices of the wire, so that the Victorian manufacturers of nails and barbed wire were placed at a considerable disadvantage.Investigations made by the department indicated that for some time there had been a price war  amongst the Victorian makers which had reduced the prices of their nails and barbed wire to levels which appeared to be unpayable. Their goods were being sold in New South Wales and Queensland at these low levels and the New South Wales manufacturers were forced they stated to reduce the prices of their goods to compete, and pointed out that such prices could not be maintained without heavy loss.The matter was referred to the Tariff Board for inquiry and report. This was in March last, but the Victorian manufacturers advised that they desiredto withdraw from the inquiry by the board, indicating that they had come to a satisfactory arrangement with the New South Wales manufacturers. The matter was therefore recalled from the board.The complaint was that the manufacturers of wire nails and barbed wire, who were also the drawers and suppliers of wire, dumped their goods in Melbourne, and insisted on the Melbourne merchants refraining from selling their goods in New South Wales and Queensland, and increasing their price in Victoria by £6 a ton. Section 15 of the Tariff Board Act provides -The Minister shall refer to the board for inquiry and report the following matters: -any complaint that a manufacturer is taking undue advantage of the protection afforded him by the tariff and in particular in regard to his -charging unnecessarily high prices for his goods; oracting in restraint of trade to the detriment of the public . . .Here is a definite charge of a restraint of trade. It appears that the influences which were brought to bear were sufficient to induce those who complained to withdraw their opposition. The Government should insist on the Tariff Board making a full inquiry into this matter. Eighteen months ago I read in this House a letter from Lysaghts stating that, owing to complaints in Parliament, they had decided to sell their goods to all and sundry, and adding that those merchants who were in the association would receive a special rebate which would enable them to undersell their opponents and still make a fair margin of profit. I trust that the Government will cause the fullest investigations to be made in order to ascertain whether or not undue advantage is taken of the policy of protection.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I was present during only a portion of the interview. As a result, correspondence continued between the companies concerned, and eventually the steps pointed out, in my letter were taken. Later, the case was withdrawn from the Tariff Board. I cannot see how the primary producers have suffered; they had the benefit of the trade war. Now that that trade war is over, and the companies are selling at legitimate prices, I do not know what can be done. I am not acquainted with all the details of this matter, and shall have further inquiries made. Similar complaints of restraint of trade have been made with respect of other articles, chiefly those in which iron and steel are used. The Government has done what it could, but its powers in these matters are limited. An investigation by the TariffBoard and a report by that body does not clothe the Government with any greater powers. I am of the opinion that in some of the States wrong things arc done; but the remedy lies with the States rather than with the Commonwealth.I shall cause further inquiries to be made, and will let the honorable member know the result.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
204,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"PAGE, Earle","C7E","Cowper","N/A","N/A",149,". - I was surprised at the Ministers remarks in reply to the honorable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory). Instead of the primary producers having benefited from a trade war they have been seriously disadvantaged by reason of their having been exploited by a combine which has a monopoly of the trade of Australia in certain lines, as the result of action taken by this Parliament. The position is that various manufacturers of barbed wire in Australia - not merely the firm mentioned bv the honorable member for Balaclava (Mr.White) - found themselves unable.to obtain their raw material at a lower price than Lysaghts charged for the completed barbed wire. Lysaghts tried to prevent other manufacturers from competing with them, and eventually they forced their competitors out of business. The matter was brought before the Minister, who threatened an examination by the Tariff Board. The firm having a monopoly then went to the other manufacturers, and entered into an agreement with them to raise the price of barbed wire by £2 5s. a ton. That was done on the 11th May last, at which time the price of wool was lower than it had been for five hundred years. Mr. Scullin, when Prime Minister, said that if any cases of exploitation and profiteering were brought under the notice of his Government he would appoint a committee to inquire whether there had been a restraint of trade. This is a case where the Minister should examine the whole of the facts. When Iraised the subject the Prime Minister said that the allegations were not correct, that the prices of certain other types of wire had been reduced. I pointed out that the price of this particular wire had been increased. Senator Greene, the Assistant Treasurer, said that the Government of New South Wales was the right tribunal to deal with the matter. The government of every State in the Commonwealth will have to deal with it, because prices are being pushed up in every State. But it is not the task of State governments to police the tariff; that comes within the province of the Federal Parliament, and I trust that this Parliament will take some action in the matter.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The nail manufacturers of Victoria complained that wire nails and barbed wire were being sold by a subsidiary company of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited at a price which was about equivalent to that of the raw materials. They had to buy their raw materials from the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited. I asked if the manufacturers could have their material brought in under item 404, and the Minister promised to refer the proposal to the Tariff Board. An inquiry would have been made, but the . parties concerned evidently got together, and agreed that the matter ought not to be proceeded with. The Minister did the right thing, and all that could be done to investigate the matter. The fact that prices have gone up indicates that the price war is ended, and that prices are now more or less normal. I speak from the point of view of the Victorian manufacturers. It is difficult to see how the Government could have done any more. Had witnesses been subpoenaed they would have been hostile.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The honorable member and the present Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Gullett) were particularly free in making charges of tariff exploitation; but both have backed down since becoming responsible Ministers. I repeat what I said when Prime Minister - that if advantage is taken of a protective tariff to exploit the community and restrain trade, I shall be prepared to use every power the Government possesses to punish offenders. In fairness to the firm now charged, an investigation should be made, and in fairness to this Parliament that provides the protection, the evidence should be sifted carefully by an impartial inquiry. Unfortunately, the powers of this Government are limited by the Constitution. It should possess the powers over trade and commerce that are possessed by the States. It is also unfortunate that, if a tariff rate is removed because of the action of one person or body of people, many who are innocent may be penalized. I recall that in all the cases investigated by my Government the exploitation took place in distribution. Honorable members will remember that the names and addresses of those concerned were announced in this chamber. That is a power that this Government possesses. Where it cannot deal directly with those concerned, it can at least give them an advertisement which will not be to their advantage.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/speech[6]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
