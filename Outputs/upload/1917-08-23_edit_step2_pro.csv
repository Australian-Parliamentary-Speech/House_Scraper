He did not think that was fair.The Premier said it was not a matter for the State Government, but for the Federal authorities to see that the men wore properly treated. It was not lack of appreciation on the Governments part, but it should be done on proper business lines.Mr. Whitsitt said that one. man who had come back with Mb jaw gone bad left his father killed in action in France, and yet he was compelled to travel well over 100 miles to hospital, and pay his own railway fare. The Tasmanian Government should not be so mean or so shabby as to allow their own soldiers to be treated like that. The Federal Government had no regard for Tasmanians.Will the Prime Minister ascertain whether those statements are founded on facts? I do not believe that they are.","AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL FORCE","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[1]/question[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Included amongst them are lighthouse construction, the Arsenal, and. the Naval Bases. I think that we should have at this stage a general discussion on the action of the Government in distributing proposed expenditure on various new works over the revenue schedule now before us, and a loan schedule which will subsequently be considered. In last years Estimates there was no provision for any expenditure out of loan funds on new works, buildings, &c, whereas this year the Government provide in the loan schedule for an expenditure of £2,742,725. The Treasurer in his Budget speech led the House and the country to believe that the Government were effecting a saving of about £3,000,000 on public works. Upon examination of these Estimates we find that, whereas last year about £4,000,000 was paid out of revenue on account of new works and buildings, this year the Government propose to expend, out of revenue on these services only £1,200,000. It would thus appear at first sight that, as compared with last years figures, there is a saving of over £3,000,000 in this expenditure. The actual fact is, however, that the Government have transferred to loan account a large proportion of the expenditure paid last year out of revenue. It is a mere juggling with the figures dealing with the services of the Commonwealth. There should be a general discussion on this action on the part of the Government.","Department of Works and Railways","ESTIMATES, 1917-18","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

My objection is that they led the people outside to believe that they had effected a saving of over £3,000,000 in these Estimates, whereas they have merely reduced the amount to be spent out of revenue, and. made provision for practically the same expenditure out of loan fund. Several of these items call for discussion. There is, for instance, the proposed vote of £16,500 for public offices at Geraldton, a comparatively small town in Western Australia, having a population of about 4,000. There are Only three Customs officers in that town, and only twenty-four officers employed in the whole of the postal services of the district. I consider that it is an absolute wast© of money to spend so large an amount on the erection, of Commonwealth buildings in such a town.

In other words, the Government would rather tax for public works than for the war. I agree that interest and pensions should be met out of revenue, but this allocation of £13,000,000 is, broadly speaking, for war purposes. I have nob gone into the items, but I doubt if for this year £13,000,000 is necessary for interest and pensions; at any rate, if it is necessary this year, God help us in the future ! When we have such an enormous amount set apart for the war it seems strange to insist on a system of borrowing for public works, especially when we have not had such borrowing in the past. Mr. Fisher, when Treasurer, made special arrangements for the expenditure on the east-west railway, and for the Commonwealth Buildings in London, the money being taken out of the note issue; and I cap see no reason for the present change, unless it is the ambition of the Treasurer to carry out his idea of, as far as possible, passing on these charges to the future. If* at the present time, there was an abnormal expenditure on public works I could understand the departure, but with the present restrictions I see no need for borrowing. Finance may not be my specialty, but even the knowledge I have causes me to look at the proposal with some shade of fear, the more so when I remember the Treasurers ideas on the subject. I know it is useless voting against the proposal, because the brutal majority behind the Government will carry it. However, I hope the Ministry will not allow the Treasurer to carry out his idea of borrowing,, especially, as I say, when there are so many restrictions upon the expenditure on public works. A good deal of trouble has been caused, not  only by the decrease of public works on the part of the Commonwealth Government, but also by similar action on the part of the State Governments, and that is why I am pleased that the Government are making provision for certain loans to the States for public works. It is to the restriction placed upon public works that most of the industrial unrest of today is due. I can understand the honorable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) smiling when I make that statement, but I know it is true.

My object in rising is to offer a few remarks in regard to certain objections which have been voiced to the erection of a new post-office and Customs House at Geraldton, which is in my constituency. First of all, I draw attention to the fact that the item is a re- vote. In fact it was placed on last years Estimates by the Administration of which the Leader of the Opposition was a member, holding the portfolio of Minister for Trade and Customs. I had occasion to interview the Works Department in regard to this building, and found that the matter had been referred to the Customs Department and to the Postal Department. At the time I was not desirous of seeing any large expenditure undertaken in connexion with public buildings, because of the outbreak of the war, and the Government also were not anxious to put up this building at Geraldton for the same reason, but a few thousand pounds was provided on the Estimates, so that if the position of affairs improved later on they could go on with the work. On this occasion the Minister has simply taken care to see that he will be in a position to commence the work if he feels it is necessary to do so towards the end of the financial year. Geraldton is a very important town. Over half-a-million pounds worth of wool was taken to Geraldton this year to be appraised. It is the commercial centre for a large agricultural district, and for the whole of the Murchison gold-fields. A new post office is necessary because of the wretchedly insanitary condition of the present building. It must be remembered that Geraldton is very close to the tropics. There are about twenty employees engaged in the building, and the accommodation is very cramped: I presume that the departmental officers in considering the question of putting up a new building, anticipated that a larger office would be required, not only for postal purposes, but for Customs and other Federal officials.","Department of Works and Railways","ESTIMATES, 1917-18","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Instead of the Leader of the Opposition seeking to make a point out of this proposed building at Geraldton, in order to reflect on the present Administration, he should draw attention to the awful scandals in connexion with the buildings at the various Naval Bases. For instance, it is proposed to spend £500,000 in the bush on buildings which will provide no facilities for the general public, and upon which extravagance of the grossest type has been exercised for the last few years.

When it returns to sanity in regard to its political faith, and throws out the supporters of the present Government, it will have less than nothing if the policy of grants for political support is pursued. It has little enough now. The Ministerial party gained in Queensland three senators and one member of the House of Representatives at the last election.","Department of Works and Railways","ESTIMATES, 1917-18","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[6]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We cannot hope to meet our war expenditure out of revenue. But we have certainly a right to expect that the ordinary expenses of the country will be met out of revenue, and that to some extent our war expenditure also will be defrayed from those special revenues which are being raised at the present time. If that is not done, why have we a demand for extra taxation? Either our ordinary expenditure has increased, demanding extra taxation, or, if it has decreased, there is no need for the extra taxation. Members of the Government have talked a good deal lately about the necessity for economy. Some time ago, the Minister for the Navy was very free in his remarks in regard to the need for a very drastic reduction of expenditure. Sensational statements have been made, and platform speeches have been utilized to show the enormous extravagance that is taking place in the Public Service. If such extravagance exists, what indication have we that the Government propose to reduce expenditure? On the contrary, we find that items which previously were charged to revenue are now not met by the ordinary revenue, even supplemented by extraordinary taxation.

Out of those lump sums certain officers, with peculiar whims about particular works, have commenced undertakings which Parliament, if it had been consulted, would have refused to sanction. Unless a big works policy is carried out in the Territory, I cannot see that there will be any necessity for years to come, for any surface line in the Federal Capital Territory. However, I rose particularly to ask a question of the Minister for Works and Railways. Many of us have been waiting anxiously for the verdict of the Minister or the Cabinet in regard to the inquiries which have been made into the expenditure at! the Federal Capital, and I had hoped that when these Estimates were before us, the Minister would take the opportunity of elucidating the position.","Department of Works and Railways","ESTIMATES, 1917-18","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[8]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

149,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"HEITMANN, Edward","KH8","Kalgoorlie","N/A","N/A",1379,". - At the outset of my remarks, which will be brief, I wish to express surprise at the method of discussing the Estimates. This is the first time in my experience that, during a general debate on the Estimates, members have been allowed to discuss individual items. My purpose is to discuss financial questions generally, and I desire first of all to draw the attention of the Government to what, in my opinion, is a waste of money, and at the same time evidence of a lack of appreciation of the functions, of the Federal Government, and perhaps also of the State Governments. When the people were asked to vote upon the question of federating, they were led to understand by the political leaders of the day that the functions of the Federal and State Parliaments would be clearly defined, and that there would be no overlapping of the two authorities. Yet, in my opinion, several Departments of the Commonwealth are duplicating work which is done by the States, or vice versa. For instance, the administration of the Electoral Department is costing the Commonwealth about £60,000 per annum, and I think we may safely say that electoral administration is costing each State £25,000. Surely we have a right to expect an effort to be made to amalgamate the Electoral Departments as far as possible. Here we have Commonwealth and State electoral officers and * offices doing precisely the same work. The same may be said of the taxation Departments. I would urge upon the Treasurer the necessity of conferring with the various States in order that we might have one taxation office covering the whole* of the taxation matters, of the Commonwealth and the States. The present system of having separate Commonwealth and State offices and staffs is not only expensive but aggravating to the taxpayers, called upon as they are from time to time throughout the year to furnish State and Federal returns relating to their incomes.And so with our State banking institutions. I well remember the fight that took place between the States and the Commonwealth in regard to the proposal that the Commonwealth should encroach upon a business the conduct of which was considered at that time, at all events, to be the peculiar privilege of the States. We declare that we desire economy. The Government tell the people that they are reducing expenditure as much as possible, and yet we have Commonwealth and State banking institutions, both owned by the people, and dealing with the same people, with two expenditures, and with separate offices, side by side in the smallest of our villages, doing exactly the business which could be done just as well with only one office. The Treasurer will probably say that we cannot force the States to enter into a compact with the Commonwealth for the transaction of this banking business. Surely it is riot asking too much of responsible Ministers, who, by virtue of their positions, must be business men, to urge that instead of duplicating the work of banking, and attending to the surplus cash of the people of Australia, they should take steps to see that the work is done by only the one office in each town ! I hope that the Minister will make an effort to bring about at the earliest date the amalgamation of the electoral, taxation, and banking systems of the Commonwealth and States.Conferences have taken place between the Commonwealth and the States in regard to this question, but up to date veryMr. Heitmann. little has been done, save in the direction of uniform taxation methods; Having regard to the Treasurers Budget statement, I am disappointed with the Government efforts at economy when I find the expenditure of different Departments increasing. The expenditure of the Commonwealth Parliament itself is increasing year by year. Honorable members are expected to look closely into this expenditure, and, if possible, to curtail it. I notice, also, that even during these times of stress quite a number of Commonwealth officers are receiving more than small increases in salary.. I believe in paying a good man well for the work he does, but during this time of war the Government should be particularly careful in regard to increasing the salaries of officers of the Public Service when there is so much poverty outside. ,","Department of Works and Railways","ESTIMATES, 1917-18","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

153,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"TUDOR, Frank","KWL","Yarra","N/A","N/A",1380,".- I regret that the honorable member for Dampier is temporarily absent from the chamber, since I desire to refer to the item of £16,500 for the erection of public offices at Geraldton - an item in which he is interested. I am not likely to say in his absence, however, anything that I would not say in his presence. I have no desire to do any injury to Geraldton, or any other town, but I feel that it is time a halt was called in the erection of expensive public buildings out of all proportion to the needs of the district for whose services they are to provide. Here we are face to face with a proposed expenditure of £16,500, and if we agree to the item it will be rightly assumed that the Parliament approves of such expenditure.On reference to the Public Service list, I find that there are only three Customs officers at Geraldton, and some twenty-three or twenty-four postal officers. Two positions in the Postal Department there are vacant at present, and five members of the staff are on active service. Unless their positions are filled by temporary employees, there axe thus only some seventeen postal officers for whom we have to provide. There should be a thorough investigation into the whole matter. It is all very well to say that some honorable member who held office in a previous Administration agreed to the erection of Commonwealth offices at Geraldton, or somewhere else; but what is the actual position? I have always regarded as a well-considered rule the provision that we should not erect quarters for public servants where they can obtain accommodation outside. I think that the only exception I made to that rule was when the residence provided for an officer at Roeburne was swept away by a hurricane, and the man had no chance of obtaining outside accommodation. If there has been any departure from that rule so far as Geraldton is concerned - and I do not think there has been - there must have been some good reason for it. The post master at Geraldton receives £432 per annum, and the Chief Customs officer is in receipt of a salary of £335. I should say that it was not proposed to provide quarters for both these officers, and I certainly hold that, wherever possible, the provision for quarters should be struck out. If neither of these officers reside in these public buildings a caretaker might be necessary, but it is infinitely better to employ a caretaker whose family may assist him in cleaning the offices than to erect expensive quarters for the postmaster or the principal Customs officer.","Department of Works and Railways","ESTIMATES, 1917-18","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[10]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is not proposed to spend £16,000 upon a new Post-office in Geraldton during this year. Not more than £3,000 is provided for this year. It is a pity that the Minister in charge of the Estimates has not the information in regard to the receipts and expenditure of this particular post-office, because he could have shown that it is the third most important post-office in Western Australia outside Perth, and that its receipts are nearly equal to those of the Kalgoorlie Post-office. The present building is altogether inadequate.

The idea is to place all the Commonwealth buildings in the one block. That is a very desirable proposition. The post-office will serve not only a population of 5,000 in Geraldton itself, but also a population of between 30,000 and 40;000 in the district of which Geraldton is the centre. Around this town is the finest belt of wheat-growing country in Western Australia, a belt which is continually expanding; the copper mines of Northampton do their business through Geraldton, and the business of the Murchison goldfields, extending north and south for about 200 miles, also filters through the same town. In fact, there are about ten electorates in the State House which transact their business through Geraldton. Furthermore, it is the largest port on the western coast north of Perth.

Although that centre is an important one, that in itself would not, at the present time, warrant the expenditure of a large sum of money on a post-office there. It must be remembered, however, that the existing building is an abomination, and may be condemned by the health authorities at any time as insanitary for the twenty or thirty men that are employed in it. The building is an old stone one, and, as Geraldton is close to the tropics, it is often intensely hot. Were the present accommodation condemned, the Government would probably be compelled to get other premises. There are large buildings which were erected many years ago, and were not required for the purposes for which they were erected, which, probably, could be obtained, but they would not be suitable, because they are right away from the centre of the town. Last year money was put on the Estimates for the Geraldton Post-office, but I, as the member for the division in which the town is situated, did not urge the expenditure, because I thought that, this being war time, we ought not to spend more than was absolutely necessary. I think, however, that there should be some amount on the Estimates which the Government could use should it be compelled to do something to the building. The promise of the Minister for the Navy not to do anything until further information has been furnished should satisfy honorable members. If it be shown that health considerations require expenditure, I am sure that honorable members opposite will not object to the money being spent. While the present accommodation may be put up with, the building may at any time be condemned by the health authorities, and then the Government may be compelled to spend a large sum in alterations.","Department of Works and Railways","ESTIMATES, 1917-18","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[18]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

As a rule, once its Estimates are passed, a Government does not pay much attention to the remonstrances of Parliament. The expenditure of £16,500. in Geraldton should provide accommodation for a picture show or a circus in addition to , a post-office; it would pay for a much larger building than would serve a town with twice the population. I understand that there are about 5,000 persons living at Geraldton, so the proposed post-office will cost about £3 10s. per inhabitant. At the present time building materials are very costly. Steel has been used a good deal in Commonwealth structures of late years, and it is three times as costly now as it was a little while ago, and galvanized iron for roofing is four times as expensive as it was twelve months ago. We should let Geraldton put up with its present accommodation until building materials are obtainable at moderate prices. I believe that the people of Geraldton would be agreeable that this work should be postponed, and would commend us for practising economy. The expenditure of £16,500 at this port would not help to win the war, and I believe that when they have obtained further information on. the matter the Government will admit that they have been hasty in proposing to expend such a large sum in a place like Geraldton during war time.","Department of Works and Railways","ESTIMATES, 1917-18","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[19]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The erection of this building will not help us to win the war, or to do anything except to measure rainfall and record atmospheric conditions. That work can be very well done at the Observatory in Sydney. I sympathize with the honorable member for Wakefield (Mr. Richard Foster) when he states that items of expenditure should not be agreed to unless it can be shown that they are definitely and urgently necessary for the welfare of the Commonwealth. This Meteorological Bureau is a luxury. It piles up records, some of which are1½ inches in thickness, and members receive copies, which are immediately relegated to the waste-paper basket. That fact provides evidence that economy could be effected in the printing of matter of this kind, which should be distributed only amongst those people in the community wh6 understand it. The provision of buildings for measuring rainfall and wind velocity can very well be deferred to a time when it is not necessary to tax the people so heavily as they are being taxed at the present time in order to provide money for the carrying on of the war. Looking at these Estimates, one would imagine that a considerable saving is being effected in public works expenditure, but when to this total of £1,257,000 is added the proposed loan expenditure we have a combined total of over £4,000,000. These figures as to expenditure out of revenue would lead one to believe that we were making enormous reductions in the Works Estimates, when as a matter of fact we are not. We are here as a Win-the-war party to economize, and since this item will not help to win the war.

It will be remembered that about two months ago we practically shut down the works at the Federal Capital, and this vote is really to pay for works carried out up to the time we did so. There was a vote of about £20,000 for avenues, but that was knocked on the head, though one, I think the Adelaide avenue, had to be completed up to a certain time, and paid for to the extent of £5,000 or £6,000.

It has been constructed for about5½ miles from Queanbeyan to the power-house, and it is of 80-lb. rails, and will form part of the line across the Territory. It will run, as I say, to that part of the city known as the business centre, a distance of about 3½ miles. I do not know how much, but some work had been begun, including part of the bridge, when we ceased work; and it was suggested to me that it would be just as well to finish it. I know there will be a doubt about the expediency of doing so; and at first Cabinet intended not to go on with it, but the matter was considered, and it was thought better to complete the work.

I believe that we can save fully £2,000 or £3,000 on this item.

There is also in the Loan Estimates an item of £8,300 for the construction of a surface line of railway. It is generally agreed that the public works in the Territory which have already been constructed must be kept in good order, and that a certain expenditure is necessary to that end. But we should not spend anything on new works which are not necessary. As a member of the Works Committee, I have visited the Territory, and I know, that this surface line will not serve any useful purpose except constructional work. As a feeder to settlement it would be of very little value, being only 3 or 4 miles in length. As no constructional work is now going on, the railway is unnecessary. I hope that the Minister will take into consideration the suggestion of the honorable member for Maribyrnong (Mr. Fenton) that the rails and sleepers that have been ordered be stacked and stored, or, perhaps, used on some other railway. I hope, too, that he will take out of the Loan Estimates the item of £8,000 odd, providing for the construction of this surface line.","Department of Works and Railways","ESTIMATES, 1917-18","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[30]/continue[14]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

My opinion is that it is a Griffin proposal, sanctioned by the ex-Minister, and that the Engineer in Chief for Railways knows nothing about it. All matters of this kind should be submitted for report to our engineers, who are as competent to advise on engineering matters as any engineers in the country. If Parliament permits work to be sanctioned without the obtaining of professional advice, there will be a tremendous loss of public money. Parliament should see that Ministers who would sanction works without getting professional advice are not kept in office. Those (responsible for selecting such a Minister should take the blame of the present situation, instead of seeking to gain kudos by excitedly advocating the reduction of the item.

I have visited the principal quarantine stations in Australia, and am of the opinion that unless an epidemic be expected the proposed expenditure is grossly extravagant in the present time of war. If there is any expenditure which could at the present time be allowed to stand over, it is expenditure on the quarantine stations.

356,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"GROOM, Littleton","KFK","Darling Downs","NAT","Honorary Minister",1395,". - Although quarantine passed under the control of the Commonwealth some time ago, an investigation of the stations throughout the Commonwealth had to be made. It was found that in some of the States the conditions were such that we had to completely remodel the stations and establish new centres to meet the changed conditions. Last year, the sum of £80,000 was provided for the erection of new buildings and conveniences, and of that sum £76,522 was spent. I shall give to the Committee particulars of the amounts to be expended in each State, and the nature bf the proposed expenditure. For New South Wales we are providing £5,399, of which only £394 is for new works, which consist of sewerage and fencing. The balance is for the completion of works authorized last year. In Victoria, we estimate to expend £9,350 at Nepean and Royal Park. Of that amount, only £1,944 is for minor new works, including road making, fencing, sewerage, and minor alterations in buildings. In Queensland, the estimated expenditure is £12,838, of which £4,865 represents new expenditure, and the balance of the £12,838 provides for the completion of the new buildings at Lytton, Cairns, Townsville, and Thursday Island. It was realized that, owing to their adjacency to the Orient, it was important to have up-to-date quarantine buildings at our. northern ports. Of the amount of £4,865, £1,800 is for the provision of cottages for launchmen at Lytton, as a consequence of the new policy of examining the larger boats lower down the river. Other proposed works include disinfecting apparatus, tramway, and train at Thursday Island, and minor works, such as roadways, mortuary, mooring buoys, &c. Of the sum of £15,000 estimated for South Australia, all but £2,318 is for the completion of works previously authorized. The new work is the erection of a retaining wall to prevent the incursion of high tides at the quarantine station at Torrens Island. Western Australia is another State in which we have had to make extensive provision for quarantine purposes. The estimate this year is £15,415, of which new works will absorb £2,631, which will be used for improving the existing quarantine station at Geraldton, and some minor works at Geraldton and Bunbury. Only £1,440 is provided for Tasmania, and that includes £1,200 for the erection of a caretakers cottage and for carrying out other minor works as a commencement on the reconstruction of the quarantine station at Barnes Bay. Honorable members will understand from the particulars I have given that nearly the whole of the money asked for in these Estimates is for the completion of works previously authorized, and that we are not undertaking any new works of considerable magnitude.","Department of Works and Railways","ESTIMATES, 1917-18","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[36]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
357,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"TUDOR, Frank","KWL","Yarra","N/A","N/A",1396,".- The quarantine service was taken over by the Commonwealth, and a Director of Quarantine was appointed in 1909. When I was Minister for Trade and Customs, in 1910, the Government had under consideration a proposal for carrying out works which would bring the whole of the quarantine stations of Australia up to date. Before embarking upon the suggested expenditure, the Government sent Dr. Norris, the Director of Quarantine, on a trip round the world for the purpose of making investigations which would insure the expenditure of money to the best possible advantage. Since that date three or four Ministers have had control of the Customs Department, but I do not think the wisdom of sending Dr. Norris on that trip has ever been questioned. Any honorable member who has ever been in quarantine will admit that even the most up-to-date quarantine establishment in Australia - that at North Head, Sydney - is by no means perfect. I understand that most of the money provided on the Estimates is merely for the carrying out of. work that was recommended as a result of Dr. Norriss investigations. There has been one addition to those proposals, namely, the making of provision in Queensland to cope with any outbreak of yellow fever, the danger of which , has been increased by the opening of the Panama Canal. I think that all the money provided for quarantine works has been, and is being, spent to the best possible advantage. Another interesting item in this division is that of  Isolation hospitals for seamen, £9,118. At the present time, seamen and others employed on vessels who, on arrival in port, are found to be infected with venereal disease are treated in our quarantine stations. I am rather surprised that no part of the proposed expenditure under that heading is to take place in Victoria. I do not think any action has been taken to provide in this State an isolation hospital for such pases. As the result of certain occurrences, the Quarantine Department considered it necessary in the interests of the travelling public to make this provision. On the occasion of my last visit to the Sydney Quarantine Station, I saw there some twenty or thirty persons who had been taken off various vessels, and were suffering from venereal disease. The cost of the treatment of these cases is borne, not by the Commonwealth, but by the owners of the vessels from which the men are taken. Quarantine is practically an insurance against the introduction of disease into the Commonwealth, and we could scarcely spend our money in a better way than in bringing our quarantine stations as nearly as possible up to date. While I have taken, and shall take, exception to other items in these Estimates, I do not think any objection can be made to those relating to the quarantine service. The honorable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) proposed to make some reference to the item relating to the Serum Institute. When I held office as Minister for Trade and Customs it was decided to establish that institute, and Dr. Penf old was selected and asked to come to Australia to take charge of it.","Department of Works and Railways","ESTIMATES, 1917-18","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[37]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Last year, for the construction of conduits and laying wires underground, we appropriated £146,592 for New South Wales, £18,770 for Victoria, £34,080 for Queensland, £15,088 for South Australia, £29,000 for Western Australia, and £7,280 for Tasmania, and this year we are asked to appropriate a larger total, namely, £270,811, the whole of which has been transferred to loan account. Then, this year, no details are given, whereas last year all the necessary information was set out. Unfortunately, the Postmaster-General is away at present, but we ought to be afforded more information in regard to these particular items, considering that over  a quarter of a million of money, which was previously obtained from revenue, is now to be obtained out of the Loan Fund. We have not heard whether it is proposed to go on with this very necessary work, although during the past few years we have been laying the wires underground, and the whole of the experts agree that it is the better and cheaper way. I am anxious to hear the reason why the Government have adopted the policy of transferring to loan, works that hitherto have been paid for out  of revenue. In Victoria, as in the other States, some works of this kind have been paid for out of revenue, and some out of loan moneys; and this, of course, must cause difficulty in keeping the accounts clear. I should prefer the Government to follow the old procedure, adopted from, practically, the commencement of Federation, of paying for these works out of revenue. Those honorable members who were here in the first session will remember that, when the Estimates were before us, there was a proposal to borrow £500,000 for various works; but there was an amendment carried, which was taken as an instruction, that, as far as possible, necessary works should be constructed out of revenue. Of course, large works such as those connected with the Capital City and the transcontinental railway, may be constructed out of loan moneys, but it is a different matter in the case of comparatively small items.

Those who have any knowledge of the administration of affairs in Australia know well that in the past, State Governments have been condemned for having spent loan moneys on things for the use of the public which have a very short life. Sir George Reid furnished Sydney Government House with crockery and spoons out of loan funds. I am pleased that the Government that I supported on my entry into public life decided to spend revenue on works with lives of short duration. I think I am correct in saying that though copper wire may have a long life the insulation surrounding the wire has a very short life, and that with the destruction of the insulation the copper wire becomes useless. Therefore I cannot agree to the inclusion of expenditure on undergrounding telephone wires in Loan Estimates.","Department of Works and Railways","ESTIMATES, 1917-18","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[42]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I cannot understand any Parliament entertaining such an unjust and erroneous system pf administering the affairs of the country as to spend loan funds on undergrounding wires for the telephone services. A poverty-stricken private firm might issue debentures in order to run its concern, but even .then its debentures would not have more than a few years life. Here we have a Government with a large revenue proposing to spend loan moneys on work that will have a very short life. A Papuan or an Australian aboriginal with a large sum of loan money at his back could manage the affairs of Australia as well as honorable members opposite are managing them now. No schoolboy would be so lacking in intelligence as to spend loan moneys on laying telephone wires underground. Since the telephones were first instituted in Sydney about twenty-five years ago the system has been altered five or six times, and we do not know that we have even now the most perfect system in operation. To ask the Parliament of Australia to permit of telephone wires, switchboards, and other telephone material being purchased out of loan moneys is to ask it to consent to the administration of affairs in a manner that is diametrically opposed to the best interests of the Commonwealth. It is asking unborn generations to pay for the telephones which we use to-day 3 I do not want my childrens children tt> pay for any advantages that I enjoy and should pay for. These telephone wires must deteriorate. The best insulation has not more than a life of ten years. The honorable member for Wakefield stated this afternoon that the Committee ought to accept the promise of the Minister for the Navy in regard to not proceeding with certain works, but my experience in this Parliament, and what I have seen in the New South Wales Parliament, tells me that when the Government of the day gets its Estimates, it does not care a snap of the fingers for what members may say. Parliamentary criticism then is of no more effect than a mustard poultice on a wooden leg for the curing of a cold.Unless we block these Estimates until some definite promise has been obtained from the Ministry, we shall not secure the reforms that we desire. It will be a disgrace to Parliament if we permit the charging to Loan Fund- of works which, in their nature, can have but a very short life. There is nothing in regard, to which members are, as a rule, so devoid of knowledge as the items which make up a set of Estimates, and I am more convinced of that at the present time than I ever was before. My present attitude is determined by principle, and would be the same if any other Government were in power. I take a keen interest in financial matters, and read everything relating to finance that comes my way. I admire a certain weekly journal for its contention that the State Parliaments and this Parliament have always been too ready to place to. loan account expenditure which should be borne out of revenue. Although the British Parliament is composed largely of lawyers and railway magnates, it is more careful in financial matters than are Australian politicians. But, even in the House of Commons, the conclusion has been come to that honorable members should have more information respecting Estimates than they have hitherto had, and arrangements have been made to that end. It is no pleasure to me to oppose the passing of these Estimates. My desire is to give the Government every assistance. I have prayed to God that it may bring forward some measure which will help to the winning of the war, but I cannot remain silent when it is proposed to pay for perishable works out of loan. We should get from the Government the promise that this will not be done.","Department of Works and Railways","ESTIMATES, 1917-18","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[42]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

When we reach the main items I hope that honorable members generally, and especially those who represent country constituencies, will have something to say in regard to the administration of the Postal Department in relation to the out-back districts. The way those districts are treated in the matter of mail and telephone services is absolutely disgraceful. We are always expressing a desire to get people to go out back and build up the country, and when they go there, Parliament will give them nothing. There is no greater enemy to the man in the back country than this Parliament. Everything that is required for the cities is given at once, but if a telephone or mail service is desired for a country district, the people are at once asked how much money they are prepared to guaranteed It is said,  This service will not pay. Put up 50 per cent, of any estimated loss upon it, erect posts along the route, and assist, us generously in building the line. The way in which the Department is treating out-back settlers is disgraceful. Only the other day the residents of a little country district were told that, unless they contributed £20 2s. a year towards an estimated loss of £40 a year on a projected mail service, they could not have it. A similar condition of affairs exists in regard to the telephone system. A perusal of the Postmaster-Generals report will show that an enormous loss has been sustained on telephone services within the metropolitan areas throughout Australia during the past two or three years. In the Sydney metropolitan area, for example, the loss the year before last amounted to £146,000, and last year to £116,000. Yet the people of Sydney have never been asked to guarantee a single sixpence of that loss. But when it is proposed to confer a few of the benefits of civilization on settlers in remote parts of this continent, they are told that they must furnish substantial guarantees against possible loss.Mr.Fenton. - If the honorable member will bring forward a definite proposal upon this question, he will command the support of quite a large number of members of this Committee.","Department of Works and Railways","ESTIMATES, 1917-18","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[46]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

There were also big losses in Melbourne and Perth. All these city services should be compelled to pay before the country districts are called upon to furnish guarantees. The Department is treating the rural areas of the Commonwealth altogether too harshly.

Applications come in for extensions in country districts to meet the development of those districts, and, as a matter of fact, we do not know at the present moment what particular cases or lines these votes will cover. It is, however, known from the experience of the Post and Telegraph Department that these votes will be devoted in the main, if not wholly, to country expenditure. . A general vote is included in the Estimates for applications for telephones and extensions to districts during the year. People send in applications for the construction of country lines-","Department of Works and Railways","ESTIMATES, 1917-18","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[48]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I have in my hand a letter from the Deputy Postmaster-General in reference to a town which for thirty or forty years has had two mail services.

492,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"SPENCE, William","KUF","Darwin","N/A","N/A",1406,".- My complaint is that in regard to postal matters enough money is not asked for. I cannot understand honorable, members criticising these Estimates so severely! It is supposed to be a business Department, but it has never been provided with a sufficient working capital. As has been explained by the Honorary Minister, a great deal of the money which the Committee is now asked to pass is for the carrying on of necessary work which has to be done during the financial year. If the work had to be planned out before voting the money there would be an immense delay.Regarding the automatic telephone exchanges, it is generally recognised that they have proved a very great success. At Perth, as well as at Geelong, when I was in charge of the Department, the Chamber of Commerce took the trouble to ask its members to report their experience of the working of the automatic exchange. On the receipt of the reports, the chamber passed a resolution expressing their great satisfaction with the system. In Sydney the automatic exchange is working satisfactorily, too. I understand that a portion of the new money on these Estimates is wanted to make the connexion complete.- I am surprised to hear that Malvern has only reached the stage when it is to have an automatic exchange. When the war broke out, in 1914, the Malvern exchange was so congested that we had to refuse to accept more subscribers. It was in such a disgraceful condition that no more business could be undertaken. On the Estimates of the Department for that year I put down a very large sum - something like £300,000, I think. We were aiming at an extension of the cables and the installation of the automatic principle in the exchanges. The instruments, of course, involved a very considerable sum. Owing to the war we had a reduction in the number of subscribers. An increase in the telephone rates also affected the subscribers list. I presume that through the operation of these two factors, more particularly the war. the Department has had to struggle along.  It is really, surprising to me that it has been able to exist so long with the money at its disposal. The very large sum which I had put on my Estimates was cut down by the desire of the Treasurer, Mr. Fisher; otherwise, more automatic exchanges would have been in operation to-day.I desire to say a few words regarding the difference between Sydney and Melbourne. It is, and always will be, far more costly to establish and work a service in Sydney. The country is very rough, the city is divided by the harbor waters, ^ the cables have sometimes to be put under the water, and the streets are very crooked, many of t.hem running into dead ends. Solid rock has to be cut to lay the cables. In Melbourne we find alluvial formation and long streets. There is no comparison between the° two cities as regards overhead wires. Sydney is more subject to storms than is Melbourne. The repairs cost more, and there are far more angles to be run. These reasons often explain the difference in the estimated and actual cost of the original work and the difference between the estimated and actual cost of working. The Department has always lacked sufficient working capital. At the same time, as it is a Government Department, I recognise that it is proper that the Estimates of any work should come before Parliament for approval, particularly in regard to the larger works that have to be planned some time ahead. The Collingwood exchange is a case in point.","Department of Works and Railways","ESTIMATES, 1917-18","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[51]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

494,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"SPENCE, William","KUF","N/A","N/A","N/A",1407,"- When I was Postmaster-General there was an idea of making a re-arrangement in regard to that particular exchange for the purpose of connecting the existing subscribers. The work was mapped out, but pressure upon the finances prevented the completion of the scheme. It is three years since we planned these automatic exchanges, and I am surprised that it has taken so long to supply particulars of all these works. I see no reason why there should be any hesitation in giving information as to when they will be put in hand. My complaint in regard to the other expenditure that is not specified is that the amount is not big enough. The Postmaster-General is absent, but there will be another opportunity of bringing matters under his attention. ,I agree with the honorable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) that the country interests are unfairly treated. I do not think that people should be called upon to give guarantees. My idea was to raise the charges, and in that way make the people pay for the service given. The Postmaster-General has had under consideration for some time some suggestions that I have put before him in regard to giving improved facilities in country districts, and I know that he is collecting information in regard to the matter. I was very much surprised to find that the telephone exchanges in fairly large towns in the Darwin electorate were closed at 6 oclock. For instance, Ulverstone formerly had a continuous service, but the Department increased the amount of revenue which would justify a continuous service, from £150 to £250, and as the people of that town were not able to provide a revenue of £250, although they were able to provide within a few pounds of that amount, their continuous service was cut off. It causes a great deal of annoyance to the people of the town. In the neighbourhood of these towns in the Darwin electorate the -problem of closer settlement has been solved. There are small farms of 50 acres and 100 acres of rich land, so that the farm houses are very close together. The farmers are willing to use the telephone service, but as they work away from their houses during the day, the exchange is closed by the time they get home to their tea. I have urged the Minister to extend the hour to 8 oclock. This would enable the farmers who have the telephone to do their business when they return from their work at night, and I am .sure it would lead to yan extension of the use of the service. In my opinion, the telephone should be installed in every farm house. Iri the case of the neighbourhoods of these towns in the Darwin electorate no great extension of lines would be required, so that the cost to the Department would not be very great. The Minister is collecting information in regard to the cost, and so on; but I have suggested to him that the exchanges should not be closed in some cases until 8 oclock, and in other cases until midnight. I have also suggested that there should be continuous service in other cases. In the Darling electorate there is a continuous service in towns not a quarter of the size of some of the towns in the Darwin electorate. The Postal Department takes as a basis the revenue received in the particular office, whereas in the Darwin electorate there is a considerable trunk-line revenue between different adjacent towns. I have suggested to the Minister that if he is to consider the revenue of an office as a basis for deciding at what hour an exchange should close - things must be looked at from the Ministerial point of view as well as from the point of view of the public; he should also take into consideration the whole of the revenue received in a district where there are quite a number of towns a few miles apart. These towns in Tasmania are quite a contrast to towns in other portions of Australia. Par instance, . there are immense distances between the towns in the Darling electorate.Some three years ago I had a draft design which, I think, should be carried out, that is, a re-arrangement in connexion with the telegraphic section of .the Department. My idea was to make it self-supporting. The telegraph service in Australia is cheaper than that which is provided in any other part of the world. The public servant in Australia receives higher wages and works less hours than apply in any other part of the world, and the telegraph and telephone rates are the cheapest in the world. The public would not complain if they were asked to pay a fair thing. I agree with the honorable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) that the cost of these low charges should not fall upon the people in the country districts. It is a shame that the people in the congested places should not be made to pay more than they are paying. It is unfair of the Department to offer the country people a service only on condition that they share the loss. , That condition is not imposed in the cities, and I agree with the honorable member for Dampier that the big cities are what they are because of the efforts of the producers in the country. I do not want to raise the old cry of town against country, but the Department should be run for the Commonwealth as a whole, with uniform charges and uniform regulations throughout. The times are abnormal just now, but I understand that the Department is now nearly approaching the period when its accounts will balance. Some of the changes made when I was Postmaster-General, in the direction of securing more careful supervision, economy, and efficiency, and cutting out waste* have contributed towards that result. The present Postmaster-General has told us of other steps which he has taken in the same direction, but it has been a big job to get the accounts to balance, because it is not long since the Department was nearly £500,000 behind on its yearly accounts, when interest was included. The general question of what work should be charged to loan and what to revenue, can be dealt with later , when the whole policy of the Government is debated ; but with regard to the conduit work mentioned, I am in a .position to point out that that has always been paid for out of loan money, because it is very big work of a semi-permanent character. The cables, if laid .down properly in this way, have, according ito the experts, a life of at least fifty years. When the conduit work was begun it was intended to extend it also to the country towns, because it means an immense saving in the working of the service. The only difficulty is that if the cables are laid too close in the cities there is a risk of interference from the electric tram lines, but, generally speaking, the views of our experts as to the value of this system are upheld by experience in other parts of the world.","Department of Works and Railways","ESTIMATES, 1917-18","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[51]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
495,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FENTON, James","KEV","Maribyrnong","N/A","N/A",1408,".- The honorable member who has just resumed his seat has indicated that, as far back as 1914, when he was Postmaster-General, he was of opinion that the building of the new automatic telephone exchanges for Malvern, Collingwood, Ascot Vale, and Sydney had been authorized. It is a marvel to me- that any factory inspector should allow the Malvern Post-office to be conducted as it has been for so long, with so large a number of telephone operators on the upper story. If any private employer treated his employees in that way he would be heavily fined. In the case of Ascot Vale, I was informed on a Friday that on the Monday morning the erection of the new telephone exchange would be begun. The money was provided on the Estimates, yet on the Saturday morning the Home Affairs Department was notified by the Postal Department not to begin operations, as the automatic equipment was not available. The war has certainly prevented us from obtaining the automatic material essential for these exchanges, but several times to-day I have asked, without receiving a reply, whether the Department is now in a position to inform the Committee if the equipment is now available. The Department has purchased sites in Sydney, Collingwood, Malvern, and Ascot Vale, at a cost of many thousands of pounds, and still holds the land. The Ascot Vale exchange was authorized before the Public Works Committee came into existence, but the other three works were submitted to the Committee, and passed by them. No building operations have yet been commenced, and the reason given is that the automatic equipment is not yet available.","Department of Works and Railways","ESTIMATES, 1917-18","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[52]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The delay is costing the Department and the subscribers a considerable sum.. The plan was to place in certain4 areas in the big cities automatic telephone exchanges, which would allow shorter lines to be constructed, and a cheaper service to be given. Sydney and Melbourne have been plotted out in that way, but until the automatic exchanges are established the Department cannot reasonably look to the telephone branch to pay as it ought. The new exchanges, when erected, will lessen the cost to the subscriber and the Department, and create a far better service. I am glad that at Malvern, at any rate, the congestion is to be relieved, and hope that this will be but the forerunner of the establishment of the other exchanges at a very early date.","Department of Works and Railways","ESTIMATES, 1917-18","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[52]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

At present, every time a country resident, or group of country residents, desires the erection of a telephone line, the proposal has to be submitted to the Department, , which sends an inspector to report on the scheme; but, unfortunately, the Department does not get in close touch with the intending subscribers. In a business of such magnitude, there ought to be close connexion between customers and the Central Administration. The present method is too costly, too slow, and too cumbersome. The people get tired of so much backing and filling on the part of the Department. We talk frequently of decentralization. Surely this is the time to practice it.

andhas a gross income of not less than £100, or, in the case of a person carrying on business in Australia, has an income from the business, which, after deducting from the gross income the deductions specified in paragraph (a) of sub-section (1) of section 18 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1915-1916 amounts, together with his income from all other sources in Australia, to not less than £100; andwould, apart from this provision, not be liable to pay an income tax of one pound or upwards; shall be one pound.- Tax Payable in Certain Cases by Male Persons Between the Ages of Twenty-one Tears and Forty-fiveYears.There shall be payable by every male person (whether in receipt of a taxable income or not) who, on the first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and seventeen -was unmarried or a widower without children; andwas not under the age of twenty-one years and was under the age of forty-five years, income tax to the amount of Ten pounds or ten per centum of his taxable income, whichever is the greater:Provided further that where the Commissioner is satisfied that by reason of the support given by a person to his dependants the payment of the full amount of tax would impose hardship on the person, the Commissioner may reduce the amount of tax payable by that person to such amount as the Commissioner in his discretion determines.The preceding provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to a person who satisfies the Commissioner -that he has been on active service outside Australia during the present war or is a member of an Expeditionary Force raised for service outside Australia; orthat he has since the first day of January, One thousand nine hundred and seventeen, endeavoured to enlist in an Expeditionary Force raised for service outside Australia, but has been rejected solely on the ground of physical unfitness; orthat, notwithstanding that he has not endeavoured to enlist in an Expeditionary Force raised for service outside Australia, he is obviously unfit for any naval or military service whatever; orthat all his brothers of military age have been on active service outside Australia during the present war or are members of an Expeditionary Force raised for service outside Australia; orthat he is permanently incapacitated for work; orthat he is employed in the police or prison services of the Commonwealth or of a State; orthat he is employed on a lighthouse; orthat he is a minister of religion.For the purposes of this subdivision  taxable income  means the amount which is ascertained by deducting from the taxable income of that person within the meaning of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1915-1916 the sum of Twenty-six pounds in respect of each dependant wholly dependent upon him, and such less sura as the Commissioner allows in respect of each dependant partially dependent upon him.-Rate of Tax upon the Income of a Company.For every pound sterling of the taxable income of a company which has not been distributed to the members or shareholders of the company the rate of tax shall be One shilling and ten pence half-penny.For every pound sterling of the income of a company distributed to the members shareholders or stockholders of the company who are absentees, and of interest paid or credited by the company to any person who is an absentee in respect of debentures of the company, or on money lodged at interest with the company by such person, the rate of tax shall be Sixpence.I may explain to honorable members that subdivision F contains the only new tax.  Subdivisions A, B, C, D, E, and G merely reimpose the rates of income tax which were imposed by the Income Tax Act of 1916. The wording in subdivisions A, B, and C has been altered from that used in the Act of 1916, but the legal effect is the same in each case. Questions have been raised as to whether the wording used in the 1916 Act achieved the purposes of that measure. The Department has been advised that the desired purpose was achieved, but in order to set the purpose beyond all doubt the wording has been altered. But the rates imposed do not in any way differ from the tax imposed in last years Act. I do not wish to do more than move the resolution to-night. The resolution will require to be passed in Committee, and then a Bill will be introduced to give effect to it. Honorable members are aware that this tax has to be renewed each year.","N/A","INCOME TAX BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Because they have struck their action has been described as a mutiny and as making war on the community. But those who thus condemn them must, surely, have forgotten that amongst the wage earners and unionists of this country it is a recognised principle that an injury to one is the concern of all.

I refer to the fact that the Parliament of New South Wales, after a very short discussion, has removed from its Coal Mines Act the provision that only practical men shall be employed in a coal mine. The State Government has taken control of the collieries of New South Wales; and the result of this amendment of the law is that when the Commonwealth requires coal, no coal miner will be prepared to work in them. They will be worked by men who ar_e totally unfit to do so without endangering property and life. This is a very serious matter. The right honorable gentleman knows that the amendment of the law in the direction I have named is an infringement of a principle which was embodied in our legislation only after years of agitation for it. Both the British and the American Coal Mine Acts provide that only practical men shall be employed in coal-mining. No miner will go down a mine to work alongside non-unionists. Regard for his own life and for the property of the mine-owners would prevent his doing so, because he knows that the non-unionists are not practical men. I believe that the Minister for the Navy could exercise a good deal of influence with the State Government of New South Wales, so far as this question is concerned. I hope that he will point out to them the stupidity ot their action, and the fact that such an amendment of the law will mean a great risk to the lives of ! those who .work in coal-mines. If he  does, he will receive the support of every  honest citizen. Mine-owners and miners alike will feel that he has done right. I . have received information by telephone from Sydney, from an unofficial source, to the effect that the coal mine- owners will not work their mines under this new arrangement, but will throw upon the State the responsibility for any loss of life which may result from it.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

As to the coal mines,, and the distribution of coal, I wish to inform the Leader, of the Opposition (Mr. Tudor) that, whatever the State Government of New South Wales may do in regard to the acquisition of coal mines, we shall have control of all the coal won, and shall take steps to see that no one State is allowed to interfere with the distribution of such coal stocks as may be available. With us rests the responsibility of seeing that Australia as a whole is fairly treated a3 to the coal that is available.Coming to the question raised by the honorable member for East Sydney (Mr. West)- as to the amendment of the Coal Mines Act of New South Wales, I have seen in the newspapers the statement that some step is being taken to modify the law to meet the circumstances of the time. I admit its seriousness. May I suggest, however, to my honorable friend, that there is a very easy way out of this difficulty. I hope that he, too, will appreciate his responsibility, and will advise the miners of New South Wales as to how they may very easily avoid all this kind of special legislation. They can do so by going back to their work. They have no wages quarrel, and there are no conditions of any kind that are unsuitable to them. They have had a new award. They made a solemn agreement, which was to extend over three years, but they immediately broke that agreement, after being granted better conditions and very largely increased wages. They, can avoid all this turmoil by keeping to the compact, and honouring it as they should do.Mr.West. - The Minister knows very well that the coal-miners cannot work unless trucks are brought alongside the mines to carry away the coal. They were blocked in Kew South Wales owing to the trucks not being available to receive thecoal.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[6]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

He knows in his heart, as well as I do, that there is no justification for this hold-up on the part of the coalminers of Australia.As to the matter of artillerymen with ball cartridge on the wharfs, I have only to say that no artillerymen have been put on the wharfs for the purpose of overaweing the strikers. There is on the. wharfs throughout Australia the ordinary guard. That guard has nothing whatever to do with the strike. It has to do with the safeguarding of our ships, and preventing a repetition of the Cumberland disaster. That is all that has taken place. A more vigilant guard must be kept for that reason, and that reason alone. Now, as to the business for to-morrow. Tomorrow is Friday, and we are hoping to clear out of the way a few of the little Bills which appear on the business-paper. There is the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Appropriation Bill, the Freight Arrangements Bill, the Sugar Purchase Bill, the War Loan (United Kingdom) Bill, and the Invalid and Old-age . Pensions Bill. I hope that we shall be able to clear a number of these little Bills out of the way to-morrow, so that we may be ready to consider the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Bill on Wednesday next.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[6]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
