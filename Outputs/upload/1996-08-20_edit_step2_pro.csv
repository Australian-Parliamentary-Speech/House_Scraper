I regard this chamber as a very important part of the political process and I undertake to discharge my duties with integrity and impartiality.Michael Beahan retired as a senator on 30 June and has just now retired as President of the Senate. From the time that I was chosen as our candidate for this position, I have been enormously indebted to him for the courtesy and consideration that he has shown to me in giving me every opportunity to learn from him about the job of the President and the things that are done by the Presiding Officers in the building and in relation to the precincts. We worked together well when he was President and I was Deputy, I value the friendship that has developed between us and I wish him well as he moves on in his career.On a day like this one reflects a little on the people that have been involved with one getting anywhere in life, and they are very valuable. There was one incident in particular that I wish briefly to refer to, and that is the untimely death of John Knight, a good friend of mine and the first senator for the ACT. Some of you will know, some of you will not know, that John Knight at the age of 37 died in office in March 1981. He left a wife and two young boys, Jason and Joshua. But for that untimely event, there is no possibility that I would ever have taken my place in this chamber and had the opportunity to serve both the ACT and this chamber.

I think everyone has appreciated the way that you have controlled us in a firm but dignified way, and I am sure that you will continue to do so in this high office that you now hold.I was thinking a moment ago of the qualities that one would look for in a President. I thought that possibly the first—not necessarily in order—would be a good sense of humour. You have that. Second would be a good solid dose of commonsense, and you have plenty of that. Third is legal skills or the equivalent thereof, and you are well qualified in that regard. Fourth is obviously political skills, and you have been in politics now for a long time and very successfully at every level of your political role. I refer from the electorate responsibilities here in the ACT up to the various functions and responsibilities that you have held in this Senate.I have no doubt, Madam President, that you will even further enhance the standing of this chamber and this parliament by being our President.

I think today is an historic day for the parliament, in particular for the Senate with your election as its first woman President. You have already made history of course as the first woman Deputy President in this chamber. We in the Labor Party do congratulate you on what we believe is a groundbreaking achievement in that regard. We are delighted to see you in the chair. We acknowledge that your election is in accordance with the principle that the party of government should hold the presidency of the Senate.I want to say also that I do look forward to working with you with the close working relationship that we established, I think, many years ago when both of us held whips responsibilities in this chamber. I know that you know your way well around this place: you have a very good knowledge not only of the formal standing orders and procedures of this place but also of the way it works informally. Of course there is a need for any President to have a very good understanding of that because you do preside in the chamber where no one party has a majority. But I am very confident that you will be treating all sides with fairness and without prejudice, no matter what the circumstances or what the issue that you face.I think that at times you are going to find the remainder of the parliament difficult and trying—it inevitably is in politics—but I am very confident, as are my colleagues, that you will be equal to that task, as you have proved to be in the other offices that you have held in this place.I also acknowledge that not only do you have responsibilities in this chamber but also significant administrative responsibilities with the Speaker of the House of Representatives. We expect that you, in conjunction with the Speaker of the House, will fulfil those responsibilities with impartiality and with fairness. I can assure you on behalf of the opposition that Labor senators in this chamber look forward to a productive and cooperative relationship with you.

You have been ever mindful of the need to protect the reputation and integrity of this Senate, as you did in your role as Opposition Whip—a role some people thought you left just in time—and in your role as Deputy President. I can personally attest to your unfailing courtesy, fairness and independence.Ten years ago today, on budget day 1986, Janine Haines rose to speak in this chamber as the first woman leader of a political party at the federal level. Ten years ago the Democrats had five men and two women but, looking behind us today, it is quite the reverse—five women and two men and all the leadership positions are held by women!

52,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,"The PRESIDENT",10000,"N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","—The disgraceful and totally unjustifiable episode that occurred yesterday afternoon in this Parliament House is one of the most shameful in this nations political history. I am sure I speak for senators on both sides of this chamber when I say that the opportunity for law&hyphen;abiding citizens to express by peaceful protest, by orderly and non&hyphen;violent demonstration or by other acceptable means their dissent from decisions made by governments is acknowledged as one of the fundamental privileges in a free and democratic society. However, it is the responsibility of all of us to ensure that it is a privilege that is not abused. What happened in this place yesterday should never have happened and those responsible for transforming what was meant to be a well&hyphen;organised demonstration into the ugly and violent display that ultimately eventuated deserve the strongest condemnation.Senators should be aware that every endeavour had been made to ensure this pre&hyphen;budget protest activity would proceed in an acceptable and reasonable manner. There was a number of meetings between Parliament House security authorities, the police and representatives of the demonstrators prior to yesterdays rally. It had been hoped that these discussions would assist in promoting peaceful protest action.Briefly, by way of background: on 4 July the ACT Trades and Labour Council wrote to the Speaker and former President Beahan about a rally to be staged at Parliament House on Monday, 19 August and requested permission to conduct a march around the building. The Presiding Officers responded to that request on 24 July. They approved the protest and the march around the building subject to the following conditions: the march not commence earlier than 1.35 p.m. and be completed by 2.25 p.m; marshals be appointed and clearly identified to cooperate with police in managing the march to ensure minimal disruption to traffic flows and access to the building for emergency and other vehicles; all efforts be made by participants in cooperation with marshals and police to ensure that roadways leading from Parliament Drive to the building and entrances to underground car parks remain unobstructed so as not to prevent the free movement of vehicles and people in and out of Parliament House; and the march be contained to Parliament Drive.There were subsequent discussions with representatives of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union and the Aboriginal community. All concerned were advised of the approved march and agreed to contain their activities to the authorised event. Most regrettably, this agreement was broken and the conditions were not adhered to.The protest rally remained peaceful until about 12.20 p.m., when a separate group of marchers entered the parliamentary precincts. This group refused to accept police direction, forced a breach in police lines and ran towards the main front entrance of Parliament House. Unfortunately, it was apparent that some of these demonstrators were affected by alcohol. This group was supported by participants from the more general demonstration who were incited to join those involved in riotous conduct by a speaker from the official platform.Police formed a protective line along the perimeter of the Great Verandah which was subsequently forced back to the main doors. The police line was withdrawn from this area due to the level of violence being experienced by officers and was redeployed to an area inside the front doors in support of parliamentary security personnel. This deployment stabilised the situation for a short period. However, demonstrators using increasing force broke through the first line of doors. Once inside this area, demonstrators used weapons, including a large hammer, a wheel brace, a steel trolley and a stanchion torn from the external doors to break open the internal doors. Simultaneously, a second group of demonstrators used other weapons to break into the Parliament House shop, but were held at the internal doors. The shop was ransacked by demonstrators and major damage was caused by persons who subsequently occupied the area. After some two hours, the demonstrators were finally repelled from Parliament House and driven back onto the forecourt area and, shortly afterwards, they dispersed. In addition to the events which took place at the front entrance to the building, incidents also occurred on the Members Terrace, the roof of the Great Verandah and the Queens Terrace.There were 197 Australian Federal Police on duty at the start of the demonstration, in addition to the Australian Protective Service officers and parliamentary security personnel. A further 60 Australian Federal Police reinforcements were called out under established contingency plans.The outrageous events which took place yesterday resulted in not only financial but, more importantly and lamentably, human costs. So far about 90 personnel have reported injuries—including lacerations, sprains, and head and eye injuries. I understand one person required hospitalisation.An initial indicative estimate of the damage to the forecourt and the foyer is up to $75,000. Emergency repairs have already been completed. The full extent of looting and criminal damage which resulted from the occupation of the Parliament House shop has yet to be determined. Nine persons were arrested and have been charged with a variety of offences.I would like to commend the Parliament House security staff, Australian Protective Service officers and Australian Federal Police officers for ensuring that the building essentially remained secure. I would also like to acknowledge the efforts of several other members of staff who were called upon unexpectedly to provide assistance in the initial stages of the disturbance.In particular, I want to pay tribute to the Parliament House nurses. They performed in a most commendable and professional manner, treating approximately 40 injured personnel on the floor of the foyer. I also want to mention that the nurses were assisted in their efforts by our colleague Trish Worth and an anonymous woman—presumably with nursing experience—who had been showing some American visitors around the Great Hall when the violence erupted.The Speaker and I have asked parliamentary security officials to undertake an urgent and detailed review of the management of similar demonstrations in the future. We expect to receive this report shortly. I am aware that there has been some comment about reductions in parliamentary security staffing. These reductions essentially involved the closure of security points, and I do not believe they affected in any way the situation yesterday.On a more positive note, I want to advise senators that the Parliament House shop will re&hyphen;open on Wednesday, 21 August, as originally planned—and I hope that Bill Podmore and his staff will receive the support they deserve. They were stoic under enormous pressure yesterday, and they are already up and running with plans in hand for what will hopefully be a once only and never to be repeated giant sale of damaged stock.I would also like to take this opportunity to remind senators of their obligations in regard to visitors. Senators are responsible for the conduct of any visitors they sign into Parlia ment House—and this responsibility is not one that should be taken lightly.Finally, I want to apologise most sincerely to the Australian people and those from overseas who were visiting Parliament House and were unfortunately involved, inconvenienced, frightened or shocked in any way by this deplorable incident. To them I say: what you witnessed here yesterday is not typical of Australia or Australians. And I believe I speak for all my colleagues when I say: we hope and pray it never will be.","N/A","PARLIAMENT HOUSE: DEMONSTRATION","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/proctext/interject/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
53,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator HILL","BH4","SA","LP","Leader of the Government in the Senate)",2672,"—by leave—I move:That the Senate take note of the statement.Madam President, I certainly wish to associate my government colleagues in the Senate with the sentiments that you have expressed, but I am sure I am able to associate all honourable senators with those sentiments. Yesterday was certainly a very sad day in the history of the Australian political process. We must do our utmost to ensure, as you said, that it is never repeated.Part of that is ensuring that all Australians understand that we regard the sort of behaviour that occurred yesterday as not only unacceptable but un-Australian. It is not the way in which we seek to progress our democracy. It is not the way in which we seek to win the battle of ideas, which is what this democracy is all about. It can never be tolerated in any shape or form and, if and when it ever occurs, it must be unambiguously and fearlessly condemned. Certainly on behalf of my colleagues I do that.It was embarrassing to listen to you, Madam President, even talk about overseas visitors in this place yesterday witnessing that sort of occurrence and in fact being embroiled within it. I think what it does demonstrate is that, whilst freedom of speech and freedom of association are so important to us, those of us who do participate within the democracy and organise rallies and demonstrations also have some responsibility to ensure that those who rally and those who demonstrate do so without resorting to violence. I hope the organis ers of yesterdays rally think long and hard about that responsibility as well.I add my thanks to the police, to the protective services and to those who showed great courage in extremely traumatic circumstances. They were a great credit yesterday to all the Australian people. They should not have had to experience what they did yesterday, to put their own lives at risk—to risk injury or even worse. It should not simply occur within our democratic process.Madam President, I want to acknowledge also all of those whom you mentioned—the nurses and other officials within this place—who also, in such awful circumstances, behaved magnificently for the benefit of all Australians. They must never again be put in those circumstances.Madam President, we think of those who were injured. We trust that they will make a speedy recovery. In some ways we symbolically share their hurt.","N/A","PARLIAMENT HOUSE: DEMONSTRATION","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
54,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator FAULKNER","5K4","NSW","ALP","Leader of the Opposition in the Senate)",2672,"—Let me say on behalf of the opposition that the Labor Party, too, condemns the appalling violence that occurred at the doors of Parliament House yesterday. We in the Labor Party have always believed that there is no place for the storming of a parliament or for violence against police. Our sympathy does go out to those police officers and others who suffered injury in the line of duty. I must say that we do share the disgust that has been expressed by many at the violence that occurred at yesterdays demonstration.I do want to say that I stood, along with many thousands of others, at the real rally that took place in front of Parliament House. These were many, many thousands of decent, hardworking Australians. Of course, that rally was well away from that place where a number took matters into their own hands. Many, many thousands of people took the opportunity to peacefully and properly express their views on a very important piece of legislation that will be dealt with in short order by this chamber. At the real rally I, along with many thousands of others, heard a crowd voice a measured anger at the chan ges that the government wants to inflict on workers with the workplace relations bill.But, as far as the opposition is concerned, we make absolutely clear that we condemn acts of violence, destruction of property and attacks on police, attendants and other staff and I associate the opposition with those remarks that the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill) made in that regard. We have always been of the view that violence has no place in the political life of the Australian community.We also, of course, have always recognised the right of all Australians to participate in peaceful but robust protest as part of a healthy democratic process. For the oppositions part, I do want to make clear that we do support the concerns of mainstream and decent Australians across all age groups and occupations—such as nurses, teachers, car and textile workers and the like—who are very concerned, genuinely concerned, about the thrust of the governments industrial relations policies and the legislation that is coming before this chamber that will reduce peoples wages, gut the role of the IRC and no longer allow unions to properly represent the interests of workers.Let me say that that was the intention of the very vast majority of the 20,000-odd workers who came to Canberra, who delivered a petition of a quarter of a million signatures to this Senate and who quite properly and quietly demonstrated. But I say to you, Madam President, that we will never defend the actions that took place at the door and inside Parliament House and we will support you and the Speaker as you undertake the work that you have outlined in your statement to the parliament. You can be confident that you will receive the absolute cooperation of the Australian Labor Party and of the opposition as we work together to ensure that that violence never occurs in this place again.","N/A","PARLIAMENT HOUSE: DEMONSTRATION","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Yesterday saw a very sad day for Australia, with a very vindictive display of assault on our parliamentary democracy. I believe our democratic right to assemble was challenged yesterday.The actions were brutal and the actions were ugly. It left a bad taste in everyones mouth, while 30,000 people or 25,000 or however many people assembled. It was their right to come down here to express their views. We have seen 40,000 farmers on the grass outside old Parliament House and we have seen a number of loggers and their trucks. Their behaviour was fine, it was not offensive and they made their point.But yesterday we saw the very worst of people come through. We saw some brutal scenes. It was relayed to me today that a policewoman was kicked and her ribs were broken. As far as the union movement was concerned, it was an absolute disaster in the public relations stakes.One would have to question the role of the ACTU. If you are going to have a demon stration—and everyone in this parliament would acknowledge that it is the right of anyone to demonstrate—there is a responsibility on those people that organise a demonstration. The ACTU organised that demonstration and they let it get completely out of control—and they have to be condemned for that and they have to wear it.One would have to query whether you would want to put your wages policy in the hands of the ACTU after that display—or whether you would want to put anything in the hands of the ACTU. It is the industrial wing of the ALP, and you guys over there, and girls—senators—have to be responsible and wear your share of the general responsibility.It is a sorry day for Australia, it is a sorry day for this parliament and I would like to extend my sympathy to the people who were hurt, the people who did defend the democratic processes at the doors when they acted in the best interests of this parliament.","N/A","PARLIAMENT HOUSE: DEMONSTRATION","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
59,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MARGETTS","DX5","WA","G(WA)","N/A",2674,"—I remember years ago being associated with protests for nuclear disarmament where there were 3,000 people protesting in Fremantle against the violence of nuclear warships. On that occasion, five people were involved in an altercation with police on horses. That was portrayed as the main issue in that protest. There were 3,000 peaceful protesters and five people who felt they wanted to say things in a different way—and the only message that people gained publicly at the end of that was the five people who wanted to say things in a different way.The Greens (WA) do not associate ourselves with the violent action that occurred yesterday. In the historical tradition, if you like, of my former colleague Jo Vallentine, I believe in non&hyphen;violent direct action. There are obviously some people in the Green movement who have differing viewpoints on that but, personally, I associate myself with non&hyphen;violent direct action. I do not believe that there was any justification for the use of violence to the extent we saw yesterday and to the detriment of peoples health and security.However, there have been a number of reports in relation to the triggering incident, and I think it is necessary to put on the record that the group who attempted to join later were attempting to join in on the protest side; they were not in fact moving towards Parliament House. There was possibly an error of judgment in debarring an Aboriginal group from participating and joining in with the group.It is not a justification of those people from the main group for taking the violent action that they did, but I do believe that, if we are going to deal with this issue justly, it should be said that much of the anger was involved with not allowing the group of Aboriginal people to be part of the protest group that was meeting, and meeting peacefully, at that time.Sometimes when such violence occurs it is used to mask the other violence in society—the violence associated with the deliberate dividing of society and the forced marginalisation of large numbers of people in our society. When we do this enough, the argument becomes a law and order issue, and I think we should be dealing with these issues before this becomes the major debate in this or any other parliament. We need to ask: what is the basis of the violence that is causing the marginalisation of our community; and should we not as a parliament be dealing with that issue as the primary issue and not the symptoms of that violence?","N/A","PARLIAMENT HOUSE: DEMONSTRATION","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
60,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator HARRADINE","6H4","TAS","IND","N/A",2674,"—As a parliamentarian for 21 years, as a trade unionist continuously for the last 40 years, I join with colleagues right around this chamber in my expression of condemnation of what occurred yesterday. It was an attack on the symbol of our democratic way of life. It besmirched the good name of the trade union movement, and we cannot allow a handful of Trotskyists, anarchists and thugs to so exploit the genuine feelings of many people and thrust them into violent activity. That sort of anarchy, that sort of individualism, strikes at the very heart of our democracy and, indeed, strikes at the heart of what I hope we all want in the industrial area: orderly industrial progress. Some forms of economic rationalism combined with utilitari an philosophies spawn on the other side that sort of anarchy which will engender disorder in industrial matters.I was not here yesterday at that time. I did send a message to the meeting that it was my view that the workplace relations bill as currently drafted would promote an unAustralian, self&hyphen;centred and selfish `Im alright Jack attitude and, if that prevailed, then workplace relations would be soured and the unity which is necessary to protect the workers and their families would suffer.But last night I did see in my room the pictures of what happened in the storming of this parliament, the symbol of our democratic way of life. I saw those violent actions which caused such injuries to police, emergency workers and other workers in this parliament who serve us as members of parliament. I saw the terror in the eyes of children and the anxiety experienced by the international and Australian visitors—those Australians who rightly regard this parliament as `our House. And this violence occurred in `our House.Somehow or another, as a trade unionist and as a member of parliament, I feel a sense of shame. I do not know why but I feel a sense of shame. I could not sleep last night. I came in here and about 4 oclock this morning I wrote a motion. I will not propose it because we have the opportunity of speaking now. But I did wander around the empty great hall of the parliament imagining the echoing voices of former Labor members of parliament who had come through the trade union movement—the voices of Ben Chifley and Percy Cleary and other great Labor leaders, all of whom would have roundly condemned yesterdays violent action. And I was very pleased to hear what Kim Beazley said yesterday and what the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Mr Faulkner) said here today.We should indeed deplore the action. Take the damage that was done to the parliamentary shop. What is the parliamentary shop there for? From the parliamentary shop thousands upon thousands of visitors obtain the information about how our parliamentary democracy works—and thugs trashed that parliament house shop.The parliament house shop does so much to help people who visit understand and better appreciate our Australian system of parliamentary democracy. It is this system of parliamentary democracy which enables the people of Australia to participate in the political process and to freely elect representatives to this parliament to speak for them and to make laws for the peace, order and good government of this our beloved nation.Many of our forebears paid the supreme sacrifice to defend our democratic way of life, and the attack on Parliament House yesterday was an attack on that democratic way of life. Today we have been speaking on behalf of the Australian people and all of those individuals and community organisations who work so hard to protect and improve that way of life which we have resolved to defend. We have also resolved to constantly seek better ways of making this a parliament for the people, by the people and of the people.I re&hyphen;emphasise what you said, Madam President, about the right to freedom of speech, to freedom of assembly and the right to peacefully demonstrate. Those rights are enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I have heard people say today, `Keep all these demos away from the place. Putem right down below. I know, Madam President, that, being in charge of the precincts of this parliament, you would not agree with that.You uphold the right to freedom of association, freedom of speech and the right to peacefully protest, and I am very pleased to hear that. In fact, it was that right which these thugs violated yesterday. I note that the ACTU condemned those violators. Although it is not for me to tell the ACTU what to do, it would be useful though for that condemnation to be a practical matter.I know that 30 years ago, in the mid&hyphen;1960s, when I was Secretary of the Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council we did have this problem of what needs to be done for the trade union movement to be united in achieving orderly industrial progress. With Albert Monk we had ACTU executive meeting after executive meeting and we were confronted in other areas by the types of actions we saw yesterday.We believed—how often do you hear it these days?—there are five principles which should govern whether or not a strike should take place: whether the cause was serious and just, whether it had the overwhelming support of the workers, whether other reasonable means had been utilised to overcome the dispute, whether the good outcomes far outweighed the inconvenience that might take place and that the action, the strike, should operate peacefully.I believe that, in so far as some of yesterdays violence was done by union members, when all of the details of what happened yesterday are in, it would serve the trade union movement well for the union rules to be applied quite stringently to the persons who breached those rules, besmirched the name of the trade union movement and put at risk—and I hope it is not put at risk, quite frankly—the debate on the Workplace Relations Bill about which so many of us have concerns.Finally, I would like to associate myself with others in expressing deep appreciation for the courageous efforts by the Parliament House staff and the police and protective services members in defence of this place—our place and the peoples place. I join with the outrage that has been expressed here that so many were injured and one even hospitalised. I hope for their speedy recovery and pray, along with you, Madam President, that Gods healing grace may renew them and, indeed, all of us in this great nation of ours.Question resolved in the affirmative.","N/A","PARLIAMENT HOUSE: DEMONSTRATION","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

She was first elected for a very brief time in 1987. I think it is fair to put on record that there have been some ups and downs in Senator Wests political career. She lost her seat in the subsequent election but, I am pleased to say, because of the very high regard for her and the respect in which she was held throughout New South Wales, she was able to defeat—my recollection is that it was by a narrow margin of 490 votes—former Senator Chris Puplick who was, at that time, a senior member of the coalition frontbench.Since winning that position, she has made a very significant contribution in this place in many roles and has shown a real dexterity with her work as a temporary chairman of committees. It is for those reasons that Senator West was the unanimous choice of the federal parliamentary Labor Party.

Senator Sherry has been paired from 2 oclock to 7.30 this day for a different reason. As you know, he was sworn in earlier today. He is currently in the budget lockup. There is no secret about that.","N/A","DEPUTY PRESIDENT AND CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES: ELECTION","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[3]/interject[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

They are not satisfied with breaking the convention in relation to the election of presidents and deputy presidents in this place. Senator Hill was too gutless to stand up in the earlier debate and nominate Senator Colston. He passed the ball back to a member of his backbench because he did not have the courage of his conviction, he did not have the ticker, he did not have the intestinal fortitude to stand up in this place and put forward his own sleazy deal and arrangement. Senator Hill has indicated to Senator Panizza that the longstanding principle of pairs in this chamber is going to be broken. That is the sort of approach that we now see from the government in this place.I might say, Madam President, that yesterday we had a meeting of whips, leaders and managers in this place when Senator Hill talked about a new framework of cooperation in the chamber. I think it is fair to say to Senator Brown, Senator Margetts, Senator Harradine and Senator Kernot—to those four senators who attended that meeting—that that was put forward as a new, more constructive and more sensible approach from this mob over here in government.I want to say to the minor parties and independents in this place that this breach of convention now—this absolutely contemptible, despicable and low breach of all process and procedures in this place—ought to be condemned by every single senator. The word of this government and its officeholders in this place is worth nothing. Their word is worth nothing. They are deceivers. They deceived us; they deceived this opposition.

Had he not raised it in such a forceful manner, he would not have had Senator Hill make his most recent concession. The point about pairing: pairing is about who comes in when the bells ring; it is not about a secret ballot at all. The result of pairing is who comes into the chamber when the bells are rung.It is for that reason that, when Senator Panizza signed his name to the pairs list, two Liberals should have been paired from coming in at the division bells—and he knows it. I am a bit sad that, probably through no connivance of his own, today, in this chamber, he has been shamed. When the word of a whip is devalued, this whole chamber does not work very well—and you, Madam President, sitting in that chair would know it better than most from the enormous service you gave in this chamber as a sensible whip.There are many standing orders in the book here, but the first standing order always should be commonsense. Let me give you an example from history of how what goes around comes around. Three years ago a variety of coalition members missed a division here because they lingered too long over their dinner. I know that because, in fact, I passed them all—can you believe that?—on the way to this chamber for that division and I made it by 20 seconds. They all hit the door running when the door slammed in their faces, and we won that particular division on a crucial amendment. What was our response in government—not to rely on past practice, not to rely on what was in standing orders but to institute the law of common sense. I recommitted that clause, and we were defeated by one vote.The next time this happened we were at fault and we lost a division that we should have won. What happened? The other side here said, `No, you cant recommit it. We wont let you. We had to move 12 divisions in a row to get that original vote restored. I warned you on that occasion that you were setting precedents. What happened a few months later? Again they missed divisions. Did we force another 12 divisions on this chamber? No. We instituted the law of commonsense and had that clause recommitted.John Howard has won this particular federal election and one of his platforms was better parliamentary behaviour. What a great start today! What a great start to parliamentary behaviour we have seen from Senator Hill and his cohorts in this particular chamber. They say that there is no convention on the electing of a deputy president. Let us put it on the record: the fact is that until 1990 all ballots were contested even though people knew the result in advance. Even though the government had the president, they still ran candidates against the presidential candidate. We as government ran candidates against their deputy president.But circumstances did change because in a discussion between Senator Hill and Senator Evans—he can get up and deny it, if he wants to—Senator Hill asked what the future convention was going to be. I thought he was very wise at the time because he not only accepted Gareths word on it but also said, `Go away and put it in writing.","N/A","DEPUTY PRESIDENT AND CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES: ELECTION","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[5]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

He put his signature to a letter.Through you, Madam President, I will tell you this, Senator Panizza: if your word is worthless in this place or is made worthless, this place will not operate. This place operates on the basis of numbers about one-quarter of the time; the rest of the time it operates through leave, consensus and cooperation. This place would not even operate without the hard work that whips do. For all the stars that are here on the front benches, et cetera, the real nitty-gritty organisation is done by the whips.We will remember this day for a long while; we will remember the sort of implicit treachery that was involved in this decision; and we will remember that we got it reversed because you have a weak leader who cannot do his own dirty work. Senator Hill has at least gone some way towards rectifying what I think was going to be a serious long-term problem in this place.I find it impossible to think that if they were not going to grant pairs for this ballot they would not have mentioned it at the whips meeting this morning. Didnt Senator Panizza think to say, `Sure, were granting two pairs all day—we know one is in hospital and one is in the lock-up—but, incidentally, you wont be able to vote in the secret ballot? Apparently, he did not once mention that. You have to ask yourself why. Was he ambushed by his leader and others, or was he in fact planning this all along? We would like to hear from Senator Panizza on this because prior to this he has had an unblemished reputation in this chamber as a stickler for the rules.","N/A","DEPUTY PRESIDENT AND CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES: ELECTION","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[5]/talk.start[7]/para","N/A","N/A"

I do have an unlimited amount of time at my disposal, but I do not want to use that up right to the crunch point.In summary, Madam President, this has been a pretty sad day not only for this chamber but also, as it turns out, for you. The precedents have been broken; a candidate that was unanimously endorsed by the parliamentary party will be, in all probability, rejected; and, in the end, that is going to badly reflect on the chair and the attitude to the chair.Whatever mistakes were made in 1990 were rectified in the next ballot when we did not oppose the candidate and we had every intention of voting for that particular candidate. As I have said in this chamber a couple of times, the Liberal Party, or the coalition, will have its fun today; it will have some joy today, but, in the end, it will pay the price for this.","N/A","DEPUTY PRESIDENT AND CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES: ELECTION","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[5]/talk.start[8]/para","N/A","N/A"

I must correct Senator Ray—and I must say I am saddened that Senator Ray, who has been one of the sticklers for procedures in this chamber and probably the only member of the Labor Party who has any respect for the institution of the Senate and the parliament, should have made such a misstatement. He said that, when pairs are granted, you are debarred from entering the chamber. There is a point of view that, if you are within the building and you are paired, you appear in the chamber and stand behind the seats here so that your presence is noted. It is quite incorrect to say that you are debarred from entering the chamber.This debate has got very muddled on the point of a secret ballot as opposed to a division. Senator Hill is perfectly correct. If we have a secret ballot, we do not know how people vote; therefore, we cannot make a prediction on how they are going to vote.My final point is about the crocodile tears of Senator Ray about breaking precedence. A far more serious matter was the matter of the division of the Senate into short- and long-term senators after the 1987 double dissolution. Senator Ray, as Manager of Government Business at the time, conspired with the Democrats to rort the system. They broke with precedence since Federation and took the plum jobs, the long-term Senate positions, for the Labor Party and the Democrats so that in the subsequent election they would be able to get control of the Senate.Fortunately, the public made their judgement of the Democrats and the Labor Party in the 1990 election—they lost seats and did not get control. But the rorting of the convention that senators be distributed into short- and long-term positions in the sequence in which they were elected—the sequence that had been followed since Federation—was a far more profound breach of convention than anything that is going on, or implied to be going on, here today.","N/A","DEPUTY PRESIDENT AND CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES: ELECTION","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This is a debate which touches on the very foundation of the Senate—that is, how we elect officers of this chamber to preside over this chamber, bring order to this chamber and structure the debate and proceedings of this chamber in a way and in a manner in which it will be orderly.It seems to me that for anyone to be denied to speak on such a matter is, in fact, to suppress the opinion of senators in this chamber by weight of numbers rather than to open the proceedings of this chamber for the free flow of debate so that all of us, when this matter is finally resolved, as it eventually will be, can at least feel that we had our say and had our opportunity to put our views to this chamber. Therefore, I think the motion to suspend standing orders ought to be supported.What has been said in this debate by a number of speakers is true. The Prime Minister promised the electorate of Australia, when he was elected, that he would bring a better order and governance to the affairs of parliament. What we have seen today is something that has been, in my view, rightly described as a low, sleazy move, and it is to break a longstanding convention of the parliament. I just ask the Senate to consider for a moment that, when we have bills of high public controversy in the wings waiting to come on in here, if the proceedings to elect the presiding officers of this chamber—and I now refer to the Deputy President, not the President—are subverted, the authority that those officers might bring to their high and esteemed office will also be equally subverted.","N/A","DEPUTY PRESIDENT AND CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES: ELECTION","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/sso[1]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The problem is not with giving pairs; the problem is with the standing orders and what they say about how the ballot will take place. That is the point. I hope I am relevant. I hope that they will be able to tell me how we are going to get over that situation before I vote for the suspension of standing orders.The problem is with the way the standing orders are written in respect of the ballot.

I hope Senator Harradine would agree that this is both a creative and a sensible approach in this circumstance.We have heard at great length about the sanctity of the secret ballot, and even suggestions now from the government that we do not know how these two senators that Senator Hill offers might leave the chamber would vote. It seems to me that, given that we have elected a President, given that we have a very adequate system of temporary chairmen of committees and acting deputy presidents in this place, we do have an opportunity for a creative approach on this particular issue.There has been talk about setting a new precedent. Quite obviously, the way to go here is to have a ballot when all 76 senators are present. We have seen today one of the sleaziest, most deceitful pieces of politics that has ever been perpetrated in this place. We have seen it only because Senator Hill has been so weak and spineless in failing to back up the relevant government office holder—that is, Senator Panizza—in terms of the commitments that he gave. I believe that, if the government is fair dinkum that it wants to see all senators have an opportunity to vote—and the Labor Party has made very clear its position in regard to this particular matter—then the way to allow that is to have this ballot when all senators are present.Do not forget this: we have seen a very sneaky, low-life performance from the government today. This is a government that was elected on a platform of bringing a new standard into the processes of the parliament. Mr Howard gave yet another so-called ironclad or solid commitment to the Australian people that he would do something serious about standards in this place being improved. And what have we seen? Every possible convention broken, every possible trick in the book from the bottom of the pack perpetuated by this crew on the other side of the chamber.If those opposite are fair dinkum about seeing the will of the Senate prevail on this issue, and if they are fair dinkum about seeing the word that has been given by the relevant office holder, Senator Panizza, honoured, then the only way through this is simply to have a ballot with all 76 senators present.

If ever the moral and intellectual inadequacies of an opposition leader have been exposed, it is today. The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) got himself worked into a fury with confected outrage about our doing what they did in 1990. He complained bitterly about Senator Knowles, who is a good friend of Senator Colston, actually having the cheek to nominate him. Then of course we had all this outrage about the fact that somehow we can equate pairs in a secret ballot with normal pairs in a division, where the vote is quite transparent. As Senator Harradine made so very clear, there is a fundamental difference, and the opposition has clearly declined to answer the point.It is not only that, of course. We have also had an extraordinary concession that somehow that argument is unanswerable. So all of Senator Faulkners outrage is now out the window, and what are we left with? A proposition that we should adjourn until such time as everyone is present. What does that mean? Take an anarchist like Senator Carr, who will be very unhappy if democracy prevails. What if he chooses to absent himself from the chamber? We would never get around to a vote on this issue. It is an absolutely ludicrous proposition.The trouble is that Labor is a victim of their own tyranny. They have never accepted the concept of a secret ballot. They cannot understand how anyone cannot toe the party line. You get the chop, you get expelled from the party, if you vote against it. The very reason they bring in show and tell is that they do not accept the legitimacy of people exercising their own personal vote.As we know, the standing orders do not provide for pairs in a secret ballot for the very simple reason that people ought to be entitled to exercise a personal view about whom they want as their presiding officers in this parliament. Yet what we are being given is a demonstration of Labors absolute intolerance not only of dissent but of anyone who would dare to challenge the rule, the iron law, of those in charge of the party.It does not work that way. The Senate was not designed to accommodate that system. It is a private arrangement. As we know, pairs are there for the convenience of the parties. They were assigned on this day on the usual understanding that they would apply when there were divisions, when there were transparent ballots. They have never been used in this chamber for the purpose of effectively causing a secret ballot to be a non-secret ballot. That is what you are trying to do.The tragedy is that Senator Faulkner is so bereft of any intellectual ability to cope with the argument about the difference between a secret ballot and an open ballot that he basically has to concede the point, not address it in any shape or form and come up with something else that the real opposition leader tells him he better give a run. That is a tragedy and it certainly pulls the rug out from any of the arguments we have heard this afternoon.We got very sick of being lectured when we were in opposition about the morality of somehow the wheel will turn and if you do not do the right thing now you will suffer in government. We got that lecture from Senator Robert Ray on referring bills to legislation committees, if you recall. That was precisely what he was on about ad nauseam when they were in government. What happened when we came to the Telstra bill and the Australian Workplace Relations Bill? Of course they were referred to references committees—in other words, an absolute and flagrant breach of all that Senator Robert Ray lectured us about.What do we find again today? My recollection is that, if Senator Robert Ray was not Manager of Government Business back in 1990, he was certainly a major player. We have not heard one squeak of a defence about how he justified the ballot that is effectively being re&hyphen;run today. In other words, convention is something that suits him, in terms of an intellectual or debating point. It has nothing to do with real life—as far as the Labor Party is concerned—where you live or die on the strength of numbers. That is all you understand.But we understand secret ballots to have a lot more to them than that. They are an opportunity for people to express their real views. We cannot force people to vote, and you should not either. But that is what you try to do. You try to ensure that somehow you cut people back. When Senator Sherry chose to absent himself, you could have explored the consequences of that. You knew full well what was going to take place in this chamber this afternoon.When Senator Hill accommodates you absolutely, what do you do? You once again want to change the rules. So you now have an absolutely nonsensical proposition before the chair. It just simply exposes the way in which you cannot address issues on principle. You cannot accept the fact that what is happening now is something that is entirely of your own creation, both internally and externally. You ought to wear that result. Democracy is a lot healthier than you are prepared to give it credit for.

Once he is in there—and I think he went in at about 12.30 p.m.—he is locked up; he cannot come out. So what we now have from Senator Hill is a proposal: `We dont accept the pairs. You cannot have a pair in a secret ballot, but we will ask two of our people not to vote.

The only way we are going to get a credible ballot is to have all 76 senators in here to elect the Deputy President. Because of the machinations of Senator Hill today in overriding the government whip—he ripped up an agreement which everybody would have accepted—he has thrown doubt on this particular ballot. Whoever is elected as Deputy President would not want to be elected with any smear of a doubt that their election was accepted and was aboveboard in accordance not only with the standing orders of the Senate but also with the conventions of the Senate.So what we have had here is a mess created by the government through its consistent inexperience and trying to be too smart by half. That is absolutely the case. It waited until the bells had almost finished ringing to call people to have the ballot before Senator Panizza gave an indication to the opposition that the pairs were off because Senator Hill, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, said they were off. The look on Senator Panizzas face betrayed the fact that he knew that he had been duded by his leader.If there is any doubt about there being effective pairs or people having to leave the chamber to make the ballot real or not real, why not wait until all 76 senators are in here and voting in a secret ballot, which everybody says is the way to do it, rather than having Senator Hill create this unfortunate precedent of saying, `Well find two Liberals and Ill ask them not to vote, but its really not a pairs process, therefore throwing doubt on this whole process? It has been a very unseemly start to the Senate today through the sheer incompetence and deception of the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill. He stands condemned as a result.

I draw the attention of honourable senators to chapter 4 of the standing orders. As you would well know, Madam President, your duties are not confined to duties in this chamber. Honourable senators should understand that the President exercises the powers of the joint Presiding Officers, is responsible for the Department of the Senate and is partly responsible for the running of Parliament House.Chapter 4 of the standing orders states that where the President is absent or incapacitated—and we hope, Madam President, that you would not be incapacitated or prevented from executing your obligations—it is absolutely critical that we have a Deputy President who can exercise the powers of the President on her behalf. And if this motion were to be passed—remembering that Senator Foreman may not be back for some time—and the Senate adjourns at the end of the week and does not come back until the beginning of September, there could be a situation where the President was incapacitated during the adjournment of the Senate and there was nobody who could exercise the powers of the Presiding Officer of the Senate.

It is a shambles because this government cannot be trusted. This is a government that is founded upon lies and deceit, that has founded its very political existence on the proposition that you can break your election promises, you can do whatever you like, you can say whatever you like, but you do another thing when you get in here. That is the course of action being followed.What is the nature of a pair? There is nothing in the standing orders. It is a very simple arrangement; it is a private arrangement between the parties. Like so much that goes on here, it is based on trust. So much of what happens in this parliament is based on private negotiation. When Senator Kemp, as the manager of government business, comes to me and says, `This is what we would like to do, I am now supposed to say, `We cannot trust you. We cannot rely upon your word because you have been proven to be categorical liars. You make it quite clear that you are morally and intellectually bankrupt. When it comes to the question of morality, you have none.As far as you and your leader in particular are concerned, you have a very simple philosophy: you take short&hyphen;term advantage, no matter how opportunistic, no matter how unprincipled. This is the morality of a government that is bankrupt. What we have seen here is quite fundamentally a government that has lied; it has lied because it can see short&hyphen;term advantage; it has lied because it feels that somehow or another it might be able to secure an advantage on some important legislation.We all understand the implications here. This is about trying to buy a vote further down the track. We all know what the game plan is, and we know the lie that you have told: you have tried to present to us a proposition based on some action taken in 1990 and you have not acknowledged that the deal done between you and the then Senator Gareth Evans made it clear that those are the rules by which we play. You have chosen to rip that up. You have made it quite clear that there is a new morality in this parliament. What we have got to do is work by a new system of morality. So get used to it, Senator Kemp.

In this system of government you rely upon the word of your opponents.

Quite clearly, that is what we have done. We pride ourselves on honouring our arrangements. Quite clearly, you pride yourselves on your capacity to rat on any deal that suits you.The conventions of this parliament have been broken many times by you. You are making a habit of it and, if this is the game, let it be clear: there are consequences that flow from that sort of immorality. Quite clearly, we have an opportunity here—as proposed by Senator Faulkner—to address this in a civilised way. You are not interested because you see that there are short&hyphen;term advantages to be taken. The consequences of that will be profound for you. When it comes to making sure that your program is addressed, perhaps then we will look at the question of short&hyphen;term and long&hyphen;term advantage.

It is blind absolute panic on behalf of the Labor Party.Then Senator Faulkner got up and argued, `We dont actually want that now. We want to wait until we can get 76 senators in the chamber, thus totally reversing his position. The argument was mounted and we pointed out the complications with such an argument—that, clearly, precedents would be established if pairs were granted in secret ballots, and a number of important contributions from senators showed the problems which would emerge. But the point that Senator Faulkner made about a pair was effectively accepted by Senator Hill—but the debate continues. Why? For the simple reason that the Labor Party has not got the numbers.

I remind the rest of us that nobody extends pairs to the Australian Democrats, the Greens (WA) or the Independents unless we are seriously ill, and I believe that Senator Foreman deserves that consideration.The arguments about secret ballots and pairs are technically correct, but the reality in this place is that party discipline governs all votes for the major parties. I have been here long enough to see that. The point is: you are asking us to believe that somebody on the coalition side will not vote for your nominee. We know that that is 100 per cent unlikely.Senator Hill has made a sensible offer which gets around some of the technicalities. In Senator Sherrys defence I also say: I need to be in the budget lock&hyphen;up too. We do not have the resources of government. It is totally appropriate that those who need to speak about the budget actually have access to the information in time to digest it. So I do not want to have to give up my vote on this occasion either.The fact that Senator Sherry was not able to stay here reflects the fact that we do not have a May budget, we have an August budget. There is a coincidence of this ballot today and the date of the budget, and that is a problem which we should be able to resolve.I understand why Senator Faulkner says we have either the principle that the pairs can operate or that every senator is entitled to cast a vote and we wait until they are all here. That is probably impossible to achieve today except if we say by way of compromise: accept Senator Hills offer of a pair to Senator Foreman, allow Senator Sherry and Senator Kernot to come out of the budget lock&hyphen;up at 7.15 and have the vote when we are all present at 7.20.","N/A","DEPUTY PRESIDENT AND CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES: ELECTION","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/sso[2]/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

197,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COATES","LF4","TAS","ALP","N/A",2693,"—From the Senate, not from the Australian Labor Party. I guess I am a bit saddened by the events of today having got a little in the road of this announcement. I had foreshadowed in March that I was proposing to resign towards the end of the year. I have brought that forward by some weeks for a variety of reasons, one of which is to do with the sitting pattern of the Tasmanian parliament to ensure that there is not an unreasonable length of time before the appointment of my successor.I would like to seek a one-minute appointment with you a little later this evening, Madam President, in order to deal with that formality. Given the events of today, perhaps I should emphasise that I look forward to being a member of the Australian Labor Party for many years to come.My first task is to say a few thankyous: to my family for their tolerance of this political life over so many years; to all those who have been my personal staff over many years—a great variety of them; and to committee staff, particularly of those Senate committees that I have been chair of. I would also like to thank all of those working in this building who have been helpful to me over the years, all of those in this town who have been helpful and all of those in the public service throughout Australia—particularly in Tasmania—who have helped in so many ways. It is sad that so many of them are feeling a bit unwanted these days.I certainly express my appreciation to the Australian Labor Party and in particular to the Left of the party for giving me the opportunity to serve here. I would also express my appreciation to my supporters in Tasmania and, of course, to the electors of Tasmania who have supported the Australian Labor Party over the years.My departure from here will mean that there is nobody left in this chamber who was a member of the parliament for the period of the Whitlam government, which shows you how time passes. Even in the House of Representatives on our side, the only ones who remain are Peter Morris and Ralph Willis. I spent three years in the House of Representatives before spending five years in the electorate office of Senator Ken Wriedt when he was Leader of the Opposition here. I have then spent 15 years in the Senate.In 1972, when I discovered that there were a number of people who had been here for 20 and even 30 years, I remember saying, `If I am still here after 20 years, give me a reminder about this and make sure that I dont stay longer. I have been a member of the parliament for 18 years, but it has been 24 or 25 years since I first sought endorsement. I think an average of those times means that it is time to depart.Even if I had stayed, I would not have been part of the Labor government elected at the next election, and those who will be should be getting in at this point. I would also like to say that I have very mixed feelings about departing, which I guess you would understand—some regrets and perhaps some relief—but the events of today in the Senate I think confirmed in my mind that I was doing the right thing.I have never been entirely comfortable with making speeches, as some of you may have noticed, and I am not going to start now. I guess you could say that I am not a particularly good politician in so far as not being very good at seeking publicity. There are many things that I am proud to have been part of in the electorate, in the parliament and in the caucus. But, dont get me wrong, I am not going to go through a long list.It has been a privilege to have served here on behalf of the party. Being part of the national decision making process is a task that is open to very few people. I am not saying that I was always on the winning side in these matters, but it is a very great honour to have been involved in and been part of the process. There have been fewer Labor senators from Tasmania than I would have expected. On my count, there have only ever been something like 28 Labor senators from Tasmania. I guess if you look at your own states, there might be much the same sort of numbers. So a very small group of people from any one state and from any one party have had this privilege.I have, of course, many memories, which once again I will not enumerate. They range from the torrid times and the achievements of the Whitlam years to all sorts of achievements in the Hawke and Keating years. There are events such as the final passing of the native title bill. There were leadership crises that also stand out. There was the very difficult situation about my opposition to our involvement in the Gulf war and my going through the full process of exempting myself from voting on that matter.I guess the one thing that stands out most of all is my years of chairing the Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee under its various names. In some ways it was a thankless task—it certainly was not one that made the headlines in the Tasmanian media—but it was a task that I mostly enjoyed, even if in many public administration matters I did not achieve the outcomes that I would like to have achieved.It is with a mixture of some pride, some regret and some relief that I thank everyone for their friendship in this place. I hope that everyone goes into the parliamentary process for the remainder of this session with the aim of achieving things for Australia. I guess one of the regrets I have is the circumstances of the sorts of things that have been announced by the new government. I do not want to make a welter of that, but I do look forward to Labor regaining government and implementing the policies which we stand for.","N/A","RESIGNATION OF SENATOR","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[1]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

210,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator SHORT","DJ4","VIC","LP","Assistant Treasurer)",2695,"—May I first take this opportunity to congratulate you warmly on your election to the high office of President of the Senate and to extend to you every good wish for what I know will be a very successful term of office.Tonight the Treasurer is delivering in another place his budget speech for 1996&hyphen;97. It is my privilege and, I might say, great pleasure to outline to the Senate the budget proposals of the government.Tonight the Treasurer announces a programme. for families. for small business. for older Australians. for major improvements in health care and, importantly,. a programme to repair the nations finances and secure our future.This Budget implements the key election commitments of the Coalition and it does so as part of a responsible economic strategy.The focus is savings—savings for investment, sustainable growth and real jobs. This Budget turns around failure and sets us on a winning course.BUDGET REPAIRThe budget outcome for the past year was a deficit of $10.3 billion. If we took no corrective measures it would be $9.6 billion this year. We would still have an underlying deficit of 2 per cent of GDP even though the economy has had five years of growth. Debt would be increasing and Australia would be dangerously exposed to shifts in the international outlook or sentiment.In periods of growth we must put away savings for the downturns. But far from saving, the previous Government kept ratcheting up our debts—spending money it didnt have.Our predecessors had Australia on a path of deficit and debt to the next century.Make no mistake, this path would only make future choices harder, future possibilities bleaker and rob Australians of the future opportunities they deserve.Our Government could not stand back and ignore the problem. Although we did not create it, we will take the responsibility to fix it.The measures the Treasurer announces tonight will reduce the underlying deficit by around $4 billion this year and $7.2 billion over two years. These measures will balance the budget over the term of this Parliament. These are the net effect on the budget bottom line after the introduction of new policy to meet the Coalitions election commitments. These measures represent a historic turnaround in Commonwealth finances. In 1997-98, outlays will have fallen around 1.8 per cent of GDP, while revenues will have risen only 0.2 per cent of GDP.The budget repair will be achieved principally through expenditure savings with a contribution from reduced tax expenditures and measures to curb tax avoidance.Importantly, Madam President, there is no increase in income tax rates, no increase in the company tax rate, no increase in the wholesale sales tax rates and no lift in the petrol excise. There are measures to tighten eligibility and clamp down on misuse, but the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme remains.Madam President, you dont turn around a nations finances, a nations future without making some hard decisions. But if we avoid the hard decisions now they are only going to get harder in the future.The tightening measures have to be fairly shared. We cannot expect those who rely on pensions and allowances—low income earners—to bear the cost. So we are asking high income earners to make a contribution and business to make its contribution too.The measures are balanced, strong and fair.CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTYBefore its election defeat on 2 March, the previous Government maintained that the budget would now be in underlying balance. The truth was nearly $10 billion to the contrary.Financial dishonesty of that magnitude undermines public confidence in our political system. We will ensure it never occurs again.Our Government will enact a Charter of Budget Honesty that will require the government of the day—ours or any other—to publish a budget update signed off by the Secretaries to the Treasury and the Department of Finance at the commencement of each Federal Election campaign. The public will be given updated financial information before the election, not after it. The public will know the state of the books before they vote.The Charter will require any future government to set out its fiscal strategy and report against it—just as this Government is doing.The Charter will entrench this Governments commitment to responsible and accountable fiscal policy.ELECTION COMMITMENTSMadam President, as I said earlier, the major fiscal turnaround in this years Budget has been achieved while honouring our election commitments.We have met the cost of those commitments as we said we would during the election campaign. And our central commitment was to look after families.FAMILIESFrom 1 January 1997 the Governments Family Tax Initiative will provide significant tax relief for almost 2 million low and middle income families.An eligible parent will receive a $1 000 increase in the income tax free threshold for each dependent child.A single income family, with at least one child under the age of 5 years, will receive a further $2 500 increase in the tax free threshold.For a one income family with two children, one of whom is under the age of 5, this will deliver an extra $34 a fortnight.Taxpayers will be able to access the Family Tax Initiative through the PAYE and provi sional tax systems or make a claim on assessment. Equivalent fortnightly cash assistance, to be called the Family Tax Payment, will be available as an alternative for low income families.HEALTHAnd our commitment to families doesnt stop there. The Government will implement major improvements to Australias health care system. Medicare will remain, bulk billing is unchanged. But people will be given greater choice to take out private health insurance. This will stem the declining rate of health insurance and secure the funding of our health system.From 1 July 1997 we will be providing income&hyphen;tested rebates for the cost of private health insurance.Eligible families will receive up to $450 a year.These incentives, together with the Family Tax Initiative, will make a qualifying single income family with two young children better off by more than $50 a fortnight.For couples the rebate on health insurance will be up to $250 a year. For singles the rebate will be up to $125 a year.Madam President, higher income earners who can afford to take out private health insurance will also be encouraged to do so.There will be a 1 per cent Medicare levy surcharge for couples with combined incomes of over $100 000 (individuals with incomes over $50 000) who do not take out health cover.This is the levy which the Government hopes no-one will pay. It is entirely optional. Those who take out health insurance (with the benefits attached) will be exempt.The Commonwealth Governments role in protecting the health of Australian families has been significantly boosted in this Budget which delivers all the public health commitments of the Government.It introduces a range of new measures, including for childhood immunisation and diabetes.It honours commitments in crucial areas such as womens health and the prevention of youth suicide.OLDER AUSTRALIANSMadam President, I wish to underline the Governments commitment to older Australians.Tonights Budget demonstrates this by continuing twice yearly indexation of the pension and making financial provision to maintain the age pension at or above 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings across the forward estimates.This will ensure that the living standards of those who receive a full or part rate pension keep pace with community standards.Madam President, there is another group of older Australians who have saved for their own retirement, have low incomes and pay tax at a much lower threshold than those on the pension.The Government will provide this group of self&hyphen;funded retirees with the same tax rebate as the pensioner rebate, in two stages, commencing with a half rebate for 1996-97. Those low income aged people who qualify for the rebate will receive their full rebate for the 1997-98 income year taking a qualifying single persons tax free threshold from $5 400 to $11 185.And older Australians who take out private health insurance will receive a $250 rebate for couples under our health reform package.SMALL BUSINESSMadam President, the Government is committed to helping small business.It has already met its commitment to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor to 6 per cent so that small business no longer is assessed for provisional tax on income in excess of what it has earned.This will deliver $180 million back to provisional taxpayers in 1996-97.The Government also has legislation in the Parliament to remove the job-destroying unfair dismissal laws.From 1 July 1997 capital gains tax rollover relief will allow small businesses to rollover their business assets without capital gains tax disincentives. This relief from CGT is designed to allow small businesses grow bigger.Many small business proprietors plough all their savings into their business which is both their livelihood and their retirement savings plan. Recognising this, the Government will allow individuals to claim an exemption from CGT, up to a maximum capital gain of $500 000 on the sale of a small business where the proceeds are used for retirement.We will also be meeting our commitment to provide more generous tax treatment for employee share schemes, in order to encourage voluntary saving and a sense of employee participation in Australian business.REGIONAL AUSTRALIAMadam President, tonights Budget will directly help regional Australia.As promised during the election campaign, the Government will increase assistance to isolated students. From 1 January 1997 the Primary and Secondary Correspondence Allowances under the Assistance to Isolated Children Programme will be increased by $1 000 per annum and $1 500 per annum respectively. At the same time, the non-means tested basic boarding allowance under the Programme will be increased to 55 per cent of average boarding fees.In accordance with our election commitment, budget funding for National Highways and Roads of National Importance will enable us to provide $75 million per annum for the next 10 years on a dollar for dollar basis with New South Wales and Queensland to upgrade the Pacific Highway.The Budget provides $36 million in real terms in each of the years 1996-97 to 1999-2000 for the Road Safety Black Spot Programme in accordance with our election commitment. This initiative will reduce the number of fatal and serious injury road crashes and so reduce the social and economic costs of road trauma.Consistent with its election commitment, the Government will provide an exemption from fringe benefits tax on remote area housing for employees in the primary production sector.TRAINING AND APPRENTICESHIPSThe Government also made clear during the election campaign that one of its central priorities is tackling youth unemployment.The budget strategy for sustained growth is about creating real job opportunities in which youth can share.Young people are looking for real training leading to real jobs.Apprenticeships have long been a route for young Australians to get quality jobs, but in 1995 the number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships as a proportion of the workforce was at its lowest level in 3 decades.The Government has therefore allocated $207 million over the next four years towards implementing the Modern Australian Apprenticeship and Traineeship Scheme (MAATS). This will bring Commonwealth expenditure on apprenticeships and traineeships to over $1.7 billion over the next 4 years.MAATS will be a business led system. Employers will only pay for the time the trainee or apprentice spends in productive work.The package includes a wage top-up scheme for apprentices and trainees employed under workplace or certified agreements to increase amounts of quality training while receiving a minimum National Training Wage weekly income.THE ENVIRONMENTThis Budget provides an additional $158 million over 4 years for environment related initiatives on top of the planned Natural Heritage Trust.When established, the Natural Heritage Trust with over $1 billion will finance the largest environment protection and restoration program in Australias history.The establishment of this Trust will go ahead when the partial sale of Telstra is completed. More detail on this is contained in the Environment Ministers statement, Investing in Our Natural Heritage .During the election campaign, the Coalition promised to expedite the implementation of the National Forest Policy Statement. This Budget meets this commitment by providing $49 million over 3 years to accelerate Regional Forest Assessments in 13 forest areas.In addition, the Government will provide $42 million over the next 3 years to establish the Green Corps. The Green Corps will be open to young Australians aged 17 to 20 to demonstrate their commitment to the environment by working on projects to preserve and restore Australias natural environment and cultural heritage. The projects will also contribute to their career and employment prospects through training, skills development, work experience and personal development.I am pleased to confirm tonight that the Government will honour its commitment to restore the CSIROs baseline funding. The Government will provide an additional $115 million over the next 4 years to the CSIRO. This more than meets our commitment to provide $60 million over the triennium.The Government has also decided to maintain the Commonwealths commitment to Cooperative Research Centres, funding for which in 1996-97 is expected to be $11 million higher than in 1995&hyphen;96.We will also meet our commitment to increase funding for higher education research infrastructure and post-graduate scholarships. This will cost $135 million over the next 4 years.REVENUE MEASURESRevenue is expected to increase by 4 per cent in real terms in the Budget year and to remain at around 25 per cent of GDP in the outyears.In keeping with our stated position during the election campaign, the Treasurer announces tonight a major effort to improve tax compliance.The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) will be provided with additional funds in 1996-97 and 1997-98 to establish a special high level task force to improve the compliance of high wealth individuals with our income tax laws.Enhanced investigation activity and analysis will allow a greater understanding of the complex arrangements used by some high wealth individuals to minimise tax, and to progressively develop administrative and legislative proposals to deal with these arrangements and others that may be put in place in the future.The revenue at risk from aggressive tax planning and minimisation arrangements used by some high wealth individuals has been estimated at $800 million a year.The timing of recovery and the amounts will depend on the outcome of these ATO investigations and it is expected that future budgets will include additional revenue for years beyond 1997-98.However, it is expected that early improvements in compliance, both voluntarily and through enforcement of existing law alone, will generate revenue in the order of $100 million in 1997-98.The Treasurer is also announcing tonight a series of measures to prevent tax avoidance and safeguard the revenue base.From tonight, the general anti&hyphen;avoidance provisions of the income tax law—Part IVA—will be extended so that they can apply to Australias withholding tax regime.Other amendments to the withholding tax provisions will further assist in preventing tax avoidance. These measures do not signal any change in the Governments policy regarding withholding taxes.Measures will also be proposed to prevent tax avoidance through the use of distributions by charitable trusts to overseas organisations. The Government will release an exposure draft of the legislation as a priority, and will undertake consultations before introducing the legislation into the Parliament to ensure that bona fide charitable organisations are not detrimentally affected.The Government will limit, with immediate effect, excessive tax benefits obtained through luxury car leases.In order to reduce serious evasion of sales tax, a change in the means of paying tax on computers will be introduced following consultation with industry.","N/A","BUDGET 1996-97","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/debate.sub1/speech/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

In an effort to ensure that all areas of government expenditure deliver intended outcomes, the Government will be examining the effectiveness of concessional taxation treatments.In many cases, the replacement of tax concessions with outlays programs will ensure that the community and the direct beneficiaries of the programs get better value for their tax dollar.Madam President, on 23 July the Treasurer announced several measures to limit abuse of the R&D tax concession.Tonight the Treasurer announces that the R&D tax concession will be reduced to a top rate of 125 per cent.At a top rate of 125 per cent, the R&D tax incentive remains among the most concessional in the OECD and compares more than favourably with concessions provided by our regional neighbours, including Singapore and Malaysia.Following consultations with industry and researchers, the Government will establish a new program—the Strategic Assistance for Research and Development program. Under the program, the Government will provide a flexible package of assistance of $340 million over the next 4 years to encourage highly innovative research and development with emphasis on projects that have support for commercialisation from the private sector. This will allow government assistance to be better targeted and assist projects not able to adequately utilise the tax concession.OUTLAYS MEASURESMadam President, given the magnitude of its fiscal task, the Government has had to ensure that government expenditure is targeted to those in need and delivered efficiently and effectively.While maintaining a strong and secure safety net, the Government will introduce a range of initiatives to better target income assistance, including strengthening the activity test for Job Search and Newstart Allowances and improving fraud detection and debt recovery. They will produce savings of $2.6 billion over the next 4 years.The Government has also had to look at those expenditure areas that are growing the fastest year on year and keep the rate of growth to manageable proportions.The Government will work with the pathology industry to slow the unsustainable growth in pathology outlays under the Medical Benefits Scheme. With reforms to diagnostic imaging, these will save $586 million over 4 years.The maximum co&hyphen;payment for general patients under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will increase to $20 from 1 January 1997, saving $180 million over 4 years.At the same time the maximum co&hyphen;payment for concessional patients will increase from $2.70 to $3.20, saving $324 million over 4 years.As waiting times for public dental health services have now been reduced, funding for the Commonwealth Dental Programme will cease from 1 January 1997, saving $399 million over 4 years. From 1997 the States will again be responsible for these services.This Budget initiates a programme of structural reform of residential aged care to address major flaws in the existing system. This will unify the hostel and nursing home systems and save $479 million over 4 years.Tonights Budget also addresses the imbalance in funding between providers of centre based child care services by removing the operational subsidy for community based long day care centres. At the same time, the Government will provide an additional $10 million a year in real terms from 1997-98 for children with additional needs to be accommodated in services.The Government is announcing in this Budget the most significant reorganisation of labour market assistance arrangements since the establishment of the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) in 1946.Labour market programmes will be radically refocussed on getting the unemployed into lasting jobs.Assistance will now be tailored to the needs of individual jobseekers and the impediments they face in getting a job rather than being programme driven.A competitive market will be established to provide employment placement services for eligible jobseekers.Madam President, the Governments fiscal consolidation strategy will improve the business and interest rate environment in Australia.In return, industry must also play its part in fiscal tightening. Industry assistance programmes, like other programmes, need to be evaluated to assess their effectiveness and their priority.In line with the introduction of user charging generally, cost recovery will be introduced for elements of customs processing of import transactions.A number of low priority business service programmes have been abolished including the Australian Manufacturing Council, the Support for Asia Infrastructure Consortia and the Information Technology Development Programme.The Government has also acted to rationalise and focus export assistance.The Export Market Development Grants Scheme (EMDGS) will be retained but capped at $150 million per annum, while its operations will be rationalised and targeted to small and medium size firms.Madam President, in its efforts to reduce spending the Government has not overlooked the cost of delivering its own programmes.As well as cutting departmental running costs, savings of $727 million over 4 years will be made from the application of an Efficiency Dividend to Commonwealth Own Purpose Outlays and also to Specific Purpose Payments to the States.The Government will also introduce a property strategy which is expected to result in savings of $731 million over the next 4 years.The Government also expects to secure one-off savings of around $300 million in 1996-97 by reducing the levels of cash and financial investments currently held by some statutory authorities.SUPERANNUATIONSuperannuation is central to encouraging self-provision for retirement. It is central to coping with an ageing population and is an important vehicle for national saving.The measures the Treasurer is announcing tonight are designed to make superannuation fairer.A major deficiency of the current system is that tax benefits for superannuation are overwhelmingly biased in favour of high income earners. For a person on the top tax rate, superannuation is a 33 percentage point tax concession while a person earning $20 000 receives a 5 percentage point tax concession. High income earners can take added advantage through salary sacrifice arrangements that are not available to lower income earners.The Government is remedying this situation.From tonight, a surcharge of 15 per cent will apply to future employer superannuation contributions for those whose income (including deductible superannuation contributions) is at or above $85 000. The surcharge will phase in over the income range $70 000 to $85 000. It will apply to defined benefit and unfunded schemes, including members of parliament as well. For superannuation contributors with such incomes below $70 000 per annum, there will be no change whatsoever. There is no change to any persons accrued benefit.For high income earners the superannuation contributions will still be highly concessional but are more in line with concessions to middle and low income earners.To further enhance the fairness of superannuation, the Government is introducing a range of reforms designed to improve the access of particular groups to superannuation.The Government will provide an 18 per cent rebate for up to $3 000 of contributions made by a person on behalf of his or her low income spouse.This will be of particular benefit to women outside the paid workforce who are currently denied access to their own superannuation plan.The Government will also extend from 65 to 70 years the age limit up to which those in the workforce can make superannuation contributions. This will address the current discrimination against older Australians who are still in employment.To enhance competition and choice in superannuation, the Government will introduce Retirement Savings Accounts. These will be a simple, low cost, superannuation product.The Government will maintain the Superannuation Guarantee at the levels and time frame currently legislated.However, the Superannuation Guarantee threshold, at $450 a month, is too low. People on very low incomes are being forced into superannuation which is unlikely to provide a retirement income when their pressing need is to maintain current living standards.The Government will allow employees with incomes between $450 and $900 a month to choose between Superannuation Guarantee contributions or the equivalent as wages and salary.Madam President, in 1992 the previous Government legislated tax cuts into L.A.W which have never been paid. In last years Budget it was claimed they would be paid into superannuation between 1998 and 2000 for employees paying 1 to 3 per cent of their take home pay into superannuation.Our Government will encourage employees to make these superannuation contributions from their take home pay and has made provision in the forward estimates for the co-contribution. But the Government will review the mechanism for the delivery of the L.A.W tax cuts to ensure they are paid in an equitable and effective way. They will be paid into superannuation or like savings vehicles.Madam President, these changes will provide a much fairer superannuation system and one which more readily meets the differing circumstances of individual Australians.ECONOMIC OUTLOOKMadam President, the Australian economy has been growing for 5 years since the recession of the early 1990s, but there has been little or no progress in boosting saving or reducing unemployment.The policies of the former Government have given Australians:. continuing high unemployment; it has not been below 8 per cent since late 1990; and. a national saving problem where the average current account deficit has doubled as a share of GDP since the beginning of the 1980s.The Government inherited an economy beset with long&hyphen;standing and deep&hyphen;rooted problems that must be addressed now if economic growth and improved living standards are to be sustained in the years to come.Fiscal consolidation and labour market reform are critical to achieving lower unemployment and improved living standards. It will take concerted effort to reap the benefits of these reforms. But to do nothing would exacerbate our difficulties.Fortunately the world economy is continuing to move ahead, with Japan, our largest trading partner, on the road to recovery.Our GDP is forecast to grow by 3&half; per cent in 1996&hyphen;97 and inflation by less than 3 per cent.Consistent with a positive outlook, business investment is expected to rise by around 14 per cent, boosting demand, which is expected to grow by over 4 per cent.After a long period in the doldrums, investment in housing is expected to begin to recover during 1996&hyphen;97. Notwithstanding the savings measures announced in the Budget, public sector demand is forecast to strengthen in 1996-97.The farm sector is expected to grow at a solid rate, following the recovery last year from the drought.The continuing strong growth in our major trading partners will result in another year of very strong export growth. Imports will pick up in line with the strengthening in domestic demand and the rapid growth in highly import intensive areas of investment.Because of solid investment the current account deficit is expected to show only a modest improvement in 1996-97, and at 4 per cent of GDP remains high, reflecting the structural weakness that our fiscal consolidation is designed to address over time.Employment should grow by around 2 per cent in the year to June 1997 and the unemployment rate should decline, albeit only slowly.CONCLUSIONMadam President, the Budget I have brought down tonight is one of reform.It changes the conduct of fiscal policy in this country and delivers imaginative reforms to a wide range of government programmes.The major fiscal turnaround in this years Budget will enable Australia to sustain higher rates of growth in incomes and employment, without putting pressure on the current account deficit and interest rates.By decisively addressing the Commonwealth budgets drain on national saving it represents an investment in Australias future.A future that offers sustainable growth, more jobs and higher living standards.I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the statement and documents.Leave granted.","N/A","BUDGET 1996-97","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/debate.sub1/speech/break/break/break/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This brief of evidence consisted of 20 volumes of affidavits and other documents.(4) The US Justice Department alleged that Mr Kalejs served in the Arajs Kommando (Latvian Security Auxiliary Police) during the Nazi occupation of Latvia in World War II. It is also alleged that Mr Kalejs lied about his war time activities when he obtained a visa to enter the US.(6) The AFP maintains close liaison with the United States and Canadian authorities, and material relevant to this case has been made readily available to the AFP.(7) Applications made to the Commonwealth for financial assistance are received in confidence and information regarding any particular application cannot be released without express or implied permission of the applicant.In relation to questions (5), (8) and (9):(5) Yes.(8) Under the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 there is a power to deprive a person of his or her Australian citizenship where the person provided false information when applying for citizenship. The person must first be convicted under the Act of knowingly making a false or misleading representation in a material particular or concealing a material circumstance in relation to their citizenship application. Prosecution for such an offence must be commenced within 10 years of the commission of the offence. Such a conviction enlivens a discretion to deprive the person of their Australian citizenship if it would be contrary to the public interest for the person to continue to be an Australian citizen.(9) No. Under international law, a State is precluded from refusing its own nationals the right of entry or residence.N/A","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[1]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is considered that there would be little value for money in taking such action.(2) ATSICs South Hedland Regional Manager wrote to the Strelley Housing Society Incorporated requesting repayment of the sum of $101,752, plus interest, that had pertained to a housing grant allocated to the organisation in 1991/92.The Duesburys financial investigation was able to identify the amount of all additional surplus funds still held by the Strelley Nomads organisation.However, there have been a number of legal issues which have required clarification. Once these issues have been clarified, ATSIC will write to Strelley Nomads to request the repayment of those surpluses identified by Duesburys.(3) The former Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs did not make a formal referral to the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) to enquire into the administration of ATSIC grants to Strelley communities from the South Hedland Regional Office.ATSIC advises that while the Nomads Health Service Review Team had recommended a referral to the ANAO, the Strelley Nomads Task Force Review Team had resolved that an assessment would be undertaken by the ATSIC State Manager, South Hedland Regional Manager and the Office of Evaluation and Audit (OEA) of whether an ANAO audit would be necessary in addition to an OEA audit of the South Hedland Regional Office undertaken in July 1993.On receipt of the OEA audit of the South Hedland Regional Office, the Task Force Review Team further commented that due to the need to undertake an investigation of the Strelley Nomads administration and the South Hedland Regional Office conjointly, it would be more appropriate to engage a chartered accountant from a leading Accounting Company to carry out the required investigations. It was advised that any Review by a chartered accountant would need to include an examination of the administrative arrangements between Strelley Nomads and ATSIC South Hedland.Consequently, Duesburys Chartered Accountants was requested following its financial investigation of Strelley Nomads to further investigate administrative arrangements with the ATSIC South Hedland Regional Office that had not already been covered by the investigation.

The primary requirement of the activity test is that the person must be actively seeking and willing to undertake suitable paid work.

They are issued where there is reason to believe that a customer is not making reasonable efforts to seek suitable paid work.(2) There is no readily available data which reliably indicates the number of employer contact certificates issued.(3) During the year ending 17 May 1996, records show 304 customers had their payment cancelled as a result of the operation of employer contact certificates.

The first stage of the project commenced on 2 January 1996 and will finish on 28 June 1996. The second stage commenced on 5 February 1996 and will finish on 4 August 1996.(3) There are seven staff, two full&hyphen;time, one part time and four casual.(4) All resources deemed capital in nature have been leased. These include the leasing of the land, sheds, irrigation system, rotary hoe, portable toilet, pump, toilets and two tractors.All those deemed non capital in nature have been purchased. These include:For participants on the project:Boots, protective clothing, wet weather clothing, first&hyphen;aid kits, morning tea amenities, telephone, working clothes, hats, sunscreen and insect repellents, hot water system, kitchen sink, cups, drinking bottles, cleaning materials.Training materials:Drill, drill bits, hammers, welding materials, construction tools, saws, piping, timber, steel, hoes, nuts and bolts, glue and adhesives, shovels, rakes, whiteboard, training videos, text books, notebooks, agricultural facts book, horticulture curriculum, agriculture market reports, fertilisers, insecticides, spray equipment, cleaning materials, ground covers, boxes, petroleum products.Site costs:Water, water storage tank, electricity connection, phone connection, rubbish bins.All these expenditures/purchases are in line with contractual obligations set by the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs and agreed to by the STEC under the NWO contract and attachments to the contract.(5) Sponsor organisations must ensure that the conditions of the contract are met before any payments are made. These include:The project set&hyphen;up costs for each project as outlined in the Project Application, to be paid by the Department to the organisation in two instalments as follows:(a) the first instalment of 80% of the project set&hyphen;up costs, paid within 14 days of receipt of the correct invoice for set&hyphen;up costs from the STEC but not earlier than one month prior to the commencement of the particular project; and(b) the balance of 20% of the project set&hyphen;up costs is to be paid within 14 days of receipt of acceptance by the Department of the Final Financial Statement and Management Report for the particular project. As yet the 20% final payment has not been made to the STEC for either stage of the project.In dollar terms this means that for each stage $76,480 has been paid to the STEC as payment for the 80% set&hyphen;up costs for each stage. The remaining 20% will not be paid until the completion of the project.In relation to the Training Allowance costs for the participants on each project these are paid by the Department to the Sponsor organisation in four instalments as set out below:(a) The first instalment, equivalent to 30% of the total Training Allowance costs, paid within 14 days of the Department being advised by the STEC of the starting date for each project and confirmation that the Job Compact clients had been recruited for the project. In this case the first instalment has been paid to STEC for both stages at a cost of $41,145 for Stage I and $41,067 for Stage II.(b) The second instalment, equivalent to 30% of the total Training Allowance costs, paid within 14 days of the STEC providing appropriate evidence that 80% of the first Training Allowance instalment was spent. In this case the STEC provided the necessary evidence for both stages and was paid $41,067 for each stage (total of $82,134).(c) The third instalment, equivalent to 30% of the total Training Allowance costs, paid within 14 days of the Sponsor providing appropriate evidence that 100% of the first Training Allowance instalment and 80% of the second Training Allowance instalment have been spent. The STEC has been paid $41,145 for Stage I and has recently submitted a report, acquittal and invoice for Stage II which are being evaluated.(d) The final instalment, equivalent to 10% of the total Training Allowance costs, paid within 14 days of the Sponsor providing evidence that 80% of the third Training Allowance instalment and 100% of the first and second Training Allowance instalments have been spent. The STEC has not yet submitted an application for the payment of this final instalment for either project.Evidence has to be supplied prior to the payment of the second and subsequent instalments of the project set&hyphen;up costs and training allowance costs including a progress report. An acquittal form is required prior to payment of the final payment for the project set&hyphen;up costs for each particular project.In respect of this project, payment has been made strictly adhering to the conditions of the contract.(6) Two participants have lodged complaints specifically about wages. Both of these were due to minor clerical errors and were rectified as soon as identified.A complaint was received in the office of the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs from a project supervisor who was dismissed by the STEC from his position due to concerns about his supervisory abilities.Some participants have raised concerns with CES staff about the level of supervision on the project and the off&hyphen;the&hyphen;job training.(7) Complaints were raised concerning occupational health and safety issues, mostly related to working outdoors; the effects of heat and sun during the summer months and working during inclement weather. Participants were supplied with sun protective clothing, sunscreen and wet weather clothing. Participants have also complained about sore backs after bending and picking for long periods.A rail line on the property divides the market garden from the packing shed. As a safety measure the gates are kept closed and crossing of the rail line is only permitted when arriving and departing the work site, during tea breaks and at lunch time.Work Cover officials inspected the site and as a result, additional first aid equipment was purchased, three participants were given additional training in first aid and the condition of the amenities was improved with the construction of a permanent toilet. A complaint involving possible unsafe practices in the use of chemicals was raised by an ex&hyphen;employee of the STEC however, Work Cover was unable to find a problem.(8) Mr John McIntyre has never been employed by the STEC but has provided volunteer assistance to the project.Mr Jason McIntyre is a supervisor of the project and initially applied for the position when it was advertised in the local press. Although at that stage he was ranked suitable, he was not selected for the position. Following the dismissal of two other supervisors, Jason McIntyre was appointed with the authorisation of the Chairman of the STEC Board, Mr David Sillett and the Chief Executive Officer, Mr Eric Gordon.Mrs Helen McIntyre was recently appointed by the STEC as a supervisor of the project.(9) All positions, except that which Mrs Helen McIntyre holds, were advertised in the local newspapers or were appointed from internal positions. Formal interviews were conducted and suitable applicants were appointed to the positions.(10) The number of positive outcomes from the project is not yet known as the first stage of the project will not be completed until 28 June 1996. However, recent discussions by Departmental officers with STEC have indicated that it is prepared to employ fourteen trainees working on the property growing and selling produce. It is intended at this stage that some trainees will come from the pool of project participants and others will come from a selection of people on the CES register.N/A","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[6]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

229,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Senator Hill","BH4","SA","LP","N/A",2710,"—The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senators question:(1) I am aware of the documents provided by the Iraqi Charge DAffaires to which you refer, as well as the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) reports describing the humanitarian situation in Iraq under UN sanctions. I believe the UN Security Council has responded appropriately to the deteriorating situation in Iraq by securing Iraqs agreement on 20 May 1996 to implement UNSCR 986, the third `oil&hyphen;for&hyphen;food resolution offered by the UN Security Council to the Iraqi Government. It needs to be emphasised that the problems of food supply and distribution in Iraq were imposed by the Iraqi government on the Iraqi people. The agreed procedures for implementing UNSCR 986 will allow Iraq to export a limited amount of oil in return for a UN&hyphen;monitored distribution of humanitarian aid to the general Iraqi populace, including Kurdish populations in the North.The Australian Government immediately welcomed this announcement and expressed its full support for the agreement, which will go some way towards alleviating the suffering of the Iraqi civilian population. We should note that the option of addressing the nutritional and health situation of the Iraqi people through this process has been available to the Iraqi Government since 1991, when the UN Security Council adopted UNSCR 706, the first `oil&hyphen;for&hyphen;food resolution. Further, it has always been within the Iraqi Governments capacity simply to comply with the relevant UNSCRs thus ensuring that sanctions are lifted. As the UN Special Rapporteur on Iraq of the Commission for Human Rights, Mr Max van der Stoel pointed out in his report of March 1996 the Government of Iraq is to be held accountable for any human hardship in Iraq.Prior to agreement being reached on UNSCR 986 the UN Security Council and UN member&hyphen;states, conscious of the basic needs of the Iraqi people, specifically exempted food and medical supplies from the sanctions, and provided a facility for the approval of exports to Iraq of essential civilian goods. The UN and many non&hyphen;government organisations (including CARE Australia) have throughout the period of sanctions operated an emergency relief program that met some of the needs of Iraqis most affected by sanctions. The Australian Government since 1993/94 has annually contributed a substantial amount in emergency aid to Iraq through multilateral and non&hyphen;government channels.As a member&hyphen;state of the United Nations, Australia is bound by the 32 United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs) on Iraq, including UNSCR 661 which imposed economic sanctions on that state. Sanctions are one of the few non&hyphen;military options available to the international community to encourage a Government to behave in a manner that does not threaten international peace and security. Australia has strongly and publicly supported the UN Security Council in maintaining sanctions on Iraq and since 1991 has actively contributed resources to UN activities and organisations such as the UN Special Commission (UNSCOM), overseeing the destruction and ongoing monitoring of Iraqs Weapons of Mass Destruction capacity; and to the Maritime Interception Force (MIF) operating in the Arabian Gulf and Gulf of Aqaba. HMAS Melbourne is currently deployed to the Persian Gulf fulfilling these obligations on behalf of the Australian Government. The Australian Government believes the Government of Iraq must fulfil all remaining aspects of the relevant UN Security Council Resolutions, including accounting for Kuwaitis and third country nationals still missing after the Gulf War, the settlement of reparation claims, and in particular, those relating to the destruction of its WMD capabilities.(2) There appears to be insufficient data available accurately to estimate the effect of sanctions on the Iraqi populace overall. Inevitably, the economic sanctions on Iraq have impacted adversely on many areas of the economy, including basic infrastructure, the environment, local food production, the provision of health services, the rationing of essential supplies, with consequences for the quality of life enjoyed by the average Iraqi citizen, particularly women and children. The 1995 survey conducted jointly by the FAO and the Nutrition Research Institute of the Iraqi Ministry of Health revealed the seriousness of malnutrition amongst Iraqi children. The WHO report of March 1996, comparing the levels of the infant mortality rate and the mortality rate of children under 5 years during the pre&hyphen;war period (1988&hyphen;89) with that during the period of the sanctions (since 1990), found that the infant mortality rate has doubled and the mortality rate of children under 5 years has increased six times. This is regarded as the result of malnutrition of mothers and children; and the widespread prevalence of infectious diseases. The maternal mortality rate, based on available data, appears to have gone up several fold since 1991. The WHO report recognised that due to the deterioration in the data collection systems in Iraq since 1991, these may underestimate the true situation. It is the Australian Governments view that both the UN and the Government of Iraq have responded responsibly to this situation, by agreeing to implement UNSCR 986. This way of alleviating hardship was long offered by the international community, in the face of obstinacy and intransigence from the Government of Iraq.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[7]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

231,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Senator Vanstone","7E4","SA","LP","N/A",2711,"—The Attorney&hyphen;General has provided the following answer to the honourable senators question:(1) The government has recently considered the feasibility of developing arrangements to enable prisoners to be transferred between Australia and other countries.In light of the humanitarian, rehabilitative and possible financial benefits, the government has decided to proceed with such a scheme.A substantial amount of work has already been undertaken on this project in the Standing Committee of Attorneys&hyphen;General (SCAG) forum. The government is continuing to consult closely with the states and territories on this matter, and the proposed legislative and administrative steps will be undertaken in a cooperative manner.Both Commonwealth and state/territory legislation is required to be enacted. The legislation is being drafted by the Parliamentary Counsels Committee at the direction of SCAG. After a lengthy period of consultation and detailed discussions with the states and territories, the draft Commonwealth legislation is now close to being finalised. Parliamentary Counsels Committee, in conjunction with NSW instructors, has also progressed the model state/territory legislation. Both the Commonwealth Bill and the model state/territory legislation are expected to be ready for SCAG endorsement in the near future.The legislation alone will not be sufficient to enable prisoners to be transferred between Australia and other countries. There must also be some form of agreement between Australia and the other country. To this end, the government intends to seek to become party to the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, to participate in the Commonwealth Scheme for the Transfer of Convicted Offenders, and to negotiate bilateral treaties with particular countries as appropriate.Some preliminary discussions have already taken place with Thai officials for this purpose. The conclusion of a prisoner transfer agreement with Thailand is a high priority because of the comparatively high number of Australian prisoners in Thai prisons. Any agreement reached with Thailand will not enter into force before Australias legislation (Commonwealth and state/territory) is in place.(2) I am advised that the Commonwealth legislation is expected to be introduced during 1996. It is hoped that the state/territory legislation will be introduced in the parliaments of the participating states and territories at approximately the same time as the Commonwealth legislation is introduced.N/A","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[8]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The decision was taken in the context of a review of the viability of the Departments regional network given the reductions in running costs for the Department and the issues which have arisen for the regional offices since opening. These issues relate to the complexity of subject matter, maintaining adequate and appropriate staffing levels and the capacity to keep offices open at all times.(a) The closures have not been handled in a secretive manner. The decision to close the offices was taken on 28 June 1996 and announced to staff on 1 July 1996 and to local members on 2 July. There has been full consultation with staff and unions throughout the review process which led to the final decision on closure. The possibility of office closures was foreshadowed with staff and unions during the review process.(b) The considerations surrounding the decision related to departmental management issues rather than to the community—particularly the capacity to provide in very small offices the depth and breadth of program knowledge necessary to adequately cover the wide range of programs of the Department. These issues needed to be worked through with staff before public announcements. On the other hand, the Department had previously had considerable input from the community on its service needs and priorities. Therefore consultation with the community was not considered appropriate before the decision being made. Officers of the Department have dealt with community concerns as they have arisen in many regions. Consultation with key community stakeholders will form part of the implementation process as the decision is put into effect. This will help ensure that regional focus is maintained in the planning and delivery of services.(c) There will be no reduction in service levels as a result of this decision. The majority of the Departments activities are not related to direct service delivery, but to the funding of community and other organisations to provide services. The implementation process for the closures will include strategies to ensure that a regional focus is maintained while programs are administered from the Perth office of the Department. There will be a particular emphasis on ensuring effective administration and support for services for Aboriginal people.The Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service which provides vocational rehabilitation to people with injuries and disabilities is not affected by this decision.(d) As noted under part (c) the decision will not affect levels of service delivery.N/A","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[18]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

253,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Senator Parer","KI4","QLD","LP","N/A",2719,"—The answer to the honourable senators question is as follows:(1) The Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) grants Fishing Permits, Foreign Fishing Licences and Statutory Fishing Rights (SFRs) under the Fisheries Management Act 1991. While these fishing authorities may be granted at any time, for some fisheries they may be granted at the same time each year. At present Fishing Permits, Foreign Fishing Licences and SFRs are current for the following long-line fishing activities:Fishing Permits for using pelagic longlines in the Eastern, Southern and Western Tuna and Billfish Fisheries.Fishing Permits for using pelagic longlines to take shark off south eastern Australia.Fishing Permits for using pelagic longlines in waters adjacent to Christmas Island.Fishing Permits for using demersal longlines to take shark and other demersal species off south eastern Australia. Currently these Permits expire on either 30 June or 31 December.Foreign Fishing Licences for tuna longlining by Japanese vessels under the Bilateral Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the Government of Japan. These are issued annually following agreement of the annual total allowable catch for Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT). The current Licences will expire on 31 October 1996.SFRs granted under the Southern Bluefin Tuna Fishery Management Plan 1995 allow for domestic longlining for SBT. These SFRs continue to have effect while the Plan remains in force.(2) The Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) advises that there are currently 245 Australian boats for which Fishing Permits have been granted to allow pelagic longlining and 248 Australian boats for which Fishing Permits have been granted to allow demersal longlining. These Permits are re-granted annually subject to continuing eligibility. In addition, 116 Foreign Fishing Licences have been granted. These Licences will expire on 31 October 1996 and are normally granted annually, subject to the satisfactory conclusion of a Bilateral Agreement with Japan.(3) In the absence of an Offshore Constitutional Settlement (OCS) arrangement, the New South Wales Fisheries Department (the NSW Department) has fisheries jurisdiction of its coastal waters, i.e. out to 3 nautical miles, and AFMA has jurisdiction from 3 nautical miles seaward to the outer limit of the Australian Fishing Zone (AFZ). AFMA grants Fishing Permits for the East Coast Tuna and Billfish Fishery and Statutory Fishing Rights for the SBT fishery in waters under Commonwealth jurisdiction. While the NSW Department licences boats to operate in NSW coastal waters, pelagic longlining and the taking of SBT are prohibited. Under OCS arrangements in force, NSW has jurisdiction over demersal longlining to approximately eighty nautical miles off shore.(4) Eligibility for a Fishing Permit generally depends on satisfying specific criteria that vary from fishery to fishery. Eligibility criteria for the grant of Foreign Fishing Licences for tuna longlining by Japanese vessels under the Bilateral Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the Government of Japan are set out in the Agreement. Eligibility criteria for the grant of SFRs for the Southern Bluefin Tuna Fishery are set out in the Southern Bluefin Tuna Fishery Management Plan 1995.(5) Under the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 (the EPIP Act) AFMA is required to refer to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) any proposal that it believes could affect the environment to a significant extent. The EPA and AFMA have agreed that the formulation of fisheries management plans should be the primary activity assessed under the EPIP Act. Guidelines are in the process of being finalised between the EPA and AFMA which identify broad categories of decisions that as a general rule are not environmentally significant. Licensing decisions fall within one of those categories.(6) The only management plan that covers longlining is the Southern Bluefin Tuna Fishery Management Plan 1995 which was determined on 3 February 1995.(7) Most pelagic longline fishing in the AFZ involves a number of target species. A number of commercial species may be taken in each longline `shot. In many cases non-target or `bycatch species can form a significant portion of the commercial return to a longline operator.The following table, provided by AFMA, shows information from 1995 logbook returns on the number of fish caught by species in pelagic longline fisheries in the AFZ.

255,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Senator Parer","KI4","QLD","LP","N/A",2720,"—The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answers to the honourable senators questions:For a proper understanding of the issues raised within Senator Woodleys question, a brief background on the Governments forest policy is helpful.The National Forest Policy Statement (NFPS) sets out broad conservation and industry goals for the management of Australias forests agreed between the Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments. Under the NFPS, Governments agreed to a framework and process for carrying out comprehensive assessments of the economic, social, environmental and heritage values of forest regions. Comprehensive Regional Assessments (CRAs) will provide Governments with the information required to make long&hyphen;term decisions about forest use and management. It will be possible to complete a national comprehensive, adequate and representative (CAR) reserve system which will safeguard biodiversity, old growth, wilderness and other natural and cultural values of forests. It will also be possible to identify the optimal use and management of areas outside the reserve system.The Commonwealth and State Governments have commenced the processes to enable them to negotiate an agreement setting out their obligations in relation to each forest region—a Regional Forest Agreement (RFA). RFAs will give industry the certainty necessary to make the investment which will underpin sustainable industry development, and provide a basis for the management of environmental values through CAR reserves and complementary off&hyphen;reserve management.Deferred Forest Assessments (DFAs) evaluated current levels of reservation of old growth, biodiversity and wilderness values and identified additional forest areas that may be required for a CAR reserve system (`deferred forest areas—called `interim forest areas in some States).The Commonwealth developed criteria which were used for the DFA process. Using these criteria, the Commonwealth aimed to ensure that sufficient suitable areas were set aside as deferred forest areas to enable the following indicative benchmarks to be met within well designed and integrated reserves in the ensuing RFA process:(i) a broad benchmark of 15% of the pre&hyphen;1750 distribution of each forest community to be protected within the reserve system;(ii) retention in reserves of at least 60% of existing old growth, increasing up to 100% (where practicable) for rare old growth; and(iii) protection of 90%, or more wherever practicable, of areas of high quality wilderness that exceeds minimum size thresholds.The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (the world heritage governing body) and the World Wide Fund for Nature, have suggested 10 per cent of current forest cover as a conservation target. More than 22 per cent of Australias forest estate is protected in conservation reserves (equating to about 14 per cent of pre&hyphen;European forest cover).This will ensure that it will be possible to develop well designed and integrated CAR reserves through the ensuing RFA process.The DFA process also sought to maximise the protection of national estate values, threatened and rare species and the extent to which forest communities were represented across their geographic range (`representativeness). The DFA process sought to maximise conservation values while minimising the economic and social costs.(1)(a) Rather than specifically approve or prohibit the export of particular species, the Commonwealth prohibits the export of woodchips produced from timber harvested in deferred forest areas. The Commonwealth also prohibits the export of the following species from Tasmania: coastal Eucalyptus amygdalina, Eucalyptus amygdalina on dolerite, Eucalyptus amygdalina inland, Eucalyptus amygdalina on sandstone, Eucalyptus globulus&hyphen;viminalis coastal, Eucalyptus pulchella&hyphen;globulus&hyphen;viminalis dry, inland Eucalyptus tenuiramis, Eucalyptus viminalis grassy woodland, and Eucalyptus viminalis&hyphen;ovata&hyphen;rodwayi. I refer Senator Woodley to the Deferred Forest Assessments of December 1995 (called an Interim Forest Assessment for Tasmania), for detailed information on species included in or required for reserves. Other than the aforementioned restrictions, it is a matter for exporters to determine the species of material they utilise.(b) The range and distribution of these species is generally referred to in the Deferred Forest Assessments. These matters are currently being addressed through the CRA process.(c) The utilisation of particular species depends primarily upon their suitability for specific purposes, the commercial viability of their use, and State Government regulatory regimes.(d) Exports of hardwood woodchips (in bone dry tonnes) in each of the calendar years listed below were:N/Amillion bone dry tonnes million green metric tonnes 1990 2.5 4.6 1991 2.7 5.0 1992 2.3 4.2 1993 2.7 5.0 1994 2.4 4.4 1995 2.8 5.1The volumes stated in green metric tonnes represent the broad equivalent of the volumes specified in bone dry tonnes.The conversion factor varies, however, depending upon the moisture content of the wood.N/A(e) Since 1990, hardwood woodchips and logs have been exported to Japan, Taiwan and Korea.(2)(a) The Deferred Forest Assessments contain coverage of State legislative regimes relating to the protection of forest values.(b) The range and distribution of these species is generally referred to in the Deferred Forest Assessments.

257,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Senator Parer","KI4","QLD","LP","N/A",2722,"—The answer to the honourable senators question is as follows:(1) & (2) The southern bluefin tuna (SBT) is a highly migratory fish that spawns in the Indian Ocean. This species is subject to intense scientific study and international management through the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT). In May of this year Australia, Japan, and New Zealand agreed on this years global catch quota for southern bluefin tuna (SBT) at 11,750 tonnes, the same as last years figure. The CCSBT decided national allocations were also the same as last year with 5,265 tonnes to Australia, 6,065 tonnes to Japan, and 420 tonnes to New Zealand.The Commission is a multilateral body established under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in 1994. The founding members are Australia, Japan, and New Zealand, the three major SBT fishing nations. The global SBT stock has been severely depleted by overfishing, but the Commission is working to ensure that the stock recovers.This years negotiations were particularly difficult and protracted, because Australian and New Zealand scientists have a more pessimistic view of the level of the tuna stock than the Japanese. As a result, Australia and New Zealand did not support a Japanese proposal for a 6,000 tonne increase in the annual catch.The Commission agreed on a substantial program of collaborative scientific work to reduce the uncertainties in our knowledge of the tuna stock. It set down clear objectives and principles for evaluating whether experimental fishing could, in the future, provide for more responsive decision-making in the fishery. The Commission have agreed that management should be directed towards returning to the `biologically safe level of 1980 stock levels by 2020. Setting a target recovery date is a major leap forward for the Commission, although it recognises that the tuna stock may take years to recover from the overfishing of previous decades. The CCSBT next meets in September 1996.Eastern gemfish was an important commercial species for the NSW trawl industry during the late 1970s and 1980s. However, from 1985 to 1989 recruitment of eastern gemfish was greatly reduced. In response, the Australian Fisheries Service, and subsequently AFMA, progressively reduced the total allowable catch (TAC) for eastern gemfish from 3000 tonnes in 1988 to zero in 1993 where it has remained. AFMA also restricted the fishing industry to low `trip limits determined by AFMA each year in consultation with scientists, industry and management. The best estimate of 1995 spawning biomass is between 30 and 35% of 1979 levels, noting that there is still considerable uncertainty surrounding these figures. A major scientific program is currently under way, including limited experimental fishing taking place during the 1996 season which is intended to provide a better estimate of current biomass and its relationship to the management target. Eastern gemfish has been nominated twice under the Commonwealth Endangered Species Protection Act 1992 (ESP Act). Nominations were considered by the Endangered Species Scientific Sub-committee (ESSS) of the Endangered Species Advisory Committee (ESAC). In both cases the Minister for the Environment did not find reason to list the species under the ESP Act.School and Gummy shark form the major catch of the Southern Shark Fishery. They are also taken in zone 2 of the Western Australian southern demersal gillnet and demersal long line fishery. Limitations are in place on the length and construction of gillnets, the number of hooks which can be used, the use of automatic baiting equipment and the size of fish taken. There are also some areas in State waters which have been designated nursery areas in which fishing is prohibited or strictly limited. Catches of gummy shark are considered to be sustainable at current levels. The most recent stock assessment advice for school shark is that recent catches have exceeded the maximum sustainable yield of the stock, and catches need to be reduced. AFMA, in consultation with the Southern Shark Fishery Management Advisory Committee (SharkMAC) is currently developing management arrangements to achieve the necessary reduction in catch. Neither School or Gummy shark are listed on any conservation list.With respect to dusky whaler I assume what is meant is actually dusky shark also known as bronze and black whaler and have answered the question accordingly. Both dusky whaler and sandbar shark have been proposed for listing in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Animals on the basis of the status of these species in the north-west Atlantic—their status in Australia was not considered. In respect of the dusky whaler shark and sandbar shark, both species form part of the catch in the Western Australian southern demersal gillnet and demersal long line fishery. Limitations are in place on the length and construction of gillnets, the number of hooks which can be used, the use of automatic baiting equipment and the size of fish taken. Catches of both species are considered to be sustainable at current levels. However, effort reductions of up to 50% are planned for the fishery in response to stock assessment advice for whiskery sharks.The orange roughy fishery was heavily fished during the late 1980s and early 1990s with a peak annual catch of about 40,000 tonnes. It is managed as three sub-fisheries as each is believed to contain a discrete fish stock. The main spawning stock off eastern Tasmania and the southern stock have been under TACs since 1990. A TAC was introduced to the western zone in 1992. Current estimates indicate that spawning biomass of the eastern and southern stocks are around 25 to 30 percent of 1988 levels depending on assumptions about stock structure and natural mortality rates. The status of the western orange roughy fishery is unknown. AFMA has set an objective of rebuilding the eastern/southern stocks to 30% of 1988 spawning biomass by 2004. This has required continued reductions in the southern zone TAC from 10,000 tonnes in 1993 to 3,000 tonnes in 1996. The TAC is expected to be reduced further to 1,500 tonnes by 1998. The eastern and western zone TACs are stable at 2,000 tonnes and 1,500 tonnes respectively. Research is continuing into better understanding the stock structure of orange roughy as this impacts on the achievement of management objectives for the fishery.(3) (4) & (5) Most of the products of school, gummy and other sharks are marketed domestically. School and gummy sharks are primarily retailed as `flake in Australia in the form of fillets or headed, gilled and gutted trunks. Australia is a net importer of shark meat for consumption principally in the Melbourne market. Australia does export a number of shark products principally fins, shark liver oil and shark cartilage although information on the quantity of these exports are not recorded. Information is not collected on exports of shark by species although total exports of shark for human consumption are recorded.N/AExport of shark for human consumptionYear Destination Total (kg) 1990 Japan 50 1991 Japan, Taiwan 274 461 1992 Singapore, Taiwan 3895 1993 Hong Kong, Singapore 1550 1994 Japan 5000 1995 New Zealand, Singapore 3007Source: Australian Bureau of StatisticsExports of orange roughy are not recorded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.

AFMA also wrote to the Executive Director of the Endangered Species Scientific Sub-committee informing him of the survey and that AFMA had written to the EPA seeking its endorsement. The EPA suggested to AFMA that it designate the survey proposal under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 (EPIP Act) as it was of the view that the proposed harvest from the research program, combined with the bycatch harvest, would amount to a significant portion of the existing stock. In the light of this advice, AFMA requested the CSIRO to undertake an analysis of the effects on the spawning stock of taking 300 tonnes, comprising 200 tonnes during the survey and 100 tonnes under bycatch trip limits, during 1996. The CSIRO analyses showed that the impact of the trawl survey on the eastern gemfish stock would be small. AFMA then wrote to the EPA and advised that in view of the CSIRO advice it had decided that it was not necessary to designate the proposal under the EPIP Act and that it would therefore be going ahead with the trawl survey. I understand that the trawl survey commenced on 17 June 1996 and is due to be completed prior to 8 August 1996.(7) There is no Australian Government proposal to list the Southern Bluefin Tuna on Appendix II of CITES at the next meeting of the parties in 1997. However, the Australian Nature Conservation Agency (ANCA) has commissioned a scientific assessment by CSIRO of the likelihood of Southern Bluefin Tuna meeting the criteria for listing on CITES. ANCA has indicated that this assessment is being undertaken to provide the agency with information needed for developing a whole of government approach in relation to CITES issues and Southern Bluefin Tuna. ANCA has indicated that any consideration of a possible listing of Southern Bluefin Tuna in the future will be carried in full consultation with relevant Government agencies, industry and other interest groups.N/A","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[21]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In addition, a voluntary undertaking by the Western Australian Government protects from timber harvesting, until 31 December 1996, all forest areas that are listed or interim listed in the Register of the National Estate.(2) The Western Australian Government has also given a voluntary undertaking to protect from timber harvesting certain National Estate forest areas where the DFA identified old growth forests requiring interim protection to meet Commonwealth reserve criteria benchmarks. Jane and Sharpe forest blocks, and part of Giblett forest block, will also be protected under this voluntary arrangement. Maps of these areas are available from the Western Australian Department of Conservation and Land Management (CALM). The interim protection of these areas remains in force until 31 December 1997, or until signature of a RFA, whichever is sooner.(3) Under the provisions of the Export Control Act 1982, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is the Minister responsible for woodchip export licence approvals.

A search of a large data base of published medical literature (Medline) indicates that no studies have been published on this issue in Australia over the last five years.(3) Hyperventilation is associated with increased respiratory drive, an increased minute volume of ventilation, muscle effort and there is a reduction in the content of arterial carbon dioxide. The latter is expressed as the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide and the normal range is 37 to 43 mmHg. Effects of decreased arterial carbon dioxide include disturbances in acid/base balance and reductions in levels of free calcium and phosphate in blood. These metabolic disturbances may lead to a well recognised array of symptoms. Such metabolic disturbances are reversible upon restoration to normal carbon dioxide content.(4) The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has advised that for the period 1990&hyphen;1994, there were no deaths in Australia resulting from hyperventilation syndrome or psychogenic/anxiety hyperventilation. Morbidity data show that during the financial years 1991&hyphen;1992 and 1992&hyphen;1993, there were 366 separations from all Australian public, DVA and private hospitals (excluding Victorian, ACT and NT private hospitals) which may have been associated with hyperventilation; ie 366 separations having a principal or secondary diagnosis recorded as: a respiratory physiological malfunction arising from mental factors, eg air hunger, cough, hiccough, yawning, or hyperventilation.(5) There are a number of disease states which can be associated with hyperventilation and the management is the treatment of the underlying condition.For those people who develop significant symptoms during an acute attack, inhalation of a low concentration of carbon dioxide can be very beneficial, for example, rebreathing through a paper bag.For those with disabling underlying psychogenic hyperventilation, careful assessment and therapy can be provided by a medical practitioner.N/A","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[25]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

274,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Senator Parer","KI4","QLD","LP","N/A",2731,"—The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senators question:(1) I am advised that a shipment of live cattle from Port Adelaide to Egypt on 27 May 1996 carried almost 10,500 head and this was the largest single shipment of cattle from Australia to that date in 1996.(2) Live cattle exports are arranged on commercial terms subject to market demand and the availability of suitable stock. This is a legitimate trade. The Government generally encourages increased exports of Australian products but has no specific responsibility for planning the level of live cattle exports.(3) Livestock exporters are licensed by the Australian Meat and Live&hyphen;stock Corporation (AMLC), under the Meat and Live&hyphen;stock Industry Act 1995. Licensed exporters seek approval from the AMLC for exports, and are subject to compliance with orders issued by the AMLC. Notification of intention to export is made to the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, which issues appropriate health certification and permits to export animals under the Export Control Act 1982.(4) (a) & (b) A Model Code of Practice for the Welfare of Animals: Sea Transport of Livestock, was endorsed by Commonwealth and State Ministers meeting in the Australian Agricultural Council in July 1988. The Code is a voluntary guide for people responsible for the welfare and husbandry of animals during sea transport.Marine Orders, Part 43, Cargo and Cargo Handling—Livestock, issued by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) pursuant to the Navigation Act 1912, provides the basis for ensuring vessels carrying livestock meet Australian requirements. The Orders include provisions relating to ship design, fodder and water supplies, fitness of livestock, the number that may be carried, the design and arrangement of pens and care of livestock on board. The Orders allow penal provisions to be applied by AMSA.Commonwealth Departments and Authorities maintain close links with representatives of the livestock export industry, individual exporters, the AMLC and significant animal welfare groups to ensure due consideration is given to welfare aspects of the live animal export trade.N/A","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[30]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

276,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Senator Herron","VW4","QLD","LP","N/A",2732,"—The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission has provided the following information in response to the honourable senators question:(1) The Strelley Nomads Task Force Review was undertaken from June&hyphen;September 1993 to investigate a number of matters relating to funds allocated by ATSIC to the Strelley Nomads organisation. The Task Force recommended that no further funding be made available to the Strelley Housing Society Incorporated and the Nomads Charitable and Education Foundation Incorporated until completion of an independent audit of the organisations.This independent audit investigation was undertaken by Duesburys Chartered Accountants and was completed in November 1995. A summary of the key findings of the investigation is attached for your information—see Attachment A.(2) Allegations that ATSIC funds had been syphoned into private companies by Nomads Charitable and Education Foundation were investigated within the context of the Duesburys independent financial investigation. This investigation looked at all funds granted by ATSIC to the Strelley Housing Society Incorporated (Strelley ) and the Nomads Charitable and Educational Foundation Incorporated (Nomads).Parts six and seven of the Terms of Reference for the investigation related to investigating the transfer of funds. A copy of the Terms of Reference is attached for your information—see Attachment B.(a) One of the areas of concern noted in the Duesburys report is the extent of transactions between Strelley Nomads and related parties. It would appear that the supporting documentation for these transactions was minimal, with no breakdowns of the amounts charged.(b) Duesburys advised in its investigation report that it did not have the right to access the financial records of the related entities to determine if the services provided were charged at realistic rates. However, the following instances were cited as examples of concerns about funds paid to related parties:1990/91 Health FundingAccounting and Audit FeesAmounts totalling $10,000 were paid to Nomads Management Pty Ltd during the year. The invoices from the related party did not detail the nature or extent of the services provided and did not detail the audit fees paid to the external auditor.Airfares and CharterAmounts totalling $55,000 were paid to Nomads (1966) Pty Ltd during the year. Nomads were unable to provide documentary evidence as to the nature and extent of the services provided by Nomads (1966) Pty Ltd.1991/92 Health FundingAirfares and CharterAmounts totalling $55,000 were paid to Nomads (1966) Pty Ltd during the year. Nomads were unable to provide documentary evidence as to the nature and extent of the services provided by Nomads (1966) Pty Ltd.Wages—Part&hyphen;time BookkeeperAmounts totalling $12,122 were paid to Nomads Management Pty Ltd during the year for the services of a part&hyphen;time bookkeeper. Duesburys was not able to ascertain which employees this charge related to and Nomads was unable to provide documentary evidence as to the nature and extent of the services provided by Nomads (1966) Pty Ltd.1992/93 Health FundingAccounting and Audit FeesAmounts totalling $9,000, equal to the budgeted amount, were paid to Nomads Management Pty Ltd during the year. Duesburys was not able to establish what services were provided or what component of this fee represented audit fees paid to external parties.Airfares and CharterFour quarterly charges of $12,669, totalling $50,676, equal to the budgeted amount, were paid to Nomads (1966) Pty Ltd during the year. Duesburys was not able to access any flight records or otherwise verify the number of flights for which the plane was used.1993/94 Health FundingAccounting and Audit Fees$1,500 was paid to Nomads Management Pty Ltd during the year. Duesburys was not able to establish what services were provided or what component of this fee represented audit fees paid to external parties.1990/91 Community Infrastructure FundingCapital—Warralong Airstrip$48,000 was paid to Nomads (1966) Pty Ltd as payment for completion of 80% of work on improvements to the Warralong Airstrip. Duesburys was not able to obtain any external documentation supporting this payment or details regarding dates on which work was completed or equipment used.Wages—Non&hyphen;AboriginalAmounts totalling $26,445 were charged to Nomads Management Pty Ltd during the year. Duesburys was not able to establish which individuals were employed or where these employees are located.1991/92 Community Infrastructure FundingWages—Non&hyphen;Aboriginal$25,886 was paid to Nomads Management Pty Ltd during the year. Duesburys was not able to establish which individuals were employed or where these employees were located.Accounting and Audit$8,000 was paid to Nomads Management Pty Ltd during the year. Duesburys was not able to establish what services were provided or what component of this fee represented audit fees paid to external parties.1992/93 Community Infrastructure FundingWages—Non&hyphen;Aboriginal$27,180 was paid to Nomads Management Pty Ltd during the year. Duesburys was not able to establish which individuals were employed or where these employees were located.Accounting and Audit$8,400 was paid to Nomads Management Pty Ltd during the year. Duesburys was not able to establish what services were provided or what component of this fee represented audit fees paid to external parties.(3) ATSIC is not aware of any Commonwealth funds being directed to the Strelley, Carlindie, Warralong, Woodstock or Lalla Rookh stations for pastoral activities. The only funding allocated by ATSIC has been to the Warralong community, which is situated on the Warralong pastoral lease. Funding to this community had been for Community Infrastructure and a Community Development Employment Project.(4) ATSIC has a policy to divest itself of all pastoral properties. Properties are instead vested in the appropriate Aboriginal Corporation. This process is almost completed and ATSIC now only owns four pastoral properties in Western Australia.(5) It is acknowledged that some pastoral stations do not have adequate facilities for all residents or may have been abandoned for short periods due largely to seasonal factors. However, the provision of Community Development Employment Projects (CDEP) funding to Aboriginal organisations is separate from any funding for pastoral operations being undertaken by these organisations. In terms of the CDEP ATSIC is only responsible for ensuring that CDEP work activities are being carried out in accordance with the work plan, that wages are paid to participants and that regular CDEP Reviews are carried out. Where an organisation has temporarily left a property, it is likely that CDEP activities are no longer being performed and the CDEP project would be suspended or ceased accordingly. ATSIC is not responsible for the monitoring of pastoral properties that are not in receipt of ATSIC funding—in fact ATSIC has no authority to become involved unless it is providing funding.(6) While ATSIC is not responsible for the monitoring of all pastoral properties, ATSICs Regional Offices routinely visit pastoral stations in Western Australia in receipt of ATSIC funds to ensure that the properties are being managed properly and are operating at a sustainable level. Regional Offices are also responsible for conducting regular visits of CDEP programs on these pastoral properties to check participant schedules and work performed.Furthermore, ATSICs Western Australian State Office conducts regular Reviews of those pastoral stations in receipt of ATSIC land management funding to ensure that funds are being expended in accordance with ATSICs requirements. Those organisations operating the stations are also required to adhere to ATSICs reporting requirements by providing audited financial statements.ATSIC recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Western Australian Department of Agriculture to monitor all pastoral properties in the Pilbara and Upper Gascoyne regions. This has involved the use of a pastoral adviser to monitor the operations of each property. In the Kimberley region, 18 pastoral properties are participants to the Kimberley Aboriginal Pastoralists Project (KAPP), which is aimed at developing all properties to their maximum potential. ATSIC fully supports this project and has provided funding to assist in its development.In addition, the leases on all pastoral properties are monitored by the Pastoral Board of Western Australia to ensure that lease conditions are being met. In the case of Strelley, it is understood that the Pastoral Board has been in contact with the Strelley Nomads organisation about the current condition of the organisations pastoral leases.(7) It is the responsibility of the Pastoral Board of Western Australia to ensure that organisations are operating their pastoral properties in accordance with the conditions of their pastoral lease. Should an organisations pastoral operations be in breach of its lease conditions, the Pastoral Board has the authority to withdraw the lease.ATSICs role in such matters is to ensure that ATSIC grant funds are being accounted for. ATSIC is only in a position to provide advice and assistance should pastoral activities not be operating at a sustainable level. This may include arranging for the appointment of a pastoral consultant or provid ing additional funding. Initiatives such as the MOU signed with the Department of Agriculture are intended to provide ongoing assistance that may not be possible due to ATSICs limited resources.(8)(a) The Strelley Task Force Review Report indicated that the Strelley station was abandoned in 1984 because of its proximity to the South and Port Hedland townships. However, it was not until 1991 that Strelley Nomads gave the State Energy Commission of Western Australia authorisation for all salvageable equipment at the station to be removed.However, considerable infrastructure still remains at the station. ATSICs predecessor, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, had recognised the need to identify and secure those Government funded assets provided for Aboriginal people associated with the Strelley Nomads organisation.The Duesburys investigation was able to identify all remaining assets in the possession of Strelley Nomads that were purchased with ATSIC funding. However, Duesburys did not inspect these assets and could not verify the locations of these assets as had been provided by Strelley Nomads.ATSIC is currently deciding on an appropriate course of action to recover the assets.(b) The Duesburys investigation was able to identify all remaining ATSIC grant surpluses held by the Strelley Nomads organisation. ATSIC has since commenced action to issue a Section 20 Notice to Strelley Nomads to recover these remaining surpluses.Because of remaining concerns about the syphoning of monies into private companies, and because the consultant engaged by ATSIC did not have the right to access the records of the related entities, ATSIC has decided to refer the matter to the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) for further investigation. The ASC is the appropriate statutory body to examine these issues.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[31]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
277,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Senator Hill","BH4","SA","LP","N/A",2734,"—On 27 June 1996 ( Hansard page 2385) Senator Robert Ray asked me as the Minister representing the Attorney&hyphen;General the following questions without notice:(1) Is it a fact that various state branches of the National Crime Authority (NCA) have been notified of budget cuts well in advance of the budget.N/A(2) Is it true that the proposed coalition cuts that appeared in your election manifesto have been doubled and that this will mean vastly reduced operations in both Western Australia and South Australia.(3) Can the minister guarantee that the NCA will remain an effective weapon against organised crime.(4) Can the minister assure the Senate that the cuts were not inspired by the malicious attack on the NCA by the Premier of Victoria, who subsequently had to apologise to the Supreme Court.The Attorney&hyphen;General has provided the following answers to the honourable senators questions:N/A(1) Yes. Proposals to make savings in the NCA budget were outlined in the Coalitions election statement `Meeting Our Commitments in February this year. These proposals are now firm requirements that the NCA take measures to reduce outlays in order to meet savings targets set by the Government.(2) The NCA determines what steps will be taken to achieve its savings targets. As you may be aware, the Chairperson of the NCA recently announced cuts in both corporate and operational areas of the NCA as part of its savings strategy. The decision by the Chairperson to make substantial cuts to the NCAs Perth and Adelaide offices was based on an assessment of the relative level and impact of organised criminal activity in those jurisdictions, compared with that in other States. Despite the cutbacks, the NCA is retaining a core team of staff in its Perth and Adelaide offices so that it maintains a presence in all of its existing locations across Australia.(3) I have previously recognised publicly that any savings by the NCA may result in a reduction in its criminal investigation capacity. Available resources have, however, been allocated to minimise the impact of the cuts on the NCAs core investigative functions.(4) As I have already stated, these cuts were foreshadowed in the coalitions election statement in February. The Government has set savings targets for all Government departments and agencies. The NCA is simply one of those Government agencies required to meet those targets.N/A","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qwn/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
