This section was added to in 1917, and provision was then made enabling soldiers of the Permanent Forces to  become officers in the non-combatant branches of those forces and also warrant and non-commissioned officers of the Permanent Forces to be appointed to commissioned rank for the position of quartermaster.

In addition there are 75 warrant officers who have been granted honorary commissioned rank. Before the limitations of this section came into force, soldiers of the Permanent Forces were eligible to compete for appointment to commissions in all branches of those forces, but after the establishment of the college it was essential, not only on account of the special training of the college, but also of the necessity for ensuring its success and the maintenance of the number of suitable applicants for entry, that appointments to commissioned rank in permanent forces, except those specially provided for, should be limited to graduates of the college.

The assessment for the financial year 1930-31 will be based upon the market selling value of land as at or about the 30th June, 1930, as disclosed by sales of the land or of comparable lands at or about that date. The HighCourt judgments require assessment values to be deduced from standards of values disclosed by actual sales of land as at or about 30th June. If, therefore, sales of land in any district which take place at or about the 30th June, 1930, show standards of value for that district which are different from the values upon which the assessments for the financial year 1929-30 have been based, the new standards of value will become applicable whether they be greater or less than the standards used in the earlier assessment.asked the Prime Minister,upon notice -What is the total sum paid to date to Burns.

The practice of withholding them for such a lengthy period is not in the best interests of this House. Since August last four new tariff schedules have been introduced, of which the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Fen ton) brought forward two, and the Acting Minister (Mr. Forde) one. Many honorable members, like myself, desire information concerning the reasons for tariff changes. They are anxious to devote such time as they can spare to the study of the boards reports, and the evidence adduced for or against proposed alterations of duty. On many other items the tariff has been amended considerably, and the House has not yet had an opportunity to discuss the alterations. The reports of the board regarding many of the items on which the duties have been altered have not been laid on the table. No doubt the Acting Minister (Mr. Forde) has considered those reports, and when legislative or administrative action has been decided upon such reports should be made available to members. Nevertheless, the policy of hushing up matters to which the honorable member for Adelaide (Mr. Yates) has objected, appears to continue. I strongly object to the House being kept waiting for reports that should have been tabled months ago.","N/A","TARIFF BOARD REPORTS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[37]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
186,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"LATHAM, John","KZO","Kooyong","N/A","N/A",24,".- At the end of the last sitting I asked that members should be provided as soon as possible with the Tariff Boards reports relating to the items dealt with in the schedules that had been laid before the House. Since that time, some twelve or fifteen reports have been received. The items are very numerous, and I ask the Acting Minister (Mr. Forde) when he expects to furnish members with the information that is essential if there is to be a proper discussion of the tariff proposals? Regarding what has been said by the honorable member for Richmond (Mr. R. Green), I suggest that it has n over been the practice of any Government to lay a report of the Tariff Board on the table, unless that Government proposed to ask the House to alter the tariff provisions with respect to the matter with which the report dealt. Unless action of that kind were proposed to be taken, it would often be unreasonable, injudicious and, indeed, unfair to the interests involved to reveal matters which, under the circumstances, were not of immediate public concern. It may be that there are exceptions to this rule, but, speaking generally, the reports should be tabled only when the Government proposes to take action upon them. We shall have another opportunity to discuss the action of the present Government in bringing down a large number of proposals without any prior reference to the Tariff Board; that, however, is distinct from the matter now before the House. I ask the Minister to inform honorable members when it is likely that they will receive the large number of Tariff Board reports Still outstanding, and when it is likely that the tariff will be discussed.. - I am surprised at honorable members taking exception to the action of the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Forde) in bringing these reports down. On the first day we meet after the recess he has tabled a whole set of reports, and has asked that they be printed. Some of them have been held back for years. The late Government prevented some from being tabled. No blame is attached to the Acting Minister in this matter; he is merely doing what is clearly his duty. His object is to enlighten the honorable member for Richmond (Mr. R. Green) and other honorable members.","Cornflour","TARIFF BOARD REPORTS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[37]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If he has not brought down all the reports in regard to items in connexion with which he has been responsible far tariff alterations, it is his duty to cio so. I hope, as I said some time ago, that we shall be supplied with all the reports of the Tariff Board in respect of the matters that have been dealt with by it. I disagree entirely with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Latham) that when the Government intends to take no action, the reports of the board should not be laid on the table. The Tariff Board was appointed, not by the Government, but by the Parliament, in the interests of the whole of the people. I think that the time will come, if there is any common-sense in the Tariff Board, and if we can get a chairman outside the Customs Department who will not be looking to the Minister for emoluments in the future, but who- will be wholly independent-","Cornflour","TARIFF BOARD REPORTS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[37]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

When the board makes a report for submission to Parliament it should be laid on the table irrespective of whether the Government intends to take action upon it. Honorable members want the information contained in those reports. The board may recommend a big reduction in duty of which the Government may not approve, and if it does the country is entitled to that information. I hope that, in his reply, the Acting Minister will inform us whether reports on items in regard to- which alterations in duty are proposed will be laid on the table before the duties are discussed.","Cornflour","TARIFF BOARD REPORTS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[37]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[4]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I ask the Minister to make known any facts of which he may be aware concerning it. I should like him to indicate, in his reply, whether reports will be available to the House with respect to every tariff alteration contained in the last two schedules submitted that have yet to be considered. Speaking subject to correction, I understand that the act under which the board was appointed makes it mandatory that the reports shall be presented to the House with respect to all tariff alterations. I should be glad to know whether it is proposed to supply members with reports by the board regarding the great number of important and substantial alterations that are proposed.","Cornflour","TARIFF BOARD REPORTS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[37]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[5]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The comments by honorable members opposite on the practice adopted by the present Government in this matter come with very little grace from them.","Cornflour","TARIFF BOARD REPORTS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[37]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
194,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"PAGE, Earle","C7E","Cowper","N/A","N/A",25,".- I rise to make it. clear that if a report of the Tariff Board recommending an increased duty were tabled before action was taken by the Government to impose the increase there would immediately be a tremendous importation of the article on which the Tariff Board recommended the increase, and, as a consequence, the protection, proposed to be afforded to Australian industry would be defeated, because the country would be flooded beforehand with goods of overseas manufacture and at the same time deprived of revenue. It was, therefore, the practice of the last Government -I trust it will be the practice of every government - to take into consideration Tariff Board reports, and not publish them until action was taken in the House itself. In the case of reports on which no action is contemplated the Minister for Trade and Customs has repeatedly, when requested to do so, given publicity to Tariff Board reports, but that has been done quite independently of the introduction of any tariff schedule. The records of this Parliament will show that when the late Mr. Pratten tabled his tariff he, on the same clay, presented a certain number of Tariff Board reports, and on succeeding days produced further reports to enable honorable members to be fully seised of their contents before action was taken by Parliament. Honorable members will recollect that before the 1925 schedule was fully discussed by Parliament, an election intervened. On that occasion, I venture to say, honorable members had all the tariff reports dealing with the items covered by the schedule. For the protection of the public revenue and the industries of Australia I trust that the past, practice will be continued, and I urge that when a tariff schedule is tabled the greatest expedition should be used to bring before members of Parliament and the public generally the Tariff Board reports, which will enable the various items in the schedule to be discussed properly.","Cornflour","TARIFF BOARD REPORTS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[37]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Chairman of the Tariff Board is one of the principal officers in the Trade and Customs Department - there is only one officer senior to him - and he has invariably carried out his duties in a most impartial and able manner.

197,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,"FORDE, Francis Michael","F4U","N/A","N/A","N/A",26,"- In what he does he is absolutely independent. There are some people in the community, I remind the honorable member, who are ready to give a decision irrespective of possible financial consequences to themselves, and he would be a poor Minister who would victimize an official for an honest decision. The Tariff Board submits its reports to the Minister for Trade and Customs and not to Parliament. In most instances the delay that has occurred in tabling Tariff Board reports has been justified. These reports are frequently favorable to requests for increases in duties, and if they were tabled astute importers would immediately proceed to import large quantities of goods and thus defeat the operation of the tariff schedule which they would have reason to assume would subsequently be laid on the table of Parliament to afford the protection recommended by the Tariff Board. Some of the reports I present to-day are certainly dated 192S, but they were withheld by the Minister for Trade and Customs in the last Government because that Government had not taken action upon them. Had they been laid on the table of this House, no doubt information would have been made available to people who would have imported quantities of goods because of the favorable recommendations of the board. The present Government has been in office for about five months and already has circulated fifteen Tariff Board reports, while 25 additional reports are in course of being printed. There will be no delay in having these reports printed and circulated in order to enable honorable members to have the advantage of the knowledge gained by the TariffBoard after its careful investigations. J cannot definitely say when an opportunity will be afforded to discuss the tariff itself ; but when that discussion does take place, honorable members will certainly have every chance to give expression to their views.Question resolved in the affirmative.","Cornflour","TARIFF BOARD REPORTS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[37]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[8]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
198,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"SCULLIN, James Henry","F4Q","Yarra","ALP","Prime Minister",26,". - The statement which I am about to read I shall present as a paper, and to enable it to be discussed I shall conclude by moving that it be printed.In placing before honorable members an outline of the legislative programme which they will be asked to consider in the next few months, it is desirable to dwell for a moment on the difficult financial and economic position confronting the Commonwealth at the present time.Fundamentally, we are suffering from the effects of world wide depression, accentuated by over-borrowing.Though the value and volume of our exports have declined, imports have continued to enter the Commonwealth on a large scale. As a consequence, the demands made by importers and others on London funds now exceed the supply, notwithstanding that £17,000,000 in gold has been shipped to London since July last. In addition to payment for imports, we have, of course, to meet a heavy annual interest bill on money borrowed abroad.For the six-years period ended 30th June, 1929, imports exceeded exports by £42,000,000. In the same period we had to pay overseas for interest and services, £193,000,000. Thus the net total of our overseas obligations was £235,000,000. In the same period our overseas debt- increased by £153,000,000. We also received in London during this six-years period the sum of £9,000,000 in respect of Bawra dividends. This gives a total of £162,000,000 received in London towards meeting overseas payments. As the overseas payments for the six-years period amounted to £235,000,000, as already shown, there was an adverse balance in that period amounting to £73,000,000. Fortunately, at the beginning of the six-years period Australia had a large accumulation of funds in London. There are, of course, certain invisible imports and exports, the effect of which the Commonwealth Statistician is unable to calculate. The results quoted, however, illustrate the position as far as it is possible to do so.The position is somewhat worse if regard is paid also to the trade figures for the six months ended 31st December last. In that period there was an excess of imports over exports, including bullion and specie, of £16,000,000, and payments for interest and services overseas, amounted to about £17,000,000. Thus we required for that six-months period a net total of £33,000,000 to pay for excess imports, interest and services. Against this sum may be set the sum of £10,000,000 borrowed by means of treasury-bills in the overseas market.The position demands that we should take the most stringent measures to rectify the trade balance. Thus, our immediate problem is to bring about a decrease of imports and an increase in the volume of exportable products, for which a demand exists. That is a task to which we must devote the most earnest attention.Development of primary industries for the production of exportable wealth and the extension of Australian manufacturing will help to balance our external trade and enable us to employ our people, and eventually to maintain a larger population. lt would be a policy of despair to declare that costs of production and development are too high to permit of the expansion of  our industries. Such a policy would imply that all development and expansion must cease. We must face the position frankly. Suggestions that wage reductions are essential to bring about increased production cannot be allowed to pass unchallenged. Employment is the barometer of prosperity, and production would be much increased if those who are now unemployed could be placed in useful work.The Government has devoted much attention to the necessity for stimulating the export of primary products. Important discussions have taken place with representatives of the wool industry, and we are watching with interest the policy now being put into effect, which, it is hoped, will stabilize prices. In the belief that wheat-growing, of all primary industries, is the one that will most readily respond to proposals for expansion, the Government last month invited Ministers of Agriculture of the various States and representatives of the wheat-growing industry to a conference at Canberra to discuss plans formulated by the Government for the establishment of a Commonwealth compulsory wheat pool. The principle of a compulsory pool was adopted by that conference. An Australian-wide wheat-marketing scheme, controlled by a pool board in each State, elected by the wheat-growers, and by a Commonwealth pool board on which each State board will be represented, is the essence of the proposals. A ballot of all wheat-growers is to be taken before 31st July next, to authorize the constitution of these boards. TheCommonwealth Government has invited the State Governments to join with it in guaranteeing the growers for the first year 4s. per bushel, payable at country sidings, which would mean the equivalent of approximately 4s. Sd. per bushel f.o.b. Honorable members will be asked to consider the legislation that is necessary to give authority so far as the Commonwealth Parliament is concerned, to these proposals.Encouragement will be given to the wine industry by increasing the export bounty from ls. to ls. 6d. a gallon. A bill to amend the Wine Bounty Act will bc submitted.The Government has given the closest attention to the loan position in Australia. In December last, a loan of £10,000,000 was raised in Australia on behalf of the Commonwealth and the States. To this loan the public subscribed £7.790,000, the balance being taken up by the underwriting banks.Last month, a further loan was issued to provide for the conversion and redemption of £10,400,000 of Commonwealth securities maturing in Australia on the 15th March. At the same time, holders of Commonwealth securities maturing on the 15th December next, were given the right to convert into the now loan. The March conversion and redemption loan has been over-subscribed, and the excess will be used to meet portion of the loan maturing on 15th December.With regard to the December loan of £60,000,000; the conversion of £21,000,000 has already been arranged for and applications are still coming in satisfactorily.These results are gratifying and illustrate Australias capacity to arrange her own conversion operations locally without recourse to the overseas markets.Four meetings of the Australian Loan Council have been held since the Government assumed office. At these meetings, the questions of loans to cover arrears of borrowing and present requirements, as well as questions relating to future borrowing, were discussed. The financial position made it necessary for the Loan Council to consider further reductions in loan expenditure during the present financial year, and to provide for substantial reductions in the programmes of borrow-, ing for the Commonwealth and the States for the coming financial year.During . the first six months of the financial year - that is, until 31st December last - customs revenue exceeded the estimate by £1,277,000, but for January, it was £398,000 below the estimate, and for February, £608,000 below the estimate.As tariff increases and exchange difficulties must result in diminishing imports, there is every likelihood that customs revenue will continue to fall during the balance of the financial year.Expenditure in all departments has been carefully investigated and reductions have been, and are being, secured by eliminating wasteful payments. The whole administration of the Department of Defence is now being reviewed with the object of effecting economies consistent with efficiency. Proposals for the amalgamation of the Royal Naval College and the Royal Military College in a joint establishment at Jervis Bay are being inquired into. It is felt that a saving in the very high cost of training naval and military officers can be made.Maintenance of the Royal Naval College last year cost £64,750. As there were 52 cadets at the college, the cost worked out at nearly £1,250 per head per annum.The staff employed for the maintenance of the college was 147, or nearly three persons for every cadet. Similarly, with regard to the Royal Military College, the maintenance cost was £52,750 for 74 cadets, or more than £700 per head per annum. A staff of 98 persons was employed for the 74 cadets.Further economies will be effected by the proposed re-organization of the work of the Development and Migration Commission. A bill to amend the Development and Migration Commission Act will be introduced. Developmental activities will be placed under the control of the Prime Ministers Department, and migration will be controlled by the Department of Markets and Transport. Co-ordination will be achieved between the work of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, and of the development section, by means of n consultative committee. This committee will deal with all schemes under the £34,000,000 Agreement, and will advise the Minister before preliminary work is started. It will also deal with matters of development referred to it by the States.The Commonwealth has had to bear the heavy cost, of a supervisory organization designed to deal with a substantial stream of assisted migrants. On that heavy overhead charge, and on the contributions of passage money to migrants, a considerable reduction has been made.As a direct result of the arrangements now operative, it is expected that a saving of £41,000 will be effected during the current financial year, and that for the year 1930-31 there will be a direct saving to the people of £124,000. Uniformity of control will mean a saving in the London organization alone of about £19,000 per annum.By arrangement with the British Government, assisted migration will be confined for the present to boys and domestics, and to nominations involving the re-union of families. The whole position was discussed fully with the Premiers of the States at the conference at Canberra last month, when it was agreed that in future all requisitions and nominations should be forwarded direct to the Commonwealth. Hitherto, the practice followed by the States has been to forward nominations direct to London. The Government considers that as it is called upon to bear a large proportion of the cost, by way of passage money, loans to migrants, and administrative expenses, it should exercise strict supervision and careful reconsideration of nominations as well as requisitions.With regard to non-British migration, steps have been taken to limit newcomers of nationalities already subject to quota restrictions to numbers representing a reduction of approximately 50 per cent, for this year as compared with last year. The permission granted in these cases will be confined, with very few exceptions, to the closest relatives of persons already settled in Australia.The need for an amendment of the Constitution designed to give greater legislative power to the Commonwealth Parliament has long been recognized. The dispute in the coal-mining industry and the recent decisions of the High Court have emphasized the need. One of the earliest measures to be placed before honorable members will provide for the holding of a referendum, at which proposals for the alteration of the Constitution, along the lines desired, will be submitted to the people.Industrial legislation has received the close attention of the Government.Under the enlarged constitutional powers to be sought, we intend to bring down, later in the life of the Parliament, a measure providing for the reconstruction of the laws affecting conciliation and arbitration, together with a comprehensive scheme of social insurance, including unemployment, covering Commonwealth, State, municipal and private employers and their employees. There will also be a complete re-organization of labour bureaus throughout Australia. In the meantime, bills will be introduced this session relating to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, the Arbitration (Public Service) Act, the Transport Workers Act, and the Crimes Act.Among other matters to be submitted for approval will be measures relating to the Seat of Government, the Commonwealth Bank, the Commonwealth Public Service, superannuation, Commonwealth employees compensation, a cotton bounty, a shale oil bounty, the Federal Aid Roads Agreement and wireless telegraphy. There will also be bills amending the Navigation Act, the Copyright Act, the Patents Act, The Income Tax Rates and Assessment Acts, the Land Tax Assessment Act, and honorable members will be asked to consider an amendment to the Industries Preservation Act to permit of contracts being entered into with regard to shipping freights.It will also be necessary to consider the tariff schedules tabled towards the close of last year. There is no doubt that the action of the Government in tabling tariff schedules embracing more than 300 items arrested, to a considerable degree, the growth of unemployment. After the tariff was introduced, numerous notices of dismissal were withdrawn, and the increased protection provided has given substantial additional employment.Honorable members will be asked to agree to resolutions for the ratification of the declaration by the Commonwealth accepting the optional clause of the statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice, and of the protocols recently adopted in connexion with the revision of the statute of the court and the accession of the United States of America thereto. There will also be opportunities for discussion of the report of the conference on the operation of dominion legislation and merchant shipping legislation, and of the report of the Australian delegation to the Tenth Assembly of the League of Nations.The difficulties confronting Australia are serious, and a proper realization of them should result in whole-hearted cooperation of all sections in the working out of a satisfactory solution. Indeed, at the present juncture, the Parliament might fittingly become an economic conference of representatives of the people meeting to discuss the general position. I move -That the paper be printed.Debate (on motion by Mr. Latham) adjourned.That the Schedule to the Customs Tariff 1921-1928 be amended as hereunder set out, and that on and after the twenty -second day of November, One thousand nine hundred and twenty-nine, at nine oclock in the forenoon, reckoned according to standard time in the Territory for the Seat of Government, Duties of Customs be collected in pursuance of the Customs Tariff as so amended.That, excepting by mutual agreement or until after six months notice has been given to the Government of the Dominion of New Zealand, nothing in this Resolution shall affect any goods the produce or manufacture of the Dominion of New Zealand entering the Commonwealth of Australia from the Dominion of New Zealand.That the Standing Orders be suspended to enable the remaining stages to be passed without delay.","Government Programme","MINISTERIAL STATEMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[38]/subdebate.1/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I have no recollection of similar action having been taken, and the Acting Minister should give the House some information concerning the Governments proposals before proceeding further.

The bill is introduced for the purpose of confirming a practice of the Trade and Customs Department which has been in operation since the introduction of the first federal customs tariff, and which has now, after 28 years acquiescence, been challenged by interested parties. The facts are briefly these: Tongued and grooved flooring and lining boards and weatherboards have always been classified by the department as  Timber, dressed, n.e.i., under item 291 (i.) of the tariff. The general tariff rate on this timber up to November, 1927, was 8s. fid. per 100 super, feet. In that month the rate was increased to 15s., while in the tariff proposals of the 22nd November, .1929, it was further increased to 20s. The classification of this material has, at this late stage, been challenged by timber importers in several States, who have signified their intention of taking legal proceedings with the object of having the timber in question classified under item 291 (k), which reads -Timber, bent or cut into shape, dressed or partly dressed, n.e.i ad valorem - 30 ner cent. British preferential tariff; 30 per cent, general tariff.","Second Reading","CUSTOMS TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[39]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

A 30 per cent, ad valorem rate would have been less than the fixed rate of 8s. 6d. per 100 super, feet which was in operation prior to November, 1927, and it is a fact worthy of remark that when the rate on dressed timber was raised from 8s. 6d. to 15s. in November, .1927, the classification of flooring boards under that item was not challenged by the timber importers, although the amount of duty under the 15s. rate was, in effect, more than double the rate, that is, 30 per cent, ad valorem, chargeable under the item under which the importers now claim that this timber is properly classifiable. There is a large amount of money involved in this dispute.","Second Reading","CUSTOMS TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[39]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[1]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

209,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,"FORDE, Francis Michael","F4U","N/A","N/A","N/A",32,"- That will largely depend upon the result of litigation. If the importing companies win it might amount to well over £1,000,000, at a time when, the public exchequer cannot stand such a loss. At all events, there is a large amount of money involved, and in respect of the threatened law proceedings, it was discovered that none of the persons engaged in the timber importing trade was prepared to give evidence in support of the departmental classification of the timber. Naturally, they had discussed the matter, but they were not prepared to assist the department in upholding a classification that had been accepted by them for 28 years. The whole business savours of a combined effort to defeat the legitimate departmental classification, and the present action is necessary in order to checkmate any such attempt. I desire to emphasize the fact that the department maintains that its classification of the timber as dressed timber, n.e.i., item 291 (l) is, and has always been correct. But in view of the situation in which the department has been placed by the action of the timber importing trade, it is considered necessary to make the present amendment in order that the revenue of the Commonwealth may be adequately safeguarded. It will be noted that the amendment of the item is to date from the 22nd November, 1929, the date of the introduction of the tariff proposal affecting this item. This is necessary in order that the Government may be safeguarded in respect of all importations since the imposition of the increased rate.","Second Reading","CUSTOMS TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[39]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[1]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The honorable member for Warringah (Mr. Archdale Parkhill)  asked what amount of money was involved. I would inform him that the amount of refund claimed in New South Wales, principally on February importations, is, to date, £23,000. In Victoria the amount involved since 23rd November, 1929, is estimated at £29,000, and in other States £10,000, making a total of approximately £62,000. Those figures refer to timber imported since the 22nd November, 1929, only. On the actual import figures, comprising about 60,000,000 super, feet, the estimated difference between the duty at 20s. per 100 super, feet and 30 per cent, ad valorem, would be £400,000 per annum. At the rate on dressed timber which was in force between November, 1927, and November, 1929, namely, 15s. per 100 super, feet, the difference would be about £250,000 per annum. Honorable members can readily understand that a large sum is at stake.

The duty on spirits used in the fortification of wine is being increased by 5s. per proof gallon. The Government will bring down a bill within the next few days to provide for a bounty of ls. 6d. on each gallon of fortified wine exported. This will increase the present rate of bounty by 6d. per gallon. Provision has been made to pay the increased bounty almost immediately, and for it to continue for a period of five years. The estimated additional revenue from the increased duty will provide sufficient funds to pay(21the whole of the bounty on fortified wines exported. During the last, five years the average quantity of spirits used for fortifying wines for consumption in the Commonwealth has been S30,742 gallons. At the present rate of duty that represents a sum of £235,376. At the proposed increased rate it would provide £443,061, a difference of £207,685, which i3 sufficient, to provide a bounty at the rate of ls. 6d. per gallon on 2,750,000 gallons of wine. Our present exportation of wine amounts to about 2,000,000 gallons per annum. The bill, when introduced, will convince honorable members that the Government^ proposal will be of great assistance to an important Australian industry. The drawback paid on fortified wine exported will be adjusted in accordance with the new rates of excise duty on fortifying spirit.Progress reported.","In Committee of Ways and Means:","EXCISE TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[40]/subdebate.1/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

219,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FORDE, Francis Michael","F4U","Capricornia","ALP","Acting Minister for Trade and Customs",34,". - by leave- I move -That the bill be now read a second time.This bill is introduced as the result of a recent Supreme Court action in New South Wales, which disclosed a weakness in the law governing refunds of customs duties. Section 163 of the Customs Act which deals with refunds, reads -Whenever goods -Have received damage or have been pillaged during the voyage; orHave, while under Customs control, been damaged, pillaged, lost or destroyed ; orWhenever duty has been paid through manifest error of fact or patent misconception of the law, a refund, rebate or remission of the duty, as the case may require, shall be made in manner prescribed.The manner of making refunds is set out in Regulation No. 126, which reads -Claims for refund, rebate, or remission of duty shall be made in accordance with Form 47 or 48, as the case requires, to the collector at the port where the duty has been paid, or is payable.Claims shall be made not later than three days after the goods have passed from the control of the Customs, or the duty has been paid, or within such further time as the Comptroller, in writing, allows, and unless so made as aforesaid no claim shall be received or allowed. Provided that, when it is clear on the face of the invoice and entry that duty has been overpaid, a refund of the duty overpaid may be allowed although the claim for refund has not been made within the prescribed time.In a case recently before the Supreme Court of New South Wales, in which an importer claimed refunds of duty paid on importations dating back about two years, the court decided that section 2 of the regulation was ultra vires in that the act gave no power to prescribe a time within which refund claims may be lodged. The present proposal is to make the section intra vires. It has always been the practice of the Customs Department to place a time limit within which refund claims may be made; the necessary provision has been embodied in the Customs Regulations since they were first framed - in 1902. The courts decision, therefore, came as a surprise. In delivering his judgment in respect of regulation 126 (2), in the case mentioned, the Chief Justice of New South Wales said -It is not a regulation giving effect to the rights conferred by section 163. It is a regulation restricting the time within which those rights may be asserted. No such limitation of time is imposed by the act, and the effect of the imposition of such a restriction by regulation is to make an addition to the law. This is outside the rule-making power. From the stand-point of administration it is, I have no doubt, looked upon as necessary, or, at all events, convenient, that some limit of time should be imposed; but if the act does not impose any restriction as to time, this cannot be done by regulation under the guise of giving effect to the provisions of the act.The regulation, which appears perfectly reasonable, has been in operation for about 28 years. The Department sees that there are no cases of hardship. In the absence of a time limit there would be nothing to prevent importers from claiming refunds of duty paid on goods imported and sold years previously ; goods on which the consumers had already paid the duty. The department, especially in instances in which claims are made in respect of goods pillaged or damaged, must be placed in a position to exercise a satisfactory check upon claims for refund. Clause 2 amends section 162 of the principal act by adding the following proviso: -Provided that no refund, rebate, or remission of duty shall be made unless application therefor is made within such time as is prescribed.The prescribed time has not yet been reconsidered but it will probably be three days, as in the existing regulation. There is, however, nothing to prevent the Minister from altering this time limit at any time by amending the regulation. It will be noticed that a time limit will not be imposed where it is not necessary, and that provision is made for cases in which its imposition would involve hardship. I desire to make it clear that the passing of this bill will not prevent Messrs Berk Ltd. from having their case fully considered on its merits, irrespective of the time limit; the decision of the court in their case will be honoured. But a time limit is necessary for the effective administration of the law relating to refunds of duty, and for that reason I commend the bill to the House.Debate (on motion by Mr. Gullett) adjourned.","N/A","CUSTOMS BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[41]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It provides for more direct ministerial responsibility in the control of the Territory, and will tend to a more economic and an improved system of administration. It was not possible to introduce it earlier, owing to the short period during which Parliament sat before Christmas.I shall not detail minutely the history of the control of the Federal Capital Territory; but shall content myself with dealing briefly with a few aspects of it. From 1909 to 1912 the Territory was governed by the Department of Home Affairs, and the work which was carried out during that period was controlled by the Works Department. This arrangement was the subject of a good deal of criticism at the time, on the score of the overlapping of authority, and also because it was held that the ministerial authority in Melbourne was too far removed from the scene of operations. Therefore, in 1912 a resident administrator was appointed. In 1916 the Home AffairsDepartment disappeared, and the Home and Territories Department was created to take its place, while the works which were carried out were under the control of the Department of Works and Railways. Notwithstanding certain criticism, this arrangement proved fairly satisfactory until 1924. The fortunes of the Capital ebbed and flowed, and during the war years and immediately afterwards developmental work practically ceased. In 1924, however, it was felt that determined efforts should be made to establish the seat of government in the place chosen as the site of the national city. The government of the day, therefore, introduced a bill which provided for the establishment of a commission of three members to direct the erection of the city and administer its concerns. During the consideration of that . bill in Melbourne the measure was strongly criticized by the party then in Opposition, which is now supporting the Government. It was claimed by its members that the commission system of control was doomed to failure. I do not desire to revive controversy on the subject, but I assert that time has shown that, although under the commission system much valuable work was done, under conditions of extraordinary difficulty, and when the cost of labour and materials was at its peak, eventually, as questions of administration came to dominate engineering and constructional questions, the system practically broke down; certainly it completely failed to obtain the approval of the citizens who were compelled to live under it.","Second Reading","SEAT OF GOVERNMENT (ADMINISTRATION) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[42]/subdebate.1/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

225,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,"BLAKELEY, Arthur","JPV","N/A","N/A","N/A",35,"- I am almost certain of it. The original commissioners were instructed to proceed with the erection of this Parliament House, and to provide accommodation for parliamentary officials and departmental secretariats. Later they were instructed to provide office accommodation and housing for certain specified departments, and to have it ready by the 9th May, the twenty-sixth anniversary of the opening of the first Commonwealth Parliament. Those instructions were complied with, and everything was ready by the appointed date. The constructional stage of the citys development .was then practically finished, and the real test of the commission system of civic government began, with the results I have indicated.I freely admit that the work of the Commission was considerably hampered by the fact that the leasehold system of land tenure operated in the Territory. Had there been freehold tenure the path of the Commission would have been smoother, because private enterprise would have assisted to a greater extent. But no disposition was shown to advance money for the provision of homes at Canberra, because its citizens were unable to secure a freehold title to the land on which they might wish to build. Thus the whole provision of residential accommodation, or practically all, had to bo undertaken by the Commission itself. The dissatisfaction of the citizens of Canberra became very evident, and the government of the day made an endeavour to meet their wish for some measure of control of the affairs of their city. It was inevitable, perhaps, that those who had been compulsorily removed from their social environment in a big city like Melbourne, should feel some dissatisfaction with their change of situation, and they were thrown together in such a way that they did not lack opportunity of exchanging views and voicing their complaints. In the circumstances, complaints were, to be expected and the expectation was fully realized. An act was passed which permitted the citizens of Canberra to elect a representative to the Commission. The first Commissioner so elected did not enjoy a happy term of office, aud after a time he resigned. A second Commissioner was elected, and he, too, subsequently tendered his resignation; but withdrew it pending the formulation of this Governments policy for the civic administration of Canberra. But though he is still the third Commissioner, it is evident that he is not at all happy in his position. The members of the last Government anticipated that they would soon have to take some step towards the substitution of another form of control for the Commission system, and the last Prime Minister, Mr. Bruce, stated in this chamber that his Government would, within twelve months, probably be in a position to formulate more permanent proposals for the Government of the Federal Capital Territory, and that Government refused to sanction the continuance of the Commission for a longer period. About that time the Chief Commissioner resigned and the second Commissioner, whose services had been loaned to the Commonwealth by the Malvern City Council, expressed his desire to return to his work in Melbourne. The two positions thus rendered vacant were filled by the appointment of two public servants, and the Commission continued to function.There is no doubt that since Parliament first met in Canberra, there has been a growing resentment among members of both houses against the Commission system of control. When Sir Neville Howse, as the Minister in charge of the Territory, introduced the bill providing for local representation, he made the following reply to the criticism with which he had been mct -It appears quite clear that honorable members generally are not anxious to accept the bill and its amendments, except as a temporary measure. I therefore propose to move, when the bill is in committee, to provide that the second and third Commissioners shall be appointed for only one year. This will enable Parliament to review the whole subject during the coming year.I am of opinion that the commission system of government must fail, in Canberra or in any other place. When the representatives of the people, the appointed guardians of the public purse, part with their control and allow a government to shed its responsibility by establishing commission control, such a system cannot do other than fail. Any system which permits the usurping of the responsibilities of Parliament cannot retain the approbation of its members.","Second Reading","SEAT OF GOVERNMENT (ADMINISTRATION) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[42]/subdebate.1/speech/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Sir John Sulman went to Washington to make a close study of the operation of the commission system of government there, and on his return to Australia he furnished on the 25th November, 1924, an official report on the subject, wherein he stated -In order to obtain the citizens view on thu commission system of government in Washington.. I interviewed Mr. Seymour, secretary of the Chamber of Commerce. He considers that, on the whole, the commission system of government fur a city like Washington is desirable, especially in view of the considerable coloured population who would have votes if. the city were governed by an elected council of the ordinary type. There was, however, a considerable m mount of dissatisfaction amongst the citizens at being wholly disfranchised.Later Sir John Sulman said -I have already pointed out the difficulties of Washington, which would have become more acute ere now but for the fear of the negro vote and if.? manipulation by unscrupulous wire-puller:-. With us this difficulty does not existI believe that it would be wrong to continue in Canberra the system of commission control that obtains in Washington, and 1. am firmly of the opinion that, were it not for the serious problem created by the existence of a large negroid population in Washington, the people of th tit city, and of America generally, would have demanded some form of representative government for that capital. This Government is of opinion thai, on financial grounds, there 13 justification for ending the commission system in Canberra. I do not desire now to criticize the financial administration of the Federal Capital Commission; but L believe that the commission system is extravagant, and that the Federal Capital Commission has taken upon itself responsibilities which should have fallen upon the Commonwealth Parliament. Certainly there was a squandering of money which Australia could ill alford to spend. The total cash expenditure on the Federal Capital Territory from 1901 to 30th June, 1929. was £10,677,094. The amount which was expended by the Commission from the 1st January, 1925, to the 30th June, 1929, was £7.314,366. For financial and other reasons there has been a gradual diminution of expenditure by the Commission, as will be apparent from the following table. The Federal Capital Commission has expended -N/AFor the current financial year, 1929-30, the sum of £450,000 only has been made available from loan, to which must be added revenue amounting to £225,000. It is estimated that at least £80,000 of that amount will be saved. On administration alone savings to the extent of £30,000 per annum have been effected, and these are of a permanent character. The Government, therefore, considers that there is no justification for continuing the costly and unwieldy machinery that was created at a time when the financial position of the Commonwealth was vastly different from what it is now. It therefore proposes, by the bill now before the House, to abolish the Federal Capital Commission, and to divide the present functions of the Commission among the departments. There will be a Federal Capital Council.","Second Reading","SEAT OF GOVERNMENT (ADMINISTRATION) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[42]/subdebate.1/speech/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

All these ordinances will be subject to the conditions that apply to ordinances generally. They will be laid on the table of both Houses, and may be objected to within 30 days by any honorable member who has any fault to find with them. The Government does not consider that the National Parliament should be asked continually to use its legislative machinery to effect small amendments to the municipal system to be set up in Canberra. The council will make recommendations to the Minister, who will submit them for the approval of the Governor in Council. The advisory council will consist of a chairman, who will be the civic administrator. . His salary will be fixed later, and his term of appointment will be for twelve months. The reason why that term is fixed is that the Government hopes that, at the expiration of that period, it may be possible to give the citizens of Canberra a greater degree of self-government.","Second Reading","SEAT OF GOVERNMENT (ADMINISTRATION) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[42]/subdebate.1/speech/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Its establishment is Australias contribution to the world of scientific attainment. We hope that in it will be carried out work of great value to the people of Australia, particularly in connexion with weather reports and cognate subjects. Valuable gift telescopes have been presented to the observatory by Mr. James Oddie, of Ballarat, Mr. J. H. Reynolds, of Birmingham, and the trustees of the estate of the late Lord Farnham.
