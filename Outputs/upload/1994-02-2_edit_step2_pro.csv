The petitioners note particularly that this reduction in petrol quality:1. Jeopardises the use of vehicles made prior to 1986 for operation on high octane petrol and could lead to many of those vehicles suffering serious engine damage;2. Will result in worse vehicle operation, higher emissions and greater fuel consumption for up to three million vehicles;3. Will have negligible benefit to the community, through reduced lead emissions, because the oil industry proposes to leave lead levels in petrol unchanged in Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia, and because the use of leaded petrol already is rapidly decreasing;4. Will disadvantage vehicle enthusiasts and low income members of the community.And your petitioners therefore urge the Senate to take action to ensure the continued availability of high octane petrol for Australian motorists.To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia opposes the increase in excise of 7 cents per litre on leaded petrol and 5 cents per litre on unleaded petrol resulting from the Budget. This rise in petrol tax:1.discriminates against low income families and those living in rural areas2.increases business costs and will cause further unemployment3.adds further to the price of an already heavily taxed product4.breaks Mr Keatings election promise not to put up tax.And your petitioners therefore pray that the Senate oppose these increases in petrol excise.To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showethThat the majority of Australians clearly stand united in satisfaction with their existing Australian National Flag which reflects their values, history and heritage,and that they condemn unwarranted attacks on their historic Australian Flag, whenever or wherever made by any Australian citizens.So therefore do we call upon the Senate to ensure that the Australian National Flag, as publicly acclaimed in 1901 and confirmed under the Flags Act (1953), is not changed, replaced or diminished at any time, or in any manner whatsoever, without such a proposal being first voted upon and approved by a majority of Australian citizens in a national referendum.And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/petition.grp/proctext/interject/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

56,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator FAULKNER","5K4","(New South Wales-","ALP","Minister for Veterans Affairs and Minister for Defence Science and Personnel)",168,"—I move:That this bill be now read a second time.I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard .Leave granted.The speech read as follows —This bill demonstrates the Governments commitment to promoting and developing Australias reputation as an attractive and reliable place to invest.That reputation suffered a severe setback in late 1980s when too many people lost money in circumstances that could have been avoided by timely and adequate disclosure of relevant information to investors.The Government has worked hard to restore that reputation. The establishment on January 1, 1991, of the national scheme, based on the Corporations Law and administered by the Australian Securities Commission, was an enormous achievement. The co-operation between the Commonwealth, the states and the territories behind that historic agreement was founded on a common desire to repair the damage of that period and raise a new regulatory umbrella, tailored to the real needs of investors in the internationalised, competitive Australian market of the 1990s and beyond.Other notable reforms have included changes to the accounting requirements, strengthening the law on insider trading, and improving the procedures for the settlement of Stock Exchange transactions. More recently, extensive reforms have been made to the corporate insolvency provisions and to the law on loans to directors and related companies. These reforms have contributed to the improved legal framework we now have. However, in my view the most significant change has been the establishment of a single well-resourced regulator—the ASC—which can take prompt and strong action to counter corporate wrongdoing.With equities again enjoying strong growth and attracting many investors into the market for the first time, this bill is an important and timely advance in ensuring a well-informed market. It makes major changes to the Corporations Law designed to enhance disclosure of relevant information for investors. For entities which are listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, it will significantly bolster the continuous disclosure requirements already in place under the rules of the Exchange. Unlisted entities in which members of the public invest will have a new statutory requirement to disclose material information to the ASC.New periodic reporting requirements, in particular, half-year reports, will also enhance disclosure by entities of interest to investors.The bill also reforms the prospectus provisions to facilitate fundraising, especially for listed entities and continuous fundraisers.History of the billThe present bill is a revised bill, originally introduced in the Senate in November 1992 as the Corporate Law Reform Bill (No.2) 1992.I will elaborate shortly on the major differences between the two bills. However, it should be emphasised that the central aim of this bill remains the same. Timely disclosure of relevant information is essential for investors to have confidence in the integrity of the market place and to make informed investment decisions. This must be the central feature of an efficient and fair securities market.Full disclosure of information about the financial position and prospects of entities in which Australians invest helps to counter insider trading, the creation of false markets and the distortion of markets through rumours.In essence, the capacity of a market to attract investment—and thus to enable continued economic growth—is directly linked to the confidence generated through timely disclosure of material information.The 1992 bill was prepared in light of a report, in September 1991, from the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee on an Enhanced Statutory Disclosure System. This report pointed to the need for improved disclosure and recommended the introduction of a statutory system for continuous disclosure to the ASC by a wide range of corporations and other investment entities.As I said in my introductory remarks, inadequate disclosure of material information was a major problem during the 1980s. This has been widely acknowledged, not only by the Advisory Committee, but also by the report of November 1991 on Corporate Practices and the Rights of Shareholders of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs which was prepared while I was the Chair of that Committee.Clearly, significant improvements in disclosure have been made by the Australian Stock Exchange and by corporations themselves since that time. However, past experience has pointed to a need to change the legal framework to improve the level of disclosure and increase investor protection.One essential difference exists in the approach to disclosure in the bill now introduced from that of the 1992 bill. This bill builds on the existing framework for disclosure by listed entities to the Stock Exchange, rather than creating an overlapping system for disclosure of the same or similar information to the ASC.This approach has been adopted in light of the recommendations of the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. It also takes into account criticism of the 1992 bill from business and professional advisers. While the bill retains and reinforces the role of the Stock Exchange, it also strengthens the position of the ASC to take action to ensure compliance with continuous disclosure obligations. Most importantly, it retains the principle that civil remedies should be available in respect of breaches of disclosure obligations. As now formulated, the bill provides investors with a right to recover damages where loss is suffered as a result of the market being misled through an intentional, reckless or negligent failure to fulfil these obligations.The bill has been the subject of an intensive consultation process over more than two years. This consultation has occurred at all stages in the development and introduction of the 1992 bill and again in the revision of that bill. In addition to the discussion papers and draft legislation released for comment, my Department and I have held numerous discussions on the bill and the approach to be adopted. This input has been welcomed and will continue to be an essential part of the corporate law reform process. The views of business and professional users of the law are carefully considered and have played an important part in determining the content of the legislation.I should add that the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee was amongst the bodies consulted on the revised approach to continuous disclosure. The Committee has recently advised me that it supports the approach adopted in the bill, including that continuous disclosure for listed companies be regulated through the Stock Exchange.The bill also contains major amendments to the prospectus provisions. The amendments are based in part on a report in March 1992 on Prospectus Law Reform by the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee. A number of the provisions included in the bill were contained in draft legislation released for public comment in January this year. These provisions, as well as a number of others, have been revised to make policy and drafting improvements in the light of comments.Content of the billI will outline only briefly the most significant features of the bill. A more detailed outline of the bill is in the Explanatory Memorandum.(a) Enhanced DisclosureAs with the 1992 bill, the enhanced disclosure scheme will apply to listed and unlisted entities in which there is a significant investor interest. These entities are referred to as `disclosing entities. In addition to listed entities, unlisted entities, primarily prescribed interest schemes and debenture issuers, will be covered if they issue a prospectus or engage in analogous activities to raise funds or trade in securities. The treatment of prescribed interest schemes is largely consistent with the relevant recommendations of the review of `Collective Investments by the Law Reform Commission and the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee, which was tabled in September.Flexibility is provided to enable regulations or ASC class orders to alter the effect of the disclosure obligations under the Corporations Law where this is considered appropriate.Enhanced disclosure will be achieved as a result of new legislative requirements for periodic reporting and for continuous, or ongoing, reporting.The major change in relation to periodic reporting is the introduction of statutory half-year reports. These reports will be similar to, but not as detailed as, the present annual financial statements. The Australian Accounting Standards Board will have power to set standards for half-year accounts. There will be a requirement for an auditor to review, but not audit, the half-year accounts.As previously mentioned, the continuous disclosure obligations for listed entities will be based on the Stock Exchange requirements. Civil, and in limited cases criminal, sanctions will apply where inadequate disclosure would reasonably be expected to materially affect the price or value of the relevant securities. This criterion—which needs to be satisfied in addition to showing that a breach of the Listing Rules has occurred—will ensure that only serious breaches of the disclosure requirements are subject to direct legislative sanctions.For unlisted entities, a statutory scheme analogous to that proposed for listed entities is appropriate to ensure that investors can be fully informed through continuous disclosure to the ASC. However, in many, if not most, cases these entities will already be subject to the supplementary prospectus requirements—and thus will not need to comply with the new obligations.Unlike the 1992 bill, no `carve-out has been included for confidential material to be withheld from disclosure. This is consistent with the approach now adopted of leaving the content of disclosure to the Listing Rules. The Stock Exchange has recognised the need to re-examine the Listing Rules in light of the legislative backing in the bill. It proposes to consider, in particular, the adoption of an express confidentiality provision. Should it be necessary, such a provision could be made by Regulation.The success of the approach now adopted for listed entities in relation to enhanced disclosure depends upon a vigorous and effective approach by the Stock Exchange to the enforcement of its disclosure rules. It also depends on close and effective cooperation between the Stock Exchange and the ASC. This cooperation is already apparent in a number of areas and will be further enhanced by the proposed conclusion of a Memorandum of Understanding between the 2 regulatory bodies to provide for cooperation in the enforcement of obligations on listed companies.I am confident that the new legislative framework and the enhanced role of these bodies can achieve the necessary enhancement in disclosure. However, the bill requires a review by the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee after 18 months of the commencement of the continuous disclosure and related enforcement provisions. This review, to be completed within a further 6 months, will provide an important, early assessment of the effectiveness of the legislation.Information released to the market by the ASX about listed entities will be given to the ASC and, together with information provided by listed entities, will be accessible through the ASC database.Significant reforms will be made to the powers and immunities of the Stock Exchange to ensure that it can properly carry out its major role in securing prompt and full disclosure. As with the 1992 bill, the 1993 bill expressly confers qualified privilege on the Stock Exchange in carrying out its functions. New measures in this bill will remove the requirement for the Exchange to give an undertaking as to damages when it takes court action and enable the ASC to share confidential information with the Exchange.A further, very important new measure will require securities and futures exchanges to notify the ASC of serious breaches of the Corporations Law or of their rules. This will ensure that the ASC receives, as a matter of right, information necessary to enable it to take appropriate enforcement action.(b) Prospectus ReformsThe new approach to prospectuses introduced in the 1991 legislation is generally regarded as having been very successful.However, in a number of areas it has become clear that, without detracting from the thrust of the provisions, amendments are appropriate to improve and streamline their operation:Consistent with the enhanced disclosure obligations, listed entities which fulfil certain conditions will be able to rely on a more limited prospectus that contains information relating to the particular offer of securities, including its effect and the rights attaching to the securities.Except in the case of sales of 30% or more of an entity, the requirements for secondary prospectuses will be abolished and replaced by a requirement for an information memorandum.Incorporation of documents into a prospectus will be facilitated where the document is lodged with the Commission, a summary is included in the prospectus and a copy of the full document made available without charge on request.The provisions on supplementary prospectuses will be clarified and in some cases tightened. A replacement prospectus, incorporating the original prospectus and any changes, will be permitted as an alternative to a supplementary prospectus.Refunds will be required where applications for securities are made on the basis of an out-of-date prospectus.(c) Other ReformsA major reform will be made to the Corporations Law to clarify and relax the present restrictions on companies which wish to insure or indemnify their officers (including directors) and auditors. This reform will meet long-standing criticisms of the present law and is based on reports of both the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee and its predecessor, the Companies and Securities Law Review Committee.Another reform in the bill will enable a document from the ASCs database to be admissible in a court proceedings as prima facie evidence of the matters stated, without certification of the document.Financial ImpactProvision has been made for additional costs which will be incurred by the ASC in relation to the enhanced disclosure system. The 1992 budget allocated additional expenditure of $3.2m over the following 4 years. The funds were to cover upgrading of the ASCs computer system and ongoing administrative costs. However, the ASC expects ongoing costs to be substantially offset by revenue raised through charges for access to new information on its national database.Significant changes are now proposed in the legislative scheme—butthese changes do not affect the need for funding the ASC to perform its role.Further details, including the financial impact of the bill on business, are contained in the Explanatory Memorandum. While some additional costs can be expected for business, these should not be significant. For listed entities, continuous disclosure and half-year reporting is already required by the Stock Exchange Rules. Most unlisted entities covered by the bill will already be subject to continuous disclosure through the supplementary prospectus provisions. However, the new civil and criminal sanctions for failure to comply with disclosure requirements may result in some additional compliance costs, consistent with the need to ensure appropriate disclosure on a continuous and periodic basis.Future ReformsThe Commonwealth is not resting on its laurels. The platform already in place means the Government can now take a more measured approach to reform and honourable Senators may be aware that I have recently initiated a major long term process to progressively simplify the Corporations Law. We cannot be satisfied only with a regulatory regime that protects investors. It must also be designed to be clearly understood by all who must comply with it, with cost and other impositions on commercial activity kept to the minimum necessary to adequately safeguard investors. The aim will be a user-friendly Law.I look forward to bringing the initial results of that review into the Parliament within its current life. However, achievements under this program will take some time and in the meantime it is appropriate that certain reforms proceed separately. In addition to introducing the present bill, I propose to release for public comment very shortly a draft bill containing miscellaneous amendments to remedy deficiencies and anomalies in the Corporations Law and the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989. These amendments will improve the operation of those laws and facilitate the operation of the ASC.A number of important reforms remain to be considered by the Government. These include reforms of corporate structures to cater for the needs of small business, regulation of collective investments and enhanced rights for shareholders to take legal action against company management.ConclusionIn accordance with the Heads of Agreement between the Commonwealth, the States and the Northern Territory on corporate regulation, the Ministerial Council on Corporations has been consulted and, to the extent necessary, given approval for the introduction of the bill into Parliament.I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and commend the bill to the Senate.Debate (on motion by Senator Panizza ) adjourned.","N/A","CORPORATE LAW REFORM BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

59,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator FAULKNER","5K4","(New South Wales-","ALP","Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",172,"—It will advantage all senators and put an end to what so many senators have complained about for so many years—that is, legislation by exhaustion. The government has been committed to reforming the processes of this chamber and adoption of these measures will in fact continue that process of procedural reform.At the outset of this debate I mention to honourable senators what some of those important reforms have been. We have moved to a system of three sittings per year. We have adopted the principle of introducing legislation in one session for passage the next. We have introduced a system of comprehensive briefings for senators on legislation and we have religiously circulated the forward legislative program. We have reformed the processes and procedures of the estimates committees. We have eliminated what has been—and I think the majority of senators would agree—the lengthy and unproductive committee of the whole stage debate on appropriation bills and we have established a supplementary round of estimates hearings based on written answers to questions and additional information provided by departments at the specific request of estimates committees.This has saved something like 30 or 40 hours of chamber time which, I believe, has been put to more productive use. At the same time, I think it can be argued that this has actually improved the scrutiny of government operations by the estimates committees.Another reform that was trenchantly opposed by the opposition at the time I moved it as Manager of Government Business in the Senate but which again has proved to be a positive reform is the limitation on speeches at the second reading stages of 20 minutes.The Procedure Committee was charged with the task of reporting by 30 September last year on ways in which the days and hours of sitting of the Senate and the order of business can be arranged so that more time is available for legislation and other business and late night sittings are avoided. There is no doubt that the recommendations of the Procedure Committee achieve these important objectives, and they are objectives that I believe have been shared by senators on all sides of the chamber.It ought to be placed on the record that it was a response from the Australian Democrat senators, as a result of Senator Chamarettes proposal for a cut-off motion last year, that led to this reference going forward to the Procedure Committee. The government believed that these objectives were worthy of close examination and referred these matters to the Procedure Committee.The Procedure Committee worked in a creative and somewhat innovative way. In fact, it dealt with these matters by unanimous and formal resolution, establishing a subcommittee of three senators. Serving on that subcommittee were me; Senator Teague, an opposition senator; and Senator Bourne, the Australian Democrats whip. That committee spent quite a number of hours—as I am sure those members of the subcommittee will tell this chamber—developing these proposals and responding to the wishes of senators expressed in party room meetings and to views expressed by Independent and minor party senators. We had quite a number of subcommittee meetings.It ought to be stressed that the proposals we are debating today arise from a cross-party perspective. While many of these ideas, although not all of them, originated with the Australian Democrats, views were expressed right around the chamber and they were taken on board by the subcommittee. The subcommittee then reported to the Procedure Committee. The Procedure Committee includes the President of the Senate, the Deputy President of the Senate, the leaders of the government and the opposition or their representatives, the Democrat whip, and other senators. It endorsed the views of this subcommittee.When the reference came from the Senate to the Procedure Committee, the Senate insisted that we have a consultative process. The Senate insisted that all parties, including minor parties and independents, be able to contribute to this debate. It was a process of genuine consultation and of genuine consensus. As a result, I hope that it will receive across-the-board support. In particular, it ought to receive the support of those on the opposition benches who habitually and ritualistically condemn the Senates working practices. I hope that honourable senators who have done that will be just as vocal in their support for this motion and for these reforms because these reforms are aimed at addressing those matters which they have complained about so loudly for so long. This is a genuine attempt to find a solution to the problems.I think it is also worth pointing out that the committees recommendations were drawn up in consultation with the Procedure Committee of the House of Representatives. It is very important, obviously, that we see the Senate and the House of Representatives operating on a similar timetable. The government is currently considering its response to the Blewett committee report relating to the procedures of the House of Representatives.This motion proposes sessional orders which will impose disciplines on all honourable senators from all parties. All parties in this proposal have to make some sacrifices; everyone has to make some sacrifices.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/debate.sub1/debate.sub2/speech[1]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

61,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator FAULKNER","5K4","(New South Wales-","ALP","Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",172,"—This includes the government, which makes a very significant sacrifice in reducing the amount of time for government business. But that was necessary in the interests of coming up with a workable compromise. I have some concerns that it might prove difficult to get the governments legislative program through in that somewhat reduced time available for government business. On the other side of the ledger, to balance that, there will be a greater predictability about the time that is available for government business and legislation. The changes that have been proposed will mean that legislation can be managed more effectively; it will enable us to do more in less time.The key features of this motion are to establish a four-day sitting week from Monday to Thursday. There will be a 2.00 p.m. start on Mondays and Tuesdays, and a 9.30 a.m. start on Wednesdays and Thursdays. There will be a limit of 40 minutes on the adjournment debate, with the debate concluding, at the latest, at 8.00 p.m. on each sitting night. There will be a limit of one hour for debate on matters of public importance and urgency motions. The time for debate on committee reports will be confined to one hour on Wednesdays and one hour on Thursdays, as well as that usual period for debate on general business on Thursdays. I believe that is a more than adequate time for proper debate of committee reports.These changes will mean a quite radical difference to the way the Senate will operate. I believe that they will bring a greater degree of predictability to the proceedings of the Senate. They will ensure that adequate time is available for legislation from the beginning of each session, which will obviously significantly help to avoid the backlog of legislation that always seems to occur towards the end of a sitting.As honourable senators would know, the classic example of this occurred in the first three weeks of the last budget sittings of the Senate when the Senate spent only five hours on legislation in three weeks. If these recommendations are adopted, this sort of situation cannot and will not happen again.I think the recommendations will also make a very significant contribution to the wellbeing of senators and all staff who are associated with the operation of the Senate. I do think it is particularly fitting in the Year of the Family that the recommendations will allow many staff and senators to have something approaching a more normal family life during sitting periods.I know that this proposal will be enthusiastically embraced by Senator Herron, who so often has stood up in this chamber and expressed concerns about the stress that is placed on the health and the wellbeing of senators and staff by sitting late hours. I appreciate the spirit in which he has made those comments. I have said to Senator Herron privately, and also on the floor of the chamber—","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/debate.sub1/debate.sub2/speech[1]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

63,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator FAULKNER","5K4","(New South Wales-","ALP","Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",172,"—I do not repeat private conversations. This is a communication from me to him, and I think he will appreciate that. I have made a very genuine attempt, I think with some degree of success, to try to ensure that, wherever possible, the Senate has not sat beyond midnight. I hope the spirit of those efforts is accepted by honourable senators all around the chamber. I think, however, any reasonable and rational senator would know that the time has come for us to institutionalise more sensible and reasonable sitting hours and sitting times.To ensure that these procedures are really put to the test, the government is proposing, as was recommended by the Procedure Committee, that they operate only as a sessional order. I think there will be adequate capacity in the remainder of this session and throughout the year as it unfolds for a realistic assessment to be made of the effectiveness of this new regime that I hope will be adopted today by the Senate. All parties and all honourable senators will have a capacity to make an informed judgment about these sessional orders before they become standing orders.The procedural changes that are proposed by the Procedure Committee, which were unanimously adopted through that process by the members of the subcommittee—and I thank Senator Bourne and Senator Teague for their involvement and commitment to the task because I believe that that was very real—will really be a very significant reform indeed of the way the Senate operates.These procedural changes do represent—as we will be told, I suspect quite often, by opposition senators—quite radical changes to the Senates sitting pattern. They are real changes, but they are also commonsense proposals. They make a hell of a lot of good sense. They tackle problems which honourable senators from right around this chamber have addressed time and time again. They address concerns that have been expressed in the Senate by senators from parties of all political persuasions for literally decades.These reforms will make our lives as senators, and the lives of those people who work in this parliament, more pleasant. I believe they will make the work of honourable senators, the work of the Senate and the work of our parliament a great deal more productive than it is now. In fact, they are the sorts of workplace reforms that we all demand of the community outside Parliament House. I believe that these reforms are worthy of the support of all honourable senators. I hope that they gain the support that they deserve.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/debate.sub1/debate.sub2/speech[1]/talk.start[4]/para","N/A","N/A"
64,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator HILL","BH4","(South Australia-","LP","Leader of the Opposition)",175,"—Firstly, I say that we are committed to reform. We are committed to sensible debate on ways in which we can improve the procedures of this place in order that it might work better and in order that the staff here might not be put under the incredible and unreasonable pressure that they have been put under in the past.We have participated in, and contributed to, reform through the Procedure Committee and in other ways. As has been mentioned, Senator Herron has written to Senator Faulkner expressing his concerns about the health consequences of the ridiculously long hours that this chamber sits from time to time. Mention has been made of Senator Teague, who participated constructively in a subcommittee of the Procedure Committee on our behalf.I concede that some concessions have been made to us in the proposal being put before the chamber today. One of those, I understand, is to allow time for normal party meetings on Tuesdays, which the government was proposing to remove. In other words, it was proposing to provide sitting times during that time and therefore remove from us the capacity to have a party meeting at that time. The party meeting would have been pushed off to another late night meeting, which has the same consequences of this Senate sitting late. So there have been a few concessions. I can think of only one, actually, but at least that one concession was made to us and is in the document before us.However, against that background it is also important to understand clearly the motive of the government in this matter. The motive of the government is to further restrict the capability of the Senate to meet its responsibility for full and proper scrutiny of the governments legislative program. That is what this government is about when it talks about reform. What it really means is to further restrict the capacity of the opposition to be effective in this place.We know the attitude of the government to the Australian Senate. We have heard it often from the lips of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). He regards this place as unrepresentative swill, a nuisance to him in carrying out his responsibilities as leader of a government. He would see this chamber reduced to nothing more than a rubber stamp. Therefore, the further that the capacity of the chamber can be restricted, the better it is for him and his objectives.We have seen his attitude to democracy demonstrated in the House of Representatives, where he is prepared simply to cancel question time when it does not suit him, and to remove the traditional rights of censure and the raising of matters of public importance. In other words, the Prime Minister has no respect at all for the functions of an alternative government to put pressure on, and to properly scrutinise, the government in both its legislative and financial functions. That is his attitude to the parliamentary process. To him it is nothing more than a nuisance. Therefore, the further the Senate can be restricted the better it is from his perspective. That is what this is all about. When one looks at the package before us, what stands out is all the examples in which the opposition is to be further restricted.Sadly, it is really only the Senate which has the capability now to put the government under any form of effective scrutiny. This has been precious to this chamber. It is as a result of that that the whole process of committees has been worked up. We have the legislative and general purpose committees to examine legislation. We have instituted short-term inquiries on Fridays so that there can be more effective scrutiny and we can bring the community into the legislative process and give it the opportunity to participate through the committees in order that the Senate be better informed in its debate. It is the reason why the estimates committees of this chamber have developed in a way that we can at least scrutinise in some detail the budget of the government, its financial intentions, and how it is expending the taxpayers money.It is almost the principal role of this chamber as a house of review to scrutinise the government and to hold it accountable. Therefore, the more the chamber is restricted in that capability the more its effectiveness is reduced, and I think that would concern all thinking Australians. It is sad that that is the attitude of this government and that it is prepared, for the short-term benefit of reducing scrutiny of its program at the moment, to take from the Senate the capacities that it currently has to reasonably, effectively scrutinise government performance.I will run through some of the changes that are before us today. I think anyone looking at them will see that it is the opposition that is to lose rights and capabilities as a result of this package. I will start with the adjournment. It is proposed that adjournments—that are unlimited at the moment—be reduced to just 40 minutes. On average, I think we take less than 40 minutes a day on the adjournment, but there is a capability now, if there is an issue of great importance—","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/debate.sub1/debate.sub2/speech[2]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

66,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator HILL","BH4","(South Australia-","LP","Leader of the Opposition)",175,"—Like last night. If an issue requires considerable detailed revelation and exploration, there is a capability now for a longer period to be taken on the adjournment. Historically, that has happened on a number of occasions. It is not a right that is abused because, as I have said, on average it would seem that the Senate takes less than the 40 minutes. But it is a residual capacity that is there for the Senate to use when circumstances demand that it be used. That is to be lost by this so-called reform. We are to be limited to just 40 minutes with a deadline, no matter how important the issue may be.Within that 40-minute period, individual speakers are to be limited to just 10 minutes each; so their opportunity to contribute will be reduced from 30 minutes, as it is now, to just 10 minutes. On some issues the point can be made in 10 minutes or less. On other issues, particularly issues of great detail, it is simply impossible to effectively communicate the message that an individual senator wants to put before the Senate in just 10 minutes.There is no reason why this matter needs to be so severely restricted. The average time taken by speakers in the adjournment debate is much less than 30 minutes. So there is no reason to reduce the time limit because that would reduce the capability of a speaker to effectively respond to a particular issue that requires a response greater than 10 minutes. Such a move would lead to a loss of rights of individual senators.Following that argument, it does not take too much to realise that if senators from across the parties come in on the adjournment debate, only four will be able to speak within a 40-minute timetable at a maximum of 10 minutes per person. It will be easy, therefore, for the government to thwart effective debate on the adjournment because the opposition will be restricted to one or perhaps two speakers who in turn will be restricted to just 10 minutes maximum each. So today we are being asked to vote on an effective loss of capability to use the adjournment debate.The government also proposes reducing the daily capacity to debate government documents. The proposal is an allocation of two days, and then a period at the end of the day. Some matters that arise out of government documents are of critical importance and should be debated at the time that is current. By agreeing to this package, such a capacity will be lost. I agree that quite often a matter will be deferred to the following day or, if it is the Wednesday debate, deferred to the following week without much being lost; but in some cases it will not be. So that in-built, flexible capacity which we have at the moment to respond to what is important at the moment will be lost.The Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) dismissed allocation of debate on the committee reports as adequate time without understanding the enormous amount of work in producing sound, thoughtful, committee responses—months of work by senators and committee staff. The community is brought into the process of developing those reports which are in the form of advice to the Senate. When so much work is put in, one would have thought that an individual senator, having done months of work, would be given more than 10 minutes to speak to his or her contribution to that report and the recommendations. Under this proposal such debate will be put off until Wednesday and Thursday; there will be simply a one-hour maximum, no matter how important the issue.Before Christmas, we had one matter which was of critical importance on sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act which was going to severely reduce the capacity of small business to deal with secondary boycotts. This debate demanded more than an hour. The government was embarrassed by that debate, so we find before us today an effort to restrict those debates to a maximum of one hour, and for speakers to be also severely limited to a maximum of 10 minutes each.Under the proposal, general business, which is the oppositions one time of the week to really raise an issue that has been notified under considered notice at an earlier time, will in effect also be squeezed out. This squeezing out will occur by virtue of the fact that it is the last item of business on this schedule that is before us on the Thursday before the cut-off of the adjournment. From past practice we know that previous government business earlier in the day has the effect of squeezing that back, so that on so many occasions the oppositions general business is dealt with on Thursday night. Those Thursday nights will not exist. The capacity of the opposition to raise matters that are important to it as an alternative government will be lost by the adoption of this reform.Matters of public importance and urgency debates are another option open to the opposition to raise issues that are important at the time and should be debated in the national interest. We have the capacity at present to debate those matters for two hours when they are raised. The two hours is not always used. If the issue can be dealt with in a shorter period, we go to the government and say, `We want to raise this matter of public interest, but believe that we can deal with it in an hour, and therefore do not fully utilise the time that is available. In other words, we seek the necessary time to develop the argument according to the circumstances of that argument. Under this package, however, the time for MPIs and urgency debates will be reduced from a maximum of two hours to one hour.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/debate.sub1/debate.sub2/speech[2]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

68,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator HILL","BH4","(South Australia-","LP","Leader of the Opposition)",175,"—As my colleague Senator Panizza says, it is not a right that we abuse. We have been raising very few such issues in recent times and, in effect, allowing the government further time for its program. But, importantly, the flexibility is there—the capacity exists, if the circumstances demand it, for this chamber to be effective in its accountability function by utilising the time available on the issue which is of such moment on the day. Under this package, however, that is further restricted.So we find that the adjournment debate is restricted, the capacity for committee reports to be brought down and debated is restricted, general business is squeezed out, the time for urgent debates and MPIs is restricted further and the occasions when government reports can be brought on is further restricted. Looking at that, one can objectively reach only one conclusion: the capacity of the Senate to effectively scrutinise government will be reduced. That is disappointing and will reduce the effectiveness of this body. I should have thought that would worry the Australian Democrats and the Greens, as it worries us, but it seems that it does not. I will be interested to hear their participation in this debate.The minister says, `All of this is necessary because we have had legislation by exhaustion. In some ways, he has blamed the sitting times and the procedural structures in this place for that occurrence. That is unfair. The legislation by exhaustion has been at the choice of the government—it has been a result of the governments specifically planned and designed programming, and the governments determination to achieve an outcome. A classic example of that in the last session was where the two largest and most profound pieces of legislation before the chamber were debated in this place in the last sitting fortnight. I am referring to major changes to the industrial relations package and the native title legislation which could have been brought forward but the government chose not to. The government left them at the end of the program, to be dealt with by a process of exhaustion through dealing with the Greens and the Democrats. The adjournment was lifted, debate continued and, at the end, the guillotine was applied. The government chose to legislate by exhaustion; this process had nothing to do with the procedures of this place at all.The minister constantly uses this example by saying, `It is not working. Yet in the first three weeks of the last session very little legislation was debated. That was the choice of the government—the government runs the program in this place. The government chose to raise other matters such as procedural debates and other matters of its choice other than legislation. It now has the nerve to come in here and blame us for the fact that little legislation was debated. That was the choice of the government and it should stand by the consequences of that rather than seek to attribute blame to this side of the chamber.In fact, nothing in these proposals overcomes legislation by exhaustion. There is nothing here which ensures orderly programming by the government—nothing to ensure that the government brings in its legislation during the course of the session in order to have such legislation reasonably debated at sensible times.There is no guarantee that we will not experience exactly what we have experienced in the past. When we get to the end of this session the government, with the agreement of the Greens and the Democrats, will suspend this sessional order in order that it might have these all night debates and push through legislation by exhaustion. I am sure that today the Greens and the Democrats will say, `We will not be a party to that, but they say that every time. Every time it has been put to the test, the Greens and the Democrats have buckled under and agreed to the governments proposals. I remember Senator Bourne shaking her head. How many times have the Democrats said, `We are not going to negate the adjournment any more because we are worried about the health of the staff? But, when it has come to the crunch, they have.So often the Democrats and the Greens say, `We will not agree to the guillotine and cut off the right of debate in this chamber—the real chamber of debate of the Australian parliament. But, when it comes to the crunch and Senator Faulkner walks over to the other side of the chamber they say, `Okay, on this occasion we will make an exception and agree to the guillotine and debate can be curtailed. That will happen again. There is nothing in this proposal that stops the all night sittings because the government will suspend the sessional order when it suits it.I think that the concept of all night sittings in the process of legislation by exhaustion is appalling and is bad legislative practice. That is why we sought—and we did it in conjunction with the minority parties—to try and impose limits on the government that required it to introduce its legislation early in a session. That was abused by the government. The government stacked the legislation in the other chamber. We took a further step—this time with the support of the Greens—to impose a second tier requiring the government to introduce legislation in the House of Representatives at an earlier date so that we could not then be blamed for inadequate debate in that chamber. But the government was not prepared to accept the spirit of that, either.As a result of that effort to ensure orderly programming, and therefore sensible debate, the Prime Minister lifted the capacity of the opposition to conduct its affairs in the traditional way; in other words, to censure the government or to move matters of public importance. It demonstrated—if there was need for further demonstration—how this government is not interested in proper orderly programming. Orderly programming solves the problem. This reform package before us today does not solve the problem. Unfortunately, when one looks at it as a whole, all it really does is further reduce the capacity of this chamber to be effective. That is our principal objective. We will participate and work towards constructive reform. I have mentioned our efforts that have contributed to the Friday committee hearings. These committee hearings are reasonably useful and can even further enhance the capability of the Senate.We have sought—and we are going to seek again—to introduce the concept of a minimum number of questions so that the government can be put under further scrutiny each day through the question time procedure. The governments response was not only what we see before us today, but let us remember what we have had in recent times. Unfortunately—again with the support of the minority parties—we have had the vote in this place to reduce the quorum so that senators need not participate to the full extent in this chamber. That is something that is particularly convenient to ministers, and that was the motivation.We had the debate earlier last year to reduce the speaking times in this place. No real case was made out as to why that should be so, but the government got the numbers with the support of the minority parties and reduced the times available for speaking. In so many instances that is now to be further reduced—again, sadly, with the support of the minority parties. The government came into this place and reduced the number of legislative and standing committees—again, unfortunately, with the support of the minority parties. The whole trend has been away from effective scrutiny of government performance. The government has achieved this with the support of the minority parties.I can understand the governments motivation, but I cannot understand the motivation of the Democrats and the Greens to that objective. I know that they see the function of facilitating the governments legislative program as a higher priority than we do. But to do that at the expense of the fundamental capability of this chamber to demand accountability is clearly regrettable.The opposition will be moving a number of amendments to change the governments proposal. These amendments will restore some of those capabilities. I have had circulated in the chamber some 18 amendments, and accordingly I move:(1)Paragraph (1), omit 9.30 am, substitute 10.00 am.(2)Paragraph (2)(a), omit the paragraph, substitute the following paragraph:(a)The question for the adjournment of the Senate shall be proposed at 7.20 pm each day.(3)Paragraph (2)(b), omit the paragraph.(4)Paragraph (2)(c), omit the paragraph.(5)Paragraph (3)(a), after item (v), insert:(va)Any debate on committee reports.(6) Paragraph (3)(a), after item (vi), insert:(via)Consideration of government documents for up to 30 minutes under standing order 61.(7)Paragraph (3)(a), omit item (viii).(8)Paragraph (3)(b), omit item (vii).(9) Paragraph (3)(b), after item (ix), insert:(ixa)Consideration of government documents for up to 30 minutes under standing order 61(10)Paragraph (3)(b), omit item (xiii).(11)Paragraph (3)(b),, item (x), omit General business, substitute Not later than 4.30 pm, general business.(12)After paragraph (3) insert the following paragraph:(3A)Questions may be put to Ministers each day until 28 questions, including supplementary questions, have been asked and answered..(13)Paragraph (4), omit the paragraph.(14)Paragraph (5)(a), omit Wednesday or Thursday, substitute any day.(15)Paragraph (5)(b), omit the paragraph.(16)Paragraph (5)(c), omit the paragraph.(17)Paragraph (6), omit the paragraph.(18)Paragraph (7), omit the paragraph, substitute the following paragraph:(7)(a)Immediately after question time on any day motions may be moved to take note of answers given to questions without notice in accordance with the terms of the sessional order of 13 May 1993 relating to answers to questions without notice.(b)If a matter of public importance is not to be proposed nor an urgency motion moved, the total time for debate on all motions relating to answers to questions without notice on any day shall not exceed 60 minutes..The first of these amendments deals with a matter that I have not mentioned. The government wishes us to start sitting at 9.30 a.m. on Wednesdays and Thursdays. I am advised that that will significantly eat into time that is currently used by important committees of this chamber. It is unnecessary to do that, so we are proposing that the starting time be 10 oclock rather than 9.30 a.m.. This will better facilitate the broader operation of this chamber. The second amendment seeks to lift the absolute cut-off of the adjournment. We do not mind that the question on the adjournment be put, but the maximum restraint of 40 minutes should be lifted. My amendment changes that back to the current position.The third amendment seeks to omit paragraph (2)(b) of the proposal before us. That also deals with the 40 minute timetable and the 10 minutes allowed for each speaker on the adjournment. My fourth proposal is to omit paragraph (2)(c). That again relates to the absolute cut-off after 40 minutes of debate on the adjournment. The fifth amendment is to insert a new item after paragraph (3)(a). The amendment reads `Any debate on committee reports. This will introduce greater capacity in the Senate to debate its own committees work. It is pointless to put hundreds of hours of effort into committee reports if they are then not properly and fully debated in this chamber.My sixth amendment will ensure that government documents are debated for up to 30 minutes each day. I have already given reasons for that. This would restore something that is in the best interests of this chamber. I cannot think of any argument to the contrary. The seventh amendment seeks to omit item (viii) from paragraph (3)(a). This relates to a further restriction that was put on government documents.The eighth amendment omits item (vii) from paragraph (3)(b), which changes the schedule by further removing government business at that time. The ninth amendment relates to consideration of government business. Some of these amendments are aimed at removing the relevant clauses from the proposal before us and then inserting the changes that I have mentioned. So, although there are 18 separate amendments, there are not actually 18 separate items.The tenth amendment seeks to remove item (xiii) from paragraph (3)(b). This paragraph also relates to government documents. We believe that we should be able to deal with documents each day, rather than follow the procedure that is set out in this proposal. Amendment 11 relates to general business on a Thursday. We are proposing that if general business has not been called on earlier, it be called on at 4.30 p.m. If these changes were not made, debate on general business would be squeezed out of existence.Amendment 12 has been particularly promoted by my colleague Senator Kemp to ensure that a minimum number of 28 questions are asked at question time. That will further improve the accountability capacity of this chamber. I would have thought that amendment would certainly be supported by the minority parties.Amendment 13 would omit paragraph (4). Again, that affects government documents so that they will be dealt with in the way I have already outlined. Amendment 14 substitutes the words `any day for the words `Wednesday or Thursday in paragraph (5)(a). That also relates to government business. Amendment 15 would remove paragraph (5)(b), the paragraph that provides:A Senator speaking to such a motion shall not speak for more than 10 minutes, and debate on all such motions shall not exceed one hour.Amendment No. 16 would remove paragraph (5)(c), which states:If a debate is not concluded at the expiration of that time the debate shall be made an order of the day for Thursday at the time for consideration of committee reports.That would take from the time available for consideration of committee reports. We need a greater capacity to deal with those sorts of matters. We do not want them shuffled off to the Thursday and then squeezed out with general business.By amendment 17 we seek to omit paragraph (6), the one whereby the government is seeking to utilise the two lunch hours on Wednesday and Thursday, even though they are asking the Senate to sit from 9.30 a.m. to 8 p.m. The government has not made out a case for that so we are seeking to reduce it to one lunch hour. We think that is sensible and feel that it would be accepted by the majority. (Extension of time granted) Finally, amendment 18 would enable us, in the event that there is no time for an MPI or a matter of urgency, to seek the alternative of time allowed for further debate on matters arising out of question time. That is a change that would not take up government time. In effect, it would be a reshuffling of the business of the Senate to better reflect the issues of importance on that particular day. In other words, if issues that we think are of great importance to the nation come out of question time rather than pre-planned matters of public importance, we should have the flexibility to debate them. That would be another sensible reform.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/debate.sub1/debate.sub2/speech[2]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

77,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BOURNE","TW4","(New South Wales)","AD","N/A",182,"—Mr Acting Deputy President, normal human beings do not look forward to a minimum working day of 12 hours, which is the absolute minimum that we presently work in this place. With committee meetings and the rest, our working days are actually longer than that and—even more importantly—the working days of support staff are longer again. That is ridiculous.The vast majority of us in this place are not Guy the Gorilla; we do not think that the more pain and stress we put on ourselves the stronger and more macho we will look. That is ridiculous too. Most of us are normal human beings. We might be abnormal in some ways—abnormal simply because we are here—but we are normal in most. We realise that we are working under ridiculous conditions and those conditions must be changed. We have all seen colleagues who have left this place and, after about three months, look about 10 years younger. I met up with Peter Walsh last night and he looked terrific. I look forward to getting out of here and looking wonderful.As Senator Faulkner said, this report of the Procedure Committee was a unanimous one. We put a lot of work into it and we came up with something which, I thought, we could all live with. We will have to wait and see what happens when it comes to the vote.With respect to the proposed starting times of 2 p.m. on Mondays and Tuesdays and 9.30 a.m. on Wednesdays and Thursdays, originally we were going to have a starting time of 9.30 a.m. on Tuesday, the trade-off for that being extra time for one adjournment debate while still finishing at 8 oclock. The opposition, through Senator Teague, put a very cogent case for needing the extra morning for party meetings, shadow cabinet meetings and that sort of thing. That seemed reasonable so we recommended a 2 p.m. start on Mondays and Tuesdays and a 9.30 a.m. start on Wednesdays and Thursdays.The extra half hour should not make too much difference. Whips meetings could be held a bit earlier—I know that I get in a lot earlier—while printing of the Order of Business and the Notice Paper will also have to start a bit earlier. That is a bit of a nuisance but it only entails half an hour and there is extra time the night before and on Wednesday and Thursday nights.The adjournment has caused a lot of angst. When we looked at this whole question of change to procedure, our starting point was Senator Herrons very compulsive submission to the committee that we should finish at 8.00 p.m. no matter what; that we should be able to rely upon 8.00 p.m. as an absolute finishing time. We decided that we would work backwards from that. In so doing, we looked at the sort of adjournment debates we have been having and the length of time we thought was reasonable. We ended up with a proposal for a maximum of 40 minutes on the adjournment with 10 minutes for each speaker.As Senator Hill said in his contribution to this debate, the average time for each speaker on the adjournment in the last budget session was about seven minutes. The average time on the adjournment in total last session was about 22 minutes. So there is no reason for an unlimited adjournment debate. If it happens that some person needs the full 40 minutes, I do not think honourable senators will be unreasonable. This has only ever happened a couple of times and leave has always been granted. If honourable senators have something reasonable to talk about, they can ask for an extra 10 minutes and, if it is before 8.00 p.m., they will be granted that extra 10 minutes. I am absolutely sure of that. They have only got to be reasonable. The vast majority of us in this place are reasonable. We do not always sound like it, I know, but we are. So that was looked at and agreed to by all of us.The next point concerns motions to take note of answers. That time has been taken up. Last session we allowed 30 minutes for taking note of answers after question time had finished—and all of that time has been used. We have used almost the entire 30 minutes every day since then for taking note of answers. Having that time was not a right and had never been a right; this arrangement was only recently introduced into this place. This time is used to effect by opposition senators and by some government senators—I know one or two of our senators have used it to effect. All of us find that we can use it usefully. That is now a right; and it is accepted that there will be a maximum of 30 minutes each day.We have also provided that any part of that 30 minutes which is not taken up can be added on to the hour that we have allowed for debate on a MPI. Some opposition senators feel that there should be flexibility when a really important topic is being discussed and that such a MPI should run for 90 minutes instead of 60 minutes. But if one honourable senator cannot get through a speech in 10 minutes, somebody else can bring up more points and the time can be used effectively. Senator Harradine unfortunately is alone and cannot get other people to make more points for him. Given that, Senator Harradine was on the procedure committee, and has been very generous in allowing this suggestion. I suppose he may vote against it.Senator Harradine interjecting —","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/debate.sub1/debate.sub2/speech[3]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"
78,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BOURNE","TW4","(New South Wales)","AD","N/A",182,"—He says he will not. The only person who actually suffers from that proposal is Senator Harradine. I apologise to him for that, but I hope it will not matter too much to him. He is very effective at using this chamber. I am sure that if anybody can find ways to use it, it is Senator Harradine. If the full half hour of taking note is not taken up, it can be used for the MPI, giving a maximum of 90 minutes.We have put in one hour for MPI and urgency motions each day. For most debates we have an hour. We use two hours only if it is a quiet day at the beginning of the session. We have used one hour for ages; and that one hour is what we have agreed to in the new scheme of things. That would allow 10 minutes per speaker.Consideration of committee reports and government responses has also caused some angst. At the moment time for that is unlimited; but that is not a right. It is done by leave. We thought it should be a right. This matter has been brought before the procedure committee, I think twice in the last year or two, and we could never agree. So we erred on the generous side of what we looked at before in the procedure committee. We have come up with an hour on Wednesday, an hour on Thursday morning and an extra 50 minutes on Thursday afternoon.Senator Hill was right when he said that we did not have to have that extra 50 minutes, according to what we had put. We meant to put that in and I am sure Senator Teague will agree that that was the spirit of the entire procedure committee—that the 50 minutes extra should have been in. That is brought up in one of Senator Hills amendments—which I think is a very good amendment—that we start general business at 4.30 p.m., no matter what else is happening. We will stop, the way we would stop everything for question time, and we will start general business at 4.30 p.m. That will allow the hour for documents, the hour for business and the 50 minutes for government responses and any committee reports which we have not got through in the two hours that we have had on the Wednesday and Thursday mornings. Nothing will be allowed to stop that happening.In the past—we would all agree I am sure if we looked at the Hansard —we have not had many government responses. We have not got to them because we have started general business a little later. The committee did not want that; we think this is very important. It is the one part of the week where the opposition has an absolute time. It knows it can count on that time and should always be able to do so. That is what we wanted and it is contained in Senator Hills amendment.Committee reports over the last budget session have taken an average of 124 minutes a week. We have allowed 170 minutes in the new scheme, which I think should work out quite well. The problem with committee reports and government responses is that when committees are on something big such as the splitting of tax bills or sections 45D and 45E, the reports do not come up in a neat way; they are not spread evenly throughout the session or the year. We have to make a bit more of an effort to get our committees to report back in a more organised way. If we put some thought into that, it will work. If it does not work, we will have to look at changing it. But we should try it first. We cannot say it is not going to work without trying it.The next thing I want to look at is the House of Representatives reforms. The House of Representatives is looking at the same sort of thing as we are. It has come up with a timetable which is fairly similar to ours. It is interesting to note that the opposition members on the House of Representatives procedure committee have put in a dissenting report which is almost the same as our unanimous report. That is very sensible. Unfortunately, in their dissenting report they have not allowed as much time for consideration of committee reports, documents or MPIs as we have, but that is a function of the House of Representatives. Senator Hill is correct when he says, `This is the place where most scrutiny goes on, rather than the Representatives.It is impossible for those in the House of Representatives to get all that extra time that we think is necessary to look at committee reports, documents, MPIs, ministerial statements and that sort of thing. I hope their dissenting report does well because it is very similar to our unanimous report; and I think our unanimous report is pretty good.The point about flexibility is a bit unfair. We will not know until we have tried it out for a little while, but I think the flexibility is there. Committee report time can be used. There will be more committee report time because we will have general business set at 4.30 p.m. There will be the same amount of document time. We are not using it up now. I imagine if we say to people, `You have this amount of time, they will start using it up. That, in some ways, is a pity, but as we all know, work expands to fill the time we allow for it. But it is going to have to contract to fill the time allowed, in some cases. In this case it will not have to contract; I am afraid it will expand.The point about committees in the mornings is interesting. There are committee meetings in the mornings at the moment, but that is mostly because we cannot have them in the evenings. The reason we cannot have them in the evenings is that we finish at 10.30 p.m. or later. The fact that we will be finishing at 8 p.m, and we can count on finishing at 8 p.m, will mean the committee meetings will move from some mornings into some evenings.There is a very good argument in the House of Representatives procedure committee report that that is not a good thing on every evening, and that we should set aside a couple of evenings when that cannot be done. We can do that by agreement. It is not in this report and we would have to do it by agreement to start with; but I think it is worth while. We have to look at whether we will agree to committees sitting on, say, Thursday or Wednesday nights—I do not know which. Maybe we should start with two nights and see whether that works. We could go to one if it does not.All of these things involve flexibility. Flexibility is what we are after—and it is very important. The question of flexibility is a big one, but it cannot be determined until we have tried it; and if it does not work, we can change it. That is the most important point.We also have two lunchtime debates, one of which concerns matters of public interest—almost exclusively the oppositions and which, I believe, it is trying to get rid of—and one of which concerns non-controversial government business, which is also important. Both those debates have been used to the maximum. They could have been allowed more time. We have had them on one lunch time per week for the last year or two. In the last session we used up almost the entire lunch time every day they were on.There is obviously a need for that opportunity; the debate has expanded to fill the space that was allowed for it. I think it is only fair to allow a whole lunchtime for such matters. We must remember that these are non-controversial matters. If there are not enough people to speak we do not have it, but if those people want to speak they should have the flexibility to do that. We allow a whole lunchtime for non-controversial business and to get rid of the bills that nobody wants to speak on because they are non-controversial. They are usually just machinery matters that go through.It has been said to me that there is a problem with staff over lunchtimes. We have had in the past—I think there has been only one occasion when it has not happened—a gentlepersons agreement amongst all of us that there will be no quorums or divisions called in those lunchtimes. Because that has happened consistently, I would expect it to continue to happen consistently. Staff do not have to monitor the chamber. If honourable senators have a bill or an MPI, it is their responsibility to be in the chamber to speak to the bill or to their matter of public interest. If they are not here, they miss out. They have agreed to it beforehand—it is all very simple—and there is no reason why anybody should have to monitor that. If honourable senators cannot do that themselves, that is their problem.I believe that those two hours should stay. If we have consistently only half an hour on one day of opposition senators speaking on matters of public interest and half an hour on the other day on non-controversial bills, then we can put them back together again, as they are now, and nothing will have changed. I believe that is a good change.Fortunately, the members of the working group all got on very well, which was good. I would like to thank my two colleagues on that working group for their very hard work. I know that Senator Teague in particular had not an easy time going back to the opposition and arguing these cases. He did it very effectively and terribly diligently. He was very good at that. He came up with some very good ideas. It is so long since we did this—the report came down in September—that I cannot for the life of me remember what some of his ideas were, but I am sure he will tell us. They were good ideas and they were ones that we put in.Senator Faulkner went back to the government and got agreement from all government senators for these things. In some cases that would not have been easy either because government business has been cut down in the same way as opposition business. All business has been cut down because we are working shorter hours. If we had worked that extra morning we would have had a little more time, but we are not going to. If we agree that we are going to get up at 8.00 p.m., then we get up at 8.00 p.m. We all have to make some small sacrifices.The other person who deserves a great deal of credit for a lot of this work is Senator Herron, whose submission to the committee was very comprehensive. It was alarmingly convincing on the health consequences of sitting long and ridiculous hours and the effects of sleep deprivation on the human beings capacity for making competent decisions, and I found it somewhat shocking. I recommend this submission to all honourable senators before they vote on this question. I think it is a very good and comprehensive submission. Senator Herron is somebody we want to have on our side.Finally, I point out that this is a sessional order; it is not a change to standing orders at the moment. If it does not work we automatically go back to our current somewhat ridiculous timetable after the next election. If it does work we will all, I am sure, be really enthusiastic about changing standing orders during the life of this parliament. As a member of the Procedure Committee, I intend to ask for a review of the way these changes are working by the start of next year. I know that Senator Faulkner and Senator Teague think we can do that a little earlier, and I think they are probably right. The three of us can look at the way this is working, probably around the middle of the year. If there are any obvious terrible flaws in it, we will find them way before then and we will be able to change them. I do not think there are any terrible flaws; I hope not. But nothing is perfect, and I imagine that this will need some tinkering around the edges. However, we will not know until we have tried it. We cannot say, `I am not going to try something because it might not work out. The odds are, I think, that this will work, and work well, and the sooner we try it the better.I had a motion on restructuring of committees, incorporating Senator Hills motion on chairs of committees, passed this morning by the Senate, and I thank the Senate for that. We are taking that one very seriously, too. That is another reform of the Senate that we think should come sooner rather than later. We on the Procedure Committee are looking forward to getting lots of submissions from honourable senators; I am going back to my office in a moment to write mine. We hope to see an interesting restructuring of committees, particularly of committee chairs, in the near future.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/debate.sub1/debate.sub2/speech[3]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
79,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator TEAGUE","PJ4","(South Australia)","LP","N/A",186,"—I very much welcome the constructive way in which this debate has proceeded. I have listened to every word from the three speakers before me—Senator Faulkner, my colleague Senator Hill and Senator Bourne. They have all been accurate, to my knowledge, in all they have said of the way in which this matter has proceeded and they have argued genuinely and constructively. Some of the issues, obviously, will be a matter for the individual judgment of honourable senators, and we will vote accordingly.One of my favourite memorials—statues, national monuments—in Australia is in Melbourne. It is the eight-hour day statue at the end of Lonsdale Street. As a senator for the last 16 years, I have had great pleasure in driving past the eight-hour day statue whenever I have been in Melbourne on parliamentary business. I look at that statue and I see eight hours work, eight hours leisure or rest, and eight hours sleep. I say to myself that if 50 years ago the workers of Australia got an eight-hour day, there has to be some hope for politicians that we will get a 16-hour day, at least in my time of tenure in the parliament.I do recognise the remarks made by a number of us, not only in this debate but earlier, that it is the case that we have a minimum 12-hour day, and I would argue that it is more like 16 for most of us, especially on days when we are here in Canberra. There does need to be reform, and I have always accepted Senator Herrons professional judgment about stress and the intolerable practice of sitting night after night beyond midnight.There is reform in the air with regard to the sitting hours. The House of Representatives this week, I understand, is adopting a new sitting hour pattern that will be very similar to the one put forward in the motion before the Senate today. Also, for the first time we will have a budget in May instead of August, and this has led to a sitting pattern in three blocks through the year rather than one each in autumn and spring. Of course, the autumn and spring sessions have blown out to more than two-thirds of the year. However, I know that there is reform about, and we need to take into account the new sitting blocks and the views of the House of Representatives.There is a zero sum gain in all of this because there are only 24 hours in a day and honourable senators have responsibilities apart from this chamber. We have committee work to do on non-sitting days and we have constituents. I have one and one-third million constituents in my state of South Australia and I love to listen to them, to be with them. As a politician, I believe that the best prospect I have for my party to win government is to ensure that my colleagues and I maximise the time we have in the electorate, hearing views and also putting forward views on our own behalf on what we would be doing in government.I wish to correct one matter. There is talk amongst some of us in the Senate that government business is somehow favouring the government or is the governments responsibility. I put it to the Senate that the legislation of Australia, the law making of Australia, is every senators business. Whilst it is the case that the government of the day proposes most laws, what is written down as government business can be equally written down as legislation. This is the only effective legislative debate in this country with regard to any federal law.I do not seek to reflect upon the other house but, unfortunately, the iron numbers of government majority in the House of Representatives mean that the government always wins. There is a record of years and years with no amendments and often no substantial debate in the House of Representatives on any legislation. This Senate is the legislative debating chamber with regard to all federal laws. As senators, we must ensure that there is proper time to have our say on what will be the laws of Australia.I wish to refer to a number of points of misunderstanding that have been circulating in recent months, not least in the last few days. The first is with regard to general business. As Senator Bourne said, it was never the intention of the Procedure Committee or any member of it to reduce for one minute or in any other way general business on Thursdays. I very much welcome the clarification on this matter from Senator Hill with regard to amendment No. 11 of the package of amendments he has moved, which will ensure that general business starts at 4.30 p.m. and that nothing that we have known over all these years with regard to general business is in any whit diminished.The second misunderstanding is that government documents will be discussed on only two days a week. That is not correct. By this motion government documents may be discussed on three days a week; that is, six days a fortnight. At the moment, we debate them on seven days a fortnight, so there is a change from seven to six days. The point is that it is our understanding that no government documents will be tabled on a Monday and, therefore, senators will not lose their ability to speak while a document is hot—while it has just been tabled—in that period of reflection. In the give and take of making a package that will allow for legislative debate, I believe that it is reasonable, as a sessional order, to see six out of eight days on which we can have all of the present abilities with regard to government documents. The actual time available for government documents exceeds by a long way the time that has been spent on government documents in many years.The third area of misunderstanding concerns committee reports and government responses to committee reports. I am as much as, if not more than, any other senator a stalwart of the Senate committee system. I have participated in 100-plus inquiries through committees of the Senate. I have, as is well known, strongly supported retaining the structure of our Senate standing committees as well as estimates, select and other committees.I want to make it quite clear that at the moment those who speak on Senate committee reports do so by leave. For example, yesterday, while I was in the chair of the Senate, Senator McKiernan presented the governments response to a very important committee report on the Family Law Act. As the chairman of that committee, he obviously wanted to speak on that vital document containing the governments response to the work of those senators on the committee. He rose and sought leave to speak. Of course he was given leave because it would be a nonsense for him not to be able to immediately respond. He did so with discipline in a matter of 10 minutes. Four other senators—Senators Kemp, Campbell, Coates and Watson—also sought leave and spoke with discipline on a matter regarding salaries. We have in the committee report suggestion in this motion a definite right to deal with Senate committee reports and government responses for a minimum of one hour on Wednesday mornings and one hour on Thursday mornings and for the overflow not to be lost off the Notice Paper forever, but to be an order of the Senate to be considered in general business, as it is now.With regard to the adjournment debate, none of us likes to see a reduction in the flexibility of individual senators. When I first came to this chamber, I could speak on any matter for 60 minutes. I could get up on any bill and give a one-hour speech on any matter before us. No-one contemplates a 60-minute speech for senators. We would be sitting on not only Christmas Day and Good Friday, but also into the early hours of the morning every day. There is a zero sum gain in these matters.If this proposal is supported by the Senate, a minimum of 21 adjournment speeches will be able to be given in any one sitting week—four each evening for 10 minutes each and five on Wednesday lunchtimes for 15 minutes each. That number of 21 spots exceeds the number of adjournment speeches that have been given in recent years. Also, the time available is double that which has been spent in recent years. In my view, the flexibility that must be retained is the ability to be given leave. Leave ought to be given in this chamber in the traditional way that we see now. If someone has a substantial speech—","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/debate.sub1/debate.sub2/speech[4]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

81,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator TEAGUE","PJ4","(South Australia)","LP","N/A",186,"—I will come to piggeries. I will give an instance of my own. I gave a 30-minute adjournment speech three years ago on why I believed it was time to come back to normal relations with China. The foreign minister, Senator Evans, gave me a great kindness in attending and listening to that speech. This being a genuine bipartisan approach, a couple of weeks later Australia normalised relations with China—a year and a half after the terrible Tiananmen events. I had just come back from China. I had a series of speeches that I could make only on the adjournment. I gave a 30-minute address. I believe that any senator who wants to make a 20-minute or 30-minute address on the adjournment should be able, through the whips, to seek leave to do so.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/debate.sub1/debate.sub2/speech[4]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

83,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator TEAGUE","PJ4","(South Australia)","LP","N/A",186,"—With regard to piggeries, which Senator Kemp keeps coming back to, I concede that if Senator Baume, for example, wanted to give a speech on the Prime Ministers piggery, his personal financial interest in such a piggery and whether it is consistent with the ethics and behaviour we in the parliament would accept of a Prime Minister, he would not be given leave to do so.At the same time, I concede that we have the opportunity to debate an MPI every day. This is clearly a matter in which the opposition would have a major interest and, therefore, it would be appropriate, being a directly political matter, for the Prime Ministers piggery to be the subject of an MPI that day rather than a 20-minute adjournment speech by one opposition senator in the evening. That would necessitate a government response on the matter; it would allow Independent and Democrat senators to speak on the same issue; and it would demand, in the one hour that is set aside every day for an matter of public importance, an answer from the government with regard to anything that we saw as lacking and, as Senator Kemp knows, there are matters lacking.Another misunderstanding is the reference to lunchtimes and late dinners. On Wednesdays and Thursdays it is proposed that the sittings of the Senate begin at 9.30 a.m. and conclude, at the latest, at 8.00 p.m. However, the only business that can be conducted during lunchtime on Wednesday and Thursday is non-controversial legislation or a matter of public interest, as now, and which absolutely precludes divisions. We are well versed in these two activities during Thursday lunchtimes. There has been no trouble with it. It was in the mind of the members of the Procedure Committee to extend this to enable those senators who wanted to make a contribution, such as an adjournment speech on a matter of public interest, to have 15 minutes on a Wednesday if they wished. The requirement for staff, at that time, is minimal. If a senator does not know all of the advice from a staff member by the time that Wednesday lunchtime begins, there is something lacking in that persons preparation. If there is a need to have some whips clerk monitoring this matter, there will need to be a roster for substitution—just like in a hospital.Hospitals operate 24 hours a day, but that does not mean that every doctor and every nurse has to attend 24 hours a day. There is a sharing of the load, and it is reasonable. Where there is a vital job—and I regard, in these matters, the vital job as the whips clerk; we happen to have an excellent whips clerk—there will need to be that degree of flexibility for that one hour on Wednesdays. With regard to the dinner break, let it be understood that at 6.50 p.m. it is proposed to debate government documents. If a senator is not prepared, with staff support, to speak at 6.50 p.m., he or she is lacking in preparation. The adjournment is at 7.20 p.m. Again, if senators are not ready to go on the adjournment with their speeches, they are lacking in preparation. There is no essential need for staff support beyond 6.50 p.m., except in very rare cases. Therefore, the staff, and senators at large, can have their normal meal from 6.50 p.m. With regard to the dining rooms, it is a management question which must be met to allow for dinner after 8.00 p.m. in any event. That probably means until nine oclock on any evening the Senate is sitting. That is achievable, and what we gain is the advantages of the package. I wished to clarify that misunderstanding.I reiterate to the chamber that the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Senator Faulkner, spoke with measure, credibility and genuineness. I believe that he spoke accurately. I say the same of the contributions by Senator Bourne and Senator Hill. There was a constructive and measured contribution from the three who preceded me, and I welcome that. Let us deal with this matter constructively and with an ability to persuade a majority to any particular position.I wish to conclude with three points. Firstly, this is a free vote. All senators are free to make up their minds on any matter of procedure. This is not a whipped party vote—that is why I am sure all honourable senators are listening to the contributions that are being made in this debate. Every senator will sit on one side or the other with regard to the 18 amendments and to the matter as a whole. It is a matter for the individual. There is no whip. It has always been the case with procedural matters on how we conduct ourselves in this chamber.Secondly, I wish to refer to the need for further reform. I welcome all that Senator Bourne has said about the committee system inquiry. I have long advocated a sharing of committee chairmanship of all Senate committees reflective of the composition of the Senate, not reflective of which party happens to be the executive government. I believe that that is a reform we ought to see in place before Easter.Thirdly, the reform that most bears upon this debate that I wish to strongly advocate is when we get to the cut-off times—Senator Hill rightly referred to these reforms initiated by the Democrats and Senator Chamarette, with opposition support over recent years—for the introduction of legislation that can be completed in a session, the Manager of Government Business and the whips ought to see that those bills can be contemplated for the rest of the session and to allocate, informally, an appropriate number of hours per bill for the remainder of the session, understanding that there will be one half to two-thirds of the time we sit available for legislation. Therefore, we will not see the bunching up of a hundred bills in the final two weeks.It is rational that when we get to the cut-off point, knowing when our last sitting day is, we allocate a certain number of hours. I am not advocating a guillotine; I am advocating an informal and rational agreement. It can be put by the whips to their party rooms in draft form and they can come back with a confirmed allocation of the hours that are available. There is a zero sum gain. If one party had a constructive view that there was no way in the world the allocated hours for that bill could be in any way adequate, the only way to argue for the adequacy of hours would be to say that we must therefore sit on extra days. I believe that with this general reform, from the cut-off date till the end of every session, there will be such a working relationship. We have moved somewhat towards it, but I believe only in the last two weeks. We need to work on it in the last six weeks. I commend the words used by Senator Hill in the amendment with regard to general business and to committee business—that is, the carry over not being lost off the notice paper of any matter that is not concluded on the Wednesday and Thursday mornings for the one hour.I conclude by reiterating this major point: government business is not to be construed as something that is in the favour of government. It ought to be seen as the legislative activity of this Senate chamber, in which we are all legislators and in which we have a responsibility. This is the only chamber that constructively and realistically has to debate legislation. We serve the people of Australia by ensuring that there is sufficient time, when we are alert, to apply our minds as carefully as possible to make sure that legislation is in the best possible form.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/debate.sub1/debate.sub2/speech[4]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"
84,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator KEMP","WW4","(Victoria)","LP","N/A",190,"—I rise to make a contribution on this important debate. I want to briefly refer to one of the comments that my colleague Senator Teague made. I do not argue that a major function of this chamber is to discuss government legislation—quite obviously, that is a major function. An equally major function of this chamber is to allow people who are not members of the government to raise issues of considerable concern to them. What worries me about some of these reforms is that when the whole package is considered we find that the time to discuss issues of particular concern and priority to non-government members has been greatly cut and restricted. I think that is a pity.One area that has always allowed us the potential to raise issues of daily concern that come up is that of matters of public importance and urgency motions. Under the package we have before us we will get five hours less in that area. I think we have used that procedure responsibly in this chamber. It is not used every day. Nonetheless, when a major issue arises there is the flexibility to use it.

86,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator KEMP","WW4","(Victoria)","LP","N/A",190,"—That is the point that Senator Bourne raised. At least in part of her speech there was an assumption that we need to be flexible. The reality is that we were being flexible and now we will be restricted. That also applies to the adjournment debate. We will have greatly restricted flexibility in the use of the adjournment debate. I think Senator Teague conceded that in his remarks as well.A number of people have referred to the fact that the adjournment debate, coming at the end of the day, for a long period of time has been used in a responsible fashion. The overall statistics show, quite consistently over a period of time, that up to 28 or 29 minutes are used on average for the adjournment debate, with two or three speakers, each speaking in the order of 10 minutes. So there is a very flexible arrangement which has generally been well used. Issues of major importance come up on occasion and people take longer on the adjournment debate to suss out such problems. That particular right will be removed from us.I thought it was kind of Senator Teague to say that we could raise such matters as matters of public interest. That is a possibility, and I would not deny that. I remember in relation to the Westpac papers that Senator McLean wished to develop the element of the surprise approach. On quite a number of evenings Senator McLean got up and, from memory, spoke for quite a long period of time on issues he felt were of particular importance to his constituents.Regrettably, flexibility on the adjournment is being removed. No matter how we dress this up, an arrangement which was working well and in a responsible fashion is undergoing a restriction, which is a pity. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which summarises where particular procedures gain in time and where particular procedures lose in time.

87,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator KEMP","WW4","(Victoria)","LP","N/A",190,"—I have looked upon the transformation of Senator Faulkner with great interest since he assumed the office of Manager of Government Business in the Senate. From time to time he has attempted to portray a very reasonable approach, which is certainly an approach that we welcome, but I have to say that I saw elements of the old Senator Faulkner when he commenced his speech and spoke about the major reforms that his government has brought into parliamentary procedures. I think there would be universal agreement that the approach of the government to parliament as a whole, particularly under Mr Keating, has turned the proceedings of the other place into a farce. I have to say the gall of the Labor Party never ceases to amaze me in that a senior member can stand up with a straight face and talk about the governments commitment to parliamentary reform.The government has made a large number of efforts to make changes in relation to the Senate, some of which I have welcomed. Although at the start I was somewhat cautious about the changes to the estimates committee arrangements, I think they are working well. I do not know whether that is your view, Madam Acting Deputy President, but it seems to me that, at least in some areas, the ability to have ministers and public servants back to question them is a plus, although I do not welcome some other restrictions in that area.If honourable senators look at the so-called reforms that have been brought in, they will note certain things. We have limits on second reading speeches. We have had fewer questions at question time in this chamber under the Hawke and Keating governments than in any other period for which we have been able to calculate the number of questions, so the scrutiny which occurs at question time has been reduced.We have had more use made of the guillotine by this government than by any other government since federation. The figures show an enormous use of the guillotine in both houses of parliament over the life of the Labor government. From 1901 to 1982, for example, only 208 bills had been subject to the guillotine in the other place. Since 1983—since the Labor government came to office—over 600 bills have been guillotined through the House of Representatives. In the Senate we have seen equally constant use of the guillotine at the end of sessions. It is regrettable that the minor parties, particularly the Democrats, have cooperated with the government in the use of that guillotine.Senator Faulkner said that—I think with the general good wishes of people—a whole new arrangement has been brought in and that this government will now make sure that its legislative program is carefully ordered and done in a way which will give plenty of time for scrutiny by both houses of parliament. We welcome that. That is an interesting commitment, but nothing in these arrangements requires that. We have to say, in fairness, that the governments record over a long period now has been quite the reverse. In fact, this government has very poorly ordered its program. It has deliberately kept controversial bills till the last moment so that they can be rammed through the parliament.Apparently the leopard has changed its spots, or the zebra has changed its stripes, and we are going to see a whole new world opened up as one of the trade-offs for these restrictions which are being placed on the opposition. I think Senator Teague would agree with me that nothing in these arrangements requires that. So we have a government, whose record has been appalling, now saying that these new arrangements, which in many ways restrict the options of people on our side of the chamber to make comments, are the trade-off. We wait in hope to see how Senator Faulkner and his colleagues deliver.I would like to raise with this chamber a couple of other points which go back to the philosophy of what this chamber is really about. I would have thought the thing that would have guided most senators—certainly those not on the government side—is the need to increase the opportunities for government accountability. One of the big dilemmas in modern society and in the law-making arrangements is the total domination of the parliament by the executive. The question is: how can we really return parliament to its proper role of making the government, making the executive, more accountable? If we were to wind back the advantages and privileges groups have, that process would, of course, inevitably be painful. I never cease to be surprised that it seems to be so difficult in this chamber to encourage the Democrats and sometimes the Greens to join with us to bring in arrangements and procedures which force greater accountability on the government and increase the opportunities for non-government senators to question the government.One of our proposals is to increase the number of questions to government ministers in question time. That is not a very controversial proposal. If the question were asked, `Should government ministers answer more questions than they do?, I think people would generally say that it was a good idea and that we could have some shorter answers. When we add to that argument the fact that, where statistics are available, on average 28 to 30 questions a day have been answered by other governments in the past, is it not reasonable in this place to require government ministers to match those numbers of questions?This procedure sets a minimum number of 28 questions in question time. The current arrangement delivers to us about 23 questions on average in question time compared with 22 questions over the previous years of the Labor government. All these changes that have been brought into question time have delivered, at the most, one extra question a day. Under my proposal—and I have received this advice from the Clerk—the Democrats would receive one extra question a day, making a total of three. At present they receive two on average. My proposal would increase the capacity of the Democrats—and, indeed, the Greens and Senator Harradine—to ask more questions. It is fully in line with established precedent in this chamber on the numbers of questions which can reasonably be asked. It would advantage the Democrats, the Greens and the Independents. I listened carefully to Senator Bourne but I did not detect any comment from her on this particular matter. I certainly hope that she and her colleagues will join with us.Another issue on which I had hoped to hear Senator Bourne speak was that of taking note of the answer. The trade-off proposed in one of the amendments moved by Senator Hill would be that if the hour allowed for a matter of public importance motion were not used on a particular day, the 30 minutes given for taking note of an answer could be extended to an hour. That would be a very constructive proposal and would save half an hour as against the proposed arrangements, which give a total of an hour and a half. Under our proposal, if we decided to forgo the matter of public importance, the total amount of time taken up would be 60 minutes. Thus we would be saving time and we would see that as a valid trade-off to increase the flexibility that senators may have. On some days taking note of answers might be seen to be a priority and would give more senators a chance to contribute to a wider range of issues. I believe that is a very reasonable proposal and I had hoped that we might have had some comment from Senator Bourne on that matter. I may be wrong, but my memory is that she did not address that particular issue.I do not know whether the Australian Democrats and the Greens see the general philosophy which should underlie all changes in this chamber as being to increase government accountability and increase pressure on the government to explain what it is doing. It is a pity that in so many areas we have not enjoyed support from them for arrangements which are reasonable and moderate and which would put increased pressure on the government. I note Senator Bourne said that the Democrats were keen to look closely at the issue of chairmen of committees. That is an important initiative and we certainly hope that it will receive the support of the Democrats. In the recent debate that we had relating to the President and Deputy President, I think Senator Bourne said that the Democrats did not feel it was appropriate that one party should hold both posts. Equally, the same argument applies to chairmen of committees; it is not appropriate that one party—the government party—should hold all the chairs of the legislative and standing committees. I certainly hope that we can make some important changes and reforms in that area.Sitting suspended from 12.45 to 2.00 p.m.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/debate.sub1/debate.sub2/speech[5]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

101,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COOK","RF4","WA","ALP","N/A",194,"—I accept the interjection from the back of the chamber, which is an implicit acknowledgment that the comments of the Treasurer accurately reflect the situation.The result of consistently good economic figures over the last 12 months is that the outlook now is for higher economic activity and employment, with lower inflation and a lower current account deficit. The revised forecasts reflect the recent spate of good economic news that we have all read across a range of areas, including job vacancies, interest rates, employment, inflation, business and consumer confidence, and retail sales.The GDP growth is now expected to average 3.5 per cent in 1993-94, up from the forecast at budget time of 2.75 per cent. The rate of growth is well above almost every other OECD economy. In fact, while we are now talking about 3.5 per cent, the OECD economies were only at 1.1 per cent on average in 1993. The government is confident that we will see GDP growth of around four per cent during the next financial year.Importantly, on the employment front 116,000 jobs have already been created this financial year, exceeding the forecast made last budget time. We can now expect employment to grow by 200,000 jobs this financial year. It is evident that the improving consumer and business confidence in the economy is having the effect of attracting discouraged workers back to the work force, meaning that the participation rate increases, and unemployment will not be reduced greatly this year. This government has always taken the view that economic growth alone is not the way to deal with employment, and because of the problems of the long-term unemployed the government has embarked on a green paper to deal with policies in this area.The growth is underpinned also by the lowest inflation rate in 30 years. For the year as a whole, inflation will be around two per cent. Inflationary expectations are very low—the National Australia Bank survey suggests that 80 per cent of business believes that Australia can maintain an inflation rate below four per cent over the whole of the decade. Interest rates are at a 20-year low; international competitiveness is at its best level for 20 years; industrial disputes are at the lowest level since the mid-1960s; and productivity is increasing substantially. The current account deficit is also expected to be lower, coming in at four per cent of GDP rather than 4.25 per cent as previously forecast.These figures show faster recovery and greater growth at the leading level of the OECD at the same time as low inflation. The lift in business confidence, which has also continued to improve in recent surveys, augurs well for business investment, which is expected to continue to accelerate in 1993-94, with an even more rapid growth anticipated for 1994-95.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[2]/answer/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

I checked the circumstances in which the cheque was paid, given that the authorisation was not formally recorded. My understanding is that for officeholders, government and opposition, the departments general operating premise has been that, if a form is signed by a senior office staff member of a minister or opposition officeholder properly authorised to exercise staff delegation, we have honoured it and acted in that way.It is not my view, following on the existing circumstances, that that process can continue.

The ongoing civil conflict in Afghanistan is obviously continuing to quite fundamentally disrupt efforts to establish a political process that would lead to a genuinely representative government and some hope of peace and stability for that benighted country.Australia urges all parties to implement cease-fire arrangements to negotiate a peaceful settlement to the conflict and to renew their commitment to the political process agreed to by them in 1993 under the Islamabad and Jalalabad accords. These accords pave the way for democratic elections and the formation of a viable government which would represent the interests of all Afghans.We continue to play not an up-front but a supporting role in support of international efforts to promote a peaceful solution to the Afghan conflict. We are also playing, I believe, a not insignificant role in the provisions of assistance to those affected.

115,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator FAULKNER","5K4","NSW","ALP","N/A",196,"—The New South Wales bushfires in January 1994 involved for the first time ever a truly national response to a bushfire situation. In addition to the magnificent assistance provided by the states and territories and by volunteers, the Commonwealth provided significant assistance through Emergency Management Australia, the Commonwealth agency charged with coordination of physical assistance in emergencies.The first official New South Wales request for Commonwealth assistance was made on 5 January and at that time Australian Defence Force elements had already been placed on stand-by to assist in anticipation of any request from New South Wales. Subsequent requests ranged in complexity from a new gearbox for an ex-army truck for use as a fire fighting appliance to all available ADF helicopters. The requests were met by the Australian Defence Force because no other Commonwealth department or agency has sufficient resources.At the height of the Commonwealth involvement there were more than 450 defence personnel actually on the fire grounds with appropriate and significant tanker, bulldozer and heavy plant support. Thirty-one helicopters were deployed from bases at Nowra, Canberra, Oakey and Townsville. All these resources had at least the equivalent personnel backup.HMAS Nirimba and RAAF Richmond base hospital were utilised as evacuation centres for hundreds of frail and disabled people who were evacuated from Sydney suburbs. RAAF Richmond acted as the base for 31 defence helicopters and up to 46 civilian aircraft on firefighting tasks in the Blue Mountains. A RAAF Boeing 707 and Hercules aircraft transported more than 1,200 interstate firefighters and 12.5 tonnes of equipment to and from Tasmania, Queensland, South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia. In all, some 2,000 defence personnel were involved in assisting New South Wales. Other personnel and their equipment were on stand-by in case they were needed. All this activity, of course, occurred at a time when much of the Defence Force was on leave.In addition to personnel recalled from leave, many others returned voluntarily, even before the first request for Commonwealth assistance was received. I want to place on record the Commonwealth governments appreciation of the tremendous job that was done by the Defence Force personnel in assisting during this New South Wales bushfire crisis.In relation to the other part of Senator Wests question, I inform the Senate that Lady Davidson Hospital in Sydneys north was successfully evacuated in the face of possible fire threat. Patients were transferred to Concord hospital for 24 hours. Lady Davidson Hospital also assisted in the evacuation of the fire-damaged RSL war veterans home in Narrabeen. It is appropriate to express thanks to all staff who were involved. Many of them worked extra hours in this emergency at a time when they were rostered on leave.I am also aware that the veteran community was very pleased that its strong relationship with Concord Repatriation Hospital continued during this period, although it is now under state administration. I went to Lady Davidson and the war veterans homes and I was really impressed by the role the staff had played and the resilience of the residents in both those establishments. The job was well done by all.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[6]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Senator Reynolds asked a question about the symposium being held in Berlin on the Australian and German experiences on immigration and multiculturalism. I thank her for the question.The Senate will recall that late last year I informed this place that plans were under way for a symposium which would not only compare immigration and multiculturalism in Germany and Australia but also offer Australia a welcome opportunity to showcase our policies in Europe and these particular areas. I am pleased to say that the two-day symposium is being held in Berlin tomorrow and in Potsdam on Friday, 4 February. It has generated a great deal of interest in the German community as well as amongst the European-based Australian media.The symposium is to be called the Australia Day symposium. In terms of the German interest in the forum there will be at least 120 people attending. The German speakers will include Brandenburgs minister for the interior, Mr Alwin Ziel, the Berlin commissioner for foreigners, Frau Barbara John, and representatives of Germanys Turkish, Polish and Jewish communities.On the Australian side, we are taking this symposium seriously. Papers will be presented by the director of the Bureau of Immigration, Population and Research, the Australian ambassador, Mr John Bowan, and the first assistant secretary of my department, Mr Des Storer.Presentations are intended to give an overview of our migration policy in Australia, the merits of planned migration programs, migrant settlement services, citizenship and our development as a multicultural nation.I am pleased to say that there is growing interest in Europe in Australias experiences in these areas. This symposium is very much a follow up to the official visit I took to Europe last year, particularly to Germany where interest in our experiences, the way we plan our migration program, the way that we develop our policies and our settlement programs are of great concern to people in that part of the world.Many European countries are grappling with large scale population movements and their effects on the local communities. Australia has been recognised as a leader-pacesetter with much to offer from our experience in this regard. In Germany particularly our experience in multiculturalism in the migration area is something that has been viewed by people in Berlin as an experience worth looking at.Meetings such as this can only help to enhance our international standing, contribute to a better understanding of what we are about and provide great lessons to countries in Europe which are now grappling with mass migration.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[8]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In warming up, I was making the point that every time Senator Baume comes up with a new piece of piggery nonsense—a new piece of piggery jokery, if you like—it is important to understand the context in which he does it and how often he has been dead wrong in the past.What I said yesterday, and I say again, is that Mr Keating has not been involved in the day-to-day management of that company. He has not been involved in the financial management. He is not now, and never has been, a director of the company. He is not now, and never has been, personally responsible, in any way, for the submission of financial returns that bear upon that company.The issue that Senator Baume raised yesterday is yet another example of a wild goose chase deliberately pursued in an atmosphere of smear and innuendo which has no substance whatsoever. If he wants an answer to the issue he raised yesterday, I am perfectly happy to give him one now. The answer is very straightforward and very direct. The issue that Senator Baume raised yesterday relates to the accounts for the company Brown and Hatton for the period 1990 to 1991. It was a proprietary company at the time those accounts were submitted. The return was submitted by the then director shareholders, Mr Brown and Mr Hatton, on the basis of its being a proprietary company. In fact, that was a technical error because, as has been readily acknowledged, for 11 months of that financial year the company was a public, but unlisted, company—with only two shareholders, true, but, nonetheless, technically a public unlisted company.Accordingly, the returns should have been put in on a different basis, an audited basis, and having regard to certain specific principles of accountancy—in particular, that subordinated capital not be treated as shareholders equity. That was one of the issues that was raised with the company as to the terms of that submission. That was corrected. That should be, and is, the end of the matter. There was no issue of public interest involved because at all relevant times the company had simply two shareholders and two directors—the same people. It was not, in any relevant sense, a matter of public interest that the accounts be written in any other way than the way they were. It was a technical error. It was corrected. Big deal! That is the issue Senator Baume has been on about for the last 12 or 18 months or so and it is a fizzer; it is a squib; it is an irrelevance like every other issue that he has raised in this context. He is scratching the bottom of the barrel and he has done nothing except get his fingers greasy.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[9]/answer[1]/talk.start[4]/para","N/A","N/A"

However much we might like to be able to clear the air on this occasion, our position has to be that the Australian government simply will not comment on these substantive allegations.

As to this, I simply say that while the ASIS allegations were among a number of issues discussed during a meeting very recently between Australias High Commissioner in Kuala Lumpur and the Foreign Minister, Abdullah Badawi, the High Commissioner did not go beyond our standard position, and I have nothing further to add in this respect to what I have said today.As to the third part of the question, whatever the difficulties that might have afflicted our relationship from time to time, I do not accept that Australias relationship with Malaysia is now a strained one. The government very warmly welcomed the Malaysian cabinets decision on 11 December last year to regard as closed the controversy which occurred in November and December last year. Malaysian ministers have announced the retraction of all measures against Australia that were imposed during those difficulties. The subsequent public assurance by Malaysias Deputy Prime Minister, Anwar Ibrahim, that there would be no residual impact on Australian companies was very encouraging. Most Australian businesses with which we have been in contact have expressed the view that the commercial environment is quickly returning to normal, and the government shares that view. Might I say again, as we did last year, that the Australian government values very highly Australias relationship with Malaysia, which has been very longstanding, very substantial and very constructive, and we look forward to developing it further.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[10]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I refer to the $49,000 awarded to the Eastern Suburbs Cricket Club of Maitland under Mrs Kellys sports rorts funds. As the club has been unsuccessful in its funding application for six years, could the minister explain why its grant was suddenly given by Mrs Kelly just before the last election? Could the minister also explain why no development application or building application was carried out before the grant was awarded to the club? Is Maitland likely to retain the money now that it has been discovered that the development site of the club facilities is heavily contaminated with toxic tar? Given that Mrs Kelly has said that she discussed with her staff all 2,000 projects awarded grants without there being any paperwork, on what basis did she make her decision to award the grant to this cricket club, given that the project did not have a DA or a BA and is now unlikely to be approved by the Environmental Protection Authority or the local council?","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[11]/question[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It had not, as yet, been drawn to my attention, but I am glad that it has and I congratulate the club on its persistence over the course of six years and its eventual success. I am sure that the people of Maitland will enjoy whatever amenity is to be built as a result of the receipt of $49,000.I shall ask Mrs Kelly for some explanation as to why this particular club was selected. I have some experience in these matters, having once been the responsible minister, and I do know that in this case Mrs Kelly looked at 2,800 applications. As I recall, 726 were actually granted.What inevitably happens on these occasions is that people try very hard to get up time and again. Some eventually break through and get their guernsey. I do not think it is appropriate for Senator Tierney, as he is almost a local, to pick upon Maitland and those who support sport in the area. I support Maitland.

I am able to announce today that Aspect Computing Pty Ltd, through its South Australian office, has been awarded a contract of nearly $3 million for its part in providing equipment for the joint Australian-United Kingdom space sea temperature probe. Senator Kernot raised questions before about the governments interest in industries connected with the environment. This project is an industry outcome for monitoring the temperature levels of the oceans and is part of a worldwide initiative. We are getting the best combination of good Australian industry doing good work for a worldwide environmental program measuring the temperatures of the worlds oceans.This equipment will be on the European ENVISAT spacecraft launched in 1998, for which Australia will provide over one-third of the equipment, totalling all up $12 million. It proves that Australian industry is now at the world edge in providing up-to-date equipment for satellites in competition with companies from all over the world. It is a real feather in the cap of Australian industry to win the contract to provide this equipment. In particular, I am proud that it is a company based in South Australia.Although those opposite are not particularly interested, it is another step forward in developing an effective space program for Australia. As I said before, it aligns with what a report of the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure recommended three years ago about developing a space industry capacity in this country. This is one of the outcomes of that report, which was unanimous. Those opposite who are laughing ought to realise that three years ago they signed the report and accepted the recommendations of the Senate committee. The government is now carrying out those recommendations and getting an upgraded space program going in Australia.

Would the minister be able to inform the Senate whether Australian studies have produced similar findings?","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[14]/question/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
165,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator RICHARDSON","4E4","NSW","ALP","N/A",204,"—Obviously, if one chooses to smoke, the risk of developing cancer must be higher. Given the number of cancers that can be caused, be they cancers of the lung, oral cavity, larynx, stomach—virtually everywhere—people must understand that they run risks. Australian evidence has not linked colon-rectal cancer to smoking, but there has been a study in the United States which claims to have established this connection. As far as I know there are two studies, involving more than 150,000 people, showing that cigarette smoking can lead to colon cancer in both men and women. The parallel studies to be published tomorrow in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute also found that early smoking apparently fixes for life the risk of colon-rectal cancer, even if the smoking habit is later dropped.For example, if people smoke in their 20s, the risk stays with them. Even if they stop at the age of 40, they will still be at greater risk. The studies also show that the risk is dose related; so the more you smoke, the more you risk. That is pretty good news for a few of my colleagues sitting around this chamber!We know that tobacco is the major cause of preventable drug-related deaths in Australia and that around 18,000 deaths are connected to smoking every year. These health effects of tobacco consumption warrant the commitment this government has to minimising the harm caused to people by cigarette smoke. Through the national drug strategy the Commonwealth government will continue to work with state and territory governments to reduce premature death and illness associated with tobacco use. It would be helpful if, in that process, the Victorian government were to at least honour the agreement that all states and the Commonwealth had come to earlier last year to have a national agreement on what can be advertised on cigarette packs. We will have to continue to take measures.

180,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MICHAEL BAUME","LE4","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A",207,"—by leave—I move:That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) to a question without notice asked by Senator Michael Baume this day, relating to the Prime Ministers ivestment in a piggery.The supplementary part of my question asked Senator Gareth Evans to give an unequivocal assurance that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), either as Treasurer or Prime Minister, had not been involved in any negotiations or dealings whatsoever—including with Danish government members or officials—in relation to the piggery project. That is a very simple question: has he or has he not as Treasurer or Prime Minister been involved other than at arms length or as a passive investor?The reason for the question is that Mr Constantinidis was the first person to publicly state that the Prime Minister was heavily involved in the operations of the company, at least to the extent of its negotiations with the Danes. We know that negotiations with the Danes went on for a very long time—in fact, longer than that for which the Prime Minister was on the back bench. That is on the record. So when Senator Evans tells the chamber that everyone knew that the Prime Minister was negotiating, he was in fact misleading this parliament because that is simply not true. At no stage was this parliament told, nor did it appear in print, that the Prime Minister was heavily involved during his period on the back bench in negotiations with the Danes.It is intriguing that neither the Prime Minister nor his ministers—nor his minions as they scurry up and down the press gallery, spreading poison and terrorising the gallery into not running any material about this issue—at any stage suggested that the Prime Ministers involvement with the business was other than at arms length. Certainly, that was the impression that Senator Evans falsely presented today. Senator Evans responded that it was an arms length exercise and always had been. He did not qualify that by adding that that was in terms of the accounts. In fact—to quote one of many examples—when asked about his pigs on radio 6WF in Perth on 30 June 1992, the Prime Minister said:Mine is really just a passive investment.It is either a passive investment or it is not. If at any stage he has been heavily involved in negotiations on behalf of this company, we are entitled to know that he did not really mean that it was only a passive investment but that it has been a very active investment.They are all now starting to admit the absolute correctness of the bulk of the points I have been making—firstly, of course, about the accounts, a matter I have been pursuing for 99 per cent of my time since raising this matter in this place. They are admitting that there was an error, and they have been forced to admit that the Prime Minister has not at all times had an arms length relationship with this company and at all times been a passive investor.We have asked a simple question. That question is: in view of the fact that the Prime Minister is now known to have been involved in detailed, heavy negotiation with the Danes, will we get an unequivocal assurance that when he was Treasurer—in other words, when he first acquired his interest in this venture—or when he was Prime Minister, he was not involved in any such negotiations.The question hangs in the air: why should the Prime Minister enter into an investment in a company which was losing multimillions of dollars—that is, according to the correct accounts—unless he knew there was a prospect of some venture like the Danish one coming good? It was the only reason the company was worth that sort of investment. We want an assurance that he had not been involved in any undertakings.

The question which was raised today—and I differ from the interpretation of the President on this—I thought was very straightforward and specific. I am sorry the President is not in the chair. I would like the President, if someone could bring it to his attention, to look very carefully at the question Senator Baume asked Senator Gareth Evans. It was a very specific question. It did not travel far and wide. Therefore it did not provide the room for Senator Evans to attempt to skate as he did. It was quite correct that points of order were taken against Senator Evans to try to get him to address the specific question. I ask that the President of the Senate, who made a ruling and a comment on Senator Baumes question, look closely at it because I believe that the comment he made was not justified.The other element is that a clear tactic is being adopted by Senator Evans. Every time Senator Baume speaks he cops an enormous tirade of abuse. Three years ago when we were new in the chamber and Senator Evans had been here a long time we were impressed by this tirade of abuse. We remember that every time my colleague Senator Campbell asked about Brian Burke, Senator Evans used to heap enormous amounts of abuse on Senator Campbell. That stopped when Brian Burke was charged, but Senator Evans was never prepared to inquire into the specific matters of the question and kept very clear of it. He resorted to the tactic of abuse. In relation to the Marshall Islands, the same tactic was adopted by Senator Evans. Specific questions were asked. Those who had the temerity to ask them always copped a verballing from him. I put it to Senator Evans and the chamber that we are getting the same tactic on some very valid questions about Mr Keatings business interests.Over a long period the Labor Party has not been loath to question people on this side of the chamber about their business interests. Senator Evans has led the charge on this on a number of occasions. There is public interest in these matters. Where sensible and reasonable questions are being asked in this chamber we are entitled to sensible and moderate responses from Senator Evans. The point I wish to make is that we have seen this tactic of abuse before, when public interest and accountability demand some considered replies to the very valid and important questions Senator Baume was asking.","N/A","ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/debate.sub1[3]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
182,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CRANE","UW4","(Western Australia)","LP","N/A",209,"—As a result of the failure of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) to respond to the addresses we have just heard from Senator Baume and Senator Kemp, a whole series of other questions are raised. Today we heard one of Senator Evanss tirades, which he goes on with from time to time when he finds the question a little difficult or a little unsavoury in his terms. Comments made in the Independent Monthly by Mr L. Constantinidis reopen areas discussed in estimates committees. That whole area is open once again. It is time that we got some straight factual answers.The Independent Monthly stated that it was predominantly during the long hard negotiations, essentially presenting the concept, negotiating it down and documenting it with the Danes. The question to be asked—this has been raised by Senator Baume and has not been satisfactorily answered, in my view—is whether or not any of this negotiating was done at the time Mr Keating was Treasurer or later on when he was Prime Minister. It also opens up questions in regard to those letters to the Pork Producers Federation, which we dealt with with AQIS. If I remember correctly, references were made in those letters to an involvement by the Prime Minister at that time, and to the involvement of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy with regard to the piggery, the import of pig semen and pig products, and a number of other related matters. This would have been an opportunity for the Leader of the Government in the Senate to answer that very precise question that was put today. It was not a broad, wide-ranging, sticky question.","N/A","ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/debate.sub1[3]/speech[3]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

Until such time as we get a clear answer to that question, this matter must be pursued. The other aspects I have raised must also be pursued.

185,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator TIERNEY","O15","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A",209,"—by leave—I move:That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) to a question without notice asked by Senator Tierney this day, relating to the allocation of sports funding.Over the last few months the sports rorts affair has unravelled more and more as cases have come to light around Australia of the absurd allocation of taxpayers money to the extent of $30 million. There was the case in East Maitland of a cricket club which had as one of its main contenders Mr Tony Keating, who is an aspirant to the seat of Maitland. The sheer incompetence of the application put forward by his club is only now really coming out. The club had applied for the money for six years. One could ask why it was constantly knocked back for six years and why, suddenly, it was granted just before the last March election? It was obviously granted because it was part of Minister Kellys pork-barrelling exercise around New South Wales, in particular in the marginal seats, Paterson being the most marginal of all.The sheer incompetence of the way in which this money was handed out is only now coming to light in the local newspapers. In the Maitland Mercury last week these headlines appeared: `Delay could cost big grant—Toxic tar fear hits cricketers; `Contamination scare; `Council may seek land test compo.What has come out of this—and it is particularly important in light of what Minister Kelly has just admitted about the paperwork, or lack of it, on this matter—is that, before $49,000 in public money was handed out, there was no testing at all of the worthiness of this proposal. All they had was an open ground, a ground that had formerly been a gas works site. What has now come to light is that there is an enormous amount of toxic tar on this site. Because of the delay caused by the environmental problems and the rather curious fact that there was no development application or building application, this has created terrific delays. It seems that what will happen is that Maitland will lose this money.This afternoon the minister, in a rather silly way, was trying to make out that it was good that Maitland had got the money. The whole point is that, as the headlines have said, the delay could cost the grant. Maitland will probably not get the money. We have had the absurd spectacle in the local region of Bob Horne, the local member, proudly boasting, `I will pork-barrel for my area. I will get anything I can for my area, which totally misses the point. The point is that we should try to get money for our area, but that money should go to worthwhile and sound projects that have gone through the proper procedures. Through the silly actions and sheer incompetence of Bob Horne and his staffer Tony Keating, the pretender for the seat of Maitland, they are going to lose a grant for this city. I challenge Mr Horne and Mr Keating to defend this action in light of the way they have incompetently handled this grant.I also challenge Minister Kelly to tell the parliament how much consideration she gave to this grant. Picture the scene: it is before the 1993 election. Everyone is rushing around electioneering. Two thousand applications for sports grants arrive on Minister Kellys desk. Is she seriously asking the parliament to believe that she considered all these sports grants in detail? Is she seriously asking us to believe that she could even do that without any paperwork? It is blatantly obvious that without a DA, a BA and environmental approval there was no paperwork. I think this is yet another example of the incompetence of this government, this minister and local members in the Hunter Valley.Question resolved in the affirmative.","N/A","ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/debate.sub1[4]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
186,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,"The DEPUTY PRESIDENT",10000,"N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","—Pursuant to the resolution of the Senate of 13 February 1991, I present the governments response to the report of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs on validation of CAM and SAM funding of nursing homes which was presented to the President on 23 December 1993. With the concurrence of the Senate, the response will be incorporated in Hansard .The response read as follows—PRELIMINARY REPORT OF THE SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON COMMUNITY AFFAIRS—VALIDATION OF CAM AND SAM FUNDING OF NURSING HOMESGOVERNMENT RESPONSE1. Background1.1 The Senate referred the validation program to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs on 30 September 1993.1.2 The specific terms of reference for the Committees inquiry were:(a)the timeliness of validations;(b)the consistency of decisions made by Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services validation teams;(c)miscalculations of negative loading made by validation teams;(d)the retrospective application of reinterpretations and redefinitions of the financial principles;(e)the impact of validations on the continued financial viability of nursing homes;(f)new proprietors being made financially liable for CAM and SAM funding spent prior to their purchase of a nursing home;and to ascertain whether a further inquiry is warranted.1.3 In the context of these terms of reference the following points need to be kept under consideration. The first is the nature and purpose of the validation program. As an audit program it plays two primary roles. The first is to ensure that $1.1 billion of the nursing home budget, which is provided specifically for nursing and personal care of residents, is expended in the provision of this care. The program also ensures the integrity of expenditure of taxpayers funds and thus fulfils obligations within the framework of audit responsibilities placed on the Department by the Parliament and the Government.1.4 The second issue is that the validation program is decentralised in its administration. Operating with 50 field staff working out of 8 State Offices in a complex area it is not unreasonable to expect that there will be some errors. Where there are complaints, these are examined and rectified. The number of complaints received by the Department, including those presented to the Committee, are not considered substantial for a program of this size and complexity. Nonetheless, the Government remains absolutely committed to the integrity of administration and fulfilling its commitments under the National Health Act, the Audit Act and under administrative law.1.5 Thirdly, there has been substantial improvement to the legislative base of the program. From December 1992 proprietors selling nursing homes must give 90 days notice to give the Department enough time to validate and for a financial settlement to be finalised prior to the completion of the sale. On 1 July 1993 debt recovery provisions came into effect. These provisions provide a mechanism for the vendor of a nursing home to provide for any liability to the Commonwealth out of the sale price of the home, which is held in trust while the validation is completed. These provisions also require the Department to complete validations within three years of the end of a financial year from 1993-94 onwards. In addition to these provisions, a bill is before Parliament that will enable recovery of monies owing to the Commonwealth from a vendor of a nursing home at time of sale for benefit paid in financial years prior to 1 July 1993.2. Current Review and Development of the Nursing Home Program2.1 The nursing home program is currently under examination by a number of review processes and these should be considered by the Committee in any further examination of the validation program.2.2 The Nursing Home Consultative Committee, chaired by Sir William Keys, is examining the outcomes of a number of reviews that have recently been completed and will recommend to the Minister on these issues. In this regard the report by Professor Gregory on the Structure of Nursing Home Funding is particularly relevant. This report addresses a number of issues related to nursing home funding that have been referred to the Senate Standing Committee. These include:administration of the boundary issues between CAM and SAM and the need to ensure that funds provided for resident care are used for that care;the issues surrounding the validation of nursing home expenditure and the possibility of expanding risk management techniques2.3 The Ombudsman is investigating complaints about the nursing home program a number of which are about the validation program. The Ombudsman is expected to report on her findings in February or March 1993. Some of the complaints relate to aspects of the Committees terms of reference and the Committee may wish to give consideration to the report.2.4 I have also asked the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) to examine the future directions I and the Keys Committee have been considering for the validation program as part of their current examination of aspects of the nursing home program and to provide advice on options for risk management that could be adopted.3. Responses to Specific Points Made by the Committee3.1 I note that the Committee has not concluded its considerations and has not drawn conclusions in relation to its terms of reference, instead noting the activity of the Ombudsman and the ANAO and proposing to keep a watching brief until April 1994. Nonetheless in relation to a number of the Committees summary of possible issues, I would draw the Committees attention to aspects of my Departments submission and make the following comment.3.2 Retrospectivity and delaysCommittee FindingThe Committee found that While retrospectivity is inevitable . . . it is possible that some validation processes have been delayed and that this is a concern and, possibly direct expense to the nursing home.ResponseConcerns about timeliness and retrospectivity are being addressed by accelerating the schedule of validations, completing 1986-87 validations by June 1994, and limiting time delay to three years. The provision of additional resources for validation in the 1990-91, 1991-92 and 1992-93 Budgets has allowed the backlog to be substantially reduced. Over the past three years, since the provision of additional resources, 2330 individual year validations have been completed covering 790 nursing homes and 8 financial years. Recoveries over the last three financial years have been $12.5m in 1990-91, $22m in 1991-92 and $20m in 1992-93. During the period 1 July 1993 to 31 October 1993, $2.5m has been recovered.Nonetheless it is not the case that time delays have caused financial loss to proprietors. Nursing homes have had the use of the funds on an interest free basis for a significant period of time. This would be to the financial advantage of nursing homes rather than be a direct expense.Further, claims of retrospective policy making results from the nature of the funding system that was initially established with CAM expenditure being defined on the basis of first principle. This first principle was clear and agreed between the Department and the industry organisations. The flexibility inherent in this approach allows some proprietors to test the limits of this flexibility by claiming that staff performing SAM duties were performing nursing and personal care duties. This leads to conflict because there is a strong profit motive for infrastructure or SAM costs to be claimed against care funding, or CAM. Under the legislation the Department has no option but to reject such duties, when claimed as CAM.3.3 Inconsistency in Decision MakingCommittee FindingThe Committee noted that from evidence available, it would appear that each instance would need to be examined separately to determine if situations were comparable. If the situations were not comparable, Departmental officers may have been quite consistent.ResponseThe Committee is correct in its comments. The cases provided in relation to claims of inconsistent decision making do not on examination sustain the concern that there is inconsistent decision making. Each case when examined displays integrity in decisions with the differences relating to the individual circumstances of the nursing home.Committee FindingThe Committee also commented that It is also possible that nursing homes are seeking to extend the boundaries of funding and allowable CAM duties or CAM/SAM crossover.ResponseSome nursing homes have sought to extend claims under the acquitable CAM component of the fee that are clearly non-nursing and personal care duties. Such activities ultimately lead to declining resident care and are proscribed under the legislation which the validation teams administer.3.4 Incorrect Information being GivenCommittee FindingThe Committee noted that . . . the question of inaccurate or misleading information is serious. The Committee would wish to determine what has occurred in these cases.ResponseWhere such instances occur appropriate action will be taken. However no evidence has been provided that supports the contention that the provision of misleading information is widespread or commonplace.3.5 Legislative changesCommittee FindingThe Committee commented that although changes to the legislation affecting sales of nursing homes would eliminate many concerns, . . . some major negative loadings appear to be linked to claims of lack of access to data, it is important that some form of data on financial operation of homes sold earlier be available..ResponseThe Committee findings are accepted and, subject to the provision of Section 135A of the National Health Act 1953 (the secrecy provision), the Department will facilitate access to information in those situations where it is of concern. In one case, raised by the relevant industry organisation, the Department is already in the process of facilitating access to such records which should be successful very quickly.3.6 Other legal issuesCommittee FindingThe Committee noted that Matters being investigated by the Ombudsman may include issues of appeals against administrative decisions, the operation of natural justice . . . and other matters not directly related to validation decision such as decisions regarding funding that are not appealable.ResponseThe program is administered under specific and comprehensive legislation. Should instances of denial of natural justice and lack of appeal rights be identified, then the legislation will need appropriate amendment by the Parliament.However the Committee should note that the recent amendments to the National Health Act have clear appeal provision to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) and also that a legislative review that is currently being undertaken in conjunction with the Australian Law Reform Commission will specifically address the issue of appeal rights.In addition, in response to the Administrative Review Council (ARC) review of administrative law provisions in the portfolio, my Department has supported an increase in appeal rights and access in appeal to AAT.3.7 Inappropriate judgements about funding levelsCommittee FindingThe Committee noted complaints that reasonable costs have not been allowed when records have not been available as the Department believes that this . . . could encourage poor record keeping.ResponseWhile good record keeping should be encouraged, this understates the concern that an incentive could be created for records to be mislaid where they show costs lower than that which would be allowed as a reasonable cost.Committee FindingThe Committee noted that there . . . may be grounds for recreating records or establish that residents were provided with appropriate levels of care in the past.ResponseIn some cases attempts have been made to recreate the records of a nursing home where these have been lost or destroyed. In such situations it is important to ensure that the funds were expended and the funds were necessarily expended in providing resident care. Provided that the recreated records can establish that funds were used in such a manner then the recreated records will be accepted and have always been accepted.3.8 Discrimination against some proprietorsCommittee FindingThe Committee noted that . . . any charges of discrimination and harassment of individual proprietors would need to be examined in some detail.ResponseAny complaints received will be taken seriously. However there is no evidence to suggest there has been such discrimination.3.9 Inconsistent use of the AFPCommittee FindingThe Committee has commented that there are complaints that the Department has requested the AFP to impound material. The Committee has indicated that it may . . . consider if there has been unnecessary use of the AFP in this matter, given that the Department has powers to access records in the first instance.ResponseThe Committee fails to note the comments in the Departmental submission on this matter. It can be unequivocally stated that the Department does not use the AFP for obtaining records for a validation.There are sufficient powers under the National Health Act for the Department to access records. Involvement of the AFP is in those instances where information becomes available that indicates there is possible fraudulent activity. In these cases the matter is referred to the AFP who take the steps necessary to investigate the matter at their own discretion. It should be noted that seizure of records can only occur under a duly authorised search warrant.3.10 Other investigations into validation and related mattersCommittee FindingThe Committee noted the inquiry by the Ombudsman of a number of complaints about the validation program and also that it is . . . possible that the ANAO may wish to examine validation as part of its work on the aged care program.ResponseThe Department has provided the Committee with its responses to the Ombudsman complaints and will continue to provide comprehensive responses to any further Ombudsman concerns. I have asked the Australian National Audit Office to consider examining the future directions of the validation program.4. Committee Conclusions4.1 I note that the Committee will maintain a watching brief on the program and will report to the Senate by April 1994. I would advise that the report of the Keys Committee into the recommendations of the Gregory, Braithwaite and Macri Reviews is likely to be available at this time. The Report of the Nursing Home Consultation Committee chaired by Sir William Keys, will cover matters being considered by the Committee. The Ombudsman is also expected to report on the cases that have been referred to her within this time frame.4.2 The Committee recommends that the Department provide access to information relating to a former proprietor where failure to do so would result in a denial of natural justice. The Department has already taken steps to facilitate access to documents where this has been possible. All cases where this has been a concern will be reviewed with a view to ensuring if possible that documents are available.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[1]/debate.sub2/proctext/interject/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
187,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,"The DEPUTY PRESIDENT",10000,"N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","—Pursuant to the resolution of the Senate of 13 February 1991, I present the Governments response to the report of the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts on the Australian environment and tourism which was presented to the President on 31 January 1994. With the concurrence of the Senate, the response will be incorporated in Hansard .Leave granted.The response read as follows—GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE REPORT BY THE SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENT, RECREATION AND THE ARTS ON THE AUSTRALIAN ENVIRONMENT AND TOURISMRECOMMENDATIONS:Recommendation 1:That the Bureau of Tourism Research and the Australian Bureau of Statistics employ an agreed set of definitions for statistics related to the tourism industry, and particularly seek a correlation between the ABS accommodation data and the data in the BTRs International Visitor Survey and the Domestic Tourism Monitor.Government Position: AcceptThe ABS is developing a Framework for Tourism Statistics for Australia to apply common concepts and definitions to the collection and publication of tourism statistics. The ABS is also developing an Australian Standard Classification of Visitor Accommodation. The BTR is cooperating with the ABS in both these exercises. When finalised, greater compatibility will apply to ABS, International Visitor Survey (IVS) and Domestic Tourism Monitor (DTM) accommodation data.Recommendation 2:That the ABS urge all collectors of tourism statistics to collect all data under the guidelines of the ABS Framework so as to allow the ABS to produce a standardised and comprehensive Directory of Tourism Statistics.Government Position: AcceptThe ABS produced a draft of the Framework in 1991 and has subsequently widely promoted its use. Upon its finalisation the ABS will encourage all statistical collectors to adopt standard methodologies, which will be reflected in the entries in future editions of the Directory of Tourism Statistics.Recommendation 3:That until a comprehensive and consistent Directory of Tourism Statistics is published, the ABS include an opening chapter for each edition of the Directory explaining its limitations.Government Position: AcceptRecommendation 4:That the BTR canvass with government authorities, practising economists and academics alternative economic models for net benefit analysis, and that the BTR be provided with additional resources to allow it to carry out additional research functions.Government Position: Under considerationA study of alternative economic models for net benefit analysis is consistent with both the BTR charter and its future priorities.A formal evaluation of the BTR was conducted in 1991-92 and this identified a number of priority areas for further activity by the BTR and the appropriate resource requirements. Since that time there has been some augmentation of BTR resources.The Governments review of the contribution of tourism to the economy, an initiative announced in the 1993-94 Budget, will assess net benefit aspects of inbound tourism. The review will be undertaken by the Department of Tourism in consultation with other relevant agencies.Recommendation at paragraph 3.21, page 47 (not included in the list of recommendations beginning at page xiii)That the Commonwealth Government request a BTR study into the costs and benefits of domestic tourism and outbound tourism and prepare a more comprehensive net benefit analysis of Australian tourism.Government Position: AcceptThe BTR conducted a Domestic Tourism Expenditure Survey during 1992. This will supply improved information for studying the economic impacts of domestic tourism.As a first step in the analysis of the data, the BTR has commissioned an input-output study, which is due for completion by the end of January 1994.ORANI modelling work has been carried out and further work using the updated data is planned, but timing will depend on funding and competing priorities.The Governments review of the contribution of tourism to the economy, an initiative announced in the 1993-94 Budget, will assess net benefit aspects of inbound tourism. The review will be undertaken by the Department of Tourism in consultation with other relevant agencies.Recommendation 5:(i) That the Commonwealth Government retain the responsibility for international marketing of Australia as a tourist destination.Government Position: Accept(ii) That the Australian Tourist Commission continue to perform that function on behalf of the Commonwealth.Government Position: Accept(iii) That sufficient funding be maintained to the Australian Tourist Commission to allow it to carry out its activities in order to achieve Government targets for inbound growth and the consequent economic yield from international tourism.Government Position: Under review, noting that this recommendation is in line with Government policy and that Australian Tourist Commission (ATC) funding is assessed against a range of factors, including: the achievement of visitor targets; alternative sources of funding; and competing Government priorities.The funding position for the ATC has changed significantly since 1986-87. Government funding of the ATC has increased by over 150% to $77.817 million in 1993-94.The Government encourages the ATC to supplement its appropriation by seeking tourism industry contributions to its international marketing programs. In 1993-94, $25.117 million is expected to be raised from State/Territory and industry sources.The Governments review of the contribution of tourism to the economy, announced in the 1993-94 Budget, will examine issues associated with both public and private sector funding of international tourism promotion.Recommendation 6:That section 7(e) of the Australian Tourist Commission Act 1987 requiring the Commission to `closely monitor and report the effects of international tourism on Australias natural environment and society be strengthened to require reports at least annually on those effects.Government Position: Under considerationThe ATC has conducted a study of the environmental and social impacts of international tourism. The study was completed in November 1993.Recommendation 7:That an investigation be carried out by the Tourism Ministers Council into State and Federal overseas tourism representation to evaluate whether the most cost-effective arrangements are in place, or whether a rationalisation is required.Government Position: RejectIn 1993-94 the Commonwealth Government provided $2 million to the ATC to supplement funding for Partnership Australia.Partnership Australia aims to better coordinate and channel the combined resources of the Commonwealth and the States and Territories to exert a more concentrated and effective influence on overseas marketing. To achieve this, the ATC has invited the States and Territories to cooperatively undertake specific marketing activities overseas under the banner of Partnership Australia.Recommendation 8:That a review of the Australian Tourist Commissions promotion and marketing be carried out to identify a program which will encourage international tourism to all Australian States.Government Position: Under considerationThe ATCs charter is to promote the image of Australia as a whole. The 1991 Evaluation of the ATCs Marketing Impact report confirmed that this objective was being met.The ATC works with all the States and Territories and the industry in cooperative marketing campaigns to assist them to attract more overseas visitors. The Partnership Australia initiative reinforces this commitment.The Governments review of the contribution of tourism to the economy, announced in the 1993-94 Budget, will also examine issues related to this recommendation.Recommendation 9:That empirical studies of the likely effects of developments on environmentally sensitive sites be commissioned by developers at the concept stage of a development.Government Position: Under considerationThe National Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development (NSESD), endorsed at the December 1992 Council of Australian Governments, calls on all spheres of government to develop and manage the tourism industry in a way that conserves its natural resource and built heritage base and minimises any negative environmental, social and cultural impacts.The Summary Report on the implementation of the NSESD has been forwarded to First Ministers for their consideration.The Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council (ANZECC) has established a working group to develop a national framework agreement on the administration of the environmental impact assessment (EIA) process which promotes early involvement of assessing agencies in project development. When finalised, the agreement will be submitted to the Council of Australian Governments for its endorsement. Draft guidelines and criteria, also prepared by the Working Group, were considered by ANZECC Ministers in May 1993 and subsequently referred to State and Territory Planning Ministers for comment.Recommendation 10:That projects likely to cause significant environmental scarring only receive development approval conditional upon an undertaking to renovate the area.Government Position: AcceptTourism projects that require Commonwealth approval and are expected to be environmentally significant fall within the scope of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. Assessment under the Act requires proponents to detail the likely environmental effects of projects.The National Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development (NSESD), endorsed at the December 1992 Council of Australian Governments, calls on all spheres of government to develop and manage the tourism industry in a way that conserves its natural resource and built heritage base and minimises any negative environmental, social and cultural impacts.The Summary Report on the implementation of the NSESD has been forwarded to First Ministers for their consideration.Recommendation 11:That there be environmental impact statements, including social and cultural impact statements, for all tourist developments unless there is a successful application to the relevant authority for exemption.Government Position: Under considerationEnvironmental impact assessments are carried out under Commonwealth procedures on proposals which require a Commonwealth decision and are environmentally significant. These assessments normally consider social issues.The Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment (IGAE) recognises the need for impact assessment to include social and cultural impacts.ANZECC has established a working group to develop a national framework agreement on the administration of the environmental impact assessment (EIA) process which promotes early involvement of assessing agencies in project development. When finalised, the agreement will be submitted to the Council of Australian Governments for its endorsement. Draft guidelines and criteria, also prepared by the Working Group, were considered by ANZECC Ministers in May 1993 and subsequently referred to State and Territory Planning Ministers for comment.Particular attention should be paid, where appropriate, to consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, consistent with the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Tourism Strategy being developed by the Department of Tourism and ATSIC.Recommendation 12:That before tourism developments are approved, provision be made for community consultation with the involvement of local government where appropriate.Government Position: AcceptThis is current practice for most development across all jurisdictions.Tourism projects that require Commonwealth approval and are expected to be environmentally significant fall within the scope of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. Assessment under the Act requires proponents to detail the likely environmental effects of projects.The recommendation is consistent with the National Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development which encourages community consultation.The Summary Report on the implementation of the NSESD has been forwarded to First Ministers for their consideration.Particular attention should be paid, where appropriate, to consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, consistent with the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Tourism Strategy being developed by the Department of Tourism and ATSIC.Recommendation 13:That the EPA become operational as a matter of urgency.Government Position: AcceptThe Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency (CEPA) has been established and is operational as an agency within the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories.Recommendation 14:That draft environmental guidelines for tourism developments be finalised by the Environmental Protection Agency by the end of 1992 for ratification at the earliest possible date under the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment.Government Position: Under considerationThe IGAE allows for national guidelines to be established through the proposed National Environment Protection Authority (NEPA). However the powers of NEPA are limited to those listed within the IGAE schedule and do not include any reference to guidelines for tourism projects. Several issues exist which require broad consideration across a number of Commonwealth bodies, and this process is currently under way.Recommendation 15:That joint ventures between Australian and foreign investors be encouraged.Government Position: AcceptForeign investment is vital to assist the timely development of high quality tourism facilities. In addition to capital, foreign investors provide operational experience and improved access to overseas source markets.Recommendation 16:That the FIRB develop clearer criteria to identify the impact of foreign investment and that foreign investment proposals be required to demonstrate the likely economic benefits they will provide.Government Position: RejectIn July 1986, the Government announced that the criterion of `not contrary to the national interest replace the `economic benefits test as the policy norm. The re-introduction of an economic benefits test would be seen as a significant tightening of policy and would be inconsistent with Recommendation 20.Recommendation 17:That the criteria for determining when an environmental impact statement is required be clarified.Government Position: RejectThe Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 (the Act) requires that proposals requiring a Commonwealth decision be referred for assessment if they are likely to affect the environment to a significant extent. CEPA provides advice and guidelines on environmental significance. The Administrative Procedures under the Act set down criteria for determining the need for an Environmental Impact Statement or Public Environment Report.The guidelines and criteria currently being developed by the ANZECC Working Group on National Environmental Impact Assessment, could also, when finalised, provide a basis for FIRB deliberations.Recommendation 18:That foreign investment proposals should be assessed against social impact criteria where appropriate.Government Position: RejectIt is recognised that social impacts may be taken into account as part of existing environmental impact assessment requirements.Recommendation 19:That the criteria against which the social impact of developments are measured be extended to State and local government requirements for EIS unless there is a successful application to the relevant authority for exemption.Government Position: Under considerationThe need for impact assessment to include social issues is recognised in the IGAE.ANZECC has established a working group to develop a national framework agreement on the administration of the environmental impact assessment (EIA) process which promotes early involvement of assessing agencies in project development. When finalised, the agreement will be submitted to the Council of Australian Governments for its endorsement. Draft guidelines and criteria, also prepared by the Working Group, were considered by ANZECC Ministers in May 1993 and subsequently referred to State and Territory Planning Ministers for comment.Recommendation 20:That, for foreign investment in the tourism industry, the liberalised policy on foreign investment since July 1986 be maintained.Government Position: AcceptRecommendation 21:That, for the purpose of advising the Treasurer on foreign investment proposals, the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) continue.Government Position: AcceptRecommendation 22:That to become more independent, the FIRB be restructured as follows:that the Board be comprised of permanent part-time members none of whom are selected from the Commonwealth bureaucracy;that the Board be served by a Secretariat; andthat the Board establish and maintain its own office.Government Position: RejectThe FIRB already provides independent advice to the Government. The exclusion of the Executive Member (the only Commonwealth officer on the FIRB) would remove the only link between the FIRB and the bureaucracy, which provides its executive services. The creation of a separate Secretariat for the FIRB is not warranted as it would duplicate services which are currently provided by the Foreign Investment Branch of the Treasury.Recommendation 23:That, with regard to foreign investment proposals, the Treasury documents be copied to the FIRB for its independent comment and advice direct to the Treasurer.Government Position: RejectThis would duplicate the current processes, add to examination costs and may result in delays to the process without providing any tangible benefit.Recommendation 24:That FIRB approval for foreign investment in new developments for the tourist industry be conditional upon a requirement to report progress on the development each six months from the date of approval until completion of the development.Government Position: RejectThis recommendation is inconsistent with Recommendation 20 and would impose additional regulatory costs on developers.Recommendation 25:That the FIRB maintain sufficient resources to monitor foreign investment proposals that have been approved and provide that information in its annual reports.Government Position: Accept, subject to preserving the confidentiality of individual proposalsConditional approvals are currently monitored. Aggregate information is currently provided in the FIRB annual report but, as proposals are examined in confidence, it is not appropriate to report on individual cases.Recommendation 26:That statistics concerning foreign investment proposals in tourism facilities from investors reports be provided to the ABS for subsequent publication (conjointly with the BTR).Government Position: RejectABS foreign investment data are based on different criteria from those used by the FIRB—the Boards figures are an aggregation of the proposals submitted for approval, along with expected associated expenditures, while those of the ABS are based on actual transactions that have occurred.Recommendation 27:That in complying with the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, the FIRB request social impact statements which include employment projections, time for completion and long term employment, where appropriate, in addition to environmental impact statements.Government Position: RejectSocial impacts are routinely taken into account when they are relevant to the assessment of proposals under the Administration Procedures of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. Employment issues are taken into account to the extent that they are relevant.Recommendation 28:That the FIRB ensure potential developments are based on market research.Government Position: RejectMost developments are based on extensive market research. To apply mandatory conditions would add to development costs and be inconsistent with Recommendation 20.Recommendation 29:That the Australian Standing Committee on Tourism include relevant advice from the Australian Local Government Association on significant issues referred to the Tourism Ministers Council.Government Position: AcceptAt the direction of the Tourism Ministers Council (TMC), ASCOT initiates consultations or responds to submissions on issues of relevance to the Council.Recommendation 30:That implementation of the National Tourism Strategy be expedited to achieve the most beneficial outcome for the tourist industry economically, environmentally and socially.Government Position: AcceptThe Department of Tourism published a status report in December 1993 reviewing the implementation of the National Tourism Strategy.Recommendation 31:That the Federal Minister for Transport and Communications establish a task force to report by the end of 1992 on national transport infrastructure needs given that international tourist numbers have been targeted to reach up to 6.5 million by the year 2000. That the Minister consult on this matter with the Australian Transport Advisory Council.Government Position: Under considerationSignificant improvements to Australias national transport infrastructure have been planned or are currently underway.The One Nation Statement, for example, provided additional funding for road and rail infrastructure, and introduced a range of aviation reforms.The Australian Transport Council (formerly ATAC) has established a National Transport Policy Framework Working Party which will, inter alia, examine the issues raised in this recommendation.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[2]/debate.sub2/proctext/interject/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

200,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator KEMP","WW4","(Victoria)","LP","N/A",219,"—Just before the siren sounded for lunch, I was making some comments on the proposals before the chamber. In the overall package we are, over a fortnight, increasing the number of hours that the Senate sits by roughly an hour and 10 minutes. So the overall changes do not increase to any great extent the actual hours that the Senate sits. The major changes relate to restrictions on the capacity of non-government senators to raise matters of concern. In other words, in the reordering of business that has occurred the government has come out, in terms of its program, a clear winner and the opposition has had restrictions placed on the times during which it has the capacity to raise issues of concern and its priorities.This is not the first time that we have seen this. In recent years, while I have been a member of the chamber, there has been a long succession of restrictions placed on the capacity of non-government senators to raise matters of concern. Senator Woodley would remember the debate that we had on reducing speeches during second reading stage debates from 30 minutes to 20 minutes. We have had fewer questions in question time compared with what happened under previous governments.There has been very extensive use of the guillotine in this chamber to put bills through. The statistics on that are most interesting and I am happy to bring them to Senator Woodleys attention. This government has been prepared to use the guillotine far more than previous governments. The statistics are quite extraordinary. The reality is that, in this chamber, the government can use that procedure only with the support, typically, of the minor parties. I think that is a pity. The willingness to use the guillotine has encouraged the government to bunch its program towards the end of the sittings.I think it is accurate to say there have been fewer sitting days. There has been a change—to the great advantage of government—to restrict the size of quorums. That again was supported by the minor parties. Quorums are sometimes a useful procedure in controlling and disciplining this chamber, and both parties have used them. Unfortunately, as a result of the change to quorum procedures there is less pressure on the government. In recent years restrictions have been imposed on the taking note of answers to questions and a time limit imposed. That is a pity because that was one of the more constructive procedures in this chamber. There has been a reduction in the number of legislative standing committees. That, again, is clearly to the advantage of the government and again it restricts the capacity of non-government senators.Overall, I do not say that there have not been a few gains, but I believe there has been a tendency, where a procedure is being used effectively, for the government to start to feel the pressure. Regrettably, on a number of occasions some non-government senators in the minor parties have decided to support the government position rather than the position that I think is appropriate in this chamber, where governments are made more accountable.Whether we like it or not, these arrangements will come in. I am doubtful whether the arrangements will produce a saving in time. Already in the debate today there has been a lot of discussion to the effect that when we get up at eight in the evening there will be a chance for committees to hold meetings. It is unlikely that those meetings will last just a few short minutes. So I think we will find that—","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1/debate.sub2/speech[1]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

202,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator KEMP","WW4","(Victoria)","LP","N/A",219,"—I do not think we will have more contact with our families; I think we will be in the parliament earlier and conscientious senators, at least, will be here later. Senator Herron may well differ from me on this matter, but I suspect that the majority of senators will ensure that less time is spent here. I am a parliamentarian who believes we are elected by the people to come here; they want us to work, and to work hard—they expect that from us. I think the previous arrangements worked quite well but I accept that the numbers are against us and there will be these changes.The final message I would like to give is that it seems to me that a philosophical issue is emerging here. What is the appropriate philosophy for this sort of chamber? As we constantly say, it is a chamber which makes governments accountable and reviews their actions. Inevitably, that is a bit unpleasant for the government. To my mind the Australian Democrats seem to fluctuate in their philosophy by trying to get onside with the government and work with the government. Of course, once they are part of the governmental process, as they will be in the course of the budget, the accountability process in this chamber is compromised. That is a decision that Senator Woodley and his colleagues will have to make. To a certain extent one becomes another part of the government and it means that the ability of making governments more accountable to this chamber is eroded. That is a philosophical issue Senator Woodleys party will have to debate internally and decide what course to take.We often say that Don Chipp had the view that the philosophy of the Democrats was to keep governments honest, to keep us all honest and, hopefully, even to keep the Democrats honest. That was not a bad philosophy. It is a pity that on a number of occasions the Democrats have not joined with us in our attempts to keep the government honest.This is an important debate. Important changes are coming forward. The particular change I am opposed to relates to the adjournment motion. It would be a pity to reduce the existing flexibility in that area. It means that the capacity to bring forward important issues which may occur once or twice a session, when a senator wants to come in and land the government with a particular problem—maybe on its side; maybe on our side—will be greatly restricted. That is a pity but I am sure we will learn to live with it.I cannot see any advantage for the Australian Democrats in supporting the government on this issue. I listened very carefully to Senator Bourne. Senator Woodley may also make a contribution, and I will listen carefully to him. But I cannot see the advantage in non-government senators supporting arrangements which reduce their capacity to question the government.In question time today it was interesting to see that a number of Senator Woodleys colleagues kept focusing on the points of order taken. I cannot remember his colleagues ever raising questions about the relevance of an answer which has been given. One of the reasons we on this side take points of order is that the government refuses to answer the questions we put to it. I think it shows the focus of some of Senator Woodleys colleagues. They focus more on the points of order. Typically, 90 per cent of points of order are on the issue of relevance—an attempt to get the government to address the question. It would be interesting to hear an interjection by Senator Woodleys colleagues that urged the government to answer the question which has been put to it. I think that is an important issue. Again, it is part of this issue of making governments more accountable.As I say, I think these changes significantly restrict in a number of important ways the ability of non-government senators to raise their issues of concern. I hope that, as we work through these arrangements, some of these effects can be moderated by the amendments that my colleague Senator Hill has moved. Because the amendments are very reasonable, sensible and, in some areas, to the considerable advantage of the minor parties, I hope that we will receive the Democrats support.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1/debate.sub2/speech[1]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
203,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator FERGUSON","EP5","(South Australia)","LP","N/A",221,"—I rise to speak only briefly to make some comments on these proposed new sitting hours and sitting arrangements which, if adopted, will see the Senate sit more days this year but go onto the adjournment debate at 7.20 p.m. and rise by 8 p.m. I believe that the only reason that these proposed new sitting hours have been brought about is that the sitting hours that have been set down in procedures for the Senate to abide by, certainly since the time that I have been here, have not been abided by, so we have had late sittings.With the help of the Australian Democrats and minor parties, the government has negated the adjournment whenever it has suited it. So, instead of finishing at 10.30 p.m.—the hour set out in the hours of sitting for three days of the week—the government, with the help of the Democrats, has made us sit until all hours of the morning. If we had stopped at 10.30 p.m., which is the hour set down in the procedures and standing orders, a lot of the issues that have been raised, particularly those raised by my colleague Senator Herron, would not have arisen. Senator Herron has spoken many times—usually after midnight—about stress on both staff and senators. His arguments have been valid, but they have been valid only because the government, aided by the Democrats, has negated the adjournment. Therefore, the sitting hours that are laid down in the standing orders have not been abided by. Stress has been placed on both staff and senators in this place purely because the hours that have been set out have not been abided by.I can understand the reasoning behind lessening the number of hours that we sit each day. The idea is that we spread the work more evenly over more days and that we get home earlier every night. For many people this may be the case, particularly for senators and staff who live in Canberra. They will no doubt welcome the opportunity to leave here at what they might think to be the far more sensible hour of 8.00 p.m. and perhaps go home to their families or go home to have dinner. I think they are being misled if they think they are going to leave here at 8 oclock. That is another point, but I can understand why they would welcome these changes.But it seems to me that we are forgetting several very important matters. Firstly, the Senates rising at 8.00 p.m. will not mean that we will have the chance to go home at that time. Honourable senators have spoken about estimates committees and other committee hearings taking place from 8.00 p.m. onwards. In many cases that will mean that staff, including many Parliament House staff, will be required to stay on; so people who think that we will stop at 8.00 p.m. have another think coming to them. If we adopt this new sitting program in its entirety we will do away with a formal dinner break and we will be in a worse position than we are in now. Currently the situation is that in most cases senators, and in many cases also their staff, have a rushed lunch—they grab a sandwich or something else that they can have on the run—if they have one at all.If this proposed procedure is passed we will not be able to guarantee a dinner break for ourselves, our staff or the Parliament House staff. I am quite sure that many senators and their staff will still be working here at 10.00 p.m. and later. I believe the proposed procedures will have the opposite effect upon the matters which Senator Herron and others have expressed concern. If people who work here do not stop for a formal dinner break they will be even more tired and stressed than usual because they will not have a chance to have a break away from work.Senator Bourne spoke at length about senators being macho by having very late sittings, and about people working 12-hour days. I do not think that anybody who comes here expects to work the same sorts of hours as people who work in nine to five jobs outside parliament because it is just not feasible or possible. No other job drags people from all over Australia to meet here. The idea is to get the maximum amount of work done while we are here. The evening meal break is an important time for senators, their staff, and other Parliament House staff to have time out. They can sit down, eat a meal, meet with colleagues and with staff from other offices. I understand that staff find out the most interesting things during the dinner break. I am quite sure that they, as well as many senators, would miss the opportunity to have this time out to sit and talk with their colleagues and other workers.Doing away with a formal dinner break will give us even less opportunity than we and our staff have now to get out of our offices. I think particularly of the staff involved in the whips offices. My colleague Senator Teague said that a whips office could have a replacement person or have a roster system so that somebody could work during the time when the whips clerk had time off. I know that our whips clerk can quickly tell us what business is before the chamber and how quickly she can contact people to let them know what is happening. It would be an impossible position for her, and other staff like her, in their offices. This building is not designed for much social interaction. Everybody seems to be hidden away in hermetically sealed offices with very little contact, and particularly at staff level there is very little contact with other staff. The one real chance that people have to get out and mix with others is during the formal dinner break from 6.30 p.m. to 8.00 p.m.The proposal to do away with that formal break for four days of the week would be very detrimental to staff and other people who work here. It is even more important for backbenchers staff because in most cases there is only one staff member for each backbencher. In ministers offices, the numerous staff can be rostered. Even if there were not a dinner break it would not have much effect because even now those staff members roster themselves for meal breaks. In the case of backbenchers, with one staff member only, that staff member usually has only a short lunch break or none at all. If these changes to procedures are passed then those staff members will not have a dinner break either.It is all very well for my colleague Senator Teague to say that they should have everything organised from 10 minutes to seven at night; if there are other things going on that night, we are still asking one staff person in an office to work for enormously long hours without a break and under constant stress. That is notwithstanding the Hansard staff. I wonder whether anybody has taken the feelings of Hansard staff into account.We are asking our single staff members to come to work in the morning and rush out to grab a sandwich at lunchtime. Now we will be asking them to rush out if they are hungry, tired or in need of a break and grab a snack to tide them over until 8 oclock. This is assuming that our staff can leave at 8 oclock. What happens if we have committee meetings and we ask them to work after 8 oclock? When are they supposed to eat and where are they supposed to eat? Currently the staff canteen shuts at 8 oclock anyway. I guess it means that Aussies will be doing a booming trade. It might be at the expense of our waistlines. If we were all at risk of dying of heart attacks because of the previous sitting hours, I wonder whether we might be just as much at risk now if we start filling ourselves up on the run with sandwiches or food that we may not normally eat.I consider that there is merit in these proposed sitting hours for the people who live in Canberra and who can actually leave at 8 oclock—they can go home at a reasonable hour and see their families—but for senators and staff from interstate, there is no home to go to. Quite frankly, I would rather have a decent dinner break from 6.30 to 8 oclock and then sit until 10 oclock or 10.30, because I will not go home any earlier if the Senate rises at 8 oclock. I will have either committee work or other work which could go much later than 10.00 p.m. After 8 oclock I would have to have dinner here or go out and have a meal somewhere else, at a restaurant perhaps.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1/debate.sub2/speech[2]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

205,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator FERGUSON","EP5","(South Australia)","LP","N/A",221,"—That is right. We will not get much here. Why would I and other senators in similar positions want to go back to our accommodation at 8.00 p.m. anyway? Why would we want to do it? Even if I had the facilities, the last thing I would want to do is cook myself a meal at half past eight at night. I have sampled my cooking before. Even though I am not always that complimentary about the parliamentary dining room, it is more preferable than getting my own dinner.Staff who travel with us are in a very similar position. Why would they want to go home to a motel room or their accommodation at 8 oclock at night? If they have come this far to work while we are here, we are better off putting the time into the work that we are meant to be doing. My feeling has always been that when I leave my family and home to come here, I would rather make use of every available hour here on work and get it over and done with, rather than spend extra time and more days away from my home and family. If I am here, I would rather be working than stopping at 8 oclock.In the end, despite the good intentions, I think that we and our staff will work much the same hours that we work now. The difference will be that there is likely to be more stress because we have eaten dinner on the run, not eaten at all or we end up overindulging at a restaurant late at night. It appears to me that the new sitting hours were devised by people who have more than one staff member or people who live in Canberra and have homes to go to.Apart from any other concerns that I have on my own behalf, I simply do not think it is fair on backbenchers staff and other staff who are in an office by themselves. Despite the occupational health and safety rules saying that all staff must take at least a half an hour break for dinner, the pressure will be on them to wait until at least 7.20 p.m. when adjournment speeches begin or 8 oclock when the house rises, or else have no dinner at all.There are staff who will simply have no choice at all. If they are the only employee over here, they are the only person able to do the job and they will be unable to leave their office until 7.20 p.m., if not 8 oclock. I understand from speaking to some of the staff members I know that they are none too impressed about the proposed sitting hours.There are two possible solutions for staff if these procedures go through. If the Senate is to rise at 8.00 p.m., then a full service must be made available at the staff canteen for at least an hour after we rise for interstate staff who are unable to go home for dinner. Alternatively, if a full service is not possible because of the reduced numbers, we need to consider their circumstances. It is all right for us as senators. We have access to transport in order to go out for dinner and to get home afterwards, but our staff do not all have that same entitlement.If the staff canteen does not offer a full service for a reasonable time after 8.00 p.m., I do not think it is fair on the staff who come here to pay their own way to a restaurant for a decent meal and then pay their own way to their accommodation. If we cannot provide a proper meal service in Parliament House for the staff who come here from interstate, then we must come up with an acceptable alternative.If Senator Teague is correct that there will be no requirement for staff backup from 10 minutes to seven on Tuesdays and Thursdays when government documents are under discussion, then I suggest that a formal dinner break ought to be declared for staff from 10 minutes to seven until 20 minutes past eight. This will give them time to have a formalised dinner break and these would then be the hours when the canteen should offer a full service. If committee meetings are to be held at night, they should not start until 8.30 p.m. Of the two alternatives, the second is the preferable by far, and I hope that senators will give it some consideration if, as I anticipate, these proposals are passed with the support of the Democrats and many of the sensible amendments proposed by Senator Hill are rejected.I do not believe that these procedures were devised by senators who have only one staff member. They certainly were not devised by staff who are unable to leave their offices for dinner until 7.20 p.m. or 8.00 p.m. and they certainly were not proposed by staff who come here from interstate. They were not designed by any normal person who gets hungry well before 8 oclock and does not work as well on an empty stomach. I do not know what my colleague Senator Herron would think about people who eat meals late every night. Sometimes when people wait a long time to eat, they tend to eat somewhat more than they should. These procedures certainly were not devised by senators like me who do not like being apart from our families as much as we are at present—let alone adding every Monday to the sitting schedule—and not making full use of the time when we are here. That is the most important and compelling argument of all.We have people who are drawn from all around Australia and from every state. We bring people to Canberra, which is an expensive exercise. I believe that every available hour should be used in the work of the parliament and Senate chamber so that the population of Australia gets value for its money, although some will always question whether they are getting value for their money. We should attempt to use every available hour we are here without going to ridiculous extremes. Those ridiculous extremes would never have been reached if the Democrats had not supported the government in negating the adjournment every time we reached 10.30 p.m.These proposed new rules say that we will rise at 8 oclock without the motion being put for the adjournment and I wonder just what will happen if we have a situation like we had at the end of last year. I wonder how early the Democrats will decide that they will support the government in guillotining legislation through which will restrict debate. We will have a similar situation to the one in the lower house where, on some occasions, there is no debate at all for important bills. I wonder where the Democrats would stand on such an issue, because when it came to negating the adjournment that was when the extra time that was considered to be required was made up. If that is no longer possible, how early in the session and how early in a debate on legislation will the Democrats support the government in applying the guillotine to important legislation?Senator Hill has come up with what I think are reasonable amendments which deal with some specific areas. The amendment I wish to refer to particularly is the one in relation to the adjournment debate. I support my colleague Senator Kemp, because Senator Bourne gave us the figures showing that the average time in the budget session for speaking on the adjournment debate was 22 minutes. Why would there be any need to put a time limit of 40 minutes on the adjournment debate when the average is 22 minutes? If convention is observed, we would scarcely ever go over the proposed time limit anyway.Putting the 10-minute limit on individual speakers allows the government to prevent opposition backbenchers from raising important issues. All the government has to do is bring in a couple of senators to speak for 10 minutes, have a Democrat speak for 10 minutes, and then there may be a chance for two opposition senators to raise an issue of substance during the adjournment debate and speak on it for only 10 minutes.During the debate relating to speeches on the motion for the second reading, I listened to Senator Bell speak long and loud on the importance of restricting the debate to 20 minutes, and on the same night he spoke for 28 minutes on the adjournment debate. Some standards need to be set somewhere along the way.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1/debate.sub2/speech[2]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

207,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator FERGUSON","EP5","(South Australia)","LP","N/A",221,"—It was drawn to his attention afterwards. The adjournment debate may be the only opportunity we have to raise important matters, and it will be possible for the government to gag that opportunity by bringing in speakers from its own side. If there was no limit, the government would not bother doing that because other speakers would be able to continue for as long as they wished.I urge the Democrats, the Greens and Senator Harradine to support the amendment stating that there be no limit on the adjournment debate, knowing that in almost every case the adjournment will be very brief. In the event that it is necessary to raise an important issue that we do not have the opportunity to raise at any other stage during the day, it could be raised at that time. When the motion to adjourn is not going to be put, 8 oclock is the cut-off time, regardless of any other consideration.I believe that no time limit should be placed on the adjournment debate. I believe that the time will be used to effect and that it will not be abused, because it has not been abused in the past. If some very important matter comes up, the Democrats or the Greens may wish to use that time. It may be the only opportunity senators get to raise important issues. Even if the other parties cannot see their way clear to supporting our other amendments, I urge them to support the amendment which refers to not having a cut-off time for the adjournment debate.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1/debate.sub2/speech[2]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

One poor soul has been sitting there for the last half hour or so—he may be interested in what senators do and how they go about their procedures. Proceedings are being broadcast today. Perhaps there is another poor soul out there in the community who is actually listening to the debate, and I commend that poor soul. However, whether the gallery is aware of it or not, it is an important debate.

210,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator HERRON","VW4","(Queensland)","LP","N/A",225,"—Before Senator Woodley came in, in the pre-Christmas period we went past midnight discussing bills for 25 per cent of the time. On one important bill dealing with the wool levy—the government was advocating a 15 per cent wool levy; we were saying 10 per cent—at about 3 oclock in the morning Senator Woodleys party adjourned for five minutes and came back and said, `Lets split the difference: make it 12 1/2 per cent. That was a reaction to exhaustion. Nobody knew the figures; nobody had any idea of the millions of dollars involved. That is the sort of thing to which I am referring. If any more evidence is required, observe what occurs in this chamber as the time progresses past 8.00 p.m. or 9.00 p.m. and the irrational behaviour of senators after midnight, particularly towards the end of the week. One does not need to be an amateur psychologist to understand what goes on in this chamber.This is an important debate that goes to the fundamental aspects of the quality of decision making that occurs in this chamber. On one occasion this chamber made an incorrect decision late at night and sent it across to the House of Representatives, where members were equally exhausted. They rubber-stamped it and it came back again. That is the type of thing that can occur. There has to be some rationality in this.If I made one contribution to the Procedure Committee report it was setting the time limit at 8.00 p.m. There has been much debate regarding the 8.00 p.m. closure. I am not a member of the Procedure Committee, but Senator Bourne indicated that the committee drew the line there and then worked backwards. It is not just the senators who are affected by this; it is the clerks and the staff. I have spoken on this many times before—usually after midnight, as Senator Ferguson indicated, because it seemed the most appropriate time to speak about it.I have estimated that, conservatively, about 1,000 people inside and outside this chamber are affected by the sitting times, apart from the families of those people. In this International Year of the Family, what more appropriate gesture could be made to the families of everybody involved in this `whoopee land of the Senate than to give some time to the families outside this chamber by ceasing proceedings at 8.00 p.m.I cannot understood my colleagues who say, `We want to work while we are here. We are giving them the chance to work. After 8.00 p.m., they can spend all night here if they want to, but they will have that choice. At the moment with the present Senate sitting hours we do not have that choice. We have to stay here because division bells ring or quorums are required; we cannot leave the place. Like boarding school, we have to be paired to get out of the place. Under the proposed procedures, after 8.00 p.m. the choice is there. Senators can have as many committee meetings as they like—I will not be there. They can do what they like in that regard, if that is what they want. They can put a committee meeting on every night from 8.00 p.m. till 3.00 a.m.—be the guest of those who wish to do it. But, under these committee changes, one has the opportunity of saying no. I actually want to sit down and think. I want to read. I want to go and meet some people, perhaps even go to a Chinese restaurant and have a meal.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1/debate.sub2/speech[3]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

212,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator HERRON","VW4","(Queensland)","LP","N/A",225,"—Thank you, Senator Woodley. We might actually meet on a social occasion rather than throwing invective across the chamber at one another. More sensible legislation might result. Interestingly, these are the same number of hours as the Senate is now sitting; the same number of hours have been achieved. There can be changes within the Procedure Committee report, and I support some of the amendments. I was not privy to the changes that were decided upon.Finally, I am reminded of the last election. There is a resistance to change. I am not saying that lies have been told, as in the last election, and that the electorate is scared, but we get this resistance to change. Everybody wants to resist change. We are frightened of change, so arguments are put up: `We cannot do this because somebody will not get time to eat, we will not be able to cover meal times, we will have to bolt our food down, and so on. Those matters will be sorted out. We should not resist change, and it is well known that this arrangement can be altered. It can be discussed again in the future. It is not set in stone. I came here with the impression that all these wonderful procedures were set in stone, but that is not so.Some people have voted with their feet. Interestingly, since I have been here, in a little over three years 12 of the 76 senators have left—admittedly, some involuntarily as a result of elections. There has been an enormous turnover, and it appears that the time spent here in this chamber is only an average of seven years. Senator Woodleys party would know about the tremendous numbers that are turned over. Some people quietly sneak away—they just cannot hack it. Certainly it would be a great advantage to the Australian people if we tried this experiment.The man who was responsible for the development of modern surgery, an Englishman named John Hunter, goes down in surgical history because he made the point that, `You should try the experiment and, if it does not work, it is no good. That is what is being proposed by the Procedure Committee. We can at least try the experiment and, if it does not work, we can change.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1/debate.sub2/speech[3]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"
213,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CHAMARETTE","SN5","(Western Australia)","GWA","N/A",227,"—I rise to say that the Greens, despite having problems with some aspects, support in principle this motion which contains the recommendations of the Procedure Committee. The opposition amendments have canvassed some of those potential problems. However, I very much support the sensible move—I believe it is welcome—to a more reasonable timetable which underlies the recommendations that we are considering in this debate.I was not certain whether the statement that parliamentary sitting hours have been set by the train timetables 50 years ago was accurate. I checked with the clerk—who had not heard this one—who further enlightened me as to the rationale of the present situation. Apparently, at a time when members of parliament were mainly professional and business gentlemen, who enacted their parliamentary responsibilities in their leisure hours, it was customary for them to be part time and for them to engage in the responsibilities of the parliament in the evening.That could have been true up to 25 years ago when this chamber never sat until the afternoon. Gradually the mornings have been adopted because, as we would all know, becoming a member of parliament is certainly a full-time occupation rather than a part-time extracurricular activity. As a consequence, we have not really adapted to the reality of the lifestyle or the time in which we live. For a long time Senator Herron and Senator Teague have bemoaned the severe effects on the physical and mental health of not only senators and their immediate staff but all the staff associated with the workings of this place.Members of the community have little idea of the hours of hard work that are involved in the political arena with regard to parliamentary representation and decision making. When people do become aware, via the media, of the ridiculous pressures that lead to all night sittings and early morning rises, they are appalled at the inappropriate example that we reflect to the community. Senator Herron raised the idea of legislation by exhaustion and I believe it is a very valid one. It gives the worst possible picture to the community of what our priorities are. We are seen in the community with our electoral responsibilities, but when we are debating in this place the public sees us making important decisions in a very rushed and harassed way at outrageous hours. Sometimes stern measures have to be adopted towards that, and the guillotine is one of them. The decisions that we make uphold the true significance and responsibility—","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1/debate.sub2/speech[4]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

215,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CHAMARETTE","SN5","(Western Australia)","GWA","N/A",227,"—I would like to finish this and get on to the point that Senator Panizza is making about adjournments. The decisions that we make uphold the true significance and responsibility for the legislation that we debate, and this should demand that we do it in the clear light of day and without pressure, and without the slur that can be placed on us if we are in a position of considering it at all hours and in all kinds of ways.As I mentioned earlier, I support in principle the recommendations that are before us, but there are some aspects that I believe warrant consideration. The major matter concerns the curtailment of the adjournment debate which will deprive senators of legitimate opportunities for expressing matters that have not arisen at other points in the parliamentary program, and which may relate to electoral concerns and community matters. When there is a rigid timetable there is always a danger that, instead of its giving us increasing leisure and freedom, it actually constrains us so that the time allocated tends to be filled up.One of the concerns that I feel about the curtailment of the adjournment debate is that the program is being driven to a certain extent by a desire for certainty. Who can blame senators, or members for that matter, who would like to have certainty on a Thursday about whether they can catch a plane at nine oclock at night to return to their families? I believe we should respect that and provide for it.However, I am concerned that constraining all four days, with increasing competition for that time, may deprive certain senators of the freedom of speech and also lead to an overuse of the adjournment debate. Ironically, as Senator Baume pointed out, all the time allocations made by the Procedure Committee have taken into full consideration the practice that we have engaged in over the past year. In that time we had total freedom—maybe not total freedom, but certainly considerably more freedom than this program allows.The danger is that when we are offered more than we were using when we had that freedom, we will suddenly demand it all and some people will get lost in the running for the time that is available. The Greens are proposing a trial period until the Easter break. On Mondays we will continue with the unlimited practice of the adjournment, as we have had it to the present, and only have the timetabled adjournments with the 10 minutes restriction and the 40 minutes time limit for the remaining three days. I believe that this will be a way of assessing whether it is required and whether the constraints of this new program are too severe.I sincerely hope that Senator Ferguson is correct when he says that this process would not be abused if we had it for all four days. One good way of testing that is to see whether the practice leads to genuine discipline being applied, or whether it will lead to concerns that the system is being abused on the one day when it is available. I will be circulating the amendment in the chamber. It allows a trial period for one day a week—and that day is Monday—when we will put the question for the adjournment at 7.20, but the same constraints that will apply to the Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday timetable will not exist.Whether this proves to be a success or not, we will have some time to make changes. It is an attempt to see whether we need it or not. If the Senate does not consider it worthy of being maintained, we will go back to the recommendations of the Procedure Committee automatically on 3 May.My second concern has already been raised and there has been some lengthy discussion on it. It is to be found in the oppositions 11th amendment, and it refers to general business not commencing later than 4.30 p.m. on Thursdays in order not to curtail the opportunities we may have to discuss general business, and opposition, independent, Democrat and Green business. The Greens will be supporting that amendment.There will be a review of this intended program at the end of this year. This is appropriate because any timetable which we are trialing deserves to be tested under the conditions of the different sittings of the year. While that review will occur after one year, I believe that there is a requirement for some monitoring along the way. The appropriate committee to be engaged in that monitoring process is the Procedure Committee, which has put all these recommendations to the Senate.Occupational health and safety issues have implications not only for senators and their immediate staff, but also for the clerks, clerical staff, attendants and Hansard reporting staff. Their present awards and work practices have evolved under the old sitting patterns and times. It may be necessary for those awards and work practices to be altered in light of the changes that we are making.This is not only an industrial issue. We must not lose sight of the personal and social impacts. I hope that, at the appropriate time, the Procedure Committee will look at these issues. If it has not done that within a reasonable period—say, within three to six months—I will take steps to ensure that there is a review to ascertain the detrimental or positive effects of the changes that we are voting on today and which the Greens support.It is high time that we changed our routines and hours of sitting. A one-year trial period before changing standing orders is appropriate because we need to establish whether the proposed new arrangements are more appropriate at certain times of the year than at others. However, no matter what changes we make, the exercise will require goodwill on all sides of the chamber. It is possible to abuse freedom and, to a certain extent, that is what has happened over the years. It has meant that there has not always been certainty over the number of hours available for government business. Sometimes it has meant that individual senators have not been able to express legitimate concerns or raise certain issues.Just as it is possible to abuse freedom, it is also possible to abuse rules—to sabotage the best laid plans and timetables. Democracy is not enhanced by such practices. We must remember that the task of this chamber is to act responsibly and honestly as a house of review and that most, if not all, of the positive amendments to legislation occur in this chamber. Therefore, it is our responsibility to engage in practices that enhance our decision-making ability and to give legislation and the other matters that come before this chamber the scrutiny that they deserve. I move:At the end of paragraph (2), insert:Until 3 May 1994, paragraphs (b) and (c) shall apply to each sitting day except Monday, and on and after that date shall apply to each sitting day, subject to any further review and determination by the Senate..","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1/debate.sub2/speech[4]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
216,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator HARRADINE","6H4","(Tasmania)","IND","N/A",229,"—Mr Acting Deputy President, I would like to congratulate those who have made contributions to this debate and to the development of the proposals contained in the report of the Procedure Committee. Among them, of course, is Senator Herron. Being a medico, he was aware of the problems manifesting themselves amongst honourable senators as a result of the extended periods and unusual hours that we were sitting. It is heartening for me to see that there is an intention all round to do something about the situation and to get some sanity into the system, not only for ourselves but also, and perhaps more particularly, for the people other than senators and members who work in this parliament—not that I am suggesting that we do not work.By and large, I support the recommendations of the report in principle. Those recommendations are now contained in the proposal moved by Senator Faulkner. I listened very carefully to what was said by Senator Hill on this point, and I am concerned to ensure that the functions of the members of the Senate—those of review and scrutiny—should be preserved. I also listened to the responses from Senator Teague and others to the matters raised in this report.It appears to me that three matters need to be considered against the one particular requirement that we all insist upon—certainly, I do and the opposition does—and that is our power to scrutinise. Senator Hill questioned the ability of the parliament to discuss government documents in a relevant and timely fashion. Government documents will be considered but a question of time is involved. As I understand it, the new provisions deduct 30 minutes from the time presently allotted for the consideration of government documents. I am not sure that that is necessarily a good idea and perhaps some further thought could be given to it.However, I am not wedded to the amendments put forward by Senator Hill which would change the order in which government documents are to be considered. While honourable senators can obtain government documents, and presumably make press statements about them, that does not discharge our function because our function is primarily discharged in this chamber.The second matter that was given some consideration was the ability of senators to raise issues on the adjournment. This is particularly important when it comes to constituency matters. There is a limitation on the time available to honourable senators for this purpose. However, as has been pointed out, the recommendations have taken into account the average time that has been utilised for that purpose in the past. I would like to see a safety valve in place on one night—I made an interjection on this point during one of the earlier contributions—and Senator Chamarettes suggestion that it be on Monday evenings seems to me to be an appropriate one, and at this stage I would be prepared to support it.The other matter that was raised is very important. It was raised by Senator Hill and related to question time. Senator Hill moved amendment No. 12, which states in part:Questions may be put to Ministers each day until 28 questions, including supplementary questions, have been asked and answered.I strongly support that, particularly after the last two days. I will not go any further into it just at present, but I very strongly support that proposition. It is not an unattainable goal to have 28 questions, including supplementaries, asked. That has occurred in the past. I am indebted to Senator Kemp for the document he gave us. In 1980 and 1981 the average number of questions daily, including supplementaries, was 28 and 29. It was 26.3 in 1982 and 23.4 in 1983. Now it is down to an average of 22.5.Unfortunately, all of us have seen the tendency for ministers to make statements to the parliament which should be made at another time. If a matter is important it should be introduced as a ministerial statement but, quite frequently, government senators ask ministers dorothy dixers. In my view, in question time ministers should be put on their mettle by this parliament and information which is of public interest should be obtained from them. One of the most important times for this to occur is at question time. It is not being done if question time is used simply as a means of allowing ministers to get on their pet hobby horses with members of the government asking them bland questions to which bland responses are made.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1/debate.sub2/speech[5]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

I have a regular committee meeting at 8.30 a.m. It might be that we will have to have that at 8 oclock. It might also be—and I do not think it is desirable—that from time to time we might have to have those committee meetings in the evening. If we do that too much it will defeat the purpose of this general attempt by everybody around the chamber to try to get some sensible hours.With those few remarks I have indicated the matters upon which I will support the opposition. I have indicated that the safety valve proposal by Senator Chamarette is worthy of merit and further consideration. I have indicated in general terms that I support the proposal that has been put forward by Senator Faulkner in the terms recommended by the committee.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1/debate.sub2/speech[5]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
219,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator FAULKNER","5K4","(New South Wales-","ALP","Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",230,"—I want to thank honourable senators who contributed to this debate for their constructive contributions. We have certainly had those from right around the chamber, including the opposition. I single out Senator Herron and Senator Teague, who made some suggestions which are worthy of examination in the future.I would like to correct the misapprehension of some members of the opposition that the Australian Democrats appear to share a great deal of the responsibility for the negation of adjournments. In fact, it is fair to say that this was done during the last budget session as a result of informal arrangements made with all parties, including the opposition. That is true of course of most of the procedural arrangements that we make in this chamber. Any examination by honourable senators would show that a very significant number of the negations of the adjournment were done on the voices at 10.30 p.m. In fact, that occurred on 13 out of the 39 sitting days during the budget session.The major point made by the opposition in this debate was some extraordinary suggestion that it was the opposition that was making all the sacrifices and the government making none with this new routine of business and times and dates of sittings. That is simply not true. The average time available for government business in the past has been a minimum of 12 hours a week, increased only by negations of the adjournment. This new proposal would provide about 11 hours a week, on the assumption that there would be no more than one MPI a week. This would be only one-third of the total time available with this new routine of business, not the two-thirds that has been claimed by opposition senators in the chamber.Government business is the only item of business which has an open-ended start and no fixed duration under these proposals. I suppose, if there were daily matters of public importance, urgency motions, suspensions of standing orders, or lengthy debate on delegation reports or Auditor-General reports, we could find very little time for government business. That is always possible. Any system is open to abuse. We have to recognise that.But I think it is fair to say that if senators adopt an appropriate spirit about these new procedures we should be able to see achieved a regular amount of government business dealt with consistently across a session from week one through to the end of a session because there is clearly time available for that in the program.The question about the amount of time for government business is a concern that the government genuinely holds about these new arrangements, but in the interests of senators, senators staff and staff of this parliament, we are willing to give these proposals a fair go.Senator Teague made a fair point in this debate when he questioned whether we should consider the debating of legislation as exclusively government time. After all, I have noticed that more opposition senators speak in second reading debates than do government senators, and their interests are served during the committee stage of a bill. It is primarily opposition, independent and minor party senators who speak during those debates. Guaranteed time for debate of legislation is in the interest of not only the government but all senators in this chamber.Another furphy that has been raised is this question of there not being enough time for committee reports, government documents and the adjournment debate. I was convinced by the very telling statistics that Senator Bourne provided during the debate. They indicate that, on average, there will be more time available than has been needed in the past for committee reports, government documents and the adjournment debate. In fact, I am surprised that Senator Bourne did not mount a strong case to say that we were being far too generous with this new routine of business in that area. The same point does not apply to the amount of time available for government business. So it is, in fact, the government that is sacrificing time—","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1/debate.sub2/speech[6]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

224,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator FAULKNER","5K4","(New South Wales-","ALP","Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",230,"—Senator Kemp made a valid point in the debate that what the non-government parties are sacrificing is the flexibility that they had previously to speak for however long they wanted in some areas. That is true. No-one is going to deny that that is one impact. But it is part of the sacrifices that are being made by all senators in developing a compromise that has been reached through a process of consensus that unfortunately has broken down only at the last hurdle.The comment that there are no meal breaks can be dealt with fairly quickly. I do not believe it is beyond the capacity of senators, other staff supervisors and those in positions of responsibility here in the parliament to organise some sort of appropriate rostering arrangements to ensure that staff in senators offices and of the parliament do have appropriate meal breaks.As for the question of the lunchtime debates, traditionally very few senators have been involved in those debates, but it has been an opportunity that many have utilised. As Senator Bourne indicated in her contribution, there is clearly a need for that to continue because that time has been well spent by many senators. Traditionally, of course, on Thursdays we have sat through lunchtime and that has not caused enormous concern in the chamber previously.In relation to the opposition amendments, the government is not planning to go to the barricades on amendment No. 11, which will have the effect of ensuring that general business will always run for the full two and a half hours on a Thursday afternoon. The same logic is not being applied by the opposition to government business in this particular routine of business. There is no suggestion from the opposition that government business begin at a certain inviolable time and nothing can be changed. Perhaps that is not where the oppositions interests lie, so I will resist the temptation of making that particular point in this debate.The remainder of the amendments that have been moved by Senator Hill would, frankly, just have the effect of gutting this proposal. They would radically alter the proposals that have come forward from the Procedure Committee. They would destroy the very delicate compromise that Senator Bourne, Senator Teague and I worked so assiduously to develop through the processes of the Procedure Committee. There is no doubt those amendments would reduce the amount of time available for government business to a ludicrous, totally unacceptable and totally unworkable level. As a result, after giving the amendments due consideration, the government will not be supporting them.I am not enthusiastic about Senator Chamarettes amendment, which relates to an open-ended adjournment debate on one day a week for a limited period. I think there are arguments that can be mounted, as the Procedure Committee did, to have a consistent finishing time, but I will not be going to the barricades on that. I accept that there is a likelihood that, as Senator Harradine, Senator Bourne and Senator Chamarette have indicated, there is an attraction in that particular proposition. I stress again that these are significant reforms for the Senate.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1/debate.sub2/speech[6]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

It is a genuine and sincere attempt on the part of the Procedure Committee to deal with the impact that the times of Senate sittings have had upon senators and staff and upon the families of senators and staff. As I said before, it is something that adds to the significant program of reform that the government has proposed in relation to the procedures and processes of this chamber.

Paragraph (7) of Senator Faulkners motion says:Debate on a matter of public importance or urgency motion under standing order 75 shall not exceed one hour, or, if no motions are moved after question time to take note of answers, 90 minutes, and a Senator shall not speak to such a matter or motion for more than 10 minutes.Clearly, if that were deleted, then there would be no limit to the amount of time that could be spent debating a matter of public importance or an urgency matter. As I read it, on the hop, that could wipe out any other business for that day.I do not think in their wildest dreams that those opposite would have thought that that would have been the case when we voted that way. I wanted to ensure that there is of right what occurs at the present moment; that is, that immediately after question time, on any of the days, a motion may be moved to take note of answers given to questions without notice. That is entrenching what is now the practice, and it is what I wanted to ensure. I support the proposal that has been put by Senator Faulkner.

That is why we supported—as Senator Harradine did—part (7)(a) of the oppositions amendment No. 18.We also support that it should be one hour for the MPI or urgency motion and, if there is no taking note of answers, then the time allowable for that should be able to be added onto MPIs.

All along our intention was that paragraph (7) should stand as printed with the addition of (7)(a) of the oppositions amendment No. 18. We believed we were voting on that.

261,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator PATTERSON","LI4","(Victoria)","LP","N/A",239,"—The Senate is debating two nursing home bills, namely the National Health Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1993 and the Nursing Home Charge (Imposition) Bill 1993. These two bills are intricately linked. The National Health Amendment Bill (No. 3) sets out the circumstances for the recovery of unspent nursing home benefits in respect of the period prior to 1 July 1993 from the vendor upon the sale of a nursing home. The Nursing Home Charge (Imposition) Bill 1993 enables this `nursing home charge to be levied.These bills extend the National Health Amendment Act 1992 which made unspent nursing home benefits a recoverable debt upon the sale of a nursing home. Previously, such overpaid benefits could only be clawed back by imposing a negative loading on the new proprietor. The changes were effectively prospective, applying only to overpayments in relation to benefits paid after the commencement date of the 1992 amendments on 1 July 1993.A year ago when this bill was being debated by the parliament the nursing home industry made it clear that the recovery of unspent nursing home benefits as overpayments from a previous proprietor should apply retrospectively as well. Whilst the coalition parties would not normally support retrospective legislation, we contended that this was a special case which would result in more timely recovery and greater protection for innocent and possibly unsuspecting purchasers.This bill takes heed of the industrys and the coalitions representations. While I do not criticise the government for introducing what is sensible legislation, this debate cannot be allowed to pass without recognising how frequently the coalition seems to be making the running in relation to important aged care reforms. This is a typical example. Late last year, Professor Gregorys funding review and the Macri documentation consultancy both lent support to many of the coalitions policy proposals. Brian Burdekins report on mental illness has reiterated many of the concerns that the coalition has continued to express about dementia care, particularly in relation to the importance of purpose specific facilities and the need for more flexible respite services.The National Health Amendment Bill (No. 3) provides for the collection and recovery of unspent benefits in respect of a period prior to 1 July 1993. The amount of these unspent benefits will be assessed by the secretary and recovered as a `nursing home charge levied on the vendor. These amendments will further protect the rights of purchasers, enabling them to purchase nursing homes unencumbered by debts incurred by the previous owners. As the `nursing home charge is strictly a tax, the Nursing Home Charge (Imposition) Bill 1993 enables it to be levied on the proprietor responsible for the debt at the time of the sale.These amendments will commence on the date of royal assent; that is, they will apply only to nursing home sales that are made after that date. However, minor amendments relating to the deadlines for investigations in relation to post June 1993 overpayments will be deemed to have commenced on 1 July 1993, as will clauses relating to interest that is payable by the Commonwealth on repayments to vendors resulting from estimated debts paid to the Commonwealth that are in excess of the actual overpayment.In the explanatory memorandum to the National Health Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1993 the government claims that it will have little direct financial impact. It is true that moneys collected from the imposition of the nursing home charge would otherwise be collected by way of negative loadings. However, as negative loadings are often applied over a considerable period of time, it is feasible that some financial benefits will be derived as a result of more timely recovery of debts. As the Nursing Home Charge (Imposition) Bill 1993 merely provides the mechanism for recovery of the charge, it has no direct financial impact.I would like to take a little of the Senates time to point out how the new debt recovery system, as outlined in this bill, will operate. The National Health Amendment Bill (No. 3) introduces a new division 2A, titled `Nursing home charge, into the National Health Act. Under this section, if an investigation upon the sale or proposed sale of a nursing home finds that a fee-reducing or unspent benefit was paid to a proprietor prior to 1 July 1993, the secretary may give notice in writing of the amount of that benefit to the vendor. The notified amount is the nursing home charge and the vendor is liable for that charge. The notice must stipulate the amount of the charge and the date that it is payable.The secretary may amend an assessment within three years of its being made. An amended assessment may be made at the initiative of the secretary or by application from the payer. If the amendment results in a reduction in the charge, the amount of that reduction is taken to have never been payable. A liable person has 42 days to lodge an objection with the relevant minister in regard to an assessment. The minister must consider an objection and reject it or allow it in full or in part. An objection decision may be reviewed under the AAT Act.Sub-section 2 refers to the collection and recovery of the nursing home charge. The secretary may extend the time for payment. However, a 16 per cent per annum late payment charge applies. The secretary may remit some or all of the penalty in special or mitigating circumstances. The charge is recoverable as a debt through court proceedings. There are specific provisions contained in the bill for the recovery of the charge from persons with joint liability, from the trustees of deceased estates, and from unadministered estates.Subsection 3 allows for the collection of the charge before the completion of a sale of a nursing home, either from the vendor, the purchaser, or both. Advance payments can occur if there is a likelihood that an assessment will reveal a vendors liability or in the event that an assessment has actually revealed such a liability.If the appropriate notice of a sale has been given: an advance payment direction can only occur upon the completion of an investigation; is limited to the purchaser; and is regarded as consideration in the sale. If an investigation is ordered due to a lack of notice of a sale, an advance payment direction may be the result of an estimate of the fee-reducing benefit, and may also include the payment of any difference between the estimated amount and the original purchase price paid by the vendor. Any advance payments made as a result of estimates are held in trust and interest may be payable if they exceed the sum of the fee-reducing benefit and any post-30 June 1993 overpayments.The bill allows the secretary to take into account any unpaid nursing home charge when setting a scale of fees and to accordingly reduce the fee that the proprietor can charge. If an outstanding charge is paid, a new scale of fees which reflects any underpaid general care benefits to the proprietor must then be determined.Amendments to subsections 65H and 65J allow the secretary to direct that pre-1 July 1993 nursing home charges and post-30 June overpayments be paid by nursing home purchasers when no advance payments have been determined. These amendments also allow the secretary to direct post-30 June 1993 overpayments to be paid by purchasers when an advance payment has been directed. The schedule to the bill replaces all references to the outdated `fee-determining benefit with the new `fee-increasing benefit in the principal act.The coalition does not oppose these two interconnected bills. As I said earlier, it was the coalition that placed on the public record the concerns of the nursing home industry about the inadequacy of the post-30 June 1993 amendments that were contained in the National Health Amendment Act 1992. This bill takes up those concerns. It must not be forgotten that determinations of nursing home charges emanate from validations of nursing home funding by the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services. Significant concerns about the departments administration of its validations program have been expressed by both the voluntary and the private sectors of the nursing home industry. On 30 September the coalition set up a Senate inquiry into all aspects of the validation of nursing home funding. The government will obviously claim that this bill will overcome some of the concerns that have been expressed by the industry about the validation process. To an extent, this is true. However, it is just as true that the success of the measures contained in this bill is inherently dependent upon the consistency and timeliness of the validation process.Professor Gregory noted the uncertainty in the nursing home industry with respect to the tasks that can be claimed under CAM, and that this is resulting in problems during the validation process. He proposes that the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services issue a clarification of the categories of CAM tasks, stating the principles that apply to each category, and giving examples of tasks that do or do not fall into that category.Sue Macri also expressed concern about the validation process in her recent work. While her consultancy was predominantly concerned with the closely related issue of the RCI and RCI documentation, she stated:Sadly, the current infrastructure established for the validation of CAM costs is not one which is viewed positively by the profession, mainly because of the negative emphasis on `lack of performance rather than `performance.I wish to put on the record that during a briefing on this bill, I asked the department whether a clause could be inserted in all written advices of estimates of determinations stating that the determination was an estimate only and advising that the principle of buyer beware should be adhered to by the purchaser. I would ask the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) to give me an undertaking that this suggestion, or something achieving the same end, will be implemented.Finally, I wish to note that a coalition amendment inserting a footnote that makes reference to section 4AA of the Crimes Act 1914 in relation to penalty units after sub-clause 65GT(5) of the bill was supported by the House of Representatives. That was in accordance with an earlier amendment to the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 that enabled users to identify the source of the new penalty units system. I would appreciate it if honourable senators, particularly ministers, when presenting legislation which refers to penalty units, would put in a clause or footnote to refer the reader back so that they know what these penalty clauses mean. It is important for us as legislators to ensure that, as far as possible, people can understand the law. One way of doing that is to see to it that they do not have to seek legal advice to find out simple things, such as what `penalty unit means.I hope that drafters will see fit to include such a footnote in all future legislation, as I believe would be the wish of this parliament. I hope that the minister will be able to address my question with respect to a purchaser about to purchase a property realising that the estimates of overpayments are only estimates and that there may be other liabilities that need to be written into any contract of sale.","N/A","NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 3) 1993 NURSING HOME CHARGE (IMPOSITION) BILL 1993 HEALTH LEGISLATION (PROFESSIONAL SERVICES REVIEW) AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
262,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator LEES","8U4","(South Australia-","AD","Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats)",241,"—Initially I will confine my remarks to the Health Legislation (Professional Services Review) Amendment Bill. This is the first part of a package announced in last years budget and introduces new measures to address the problems of overservicing and fraud within Medicare.Let me say from the outset that the Australian Democrats are not impressed by this bill, particularly by the notion of peer review in this area. We are certainly not impressed by the level of influence that the AMA will be able to exert on this new process. We are not impressed by the total lack of consumer input or involvement at any level of the process.Although I have some amendments to move, I stress that, for two reasons, the Democrats will not be voting against this bill. Firstly, we acknowledge this bill does introduce a better system than we have now. It will introduce a tougher process, and therefore is certainly a step in the right direction. Secondly, we see this bill as being the last chance for the medical profession to get its house in order. If this bill does not work, and I am putting on the record here that I believe it really will not work, then the government will have to say to doctors, `That is it. You have now had every opportunity through peer review to tackle the problem seriously; and you have failed to do so.The government will then have to say it will no longer support the notion of peer review and will move to a process of outside scrutiny and control. In our view we have already gone past the point where peer review should be abandoned. The facts show that peer review has not worked in Australia or anywhere else in the world. I believe the only reason it is getting another chance is that the AMA has convinced the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) that it is worth another chance.The AMA has certainly done some very clever work to shore up its position in the aftermath of two very damaging reports about the peer review process, one by Harvey Bates for the Health Insurance Commission and the other one by the Commonwealth Auditor-General.The Australian National Audit Office report found that there was `a lack of prosecutions and disciplinary action taken against unethical practitioners. It also found that the performance of the Health Insurance Commission in this area had shown virtually no improvement since the early 1980s. The ANAO concluded that `the emergence of organised fraud and excessive servicing, protected by corporate veils and the best advice money can buy, represents a real challenge to the efficient and effective use of the health budget.The report found that the Health Insurance Commissions legislative powers were deficient and recommended changes to the legislation in order to get much tougher on fraud and overservicing. Harvey Bates reviewed the operations and procedures of the Health Insurance Commissions investigations unit and found that under existing legislation it did not provide a satisfactory base to support any positive investigations in significant cases of fraud. Bates recommended the development of a national fraud control plan—major legislative changes including giving the Health Insurance Commission adequate audit and entry powers. He also recommended increases in penalties. This is not, as he stressed, a small, minor problem.In early 1980, based on computer profiles of billing practices, the Department of Health put the extent of fraud and overservicing at least at seven per cent of the total medical benefits expenditure by the Commonwealth and the health funds. In 1982 the cost of fraud and overservicing was conservatively put at $100 million per year. If that same estimate is applied to todays budget we are up around $400 million a year. Bates estimated the cost was at least $300 million a year. I appreciate that the AMA considers these figures to be vastly exaggerated, but even if we accept the AMAs viewpoint we still have a major problem which is costing the Australian taxpayer a great deal of money.Of course overservicing is not just about money. It is also about service provision. For example, unnecessary surgery is acknowledged as an ongoing and significant problem within the Australian health care system. Until now we have not been very good at cracking down on Medicare rorts and the Health Insurance Commission has a very poor record in investigating and prosecuting medical practitioners. Between 1985 and 1992 only 43 medical practitioners were penalised for fraud. In 1991-92 only four practitioners were prosecuted by the Health Insurance Commission. However, it is worth noting that all four were indeed found to have overserviced; and more than $1 million was reclaimed from just those four cases.The medical services committee of inquiry also has a poor record in taking disciplinary action against practitioners for overservicing. From July 1985 to June 1992 only 88 practitioners were referred to the MSCI and, of these, only 51 were required to pay back any money—a total of $556,826.The Auditor-General found four possible reasons for the low level of prosecutions and disciplinary action. The first was inadequate investigative powers; the second was a lack of comprehensive and effective legislative powers; the third was insufficient training for investigators; and the last was the Health Insurance Commissions emphasis on counselling and conciliation.Both the previous health minister, Mr Howe, and the Health Insurance Commission were sympathetic to the recommendations made by the Auditor-General and Harvey Bates. In fact, in December 1992 the Health Insurance Commission began work on a legislative reform project to pick up some of the issues raised by the two reports. The commission set up an extensive round of consultations. One of the things it was asking about was the Medical Services Committee of Inquiry process. The commission was proposing to replace peer review with a much more independent process, one which was more in line with the decision-making and review processes in other Commonwealth legislation.The commission started on that process only to have the rug pulled out from under it. It seems that this was done primarily because the AMA, which had been incredibly intransigent about any sort of changes—particularly improvements—to legislation in this area for a long time, decided it was going to adopt a new and far more responsible and reasonable attitude. The AMA then put in considerable efforts to convince the minister that it was ready to cooperate.I am not sure why that change came about. It could be that the AMA saw the writing on the wall, or that the new President of the AMA, Dr Brendan Nelson, is a very reasonable and responsible person; and he was able to work responsibly with the minister to come up with a compromise deal. Whatever the reason, the Health Insurance Commission was told to stop its consultative process. The AMA was in and the Health Insurance Commission was out. Peer review, which looked to be on its way out, was suddenly well and truly back on the agenda. This has resulted basically in a total lack of consultation about this bill with anybody other than the AMA—and it certainly shows.When the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs looked at this bill late last year, a number of submissions from other professional organisations expressed concern about the influence given to the AMA over the new peer review system. There are provisions within this bill which say that the minister must consult the AMA before appointing medical practitioners to the Professional Services Review Panel, before appointing panel members to be deputy directors and before appointing members to the Professional Services Review Tribunal. The provisions do not say `may consult, but `must consult.The greatest level of AMA influence can be found in new section 83(2) of this bill which says that the minister must not appoint a medical practitioner to be the director of the Professional Services Review unless the AMA has agreed to that appointment. In other words, the AMA has been given a power of veto over the appointment of the person who is going to head up the process. I really do find that extraordinary.The AMA is not a neutral or independent group. It is, to all intents and purposes, the equivalent of a trade union for doctors. There is nothing wrong with that. I must stress that I believe it to be a very efficient and effective trade union which serves its members extremely well. I may not always agree with what the AMA says and does, but I will certainly be the first to acknowledge that it has done some very good work. I will give honourable senators a couple of examples. I have been very impressed by the AMAs recent efforts to draw attention to the link between high unemployment and poor health.It has also done some excellent work on the dangers of smoking and other related issues such as tobacco advertising and warnings on cigarette packets; and in the area of Aboriginal health it has brought to the ministers attention a range of different issues. I welcome the ministers recent involvement in the area of Aboriginal health.To put the good work aside for a moment, the AMA is essentially a union obliged to put its members interests first. To give a union veto power over the appointment of the person who is going to be inquiring into malpractice amongst its membership does not make a lot of sense.Look at it this way: imagine a bill which dealt with corruption on the waterfront where the government was setting up a panel to investigate and penalise waterside workers who were rorting the system. If the government came in here and said it was going to give the power of veto over to the ACTU, which is appointed director of that panel, everyone would be screaming from the rooftops—particularly the coalition. We would never hear the end of it.But apparently it is okay for doctors to veto the appointment of a person who is investigating overservicing by doctors. I argue that not only is that inappropriate but it sends the wrong message about the governments so-called determination to crack down on fraud and overservicing. It is not enough to be independent; one must also be seen to be independent. There should be no suggestion whatsoever about any undue influence. How can that perception of independence possibly be maintained when one organisation has the power to stand in the way of the directors appointment? The simple answer is: it cannot—and I will be moving an amendment in the committee stage to change that.Another concern the Democrats have with this legislation is that there is absolutely no role in it for consumers, that is for the people who actually use the Medicare services.I have accepted with considerable reluctance the Ministers and the AMAs argument that putting consumer representatives on the review panels would be particularly difficult. But I cannot see any reason why consumer representatives cannot be included in the tribunal stages of the review process. I do not think that the medical profession should be the sole arbiter of what constitutes improper practice. The health issues centre told the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs:A committee acting in the public interest should not be concerned solely with whether a practitioners conduct is acceptable to his or her colleagues. Just as important is the issue of whether the practitioners conduct is considered acceptable to the community. The disparity between how professional groups assess the publics best interest and how lay members of the public assess their own interests can be vast and significant.The Democrats believe consumer representatives could play a valuable role on the tribunal. They would certainly make the process more publicly accountable. I think consumer groups are right when they complain that once again medical practitioners are getting a special deal from the government.These groups argue that regardless of disputes about the extent of the problem the government continues to treat illegal activities by doctors as being less serious than blue collar crime or social security fraud. Surely it is about time we started treating doctors and other professionals in the same way as everyone else who is caught ripping off the taxpayers.We did have a number of other concerns with this bill and they were addressed in the committee stage. I must again take the opportunity to say how worthwhile the Senate committee system is. This is another example of a lot of time saving for us in this chamber, and I commend the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs for its hard work.I conclude by restating that I do not believe this bill will deliver, unfortunately. The reason it will not deliver is that this bill is not about public accountability; it is about accountability to ones peers and ones profession. I really do think that is a mistake. I remind the minister of the recent comment of the Hilmer committee on national competition policy, which stated:No section of the community is entitled to be a judge in its own cause.I believe those words will prove to be very prophetic in the case of this bill.","N/A","NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 3) 1993 NURSING HOME CHARGE (IMPOSITION) BILL 1993 HEALTH LEGISLATION (PROFESSIONAL SERVICES REVIEW) AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
263,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator HERRON","VW4","(Queensland)","LP","N/A",244,"—I refer solely to the Health Legislation (Professional Services Review) Amendment Bill part of this debate. The opposition is totally opposed to fraud. This legislation has resulted because the government has failed to control fraud. It has been in government for 10 years. What has been the result of its attempts to control fraud? Firstly, it has failed to understand how medical practice is conducted. It has failed to appreciate the honesty of the overwhelming majority of medical practitioners.A Morgan gallup poll conducted last year by Time magazine questioning people with varying occupations on honesty and ethics showed that medical practitioners came out on top. I will not tell you, Mr Acting Deputy President, where politicians came on that poll, but I can leave it to your imagination.The government failed in the past to control the rogues of the profession or successfully prosecute them, and its record in this regard is absolutely abysmal. In the four years prior to May 1993, 27 doctors were prosecuted and only $4 1/2 million was recovered. In fact, in relation to fraud, only $250,000 was recovered over four years.I would hate to think what the legal profession was paid to get that amount of money. So the government has failed. It has been in government for 10 years and has not been able to do anything about fraud. It was all due to Medicare. The government put up a system where there was a blank cheque and the minister says what a great success it is. Bulk billing accounts for 80 per cent of the services—just wham it through. There is no accountability.The government employed Harvey Bates to look into fraud. He said that 10 per cent of the $30 billion spent on health care goes in fraud. Where did he get the figure from? In his report he states that it is because in the United States of America 10 per cent goes in fraud. Ergo, it goes here. Rubbish! The minister knows that as well as I do because I questioned him on this in the past. He has backed off on that, too.","N/A","NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 3) 1993 NURSING HOME CHARGE (IMPOSITION) BILL 1993 HEALTH LEGISLATION (PROFESSIONAL SERVICES REVIEW) AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[3]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

265,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator HERRON","VW4","(Queensland)","LP","N/A",244,"—In fact, the Australian National Audit Office said it was seven per cent. We were coming down at that stage. In May last year, a spokesman from the Health Insurance Commission said:At present there is no valid basis on which any estimate of the level of inappropriate payment from the public purse can be made with confidence.I think that is now the position of the minister. Nobody knows for sure, although the minister put a figure on it in the budget last year. Last year, in reply to a question that I asked, he said that there would be a $100 million saving alone from pathology—as if that was all due to fraud and overservicing.The minister knows as well as I do that it was due to negotiations that were held between the Health Insurance Commission and the College of Pathologists whereby there were changes in the structure of pathology in relation to the number of pathology practices that were billing and the successive reduction in the rebates given for various procedures over a number of years. Rebates have been dropping behind the consumer price index. In fact, the Auditor-General said:There is no longer a single well established and commonly understood basis for the scheduled fee. Reductions in scheduled fee have generally resulted in reduced observance of scheduled fee by medical practitioners and increased costs for patients.So there is an incentive built in for those who feel that they are badly done by. In fact, last week in my own state a neurosurgeon quite rightly was sent to gaol for defrauding the government. His defence was that he felt he was badly done by because of the rebates that his patients were getting.The government has proposed various amendments, the thrust of which we support. Those amendments came out as a result of the referral of this legislation to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs. I commend the government for taking notice of the report of the Senate standing committee. The proposed amendments were in consultation with the various objections that were raised, and we support them. We support the Democrats amendment No. 3 omitting `the minister may make, and substituting `the minister must make, because that tidies up another small aspect of it. We do not support the rest of the Democrats amendments.There are still problems in relation to this area. At least this is an attempt, in consultation with the profession, to get rid of fraud. Nobody supports fraud. It is a genuine attempt on the part of the government. We still have reservations in relation to the privacy aspect—confidentiality of patients records—which is mentioned in the Australian National Audit Office paper on this bill. But it is actually covered in a subsequent bill—which is consequent to this bill—which will come forward at a later date. With the proviso that we reserve the right to discuss the privacy aspects of the Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Bill 1993, we support the thrust of this bill.","N/A","NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 3) 1993 NURSING HOME CHARGE (IMPOSITION) BILL 1993 HEALTH LEGISLATION (PROFESSIONAL SERVICES REVIEW) AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[3]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
266,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator RICHARDSON","4E4","(New South Wales-","ALP","Minister for Health)",246,"—I table some supplementary explanatory memoranda to the government amendments. It is minor stuff but, nonetheless, it must be done. I would like to cover a few points that have been raised during the second reading debate. Allowing for the fact that this is a cognate debate, I would like first to address some of Senator Pattersons concerns on the Nursing Home Charge (Imposition) Bill before I address the remarks made by Senator Lees and Senator Herron.I was asked about, if you like, the caveat emptor situation for prospective nursing home purchases. The arrangements that are in this bill complement the protection that is already provided by earlier amendments and, subject to compliance with the existing requirements relating to the giving of notice of sale, should provide the protection which Senator Patterson feels is necessary. The purpose of the notice period is to allow sufficient time for any liabilities to be identified and advised, obviously, to both parties but, in particular, to the purchaser prior to a sale. Failure to give correct notice is an offence. Notwithstanding such an offence, the vendor remains liable for any debts incurred prior to the sale.Obviously, because we have these new provisions does not mean that a purchaser should approach any potential nursing home sales transaction with anything less than the usual commercial diligence. On the introduction of the first stage of the amendments, the department sent a circular out to each nursing home operator and to industry representative groups explaining these new arrangements and stressing the continued importance of the buyers making sure that they are aware of any potential liability prior to the sale. The department plans to reinforce that importance at the commencement of these amendments through a further circular as well as in standard correspondence and sale situations. I think I am in a position to guarantee to Senator Patterson that, whenever the department is aware of a potential purchaser, that purchaser will be notified of these arrangements in the bill and, of course, of the need to exercise particular diligence in that situation. That having been said, I wish to turn to the remarks of Senator Lees and Senator Herron.","N/A","NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 3) 1993 NURSING HOME CHARGE (IMPOSITION) BILL 1993 HEALTH LEGISLATION (PROFESSIONAL SERVICES REVIEW) AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[4]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

268,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator RICHARDSON","4E4","(New South Wales-","ALP","Minister for Health)",246,"—What I have said is that, whenever we are aware of a purchaser being involved, we will send that purchaser the document. I gave Senator Patterson that assurance privately when she came around because she had to leave and she was happy with the assurance, so I do not think there is a problem. If there is a problem, I will certainly come back to it, but I am not aware of one.I shall return to what I was about to say concerning the remarks of Senator Lees and Senator Herron. It is interesting to listen to the two of them because one could say that they have an opposite approach. Often in health matters these days I seem to be attacked from the left and the right. It is interesting being in the middle of these attacks. As you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, I have always been a centrist, and I find myself there again. On the one hand, Senator Lees has said that in some way I have been seduced by the AMA, the dreadful trade union representing doctors. On the other hand, a former state president of that same trade union—I had never actually thought of Senator Herron as a trade unionist—offered a different kind of criticism. Both are wrong, and I shall briefly outline why.I do not think it is the case at all that the AMA knocked on my door and came in and said, `Please give us a peer review system in overservicing. That is far from what I think it wanted. I think it would have much preferred that I simply go away and not talk about it at all. But in looking at the governments record over 10 years, I became convinced that a different approach was necessary. First off, I acknowledge what Senator Herron said. The figures are there for anyone to dig out. We have not been able to recover anything like the amounts that I think we should recover. I do not accept the 10 per cent figure to which Senator Herron referred. I have never accepted the 10 per cent figure. I find the seven per cent figure a bit rich as well. I do not think there is any real basis for them. Certainly I cannot provide anybody with data to back up either claim. Until I can find a base, I will not make any outlandish claims.That having been said, we had, first, to approach the difficulty that Brendan Nelson refers to consistently—being able to define what overservicing is. Overservicing is difficult to define. I find it hard, in looking towards the definition that we find here or in listening to anyone elses definition, to believe that I will be the appropriate person to make the decision. I think we have to look to the profession, which is, as far as I am concerned, a noble one. The people in the profession are, in the main, noble servants who do a grand job. I have enough faith in the profession and in its nobility to believe that it can take part in a genuine system of peer review and make sure that the rogues to whom Senator Herron referred are brought to justice and at least made to pay back the money that they need to from overservicing.Both Senator Lees and Senator Herron referred to fraud. I am not going to because this is not a fraud bill. As I understand it, we will get to that later, and I will deal with it when we get to it. So I will not take up the remarks that they made.It is certainly not true to say that the AMA walked in with this proposal and I adopted it. It is true to say that I looked at the work of the Health Insurance Commission and decided not to proceed down its path. I do not deny that. It has been working on that for a while. I did that because, as I said, in reviewing a decades worth of work on this, I thought the basis of the approach that we had been trying was not working and that we ought to try a new one. The reason I thought the approach was not working is essentially that the profession has boycotted and frustrated the process from day one. It has done a pretty good job of it and continues to do so.In the punitive approach, inevitably we got ourselves bogged down in medical services committees of inquiry where legal representation meant that these things took years rather than months, and further appeals followed. In fact, I am staggered by the fact that I am getting correspondence on my desk—I was busily signing some last weekend—where doctors have been involved for seven years in a process before I get to determine the penalty at the end of the day. I find that unacceptable. It must be unacceptable to the government, and I assume that it is unacceptable to the opposition, the Democrats and anybody else who wants to examine it. We cannot have a process that takes so long because, in the end, that is justice to no-one, not even to those who have done the wrong thing in the first place.I knew that the frustration that the profession felt and which it had then demonstrated by its attitude to the process was going to be awfully hard to defeat. I am not one who is afraid of saying, `Lets try getting on together. Lets try a process of peer review where, if all of the noble words you have spoken are true, you will be able to make sure that if the wrong thing is being done it will be stopped.Much more importantly, what the process of peer review can achieve that the processes and the path that we have been down for the last 10 years can never achieve, is an effect on the rest of the profession who are not necessarily being investigated and who are not, therefore, feeling under threat. I wanted members of the whole profession to understand that there was a problem here and that if they were to transgress, then their own peers would come down upon them. I do not think that is a bad idea. I have supported it strongly. I think it has a much better chance of success than the kind of direction that I think Senator Lees is suggesting.I talked not only to the AMA but also to a number of other organisations about it. If one is the health minister and one is looking at who to talk to in the medical profession, one talks to everybody, but it has to be acknowledged that the AMA is the most significant body and it would be pretty foolish to ignore it. I have obviously talked to Dr Peter Stone and his colleagues in their organisation, and all the others, but we cannot ignore the AMA. I must confess that over the last decade there have been a few times when I have wished we could, but we cannot and, therefore, I talked to the AMA. I never wanted it to be seen as the sole preserve of the AMA. I was happy when Senator Lees and others raised in the committee last year that we ought to make sure that the AMA kept to its undertakings and consulted other groups, so I am happy to accept amendments along those lines.I take exception to Senator Leess remarks about it being, in some way, a terrible thing to have the AMA needing to agree before the director is appointed. I think that makes it certain that the director is genuinely independent rather than have the person questioned. If it were the case that I simply stood up and found someone who I thought was appropriate and nominated that person, then there would be no question that that person would be independent of the AMA, but there may well be a question—and certainly it would be a question in the minds of members of the profession—as to what my relationship might be with that person. It would always be a matter of controversy, as it always has been with the HIC.The person who heads up this organisation has, if one reads through the bill, considerable powers. Deciding whether to set up a review committee is, indeed, the heaviest of powers. I think we must have the profession onside for that appointment, otherwise we will go back to the boycott and the frustration of previous years. I am more than happy to discuss a potential head of that body with the AMA and come to an agreement on an appropriate person. That person will then have genuine independence in every decision that he or she makes. It would be very hard for either side to claim bias. That is what I believe is fundamental and necessary and so I am happy to do it.As to the other remark about treating doctors crimes as less serious than social security fraud or other forms of white collar crime, I think we will demonstrate with the fraud legislation that this is a matter that will be pursued ruthlessly and toughly. Fraud is fraud. It is different to this; there is no definition. That is straight out stealing from the Commonwealth and if people are going to do that then, as far as I am concerned, they go to gaol. It is not a matter for any committee of inquiry to look into; it is a police matter and that is what it will be seen to be, but we will debate that on another day.I have taken the view that if there were weaknesses with the HIC—and certainly the HIC never pretended that there were not weaknesses—and difficulties in it proceeding down the path of chasing doctors in the last 10 years, then a change would be necessary. I am delighted that it would appear these bills are going to be passed without any major opposition.I cannot finish my remarks without referring to Senator Herrons reference to bulk-billing. There are the odd magnificent obsessions that run around the place from time to time and we have another example tonight. Members of the AMA have been getting themselves into a lather about bulk-billing for a decade. I am grateful for this because it has meant that they have got their Liberal Party mates in the same lather and have dragged them along the path of opposing bulk-billing on every occasion. We have dined out very well on this and we are happy. Keep it up. This is a major plus for us—although I note that Senator Herrons colleague, Senator Newman, has now started to say, `We might have to look at bulk-billing. Gary Nehl, the honourable member for Cowper in the other place, who put out a very nasty letter bitterly criticising Dr Hewson and some of his colleagues—I was most appalled at the strength of the language in it—has also said that we have got to do something about that.I want to make a couple of points about why bulk-billing is irrelevant in this argument and why it is not the case that if we get rid of bulk-billing we get rid of overservicing. Firstly, in round figures, about $3 billion of services are bulk-billed each year.","N/A","NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 3) 1993 NURSING HOME CHARGE (IMPOSITION) BILL 1993 HEALTH LEGISLATION (PROFESSIONAL SERVICES REVIEW) AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[4]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

At the end of the day, there is still $2 billion of the $3 billion there. So if bulk-billing was the cause, two-thirds of the cause would not even be touched and opposition senators could not expect any of us to believe that the whole of the overservicing exists in the other $1 billion.

278,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator RICHARDSON","4E4","(New South Wales-","ALP","Minister for Health)",246,"—I am going to make my point anyway. When we look at the service data for what happens here, we see, and it is worth noting, that in New South Wales there is a bulk-billing rate of 64 per cent and 9 1/2 services per head per year. I think that was in 1989-90. I am using that year because that was the year the audit office used; I am sure that is right. In Tasmania, where the bulk-billing rate was much less at 45 per cent, there were only 7 1/2 services per head per year. So there is this great conclusion: less bulk-billing, fewer services.There is a problem with that assertion. That assertion ignores the rest of the evidence. In Western Australia in the same year, there was a bulk-billing rate of 56 per cent—a lot higher than in Tasmania but, nonetheless, less than in New South Wales—and the services per head dropped to seven per year. I would like to find out why this disparity occurs. I know that it has naught to do with bulk-billing. It is obvious, on the face of those facts, that the opposition cannot pursue it, but I am glad honourable senators opposite laugh and I am glad they keep doing it.The last bit of evidence from last week is that 87 per cent of Australians think that bulk-billing is a good idea. I tell you what—those 87 per cent of Australians usually work things out pretty well. When it is that overwhelming, those opposite ought to wake up and go along with it. But if they do not, we stay here and they stay there and I always like that. I commend the virtues of bulk-billing, I certainly commend all three bills and I am delighted to hear that the Senate will not be opposing them.Question resolved in the affirmative.Bills read a second time.","N/A","NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 3) 1993 NURSING HOME CHARGE (IMPOSITION) BILL 1993 HEALTH LEGISLATION (PROFESSIONAL SERVICES REVIEW) AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[4]/talk.start[7]/para","N/A","N/A"

They are considering items that are, of their nature, technical—in some cases highly technical—and I think they will be much better debated by those who understand those technicalities.This goes back to what I said before. Even when dealing with the definition of overservicing it is not a matter of what a consumer believes to be overservicing. I find it hard to define it without the profession because it is the profession telling us what is appropriate, in the first place, and, by definition, if we are being told that, we are being told what is inappropriate. I find it hard to understand how we can go to consumers in this situation. It is the same argument as applied with the committees, so I still have to oppose it.

The thrust is to have a peer review committee to call before it a professional colleague to discuss the manner in which these services are provided, whether they are appropriate or not, and that is the point which I think Senator Lees has missed.The consumer may consider them inappropriate for whatever reason but, if this is to work, the medical practitioner who is called before the committee must feel confident that he or she is being judged by a peer group on the services that are provided—not on their appropriateness or otherwise, but on the number of services provided, whether this equates with whatever group they appear before. It may be a chiropractor, a dentist or an optometrist, not just medical practitioners. So having a consumer there is inappropriate in these circumstances for the purposes of the bill.In many other respects it may be appropriate, but particularly in relation to the overservicing provisions, most of the time, despite the quality of the consumer representatives proposed and their understanding, they are still not members of that professional group, whether it be chiropractors, optometrists or whatever.

303,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator HILL","BH4","(South Australia-","LP","Leader of the Opposition)",252,"—The coalition will support the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Bill which will give effect to Australias obligations as a party to the Chemical Weapons Convention, lead to the ratification of the convention and provide a legislative basis for its national implementation. In the 95 years since the first attempts at The Hague conference on chemical weapons and in the 69 years since their use—but not possession—was outlawed under the 1925 Geneva protocol, the international community has been trying to ban chemical weapons. The achievement of international agreement on this in January 1993 was a significant milestone. We applaud the efforts of the international community in having outlawed some of the most abhorrent and horrific of all weapons of mass destruction. The Chemical Weapons Convention is the first treaty in history to ban the development, acquisition, stockpiling, retention, transfer or use of an entire category of weapons.The coalition would like to give appropriate recognition to the role that Australia played. I make particular mention of the efforts of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, and his department over the years. Because of my particular interest in this area, I witnessed the efforts of many dedicated and capable officers in his department. They can all be proud of the contribution that Australia made to the achievement of this very important agreement. The coalition is particularly pleased with the support gained within the Asia-Pacific region for the convention. We urge our regional neighbours to continue this commitment by ratifying the convention at the earliest opportunity.The difficulties inherent in the complex negotiations for the convention reflect the problems the international community has been facing and will continue to face as a result of the end of the Cold War. The so-called new world order, which was so optimistically talked of and which was to reflect a new era of global cooperation, has failed to eventuate. Instead, the international community is continuing to wrestle with a whole range of intractable problems—from bloody conflict in Bosnia to starvation in Africa, from political instability and economic hardship in Russia to human rights abuses in Burma. The list is long and difficult.The question becomes that of what the international community can do to reach agreement on such difficult issues. To date, efforts, whilst diligent, have not been impressive. The issue of human rights, for instance, stands as an example of an international issue on which little agreement has been reached. The Vienna conference last year, which was designed to reach a greater international consensus on the undeniable need for consistency in the respect for human rights, did much to illustrate the divisions which exist but little to implement the practical schemes to ensure that individuals rights are universally respected. In other words, a convention is not enough; it is just simply a starting point.The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction—be they chemical, biological or nuclear—is potentially one of the most threatening developments of our age. The technology to deliver these weapons is becoming more widely available. Some states are showing little hesitation in selling both the knowledge and the materials necessary for their development—that is, both the warheads and the delivery vehicles. The continuing proliferation actions of states such as North Korea remain totally unacceptable to countries like Australia. The threats arising from possession of such weapons, the destabilising results and the uncertainty generated can trigger chain reactions that could lead to devastating outcomes.In the area of arms control and disarmament, the weakness of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the role of the IAEA, as illustrated recently over North Korea, has become deeply disturbing. The need to strengthen and expand the missile technology control regime is urgent, as evidenced by the sales of sophisticated technology, even from within our region. Now that the Cold War has ended, the case for a comprehensive test ban treaty, particularly after Chinas large nuclear test last year, has strengthened.The Chemical Weapons Convention is a step towards more encompassing arms control regimes. Although it has gained a more significant outcome than other international negotiations, it still suffers from similar problems. This is particularly the case with respect to the difficult problem of how the international community can bring pressure to bear on states which have no intention of conforming with the spirit or requirements of the Chemical Weapons Convention or often of other such issues. The issue of compliance—how to encourage and enforce it—remains a major challenge to the international community.I turn briefly to the level of support for the CWC. To date, 154 countries have signed the convention but only four have ratified it. The treaty will come into force when 65 signatories have ratified it. Australia is seeking to provide on example by promptly passing this legislation. We support that example. Let us hope that others will do likewise.The coalition is concerned about the limited international support the convention is receiving from those countries most likely to be interested in possessing, or which indeed already possess, chemical weapons. Not only have states such as North Korea not signed the convention; most middle eastern nations have not signed either. Given that the Middle East is the only certain theatre since World War II where chemical weapons have been used, this omission is obviously unsettling.Chemical weapons are not difficult to make. The extent of Iraqs extensive chemical weapons program discovered after the Gulf War is an illustration of the ease with which states can develop and conceal huge chemical weapons arsenals. Iraq has declared, for example, 140,000 chemical weapons, 600 tonnes of bulk chemical warfare agent and 3,500 tonnes of precursor stock to United Nations inspectors, but it has still not been possible to determine whether this is in fact the total stockpile. Without the cooperation of the country concerned it would be therefore very difficult to enforce the provisions of the convention, whether that particular country is a signatory or not.About 20 states are believed to possess chemical weapons, many of which will not sign or ratify the convention. Therefore, as I said a moment ago, greater efforts need to be made to find ways in which such countries can be brought on board to accept the importance of the principles of this convention, and how it can enhance their security rather than threaten it. From there, apart from the issue of a cooperative enforcement regime, the international community has got to look to other ways in which it might be more effectively enforced in relation to states that are not willing to comply. I want to look briefly at verification. The effectiveness of the convention will also be limited by the effectiveness of its inspection and verification regime, which is already less than perfect. This was the most difficult part of the negotiations for the final agreement, and the verification provisions were then substantially watered down.The convention now provides for two verification regimes—a routine monitoring regime involving declarations and systematic inspections; and a challenge inspection regime where any state can request an inspection of any facility in any other state. Both regimes are likely to be limited in their effectiveness and dependent upon state cooperation. Problems such as we are witnessing in North Korea with respect to its refusal to allow adequate IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities despite it being a signatory to the NPT illustrate the likely difficulties ahead.Another concern I have with the convention is the exceptions to it. I read that the use of chemicals for `law enforcement including domestic riot control purposes—article II 9(d)—is not prohibited under the convention. There seems to be some ambiguity about this, but it is not hard to imagine ways in which states could develop chemicals for what they refer to as domestic riot control that could have other uses. The use of that as a means to avoid the effectiveness of the convention, and how that is going to be regulated, is something we are yet to see in detail. On its face, it does appear to be an obvious omission or concession that unfortunately can be abused.I want also to mention the role of industry. The Australian chemical industry has been totally supportive of this legislation and the convention and the process leading to the convention, and I commend it for that. It is obviously essential that chemical companies comply with a range of laws to ensure their safe operation. I hope that the government will ensure that there is not an unnecessary burden imposed on such companies which are pursuing genuine legitimate business aims in the need to comply with the convention. Of course, such compliance is paramount.On this side of the chamber, we have some little concern with aspects of the cost. We note that Australias annual contribution to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, based in the Hague, is estimated to be about $1.7m. That is one thing, but we also see that Australia is going to establish its own chemical weapons convention office at a cost of another quarter of a million dollars. We do not see, without further explanation, exactly why that could not be done within existing resources and within the skills of DFAT; that might be something that the minister is willing to address in his reply.In conclusion, the convention does need to be strengthened. This is obvious from what I have outlined today. The coalition would urge that every effort be made bilaterally and multilaterally to overcome its shortcomings. The signing and ratification of the convention obviously must not be seen as the end point. It may not be the starting point but it is only a step along what is still a very difficult road. The convention must continue to evolve so that there can be greater reassurance that such weapons are effectively outlawed.Although the convention does have limitations, it is an important step towards banning weapons which have an immediate and appallingly detrimental effect on human life and which should never be countenanced as a weapon of war. We on this side of the chamber will continue to maintain our long running support for the elimination of such weapons of mass destruction and thus we are pleased to support the bill.","N/A","CHEMICAL WEAPONS (PROHIBITION) BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
304,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MARGETTS","DX5","(Western Australia)","GWA","N/A",255,"—The Greens (WA) will be supporting the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Bill 1993. I would like to look at a couple of aspects of international security in light of the chemical weapons convention. Some points have been made by Senator Hill. It is good to see that there is some degree of support from both sides of the parliament for continuing work on these aspects.Firstly, much gratitude is due to the people of the Australian government, at diplomatic forums and in departmental roles, for their current impressive success. There are, however, some matters that will require the further commitment of the Australian government and the international community. Unfortunately, the convention does not have universal coverage. Its greatest weakness in trying to provide stability in the international security environment is that some nations have not yet signed, and this has already been mentioned. Still, the emphasis is on `yet. Efforts can and must continue to make it truly encompassing.The government will require the political will to keep up the pressure, firstly, at the United Nations level, where Australia can work on nations to sign the convention. There will be international conferences on chemical weapons where the importance to join can be stressed; and there are the usual diplomatic avenues through which Australia can promote the convention bilaterally. I certainly hope that the government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) can maintain the good work of this convention which we are all so proud of.One of the encouraging points to look at is: what sort of a model does the convention provide for further reaching nuclear disarmament? While this convention might not easily transpose itself to the question of nuclear weapons, the level of cooperation and commitment from the international community is clear evidence that weapons of mass destruction can be renounced.Chemical weapons have enjoyed momentary and marginalised praise in their history, having mostly received the condemnation due to weapons of mass destruction. On the other hand, the existence of nuclear weapons is entertained in many international bodies. Why is it, especially in the post-Cold War age, that there is not the political will to remove them too? The Nuclear Proliferation Treaty is a problematic treaty, for it is discriminatory in nature, accepting that some nations have nuclear weapons, and not providing mechanisms sufficiently able to remove them from the international security playing field. Indeed, the United Nations Security Council has its roots in the nuclear age, giving permanent membership status to those who first possessed the atomic bomb. It is like a club and that is the ticket by which one can join.A new process is needed. This means opposing an indefinite extension to the current nuclear proliferation treaty next year. I hope that this will be the focus of the Australian government. To push for an indefinite extension will be to provide for the indefinite existence of the nuclear threat.","N/A","CHEMICAL WEAPONS (PROHIBITION) BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
305,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MacGIBBON","YH4","(Queensland)","LP","N/A",255,"—I have much pleasure in supporting the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Bill 1993. It is an important further step on the path to controlling weapons of mass destruction. It must be said, as Senator Hill pointed out, that it has some limitations. It is an imperfect bill and it will not have the effectiveness, and therefore the force of law, that it sets out to attain.Being realistic, that is probably the best that can be done in the present circumstances. The government is to be congratulated on the international support it has worked so hard to get for a chemical weapons treaty. It provides national recognition of Australias bipartisan opposition to chemical weapons.While the public memory of chemical weapons has faded, this country has a considerable experience of chemical weapons on the battlefield, dating from the First World War, when the Germans introduced a range of chemical gases—chlorine, phosgene, mustard and lewisite, to name some of them—which had devastating effects on Australian troops.It is interesting to read the battalion histories of some of the units involved in the First World War when gas was introduced. The soldiers talked about hearing the start of an artillery barrage—then the lack of any detonating, high explosive shells coming into the lines, only the soft plop of gas shells falling into the mud. Within the circumstances of the First World War, the fixed positions and the rigidities of trench warfare where one had high concentrations of troops in very precise positions—positions that could be located—the effect of chemical warfare in the form of gas was probably at its highest. Thousands of members of the AIF died of gas and, sadly, many more died 10, 15, 25 years after the First World War as a result of the effects of gas.","N/A","CHEMICAL WEAPONS (PROHIBITION) BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

307,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MacGIBBON","YH4","(Queensland)","LP","N/A",255,"—The father of one of my school friends died of the effects about 25 years after the war. As Senator Collins said, those poor souls endured miserable lives with their scarred lungs.Recently, we saw the use of chemical weapons, both poisonous and nerve gases, by the Iraqis against the Iranians, in their long conflict in the 1980s, and against their own people, the Kurds.I wanted to speak on this bill because I have been actively involved in the arms control debate in the past. I was very active in the Senate and in the general public debate in the last of the pacifist cycles—for want of a better word—in the early to mid-1980s. There we had to counter the impractical policies of the nuclear disarmament groups. We had to argue for safer arms control measures, and the basic policy that we followed on this side of the chamber was the need for mutual arms reductions between both the West and the Soviet group; for verifiable procedures in relation to those reductions; and for balanced reductions of the forces so that neither side got an advantage. While we were not very strongly supported on that by the Australian Labor Party, interestingly, when it came into government, it adopted the policies that we had been espousing through the 1970s and the 1980s on that.I return to the bill. It follows on the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which went through this Parliament in 1968 and was passed into law in 1970. That treaty was one of the many great achievements of the Liberal government which brought the golden age to Australian politics in the 1950s, 1960s and the early 1970s. It is true to say that despite its limitations—because the nuclear non-proliferation treaty has the same limitations as this bill which Senator Hill went through, as evidenced by the inspection procedures which North Korea has not complied with in recent times—the nuclear non-proliferation treaty was a pacesetter at the time and certainly in advance of its time.Chemical weapons fall into a class of weapons which are known loosely as weapons of mass destruction—the nuclear, chemical and biological group. The basis of the opposition to the use of those weapons is broadly on the lines that they are non-specific—their effect is not primarily restricted to the combatants in an armed combat. Generally, they are quite indiscriminate with respect to their targets. In the jargon of the times, they have a high degree of collateral damage—they damage civilian lives or civilian properties. Another characteristic may be a long-term or a residual effect.In the arms control debate, nuclear weapons have attracted most attention in the last 40-odd years because they are the newest and the most dramatic of the trio. The Cold War was fought successfully on a policy of deterrence. That particular form of deterrence was that of mutual assured destruction, which meant that if a pre-emptive nuclear strike was made by either the Soviets or the West against the other superpower bloc at the time, there would still be a residual power to strike back and to paralyse the opponent, so that nobody would win out of it.I said at the time and on many occasions that, while I supported the policy because it simply was the only practical alternative we had at the time to succumbing to the Soviet Union, I always recognised that, while it had great dangers, it would never survive into the future and that some other sort of technology would emerge in the fullness of time to maintain the balance of peace between these two groups. Of course, it is a matter of history that, instead, the Soviet Union collapsed with great rapidity, to the surprise of all of us. We then saw the end of the Cold War and since then we have seen the beginning of the dismantling of the worlds nuclear arsenals.Unquestionably, security from nuclear attack or from nuclear misadventure now has been very significantly reduced compared to what it was a decade ago; but we will never get rid of nuclear weapons. Sadly, there will be a need for somebody to maintain them in the world because we simply cannot tolerate one nation holding the rest of the world to ransom by the possession of a nuclear weapon.Even though the tensions relating to the Cold War have diminished, there are still a number of residual problems coming from the great arsenals that existed in the 1970s and 1980s. It is impossible to know the number of nuclear weapons in the world. Some estimates are that the United States had about 50,000 weapons, so presumably the Soviets had about the same. To that one has to add the arsenals of France and the United Kingdom. So a figure in excess of 100,000 nuclear weapons may not be an unreal estimate.The other element that we have to look to is the way the weapon inventories have been maintained. In the Western nations the inventories are reasonably accurate. As weapons were replaced by successive technological advances, the preceding generation of weapons was either dismantled or destroyed. It is a very different situation in the Soviet Union or its successors. Firstly, its inventory control is nowhere near as tight as that which existed in the Western nations.Since the breakup of the Soviet Union the control of those weapons has moved into various hands. We have seen the rivalry over the possession of nuclear weapons between the state of Ukraine and the CIS. I am absolutely certain that, given the breakup in the social order in the Soviet states, nuclear weapons have been sold to third countries about which we know nothing.One of the most worrying things about the Soviet Union was that it apparently never destroyed any weapons when they were replaced by more advanced designs—weapons went into various stockpiles. It is accepted that all the nuclear weapons built in the Soviet Union still exist there. Given the lack of inventory control, that is very worrying for the world in relation to arms control.Another problem with nuclear weapons is the covert acquisition of nuclear weapons by countries like Israel, India, Pakistan, South Africa and, of particular relevance to Australia, North Korea. While we would all love to get rid of nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons technology now is available to countries which have money. There has been a proliferation of nuclear weapons and we simply cannot contemplate any nation being held to ransom by another nation with a nuclear weapon.Debate interrupted.","N/A","CHEMICAL WEAPONS (PROHIBITION) BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

309,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator SANDY MACDONALD","CX5","(New South Wales)","NP","N/A",257,"—I rise to speak very briefly tonight in support of the Hunter Valley bid for the $1 billion Royal Australian Navy minehunter contract. Three companies have been invited by the Commonwealth to tender for the project which involves building and fitting out six state-of-the-art minehunters. The companies are Australian Defence Industries, Australian Submarine Corporation and Transfield Shipbuilding.New South Wales—and particularly the Hunter region—is far ahead of the other centres vying for the contract. The Hunter Valley is one of the powerhouses of the Australian economy, with the resources and industry necessary to grow and add much to the nations wealth. Let me outline some of New South Wales, and particularly Newcastles, advantages over its competitors.New South Wales has the highest concentration of advanced high technology, electronic and computer system suppliers. New South Wales has the largest glass reinforced plastic facility in Australia. It is the home of both of the preferred sonar suppliers, and most of the other potential suppliers of the crucial elements to the combat systems. It has a greater concentration of manufacturing and high technology research and development companies than the other locations. New South Wales houses the Navy fleet base, maritime headquarters, mine warfare base and mine warfare systems centre. The vessels will be based at HMAS Waterhen in Sydney. The Navy trials, training and evaluation programs will be carried out in Sydney. Being close to the Navy is both cost-effective and convenient. Forty five per cent of Australias electronic and electrical engineers, and 40 per cent of our computer professionals, live in New South Wales.The project will create up to 1,000 jobs, which will last during the eight year life-span of the project. The successful bidder and its overseas design partners are required to build the vessels achieving at least 60 per cent Australian content. New South Wales is the only state where the necessary breadth and depth of skills and technological capacity to facilitate this level of Australian content can be achieved at an acceptable price.The project will attract more investment to Australia from businesses wishing to capitalise in the attractive infrastructure base of the Hunter Valley. It will also underpin great export opportunities for the nation; exports essential for our continued economic recovery, especially in the light of todays weak balance of trade figures.It is only fair that the region receives the contract after losing the frigate and submarine contracts over the last few years. Newcastle has established shipbuilding sites, the expertise and, most of all, the will to complete this project to world class standards. It is an area of great economic and social potential, and Newcastle and the Hunter Valley need to be nourished by government. The area needs to be nourished for the benefit of all industry. What better nourishment could there be than this $1 billion contract?Newcastle has a long tradition when it comes to shipbuilding. It is a wonderful port, has a wonderful harbour, has a concentration of the necessary skills and has a commitment to excellence. It is a natural choice for a project of this magnitude. I commend Newcastle to the three bidders, and I commend Newcastle and the Hunter Valley to the government.Question resolved in the affirmative.Senate adjourned at 7.34 pm","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/debate.sub1/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The InterGovernmental agreement, recently endorsed by the Commonwealth Government outlines that guidelines for the management of these areas are currently being developed by State agencies and that consultation with the Commonwealth will be part of this process. Therefore I would expect my Department to be consulted on these prescriptions to ensure that Commonwealth environmental obligations are satisfied by the proposed management prescriptions.(2) It is my intention to continue to promote the conservation initiatives of the NFPS. This particularly includes the avoidance of activities in likely high conservation value forests pending their assessment for inclusion in a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system.

331,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Senator McMullan","5I4","TAS","ALP","N/A",285,"—I have been advised that the answer to the honourable senators question is as follows:(1) The entry in the Purchasing and Disposals Gazette of 17 November 1993, to which the honourable Senator refers, concerns the estimated value of a three year common use arrangement for supply of panel systems and link desking to Commonwealth agencies and other users throughout Australia. The arrangement was established by Purchasing Australia, a Division of my Department.Common use arrangements are not contracts in the strict legal sense. They are standing offers by suppliers to supply goods or services at the price agreed and on specified terms and conditions if they are ordered by the Commonwealth. A contract is formed only when an order is placed under the arrangement for specific goods or services.Finance Regulation 43B requires that departments notify in the Gazette:details of any contract arranged for supplies to be procured or used in Australia where the estimated liability of the Commonwealth is not less than $2000;standing offers to supply; andorders placed under standing offer arrangements if the value of the contract established by the order exceeds $2000The title of the common use arrangement, panel systems and link desking, does not refer to a single item of furniture. The arrangement covers design and supply of the panels used to divide office space (panel systems) and linked work-surfaces (linked desking). Eight panel systems and seven linked desking systems are available from seven appointed suppliers.(2) When an order for supply of a particular system is placed on a supplier, the ordering officer specifies the location of that system. The system could be required in offices anywhere in Australia.(3) Seven of the eight panel systems are fully Australian made. In the case of the eighth panel system, some metal framing and brackets are imported as they are made by the companys overseas parent.Six of the seven link desking systems are fully Australian made. The seventh link desking system has an imported rolled steel beam. With the exception of this beam, this system is made in Australia under licence for an overseas company.Some minor hardware items on some of the systems are imported if satisfactory Australian alternatives are not available.(4) Twenty-four tenders incorporating forty-two systems were received.(5) Tenders were assessed on the extent to which they complied with contractual and technical requirements and relevant Government policies stated in the Request for Tender as well as their cost-effectiveness. The following specific selection criteria were used:Compliance with the mandatory requirements of the specifications;Compliance with applicable SAA codes Telecom and Local Electricity Authority requirements;System flexibility and reliability;Meeting mandatory testing requirements;Wiring reticulation and cable management;Provision of and flexibility of services outlets;Acoustic properties of screening components;Stability and rigidity of connection components;Safety and ergonomic requirements.(6) As I advised the honourable Senator in answer to his first question, the value stated in the Gazette, $34,000,000, was the estimated value of a three year common use arrangement, not the value of a specific purchase. Based on information provided to Purchasing Australia by suppliers, the turnover on the previous common use arrangement was $39,273,855 over thirty-nine months.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[8]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

333,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Senator McMullan","5I4","TAS","ALP","N/A",286,"—I have been advised that the answer to the honourable senators question is as follows:(1) $6,500 was paid by cheque to Lincoln Downs as a deposit on 5 October 1993.(2) The balance has not been paid as the deposit relates to a training conference scheduled for 20 to 25 February 1994.(3) The planned function is a training conference for the Australian Archives involving staff from two national program areas across Australia. The first two days will be attended by staff responsible for implementing the Records Evaluation and Disposal Program. The issues that will be addressed are primarily strategic issues for the forthcoming three year planning cycle, discussions on the national workplan for next year, and a range of technical matters to bring staff up to date on current developments and changes in disposal policy and practice.The final two days will involve staff from the Access and Client Services Program and will also address strategic and operational issues associated with the delivery of access and information services to public and official clients over the next three years as well as consideration of improvements and changes planned for implementation over that period.A one day joint session is scheduled for staff from both programs together with representatives from two Canberra based programs, Public Affairs and Technical Training, at which the focus will be on service delivery issues related to Commonwealth records with a high use potential for research and of other interest to the community.(4) It is expected that the training conference will be attended by approx. 80 staff although not all will attend on all days as indicated in (3) above. Corporate Policy and Support is the Branch of Australian Archives which carries out financial and accounting functions and arranged for the deposit to be paid.(5) As indicated at (2) above the training conference is planned for 20 to 25 February 1994.(6) The payments to Lincoln Downs will cover accommodation, meals and use of conference/training facilities. Final costs will be dependent on final attendance figures. However, it is calculated that for the planned 80 staff to attend, the cost would be $106 per head, per day, for accommodation, meals and the use of conference facilities. The estimated total cost is $25,625 for the 5 day conference of which a $6,500 deposit has been paid, see (1) above.(7) Other costs involve travel, staff time for the administration and organisation of the conference and preparation of papers. The estimated cost of travel, again dependent on final figures, is $15,291.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[9]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The contract called for qualitative and quantitative pre-campaign research, qualitative campaign tracking research, and qualitative and quantitative campaign evaluation research. The pre-campaign research began in August/September 1993 and was completed in November 1993. Other stages of the research have not yet been undertaken.The pre-campaign qualitative research took the form of 11 small group discussions (approx eight people per group) held in Melbourne, Brisbane, Newcastle, Albury and Sydney. The pre-campaign quantitative research took the form of 150 employer telephone interviews (100 in metropolitan and 50 in rural areas); and 600 employee telephone interviews conducted nationally. Both qualitative and quantitative research surveyed a cross section of ages, gender and nationality and included union and non-union members.(3) The research indicated a lack of knowledge and understanding among employers and employees of workplace bargaining and the award system. Knowledge of the proposed changes to the Industrial Relations Act and how they will affect individuals and companies was shown to be scant and misconceptions high amongst both employers and employees. The research found there was a clear need to inform employers and employees about the changes.(4) The Department of Industrial Relations.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[10]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Information supplied by DCNR indicates that, as a result of preliminary analysis of the survey, 74% of old-growth in East Gippsland will be represented in conservation reserves or areas excluded from harvesting within State forests; that a minimum of 60% of old-growth of timber producing ecological vegetation classes will be protected from harvesting; and that it is anticipated that old-growth in other ecological vegetation classes will be protected in at least 90% of its area.(2) DCNR is currently developing a Forest Management Plan for the East Gippsland Forest Management Area. Information from the joint study of National Estate values in the region, the old-growth forest study, and the updating of the National Wilderness Inventory will be taken into account in developing the Plan.In the light of preliminary analysis of the old-growth survey, I am advised that Victoria has made some amendments to its 1993/94 Wood Utilisation Plan for East Gippsland, which was developed in 1992/93. I understand that some harvesting of old-growth forest in East Gippsland in 1993/94 will be necessary to enable Victoria to meet its contractual sawlog commitments to the local industry.(3) I am unfamiliar with the details of the allocation of sawlogs to Andrews Mill. Resource management and land use planning are primarily the responsibilities of the State Government.(4) I am advised that lowland forest in East Gippsland has been utilised since World War II and does yield sawlogs.(5) Projections of future sawlog supply vary according to the underlying assumptions on which they are made, however several recent reports support the notion that softwood plantations have significant potential for expansion in supplying Victorias future timber resources.The Victorian Auditor-Generals Special Report No. 22 of May 1993, reports that the Victorian softwood industry has been steadily increasing its share of the sawn timber market throughout the 1980s. Projections of softwood sawlog supplies in the Report indicate that Victoria is in a sound position to support an expanding softwood industry, however there may be regional variations in ability to meet sawlog commitments.A report on the Wood Products Industry in Victoria by the Victorian Wood Products Working Party, published in June 1993, predicts that within 10 years Victorias softwood plantations could produce a sawn timber resource equivalent to current domestic consumption.(6) Several socio-economic surveys have been conducted in the East Gippsland area, primarily associated with the increase in National Parks in the late 1980s.(7) The Forest Management Plan for East Gippsland is currently being prepared by DCNR.

347,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Senator Gareth Evans","VD4","WA","ALP","N/A",291,"—The answer to the honourable senators question is as follows :The Government is aware of the CNRM peace plan, presented by Mr Jose Ramos Horta, Special Representative of the CNRM, to the Council of Foreign Relations in New York on 14 May 1992. The Government is familiar with the details of the plan.(a), (b), (c) : The Government commented on the peace proposal when it was presented in 1992. I refer the honourable senator to my reply to a Question without Notice recorded in the Senate Hansard of 28 May 1992 (p. 2909). At that time the Government made it clear that while the peace proposal was interesting it was not one on which the Government proposed to take any action. This remains the Governments position. The reasons for this are as follows.(i) It is by no means clear that the proposal has the full support of the East Timorese community. For example, on the World Today radio program of 21 May 1992, Australia—based East Timorese activist Mr Alfredo Ferreira was reported as saying that he doubted whether there would be widespread support for the idea of ceasing to resist Indonesian rule, and that Mr Hortas views were his own and did not necessarily represent the views of other East Timorese.(ii) To the extent that the proposal leaves open the question of sovereignty over East Timor, it is inconsistent with the position of the Australian Government. In 1979 the then Coalition Government extended de jure recognition of Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor. This has been maintained by successive Labor Governments.The Government continues to regard the peace plan as a matter for the Indonesian Government. As the Government said at the time the proposal was presented in 1992, if the peace plan had the effect of contributing to the longer—term reconciliation process in East Timor, the Government would welcome it. The Government has long made known its views on the need for a reconciliation process in the province and has urged the Indonesian authorities to sit down with the people of East Timor, including the armed resistance, in a forward—looking spirit. The Government believes a reconciliation process in East Timor would include improved social and economic development in the province and greater recognition of its distinctive cultural identity. The Government has also made clear that the security forces need to be more sensitive to the needs and aspirations of the East Timorese, and that a reduction in troop numbers would be a major step towards improving the situation in East Timor. The Government has indicated to the Indonesian authorities that reconciliation might be assisted by giving the people of East Timor a significantly greater say in the running of their affairs, and possibly some greater degree of autonomy.The Government welcomes the Indonesian Governments announced plan to downgrade the nature and level of its military presence in East Timor. The disbanding of the provinces special military command in April 1993, leaving the provincial level command to assume security management of the province, places military arrangements in line with those in other provinces in Indonesia.(d) In the circumstances, the Government does not intend to raise this peace plan proposal with the Indonesian Government. It can be assumed that the Indonesian Government is aware of the matter.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[16]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The arrangement was established by Purchasing Australia, a Division of my Department.Common use arrangements are not contracts in the strict legal sense. They are standing offers by suppliers to supply goods or services at the price agreed and on specified terms and conditions ifthey are ordered by the Commonwealth. A contract is formed only when an order is placed under the arrangement for specific goods or services.Finance Regulation 43B requires that departments notify in the Gazette :details of any contract arranged for supplies to be procured or used in Australia where the estimated liability of the Commonwealth is not less than $2000;standing offers to supply, the estimated value of which is not less than $2000;and orders placed under standing offer arrangements if the value of the contract established by the order exceeds $2000.The three companies listed in the Gazette are the suppliers appointed to provide drapes or blinds when ordered by Customers within the specified areas in Queensland.(2) The value stated in the Gazette , $725 000, is the estimated total value of the common use arrangement over three years, not the value of a specific purchase.(3) Selection of materials and fabrics from the commercial ranges available from the three appointed suppliers is a matter for the ordering agency.The following details are provided for the information of the honourable Senator:Vertical drapes and holland blinds—some Australian fabrics are available but most fabrics are imported;Venetian blinds—the aluminium strips are imported in a large roll. They are cut to size in Australia and combined with local track and cord;Pleated blinds—all the fabrics are imported as none is available locally.It is estimated that the local labour component in the cost of manufacturing (i.e. making the blinds or drapes, providing the tracks and assembly), excluding the supply of fabric, is 60 per cent on average across all four types of window furnishings.(4) and (5) Each time a Customer requires drapes or blinds, it obtains quotes from one or more appointed suppliers. The cost for each window varies according to the size of the window, the materials or fabric chosen and the location. The following indicative examples are provided for the information of the honourable Senator:N/A——————————————————————————————————————-Material Labour——————————————————————————————————————-Vertical Drapes—Size 6m by 2.7m dropTrack 6m @ $20 $120Installation $60Blades, 54 @ $1.35 $72.90Chain, 6.5m @ $0.80 $5.20$125.20 $132.90TOTAL: $258.10.Add fabric at cost plus 20%.
