In New South Wales, the Silo Board is prescribed by State legislation as the monopoly receiver and handler. So it is beyond the competence of the Australian Wheat Board or of federal authorities to deal directly with this matter. It is not to be thought that it would be easy to establish a system for grading all wheat, because the physical requirements of handling a crop amounting to millions of tons are not easily arranged. But the Australian Wheat Board, as a matter of practice, does sell undergrade wheat to stockfeeders at a discount. At present it has some millions of bushels which are being offered to stockfeeders at a discount of 6d. a bushel.

Also, under the Quarantine Act, the federal Minister for Health may issue certain types of drugs free of charge under such conditions as he sees fit. Existing legislation, therefore, gives the Australian Government automatic control of the rationing and distribution of the vaccine. Now that we have some certainty of supplies ahead, the State governments will be called together. The question of administration will be discussed on the lines of the States taking over the vaccine imported by the Australian Government and handling it just as they are doing for diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus toxoids. The whole position oi the ultimate real value of the vaccine, and of the most effective way in which to handle it, is in the experimental stage. It is necessary, therefore, to keep exact records of every case. We received new.from America this morning that, unfortunately, in California several children have died, apparently as a result of inoculation, and I am sure the House would like to express its deep sympathy with those who have lost their children The particular firm that supplied the substance has been precluded from making further sales. The vaccination of school children will enable the vaccine to he more easily handled, and as fairly large numbers of patients will be given injections in groups the danger of deterioration of the vaccine will be lessened. The vaccine is being provided in ampules of three doses and of nine doses. Consequently, if a number of children could be treated together, all of the vaccine could be used at once, and there would not be the slightest danger of its deteriorating as a result of being kept overnight. To keep vaccine overnight is a very dangerous practice. Honorable members will probably remember that at Bundaberg about 30 years ago there were quite a number of deaths from diphtheria because the serum had been kept overnight.

In the establishment of the uraniummining industry in Australia there have been several notable developments since the 30th June, 1954. An example is the bringing into production of the u raniium deposits at Rum Jungle, in the Northern Territory, where a large and complex treatment plant constructed by Consolidated Zinc Proprietary Limited, as agent for the Commonwealth, was formally opened by the Prime Minister on the 17 th September, 1954. This plant is now successfully producing uranium oxide, two substantial shipments of which have already left Darwin for delivery to the Combined Development Agency. Further shipments are expected to be made henceforward at regular intervals. This very considerable undertaking, which was completed in the remarkably short time of twenty months, represents, not only a punctual fulfilment of commitments entered into by Australia for the defence of the free world, hut also a contribution of great significance towards the development of the Northern","N/A","ATOMIC ENERGY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[1]/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

Another encouraging aspect of the position is that ore is beginning to come forward from privatelyoperated mines outside the project area. By arrangement with the Combined Development Agency, this ore is being accepted for treatment at the Rum Jungle plant. In the sphere of arrangements with the Combined Development Agency, I must mention also that the South Australian Government has likewise made gratifying progress with its uranium project at Radium Hill. The mining operations and concentration plant there were formally opened by the GovernorGeneral on the 10th November, 1954, and the associated treatment plant at Port Pirie is expected to come into operation shortly. Like the Rum Jungle project, the Radium Hill undertaking is committed primarily to the production of uranium oxide for the Combined Development Agency, but it has established the uraniummining industry in South Australia, and there are good hopes that the industry in that State will eventually produce oxide in excess of the committed output. Honorable members will be interested to know that the Rum Jungle and Radium Hill projects were inspected by the Raw Materials Subcommittee of the United States Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy, which visited this country in November, 1954. In a report issued by the committee on its return to the United States, the projects are referred to in the following terms:","N/A","ATOMIC ENERGY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[1]/para[2]","N/A","N/A"

Promising discoveries were made by private companies in the South Alligator River area, in the Northern Territory, and early this year the companies concerned had discussions with a major United Kingdom mining company on proposals for the development of this field. Although these discussions did not result in agreement with this British company, they brought the Australian companies together, and some of them are now consulting with one another and with a large Australian mining company in an endeavour to work out a joint development plan. If agreement is reached, as [ hope it will be reached, a basis will have been established for what may prove to be most important operations in the area, involving, ultimately, the erection of a treatment plant and the production of substantial quantities of uranium oxide. One of the major companies operating in the area, the North Australian Uranium Corporation, has also just concluded an agreement, which was announced yesterday, with a large American company, under which the American company will contribute capital, on a £lfor£l basis, equal to the present subscribed capital of the North Australian Uranium Corporation, for surveying and prospecting work, to be followed by the erection of a treatment plant if this is justified by the results of the survey.

Under these arrangements, the Rio Tinto company will provide finance and technical skill for the thorough examination of the leases. If the results of the investigations warrant it, the Rio Tinto company will establish, at a cost of several million pounds, a treatment plant, the output of which will, in normal circumstances, he purchased by the Commonwealth. I do not need to enlarge on the great interest and importance of these possibilities. These encouraging developments did not take place of themselves. I do believe that the Rio Tinto company, for instance, would not have undertaken operations in Australia but for the very active encouragement that was given to it by the Australian.

When discoveries of uranium ore were reported in the Mount IsaCloncurry district of Queensland, the Australian Atomic Energy Commission and, a little later, I, myself, had discussions with Mount Isa Mines Limited. As a result, that company offered to cooperate with the Government in the purchase and treatment of uranium ores in that district, provided, of course, that satisfactory terms could be arranged, and, above all, that there was a sufficient quantity of ore of a commercial grade in the district to ensure the operation of a treatment plant for a period sufficient to enable a reasonable return to be received on the substantial capital outlay involved.","N/A","ATOMIC ENERGY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[1]/para[5]","N/A","N/A"

As a rough guide, it can be accepted that the exploration and development of a deposit of commercial grade ore to the production stage, and the erection of a treatment plant, would involve a capital outlay of between £3,000,000 and £5,000,000.

It has been deliberately seeking a substantial selfsufficiency in uranium, realizing that a war would undoubtedly render importations somewhat uncertain. It has, of course, made contracts with other countries such as Canada, Belgium, South Africa and Australia for the supply of uranium., and in all. or most of these contracts the United Kingdom has participated. Recent information, however, indicates that the United States Government is moving away from a policy of ore buying toward one of buying oxide from producers with their own plants. This has for some time also been the policy in Canada. I was so informed by Mr. Howe when he was in Australia a few days ago. The Australian Government has not, on the advice of its experts, felt able, as yet, to adopt as generous a policy for the purchase of uranium ore. Merely to buy uranium ores of commercial grade? wherever they may be found in Australia could well involve the outlay of many millions of pounds of public money with the very definite risk that, for many years, little or no return would be received. Clearly, it is impossible to establish costly treatment plants in every area in Australia where uranium ore is found and, equally clearly, the cost of transporting ore to the areas selected for treatment plants on the basis of the ore reserves in those areas might well make the operation completely uneconomical. Contrary to what many people think, uranium does not bring a fabulous price. As a guide to the sort of price Australia might expect for any exportable surplus it had in the future, the director of the Raw Materials Division of the United States Atomic Energy Commission recently gave it as his opinion that the world price for oxide produced from this mineral might settle down at about 10 dollars per lb. or about. 90s.

Australian Government, so far, has pursued a policy of encouraging private enterprise to search for and produce uranium by the gi ant of rights to mine and sell the product; by substantial taxfree rewards for discoveries; and by the guarantee of a market at a specified price and for a specified period. Only in the case of the Rum Jungle project has it taken a direct hand. This policy is not inflexible and has already been modified in the light of current happenings. It will no doubt be modified again as and when circumstances warrant; indeed, some aspects of i|. are before a committee of Cabinet at the present time. The Australian Atomic Energy Commission is already buying ore at Rum Jungle from producers in the adjacent territory. It will consider purchases elsewhere if and when sufficient ore reserves are proved and a treatment plant appears justified, or if other special circumstances appear to make it desirable. The supply and demand position is constantly under review. It is, however, extremely difficult, in the absence of freely disclosed facts as to production throughout the world to form any infallible judgment as to what the future holds. The military demand is, at present, the dominant factor, but the United Kingdoms requirement for its recently announced programme of nearly £200,000,000 for the generation of power from nuclear sources is also now an important factor.

It has, and it will, give encouragement to private enterprise in this field, but in so doing, it must have due regard to the risks involved to public funds. In short, it has to determine the risk which it, ascustodian of the public purse, is justified in taking to assist in establishing a uraniummining industry.

In addition, the United Kingdom has made available facilities for the training of the scientific staff of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission both in research and in reactor technology and engineering. At present, the commission has fifteen officers at the Harwell Atomic Energy Research Establishment, some of whom are engaged in the final design of the reactor to be built in Australia, and some in research work, while others are attending the Nuclear Reactor Technology School there.

Several distinguished scientists have now joined the commission. In particular, I mention two names. Our chief scientist is Professor C. N.

Honorable members will recollect that under section 4 of that act, the Minister is the person who may grant a licence after he has considered the recommendations made by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. It is his decision. It is not the decision of the Executive Council. It is not the decision of the Parliament. Accordingly, the only way in. which we can discuss the PostmasterGenerals exercise of his discretion is by placing before the House such a submission as I have placed before it. There can be no doubt that the matter is of urgent public importance. Television is the most potent and pervasive of the means of communication, and the character of television in this country will be determined, to a very great degree, by the way in which the four successful applicants operate under their licences.","N/A","TELEVISION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is quite plain, therefore, that during the five years currency of those licences the Royal Commission on Television recommended a threeyear term, if I recollect aright, but the Minister has granted a. fiveyear term the same interests which have a monopoly of the daily newspapers in Victoria, and of all the daily newspapers, except one, in New South Wales, which are the same interests that control the wealthiest broadcasting stations in Sydney and Melbourne, and the States of which they are the capitals, will also control the only commercial television stations in those two States. It is the policy of the Government that there shall be a dual system of television, public and private. The Government realized quite well, when it decided to permit private television, that there were very few companies already in existence which could operate private television. It knew that private television could be operated only by the companies that already dominated the commercial broadcasting field, which were owned by the monopolists of the newspaper field. It had every selfinterest in propounding the principle of private television, because the newspapers to which \. have referred, without exception, support the political point of view propounded by the Government coalition. The commercial broadcasting stations, insofar as their listeners will tolerate propaganda of a political character, also state the same point of view. It is plain, therefore, that in the two principal States of Australia, in which commercial television is to be instituted, the same point of view will be put on television as is put by the press and the commercial broadcasting stations, and that point of view alone will be put.

Applications for television licences were made on behalf of the people who hold the contrary point of view, by the general secretary of the largest trade union in Australia and the right honorable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt) as leader of the Australian Labour party. They made these applications as Labour party trustees. The trade unions, and last month at Hobart, the federal conference of the Labour party, ratified the applications. But the Australian Broadcasting Control Board rejected the applications, and the PostmasterGeneral, of course with alacrity, endorsed the rejection. Therefore, the only means of presenting a point of view that is alternative to the point of view held by the people who control the four companies that have been granted licences in this latest, most pervasive and most potent form of mass communication in Australia, has been lost.

M. Bourke), and the honorable member for Yarra (Mr. Keon), were absent during the division on the resolution, as they were absent from the rest of the proceedings of the day. But those honorable members on this side of the centre aisle who were in the chamber on. the occasion of that division voted against it. I was not here at the time, but I know that the honorable members who voted against the resolution did so because they doubted the bona fides of it. You will recollect, Mr. Speaker, that the Daily Mirror interests in London had at that time just bought the controlling interest in the Melbourne Argus, and the broadcasting stations owned by the Argus. Honorable members on the Government side would never have persisted with that motion if the other branch of the Harmsworth family, which controls the conservative Daily Mail, had bought the Argus and its broadcasting stations. They persisted with it, however, because the radical Daily Mirror interests had bought them. They resented the fact that the Argus, under its new control, had already changed its political tone. They feared the possibility that the broadcasting stations formerly owned by the Argus would also change their political tone. We objected to the timing and the sheer vindictiveness of the motion. The general principle that Australian means of mass communication should be owned and controlled by Australians is surely endorsed by all members of the four parties in this House the two principal parties and the two rump parties. It is true that the applications made to the Australian Broadcasting Control Board were severely modified by the board, but in the result it is possible for 20 per cent, of the shares in each of the four successful applicant companies to be owned overseas, and for any shareholder in one of those companies to live overseas and own 15 per cent, of its shares. The lineup is that a 20 per cent, interest in Amalgamated Television Services Proprietary Limited, the SunHeraldMacquarie station will be held by the Daily Mirror, of London; 20 per cent, of the shares of the General Television Corporation Proprietary Limited, in Melbourne, the ArgusAgeHoyts station, will be held also by the Daily Mirror, of London; 20 per cent, of the shares of Television Corporation Limited, the Packer station, in Sydney, will be held by the Daily Mail; and 20 per cent, of the shares of the Herald and Weekly Times station in. Melbourne will be held also by the Daily Mail. No shares are at present held by the Daily Mail, although the evidence given before the board was that the Herald and Weekly Times wished to include 30 per cent, of the capital investment from Associated Newspapers Limited, which owns the Daily Mail.

When we consider the applicants and after all, the board can grant licences only to applicants the plain fact that emerges is that each of them represents an aggregation of capital. Without the backing of that aggregation of capital, how in the name of goodness could they withstand the long period of high capital cost and high expenditure on operations without earning a profit?

I well remember what happened a couple of years ago when there was a crisis in Australia over the balance of overseas payments. The time came for the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) to make a national broadcast. Being quite unwilling to use the power that is conferred upon the Government by the Australian Broadcasting Act to commandeer time from the commercial network, he sought a hearing on the commercial broadcasting stations. They advanced all sorts of reasons why time could not be provided, even for the Prime Minister in relation to a matter of grave national importance. The reason behind that, of course, is that the commercial interests feel that they are under a threat from a Labour or a potential Labour government, particularly when they hear statements like those that have been made by the honorable member for Melbourne (Mr. Calwell), who wants to nationalize broadcasting stations. On that particular occasion, the Prime Minister was given time by a very restricted group of stations indeed, who were awa.ro of their national responsibility.","N/A","TELEVISION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[7]/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

The broadcasting act provides that commercial stations shall make their facilities available without discrimination yet, as the PostmasterGeneral (Mr. Anthony) pointed out this morning, the Labourowned stations refuse to accept advertising or broadcast programmes from antiLabour sources. Perhaps the time has arrived when we should look at that aspect of the matter. It is true that there are five Labourowned stations. It is rather intriguing, therefore, to note that, when the Leader of the Opposition was in Newcastle recently, the Labour station in that area denied its facilities to him. Apparently he did not belong to the right Labour party. In other words, the station gave him the air, but not in the manner in which he wanted it. The honorable member for Melbourne accuses the Government of inconsistency. There is no greater expert on inconsistency in the House than the honorable member himself.

If we accept the benefits of the knowhow and techniques of big overseas companies we must at the same time give them some interest, very much short of control, in television in this country. It is difficult to argue that an aggregate holding by overseas companies of 20 per cent. of the capital invested in a television station will give the overseas company a substantial measure of control. The limit imposedon overseascapital conforms with the practice in the United States of America. No one will deny that the Americans are very careful about the development of new industries.

The right honorable gentlemans letter is interesting because investigations that I have made into accommodation that has been availed of by a number of Leaders of the Opposition and a number of leaders of parties in this House lead me to one conclusion. When the Leader of the Opposition says that he wants coequal rights with the Government, he means that he wants just double the accommodation that is at present used by the Prime Minister and double the present staff of the Prime Minister, and, indeed, double the staff and the accommodation which the Prime Minister had when he was Leader of the Opposition. In this respect I merely wish to say that I do not know what the staff of the Leader of the Opposition does, whether it is concerned with purely parliamentary matters or whether, in their spare time, the members of that staff take the greatest delight in compiling dossiers, because it seems that they do classes of business other than parliamentary business.

Yet the right honorable gentleman tells the House that the only accommodation he has for carrying on his duties is in Canberra. What is his Sydney office being used for? I understand that he has two offices in Sydney where, also, he has a staff of three, the members of which seldom come to Canberra.

I must say that I am amazed at the way in which the VicePresident of the Executive Council (Sir Eric Harrison) has treated the whole question. He is a past master at the art of suppressing what is true and suggesting what is false. He told the House that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) had four rooms and that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition had three rooms. After an interjection by a member of the Australian Country party the Minister admitted that the room I have is one room subdivided by partitions into three. It is the room that, the Australian Country party had in other days. It is the room which the Lang Labour party had at an earlier period. What he did not tell the House is that, although certain meagre facilities are provided for the Opposition in the Parliament House of the nation, fifteen Ministers on the House of Representatives side of this building have 47 rooms. At the most, seven rooms for the Opposition, and 47 rooms for fifteen Ministers! I suggest that most of those Ministers and I do not think you will interrupt me by disagreeing with me, Mr. Speaker ought not to be in this place at all, any more than wartime facilities should have been in this place. They should be accommodated where their main offices are. There may have been justification for having ministerial suites established in the Parliament building in wartime, but the trend should be the other way now. Ministers should retire from this building, but, instead of that, they are increasing their demands on Mr. Speaker for additional accommodation. Ministers today have much more accommodation than they had in the days of the Curtin and Chifley governments. The Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) has three rooms and the Treasurer (Sir Arthur Fadden) has two. The VicePresident of the Executive Council and Minister for Defence Production, whose principal occupation in this House is moving the gag, needs three rooms in which to soliloquize and contemplate the next move that he will make against the rights of members of this House. The Minister for Labour and National Service and Minister for Immigration (Mr. Holt) has four rooms. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr. McEwen) has five rooms, and the Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Casey) has three rooms. The Minister for Defence (Sir Phillip McBride) has three rooms, and the Minister for Health (Sir Earle Page) has four. The PostmasterGeneral .(Mr. Anthony) has three rooms and the Minister for the Navy and Minister for the Army (Mr. Francis), the Minister for Supply (Mr. Beale), the Minister for the Interior (Mr. Kent Hughes), the Minister for Social Services .(Mr. McMahon and the Minister for Territories (Mr. Hasluck) have .three rooms each. The Minister for Air and Minister for Civil Aviation (Mr. Townley), who, at least, has two most important portfolios, is asked to do with two rooms.

In 1940, when I first came to this Parliament, the Leader of the Opposition was Mr. Curtin. He had a staff of two, and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in those days had a staff of one. But the work of the Parliament has increased as a result of the war and also because of the changes in our habits and the greater concentration of powers in the Commonwealth Parliament which resulted from the decision of the High Court in the uniform taxation case, the alteration of the Constitution placing social services under Commonwealth power, and other developments. Not only has the work of the Parliament increased enormously, but in addition, the membership of the Parliament itself has increased by twothirds. The truth is that this chamber is very overcrowded. We need to extend the chamber itself. The accommodation for all honorable members in Parliament House is totally inadequate. The work .of the Leader of the Opposition and he certainly devotes himself assiduously to it increases .with the passing of the days, and instead of losing a room he ought to be given greater facilities. It is said ito him that if I am to be evicted I can occupy one of his rooms. To offer the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, in those days, one room in which to work, would be completely unfair and, I suggest, improper. But to deprive the Leader of the Opposition of one of his rooms is grossly improper. Like everybody with Scottish or Irish blood I have a racial objection to evictions, and I certainly protest against this one. It is .not fair.

It is a matter of great distaste to me that the inception of our party, and its recognition in this Parliament, should .be accompanied by this unseemly brawl over the allotment of the minimum of accommodation. I think the whole attitude, bearing and standing of the Leader of the Opposition is quite unworthy. He appears to me to have put himself in a most undignified position as a result of the action he has taken. Everybody knows that in this House there has been, for a considerable time, a shortage of accommodation. The honorable member for Melbourne (Mr. Calwell), as Deputy Leader of the Opposition, has been more aware of it than has the Leader of the Opposition, who has lived in his rooms without any regard to what has gone on in the rest of the building. For a considerable time the deputy leader of my party, the honorable member for Yarra (Mr. Keon) and I, have used tables in the Labour party room. We have been happy to do so, in view of the shortage of accommodation in the building. Mr. Speaker has on a number of occasions called honorable members, who lacked proper accommodation, into conference with the  Whip  to consider the position, and to ensure that the best use would be made of the accommodation available. He has always done his best, and I have trusted him. I have kept out of the way of other honorable members by using the party room, so that they could do their work properly, because I considered that honorable members from electorates in places as far away as Western Australia and elsewhere required an office here in which to work, more than I did. I am a Victorian, and in any event I liked using the party room. We are a party. That must be remembered. We represent the voice of a section of the people. It is the voice of the Victorian people at present, but it is also the voice of people all over Australia, and it is the voice of many men who sit on the benches behind the Leader of the Opposition. As a party, we requested that we be given sufficient room to enable us to do our work. You, Mr, Speaker, proposed to allot to us a room at present occupied by the honorable member for Melbourne (Mr. Calwell), the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I am. npt very familiar with that room, because I have been in it only a few times, but I know enough about it to realize that it represents absolutely the minimum of the accommodation that we require. The room that we are allotted will have to accommodate a lot of people. It will have to accommodate myself, my deputy leader, the whip, and also a staff of at least two. It will have to serve also as a party room for the seven of us, and possibly for many more before very long.","N/A","PARLIAMENT HOUSE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

When ,1 came to the Parliament, I found that, the accommodation allotted to me was a desk in a room used by between half a dozen and a dozen other honorable members I do not know the exact number, because it seemed to fluctuate in a room used also as a common room.

Normally, I should not enter into a debate such as this, but I do so now because I feel that, in view of the disgusting approach to the matter by the VicePresident of the Executive Council (Sir Eric Harrison), the situation should be clarified. The approach made to the matter by the honorable member for Ballarat. (Mr. Joshua), the Leader of the AntiCommunist Labour party, was by an attack on the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt). What is the position? A letter was written by the Leader of the Opposition asking for a conference to be arranged to discuss accommodation. I claim that this matter should never have come before the House. I say that the time wasted on this debate today is a disgrace. I take strong exception to the manner in which the matter was introduced by the VicePresident of the Executive Council. The question at issue is an allocation of accommodation to the new party which would involve that party taking over a part of the accommodation at present occupied by the Leader of the Opposition and the honorable member for Melbourne (Mr. Calwell), the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. But the greater part of the speech of the VicePresident of the Executive Council was devoted, not to the question of accommodaton, but to a personal attack on the Leader of the Opposition.

The honorable member for Ballarat and some of his colleagues made an approach to Mr. Speaker on an earlier occasion.

The statement of the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) on foreign affairs contained some concepts of which all Australians can well be very proud. It contained the concepts of constantly seeking peace by every possible means, of defending not only our rights but also the rights of others, and of improving our living conditions and the living conditions of our neighbours. It is a policy on international relations with which all political parties must agree in principle. The only divergence of opinion by any political party in Australia, except, perhaps, the Communist party, can be in regard to methods and priorities. There are a few people who believe that we should constantly seek peace by means of appeasement. We know that, unfortunately, appeasement is the surest road to disaster, particularly when dealing with a potential enemy who is both ruthless and without moral standards of any kind. The Communist doctrine itself postulates that might is right. It subscribes to the idea that the end justifies the means, and it openly advocates deceit, lies, and the breaking of agreements, as legitimate instruments of international diplomacy. Unfortunately, there is also a small group of people who believe that we can defend our rights, and presumably the rights of others, by keeping our defence forces at home. Any one who has any knowledge of the horrors of war would resist to the utmost, and at almost any cost, any suggestion that, if a war were forced upon us, we should fight it on our own territory.","Foreign Affairs and Defence Ministerial Statement, 20th April, 1955","FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Those people who think that the standard of living can be raised and maintained by a system of indefinite credit are doomed, of course, to the most dismal awakening. Fortunately, the majority of people in Australia are more realistic. They agree with the Government in the belief that we must seek peace with honour, that to defend our rights means that we must have defence in depth, and that to improve our standards of living means that we must increase the real wealth of this country and seek to expand overseas markets. If we are to defend ourselves in depth, we must have some sort of outpost for our defences. Probably the most controversial portion of the statement by the Prime Minister was his reference to the sending of a small force to Malaya. It is, relatively, a small force. It is proposed that it shall consist of one battalion, two fighter squadrons, a light bomber squadron, and a couple of small ships which will be either destroyers or frigates. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) gave the impression that that was to be Australias contribution to a central reserve for a possible war in the Pacific. That is not the case.","Foreign Affairs and Defence Ministerial Statement, 20th April, 1955","FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

I think it is a very good plan. It will encourage the people of Malaya to make every possible effort to regain peace in their own country and so advance their aims of selfgovernment, because no responsible national in Malaya, whether he comes from China or any other eastern or western country, believes that, in the present disordered state of that country, he could survive if British forces were withdrawn and he were thrown back on his own resources for selfgovernment. As the Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Casey) pointed out, without doubt these people will welcome any forces from a friendly nation which will enable them to terminate, in the shortest possible time, the present turmoil, and so bring closer the day when they may take over the direction of their own affairs. The plan to which I have referred does not represent the full extent of the Governments proposals for defence. It is a plan to meet a particular situation in SouthEast Asia under the existing cold war conditions. I believe that the fact that this small force will be stationed in Malaya does not mean that it cannot be used in any other trouble area in SouthEast Asia under cold war conditions, such as in Thailand, the associated states of IndoChina or Burma. I hope that, in addition to providing this acceptable help to Malaya, thus giving to the peoples of the states which border Malaya some small additional sense of security, we ourselves will take the opportunity of obtaining some practical training in actual active operations and, particularly, that we shall be able to arrange with the British Government for some responsible appointments to staff and command positions.","Foreign Affairs and Defence Ministerial Statement, 20th April, 1955","FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/para[2]","N/A","N/A"

That is the force that the Government proposes to raise as a ma jor contribution towards meeting its commitments under the Anzus pact and the Manila treaty. For a country of Australias population and resources to establish and equip a force of two divisions is quite a formidable task. To that degree. I welcome it. It is however, such a task of difficulty that I wonder whether we could not make an equal, or possibly better, contribution to our common cause in the event of a major war in the Pacific by means that are more suited to our circumstances. The raising of two divisions will require the utilization of a great deal of manpower. Two divisions constitute an army corps. The raising and equipping of two divisions, or an army corps, would absorb approximately 70,000 or 80,000 men. because such a force comprises in addition to divisional troops, corps troops, ancillary and other services. History has shown that, in Australia in peacetime, we have not a great rush of volunteers, and the voluntary method is the traditional method by which Australia raises its forces in peacetime. Indeed, it is the law of the country that in peacetime forces must be raised by voluntary means. In addition to the difficulty of persuading approximately 80,000 men to volunteer under peacetime conditions, the withdrawal of such numbers of men from Australian industry at a time when we hope to develop our natural resources, when labour is so short, and when we have full employment, would he an extremely difficult task.","Foreign Affairs and Defence Ministerial Statement, 20th April, 1955","FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/para[3]","N/A","N/A"

If our contribution to the common defence of this area, and the discharge of our obligations under the Anzus pact and the Manila treaty, were to take the form of a group of highly mobile medium bombers of the V class, the group to consist of two wings each of two squadrons, the manpower necessary, even allowing for all of the ancillary services that would be required, would be less than 7,000 men. Such a group should be established on a mobile basis. It should be equipped, preferably, with Americantype aircraft capable of carrying atomic weapons. I suggest Americantype aircraft, not because I think they are better than British aircraft, but because it is obvious that, if we must go to war in this area, our major ally will be the United States. To have in the field the same type of equipment as our major ally would simplify our supply and equipment problem very greatly. If this group of medium bomber aircraft were established on a mobile basis, and if preparations and arrangements were made with our allies for forward operational aerodromes, the striking force, relatively, would be significant. In addition, we should not be obliged to call upon our own resources, or those of our allies, to anything like the same degree in order to move such a contribution to the common defence in the event of emergency. I point out in passing, that, even if we had this army corps fully established and fully trained before we were faced with the catastrophe of war. we should be immediately faced with the major problem of moving it to where it was required, because God forbid that it should be required in Australia. If it were required in Australia, the war would be already lost.","Foreign Affairs and Defence Ministerial Statement, 20th April, 1955","FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/para[4]","N/A","N/A"

At present it is beyond the ability of this country to move an army corps in the short time that will be available if it is to be employed effectively. As a result, we automatically present to our allies a difficult problem in assisting us to move these troops at the very time when our allies are fully occupied with their own concerns and the movement of their own strategic forces. The same argument does not apply to a highly mobile group of hardhitting air bombers, which could make an initial attack within an hour or two. If such a group were to go forward to operational bases outside Australia, air transport within our awn ability could sustain it until further provision for continuous operations could be organized. Such a plan is much more feasible and much more within our resources than would be the raising, training and, if necessary, moving of an army corps, and it would enable us to make a much more effective contribution to the common defence of the SouthEast Asian :i rea.","Foreign Affairs and Defence Ministerial Statement, 20th April, 1955","FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/para[5]","N/A","N/A"

He expressed no opinions and made no decisions because he had no courage. Mr. Pearson diverged sharply from the American view that the offshore islands are necessary to the defence of Formosa. He stated bluntly that they were, in effect, part of the Chinese mainland and that their strategic role  would seem to be more important in the defence of that mainland against attack than in offensive action against Formosa .

He also said, and I agree with him, that it would be more practicable to rely upon an advanced air force group than upon an advanced army corps. In the event of a hot war, an advanced air force group would be more effective in defending Australia than the sending of two divisions of troops to Malaya. The honorable member for Ballarat, who, of course, is a very strange individual, believes in defending Australia in other countries. He believes in garrisoning Australian troops in. other countries before war breaks out. He is oblivious to developments that have occurred since World War II., particularly the fact that countries which then agreed that British troops should be stationed within their borders, establishing air and submarine bases, have changed their outlook in that respect. For instance, the United Kingdom has withdrawn troops which it previously stationed in India for the defence not only of India but also of other parts of the British Commonwealth, and it has withdrawn troops from Pakistan and from Egypt. Some people will say that Britain was obliged to withdraw its troops from those countries. In my view, Britain withdrew those troops for two reasons; first, on grounds of common decency, and, secondly, because the British people have come to realize that, British armed forces have no right to remain on the soil of other nationals against the will of those nationals. Does the honorable member for Ballarat suggest that it would have been impossible for Britain, assisted by the other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, to retain in the Suez Canal and Egypt, the troops which it previously had stationed in those areas? Some of those troops are now stationed at Cyprus and some may be stationed in the British African colonies. The point I make is that British troops were withdrawn from Egypt because the constitutional government of that country objected to their presence and the sentiment of the Egyptian people demanded such action.","Foreign Affairs and Defence Ministerial Statement, 20th April, 1955","FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/para[9]","N/A","N/A"

What we have to defend Australia against is communism, with its declared objectives and its proselytizing activities in every part of the world. The Prime Ministers statement on foreign policy contemplates that state of affairs.

There is one which I may call the ultimate deterrent, nuclear power. The position as I see it is that our opponents know quite well that we are not aggressive and that we should use nuclear weapons only in an extremity. Therefore, while it is essential for us to make all preparations for such an extremity and to be ready and prepared to use those weapons, it is also essential for us to be ready to use what are called conventional armaments, not by ourselves but as an integral part of the defence plans of our allies. What twaddle it is for people like the honorable member for Banks (Mr. Costa) to say that the defence of Australia can be conducted by ourselves alone, in Australia ! Every one knows that if there is to he any defence at all, it must be defence by combined powers, and even then we may well expect severe blows in carrying it out. One objective of our defence plans must be to maintain forces armed with conventional weapons. Whether we agree completely with what is said in the Prime Ministers statement in this regard, or whether we listen, as of course we do, with great respect to the suggestions made by my colleague, the honorable member for Indi (Mr. Bostock), is only a detail of the main principles of the case I am putting to the House. Whatever we do, we must have some reserve of forces armed with conventional armaments. There is another reason for this. It is only natural to suppose that the Communist powers will follow a policy of piecemeal wars. They know that we are not going to be the first to use atomic weapons. Therefore, they are prepared to use the advantages that they have in manpower and conventional armaments in .order to create more emergencies such as those in Korea, IndoChina and Malaya.","Foreign Affairs and Defence Ministerial Statement, 20th April, 1955","FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[8]/para[5]","N/A","N/A"

No proper comparison can be made between the grant of independence and selfgovernment to Malaya and India. It is misleading for the Leader of the Opposition to attempt to make us believe that any such comparison can be made, because the countries are quite different. In India, there was no active subversive fighting going on, as there is in Malaya.

The main reason for Russias doing so would be that, immediately the production of such weapons had ceased, and immediately existing stockpile3 were destroyed, it would have a preponderance of power in any military offensive.","Foreign Affairs and Defence Ministerial Statement, 20th April, 1955","FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[10]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

That country was unprepared for independence. One would not take a child that could not walk, put it in a main street in front of traffic, and say to it,  Go for your life. If you are knocked over by a motor car, it will teach you that you should not go in front of cars . All of the reliable reports that have been received from Indonesia show that economic conditions in that country now are far worse than they were when the Dutch people were in control. We may admit that there were some failures under Dutch rule, but it is now acknowledged that the present Government of Indonesia has made a complete mess of governing that country. I arn amazed that intelligent people should advocate the giving of immediate independence to such countries as Malaya. Has anybody stated that we will not give Ma laya its independence, that we will not grant to it the right of selfgovernment? Malaya will be given the right of selfgovernment when it is ready to receive it. Take the case of India. The Indians themselves have acknowledged that one of the main reasons why that country was able to make such progress after receiving independence was the foundation that was laid, and the assistance that was given, by the British. Similar preparatory steps are being taken in Malaya. Progress is being made every day towards the attainment of independence.","Foreign Affairs and Defence Ministerial Statement, 20th April, 1955","FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[10]/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

We would be handing over to a potential enemy a vital and strategic point in SouthEast Asia. To those who oppose the sending of troops to Malaya, and who say that such action is offensive to the people of SouthEast Asia, I direct this question : Are we going to Malaya to defend the people of that country against the terrorists, or are we going to attack the the people of Malaya themselves? It is obvious that these troops will be sent so that independence may eventually be given to Malaya, and so that the terrorists who are endeavouring to disrupt the economy and the political life of that country may be completely destroyed. While the terrorists remain in that area, Malaya cannot become an independent nation. We have had statements from leading authorities in Australia, from members of the returned soldiers league, and from citizens who are conscious of the responsibility of this country, which support the Government in an action that will contribute towards peace through strength.","Foreign Affairs and Defence Ministerial Statement, 20th April, 1955","FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[10]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The observation of the honorable member for Mallee (Mr. Turnbull) that the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) showed that we are doing something practical to stem the forward surge of communism by the means proposed in the Prime Ministers speech, must be replied to at once. I disagree entirely with that view. We shall do nothing practical to meet the onward surge of communism by merely sending troops to SouthEast Asia to slaughter native peoples in order to force them to see the virtues of Western capitalism. The Government proposes to use force of arms to convince the people of Asia that Western imperialism is preferable to Communist imperialism. Such a proposition will cut little ice with the Asian people.

Except in Singapore, they are ruled by a High Commissioner. Even in Singapore tie elected government can do only what the High Commissioner permits it to do. There must be some thing wrong in Malaya when we realize that when this trouble started in 194S there were only about 6,000 bandits and that, although there have been employed continually since then as many as 300,000 men, including special police and the like, in trying to combat them, there are still just as many bandits operating there today as there were eight years ago when operations against them were commenced.

He also quoted the Colombo plan. Whilst that plan is not his brain child, he has done a tremendous lot in implementing it.

But we shall leave that. It is a matter of history. At the moment, there are 2,000,000 refugees or more in Hong Kong who have fled from the red fear.

I was told it was expected that half the 15,000 civilians would come with the troops to Formosa, and that the other half would say that they wished to stay. That was not mere talk, because the Americans were with them when the offer was made, and they had very great difficulty in providing for evacuees. Three days later, the Nationalists learnt that of the 15,000 persons on the Tachen Islands, nine only asked to stay because they were too old to move. One mans family said that they would stay and look after the old man who was too old to be moved. The old man committed suicide that night so that his family would not have to remain and come under the Communist regime.

They had no intention of keeping the armistice, and they set off to hotup another cold or tepid war in their own time in another place.

This was the great occasion, the wellpublicized occasion, when the Prime Minister of Australia should have made some statement concerning the attitude of the Australian Government towards the Malayan people themselves. It is true that those people have not yet got selfgovernment, but before the end of the year they will have representative government, even if not responsible, government. The island of Singapore, which has a majority of Chinese people in its population, already has representative government, and it is not hostile to the British point of view The sensible thing, surely, before sending Australian troops to Singapore or Malaya, is to consult with the people there about it. That was not done. We are repeating the same performance that we had in 1950, when an Australian heavy bomber squadron was sent to Malaya and Singapore without consultation with the people there. Of course, on that occasion, no reference was even made in this Parliament to the move. The occasion of the Prime Ministers statement was one on which he should have said, in no uncertain terms, that we believe that the people of Malaya are entitled not only to political self determination, but also to economic self determination. Such a statement would have removed the last vestiges of indifference in Malaya, because the best way to remove indifference in that country is to assure the people there that we are not helping them in order to preserve their exploitation by one power alone, but are helping them in order to preserve them from exploitation by any power, whether China or the United Kingdom., and that they will have real selfdetermination in the political and economic sense, and will have our assistance when they ask for it, and in the terms in which they ask for it. it is all right to talk about these people not being fit for selfgovernment. The point is that that statement has been made by no one more often than by the members of the present Government, about every country that has achieved selfgovernment since the end of the war. According to these gentlemen none of the countries represented at the Bandung conference would be fit for selfgovernment. According to them we alone are wise. Yet, one can see what a shambles our politics are. The great trouble about promises of selfgovernment to countries that are waiting to achieve it is that we never say when it is to take place, and who is to make the decision. The people who are to have selfgovernment are the only people who are consistently ignored in connexion with the proposals to establish it.","Foreign Affairs and Defence Ministerial Statement, 20th April, 1955","FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[13]/para[10]","N/A","N/A"

But the position is different in SouthEast Asia, and it is different only for the reason that, so far, the Communists have believed that Seato is only a paper organization.

The defenceless countries of Asia look to the members of Seato to carry out their obligations under the treaty.

Taylor in the last issue of the New Statesman and Nation, which has come into the parliamentary library, in which he revalues the whole question of imperialism. He points out that the thesis that was propounded by a number of the early thinkers on the subject was that the basis of imperialism was a drive for profits, whereas he establishes fairly clearly that the basis of imperialism is a drive for power. He goes on to state that that is exactly the analysis of imperialism that the Communists will never make, because they are practitioners par excellence of this drive for power, and every crisis in their political structure resolves itself finally into a struggle between the leaders of the two supreme points of power, at one stage the army and Beria. and earlier the army and the secret police in the persons of leaders of the various Soviet secret police systems. Exactly the same thing was true of Nazi Germany, where the possible crises, and the one that did develop in 1944, were crises between the two power points the leaders of the military and the inner party forces around Hitler. That is why we ought to recognize that in the world today there is an older form of imperialis tit which may very well be a softer form nf imperialism. After all, the motives in my mind are much more basic to my i lii thinking than the money in my pocket.

We had been led to believe that that party had reached some final conclusion, on this question, particularly in relation to SouthEast Asia. Supporters of the Government had high hopes that last night some constructive and practical suggestion would be placed before the House and the people of Australia in relation to this very difficult problem which could have such disastrous effects on Australia. If communism is to pursue its course of invasion of free countries, as it has in other parts of Asia, it is only a question of time before Australia will come within the ambit of hostilities. Unfortunately, the House and the people of Australia were badly let down by the Leader of the Opposition. The only suggestion that he made, and which he repeated ad infinitum, was that we must have a new approach in world affairs, based on the true spirit of the United Nations Charter. The question that follows naturally is this : How is that to be done? Everybody knows that there is an instrument of veto which has been used very often at meetings of the United Nations organization. It is easy to express points of view in terms that are vague. I suggest that the speech of the right honorable gentleman was quite illogical from beginning to end. The words that were used by the Leader of the Opposition bear a similarity to that very delightfully coined phrase which has been used so frequently at international conferences peaceful coexistence.

These issues are Australias future relations with the East and with the United States of America, and the adoption of a policy by means of which we shall be able to maintain our present position and survive as a nation in the Pacific area. The tragedy is that few Australians realize Australias proximity to the East, and the danger of absorption by a new form of colonialism which is ever moving southward. The danger to Australia is considerably accentuated by a real internal fifthcolumn activity, which should not be overlooked in a debate such as this. I believe that this point was thoroughly outlined by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt). His speech is important, because in it he outlined the real reason for the present breakup of the Australian Labour party. The policy that he enunciated last night has been made possible only by the use of bogus .conferences and by the generous use of the bludgeon. The great Labour movement has had no say in that policy. Chance provided him with the opportunity to present it to an unauthorized conference and to have it pushed through without any genuine section of the Labour party being given an opportunity to play a part in that, conference. His speech last night was dangerous, and, in my view, it represented fifth column activity at its worst. It did not represent Australian sentiment. Neither did it represent the voice of the masses who comprise the trade unions of this country, or of the masses of those who comprise the Australian Labour party.","Foreign Affairs and Defence Ministerial Statement, 20th April, 1955","FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[18]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Does anybody believe that any great number of Australians would prefer red China, to the United States ? Yet, that was a strong inference to he drawn when the recognition of red China was propagated in this chamber last evening. Does anybody believe that recognition of red China is necessary, or that advocacy of such action has merit except as a psychological persuasion that, after all, communism is not so bad? I know of no phrase that can be more dangerous than the phrase,  Recognition of red China . Is it part of Labours policy to sneer at mention of the United States and to show marked preference for red China?

In fact, he outlined so many of those things that I have no intention of referring to all of them. But one of those requirements which he mentioned was that we should seek a solution to any action that tended to break the peace by negotiating, by relying upon inquiry and by the use of arbitration. He referred also to a number of other courses of that nature, which he quoted from the charter. All of those things were approved by those honorable members who purport to follow him. It is most significant that none of them has thought it proper that those rules might have been applied to the dispute which the right honorable gentleman has caused in the Labour party. Neither he nor his followers seem to know anything about those principles at all where that dispute is concerned. Undoubtedly the bludgeon was used ; constituted authority was overthrown and rules of the party, which have been evolved at conference after conference, were simply scattered to the four winds. After intrigue and after threats, the minority of members of the party, who now comprise either the federal executive, or the federal conference of the movement, met and imposed their will on the weaklings in the movement. I say that without reservation. Now, fearful of further defections, they have, in a cowardly way, determined to defer taking similar action in New South Wales and Queensland until the first trench in Victoria has been consolidated.

I do not believe that they are sincere for one moment.","Foreign Affairs and Defence Ministerial Statement, 20th April, 1955","FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[19]/para[5]","N/A","N/A"

I do not think the honorable member himself believes that to be true for one moment. There is not one word of truth in it. I do not pose as an authority on the subject of Asia, but I have spent some years of my life in Asian countries, not as a dele gate of governments or as a very privileged person, but as a very underprivileged person, if you like, because I was a soldier, and one does see, from that more lowly vantage point, things which more important people do not see. I believe that the Asian people I except only the Russians and the Japanese from this category can thank western civilization for nearly everything which they enjoy today, which they value, and which is worth while. Any pretence to democracy which they have has come from Britain largely, from Holland in no small part, from France to a lesser degree, and from the United States in respect of the Philippines. Those are the facts, yet some honorable members have so little knowledge of the matter, and such lack of principle, that they will mouth the falsehoods to which we have listened.","Foreign Affairs and Defence Ministerial Statement, 20th April, 1955","FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[19]/para[6]","N/A","N/A"

Two divisions, I think, were mentioned. I must say that it gave me great pleasure to hear the speech of the honorable member for Ballarat. I have many differences politically with him, but still I have a great deal of respect for him. He has risen in his place and in forthright language has given the House and the nation, as he should, the fruits of his convictions and experiences, instead of repeating some of the twaddle with which fellow travellers like Dr. Burton have filled those who still sit behind the Leader of the Opposition.","Foreign Affairs and Defence Ministerial Statement, 20th April, 1955","FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[19]/para[8]","N/A","N/A"

He considered that not enough has been done to condition the people of this country to the gravity of their danger, and to the necessity possibly for them to make very great efforts for their own salvation. I always consider foreign affairs in relation to national selfinterest, and I make no apology whatsoever for doing so. It is bound up with defence, and I say now, as I have said before, that the Government, if it believes that great defence efforts may.be needed, and I gather from the statement by the Prime Minister that such is his opinion, should also have been expounding to the people the peril in which we lie, and the necessity for taking positive steps for our own defence.","Foreign Affairs and Defence Ministerial Statement, 20th April, 1955","FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[19]/para[9]","N/A","N/A"

The policy, of England, to which we look for so much, has always been wherever possible, to fight its wars on foreign soil. England has not been defended in England except when it has been defeated, as you, Mr. Speaker, know. England has defended itself on the continent of Europe, and we shall have to defend ourselves, if necessary, probably on the continent of Asia. Therefore, the government, wisely and courageously, is committing Australia, in our own defence and in certain circumstances, to provide a force bearing some relation to the threat to us and to our capacity to exert ourselves. I know perfectly well that there are honorable members opposite who are completely opposed to any form of defence, so responsive are they to red ideas I know that other honorable members honestly confuse communism, the rise of radical nationalism in Asia, with .perfectly legitimate socialist ideals such as many hold in this country. There is no connection whatever between those rabid nationalist movements and what, some honorable gentlemen understand to be legitimate political aims in this country.","Foreign Affairs and Defence Ministerial Statement, 20th April, 1955","FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[19]/para[10]","N/A","N/A"

To meet the immediate relief requirements of refugees coming from North Viet Nam towards the end of 1954, we contributed relief foods and small agricultural tools to the value of £25,000, which were distributed through the agency of the Australian and International Red Cross. Tn order to meet the longerterm needs of the three States a programme of supplies for economic development was organized quickly, so that in the space of about six months it bad been expanded to embrace shout ten individual projects valued in all at about £1,000,000. Inevitably the: typo o£ equipment. being supplied reflects the priority given by these governments to reconstruction work, consisting as it docs largely of equipment .for improving communications,, assisting, refugee resettlement and promoting agricultural: development. Our aid is, of course, being coordinated with the much larger aid being provided by the United States. For Viet Nam projects worth £250,000 have been approved. They involve the provision of road rollers and heavy earthmoving equipment for roadmaking and refugee resettlement schemes telephone cables; irrigation equipment; and agricultural and workshop equipment for experimental farms. Cambodias share of our contribution is about £500,000. The railway rollingstock already referred to takes up £335,000 of this allocation and the balance is being applied to roadmaking and earthmoving equipment, which will he used largely on schemes of refugee resettlement. Allied with the rollingstock project is a proposal to supply. £50,000 of Australian equipment; trader the Technical Cooperation Scheme,, to establish a. Cambodian railway apprentices school in the capital, Phnom Penh. For Laws, roadmaking and agricultural equipment worth £250,000 is being supplied. During my recent visit to this State I was able to see for myself the very, poor condition of the roads in Laos and.
