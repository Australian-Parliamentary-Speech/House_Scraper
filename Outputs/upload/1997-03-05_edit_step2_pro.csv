After reviewing comments from the heads of the five parliamentary departments, we have decided to implement a management structure based on the two chamber departments.The functions of the present three joint departments—that is, the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff, the Department of the Parliamentary Library and the Joint House Department—will be merged into the Department of the House of Representatives and the Department of the Senate.This two&hyphen;chamber department structure is the best way of achieving a dynamic and responsive organisation which will allow the parliament to make significant savings while improving the services provided to senators, members and committees.The President and I know that we will have the full and professional support of all staff in meeting the objectives of greater efficiency and effectiveness in the parliaments operations.We have asked the departmental heads to provide us by Tuesday, 18 March with an implementation plan for the transition to the new structure. I will advise the House as soon as practicable after that.","N/A","PARLIAMENTARY ADMINISTRATION","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Indeed, what they might decide to do—and what I would suggest, Mr Speaker, you might decide to do—is have a little read about what the now government when in opposition said about what were far less dramatic changes that previous Presiding Officers wanted to make in this place.If just by fiat of the Presiding Officers we are going to see the whole nature of the way this parliament has worked for at least the last 50 years change so dramatically, that is not good enough. If your stewardship of the job of being the head of the House of Representatives is to see a short consultation with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) as the way to do this, I must say to you, Sir, that that is not the way these things have been done in the past and not the way they should be done now. If we are going to change the way this parliament operates, all members on both sides should be taken into your confidence about how that is going to happen.You have come in here and made a short statement about merging the administration of the three service departments. I do not know how you are going to merge it because my recollection of how one needs to do that is maybe we have to have legislation to abolish the three departments because there is legislation that makes it necessary to do that.What is going to happen to the people who run those departments? What is going to happen to the structure of those departments? Is the Joint House Department going to end up going into the Department of the Senate or into the Department of the House of Representatives? Are the Library and Hansard going to go into the House of Representatives or the Senate? What is going to be the outcome for services to members and senators if the Library goes into the Senate? Are the services going to be directed according to the more rapacious manner in which the Senate manages to accrue assets to itself to the detriment of the House of Representatives? Presiding Officers on both sides in this place, and members, have spoken in the past about how it is interesting that the Senate manages to have somewhat the same appropriation as the House of Representatives when there are twice as many people here.","N/A","PARLIAMENTARY ADMINISTRATION","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/speech[2]/break/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

8,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr LEO McLEAY","4I4","(Watson)","ALP","N/A",1961,"—More, my colleague says. So, if we are going to have the service departments run by the Senate department, what effect is that going to have on the members of this House?You cannot just come in here and read a short statement at the beginning of a non-broadcast day and say, `That is it. You cannot do that. You might smile and say, `Ive just done it and the governments got the numbers and well do it, but, if you have any due regard for the rights of members here—and you have said on a number of occasions that you see your responsibility as being the person who reflects the rights of members—you need to take members into your confidence.You need to come in here and make a more lengthy statement to this parliament rather than just say, `We are going to absorb the administration of the joint departments. You need to tell us how you are going to do that and you need to at least canvass these ideas before saying—what was it?—it will be in two weeks time. We have not even seen a copy of the statement you have just made. In two weeks time, or something, this is going to happen.In the past when governments and Presiding Officers have looked to get efficiencies out of the parliamentary departments, they have canvassed these things widely. The member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) and I, for instance, put forward a private members bill here some time ago. The government has not even given that time for debate. In the past, Speaker Child brought in legislation to this House which was canvassed, debated widely and then rejected by the Senate. We had widespread debate on that, but all of a sudden now you want to stampede us into agreeing to something in a few weeks time. The short statement you have made here is just a most unacceptable way of dealing with what are going to be the most dramatic changes to the administration of this parliament since the 1930s.It beggars belief that we should be expected to say, `Terrific, go ahead and do it. The opposition believes that there are ways of getting economies of scale out of the parliamentary departments. We said that while in government and we have said that while in opposition. But we think that members on both sides—and members of the government—should not just see this as something that they should be stampeded into.You are the people who will suffer from this. The people who will suffer most from this are members of parliament. Sometimes in debates in this House we have to consider ourselves to be members of parliament, not division cannon fodder for the government or division cannon fodder for the opposition. If being a member of parliament means anything it means having at least some control over what happens in this House and what services are provided to members of this House.Quite frankly, as a member of the House of Representatives, I would not be happy to see the Senate department have absolute control over the manner in which services are provided to members of the House of Representatives. What will happen with the division of responsibilities between the two chambers? What will happen when there are—as you know and as a former Presiding Officer I know—the regular disputes, which do occur, between the two houses? What will happen when the Senate decides, as it normally does, that there is a standard for them and a standard for others? If you divide the assets of the joint departments between the two chamber departments you will find that the appropriation of the Senate will grow fourfold.It also gets down to accountability. The Senate department has a standing Appropriations and Staffing Committee where opposition and government senators sit down with the President and tell the President how the President will spend the money appropriated to the Senate department. Quite frankly, as a member of the House of Representatives, I find it interesting that a group of senators will sit down and decide how they will spend money which in fact will provide services for members of the House of Representatives.Mr Speaker, I did not hear in your paper that you are going to take us into your confidence and set up the same sort of thing for the House of Representatives—I bet you are not. When I was the Speaker I resisted doing that, my colleague the member for Cunningham resisted doing that and former speakers resisted doing that. But we are going to allow senators to decide what will happen to services provided to members.If the break up of the departments is such that Hansard and the Library go to the Senate, what you will see is senators deciding what happens to services that both government and opposition back bench members have to do their jobs. I must say in a cynical fashion that those of us who have been here for more than five minutes—with all due respect to my colleague the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan), who saw the light and left the Senate and came here—know that the Senate will look after itself to the detriment of people here.There are a huge number of issues that we as members of parliament, not as members of the opposition or members of the government, should consider before this is done. Mr Speaker, you have the job of representing us. You are the person in the scheme of things whose job it is, if there is an occasion when the Speaker should be worried as previous speakers were that the Speakers job in the Commons was to talk on behalf of the members of the Commons to the king, to not be stampeded by the ERC but to take us into your confidence about what the government wants to do with the parliamentary departments and seek our concurrence. You need to do that. If you do not do that you will have in fact not fulfilled your responsibilities as the person whose job it is to represent the views of this House.I think if members of parliament in this House find that they do not have some say or some control over the services that are provided, particularly the all important services such as the research service and the Hansard service, and they are going to be run by the Senate department then that is just not acceptable. The whole reason the joint departments arose was so that you got, first, some economies of scale with expanding technology and, second, the Presiding Officers from both chambers were able to have some input into the way those services were delivered.If the President and Mr Evans are going to run some services that are provided here we will not have that input any more. You have not told us what power you will have on behalf of this House to ensure that those services are delivered. These are issues that need to be widely debated. These are issues that members on both sides need to get a full understanding of. They are not issues that we should deal with at half past nine in the morning with a one&hyphen;page statement. They are not issues for which we say consultation is a short talk to the Leader of the Opposition one day and the next day come in here and do this.If that is the way you see the job of the Speaker in representing this House to the government then I think you have lost the plot, Mr Speaker. I say that in all seriousness because this will be one of the most important changes in the way this House works to have occurred in the last 50 or 60 years. There may be good and cogent reasons for this to happen. There may be different models from that of just absorbing a couple of acts of parliament—I do not know how you absorb a couple of acts of parliament, but somehow you and the President have found a way to absorb a couple of acts of parliament.This needs far more debate. It at least needs the same debate that we had when previous Presiding Officers considered smaller changes. Mr Speaker, we may not be able to do anything in this House because the government members may be willing to be stampeded into what the government wants to do, but we will certainly have a lot to do and say about this when it gets to the Senate. Mr Speaker, if you and the President want to get some movement on this issue then far more widespread discussion might ensure that there is some movement in the Senate. At present I can say fairly clearly that our point of view is that there will not be any movement. There certainly will not be movement in the next couple of weeks if that is what you think.This is a profound change to the way the House of Representatives and the parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia will work; and because it is such a profound change it is something that you do not do at half past nine on a Wednesday morning on a non&hyphen;broadcast day after a short discussion with the Leader of the Opposition. We want far more discussion of this. We have proposals to put to you and the government—if the government is driving this, and I am sure it is—about how this system ought to work. There are models such as the one put forward by previous Presiding Officers. There are models like the New Zealand model with a parliamentary commission where members on both sides sit with the Presiding Officers and have some say in how their house will work.Most certainly, Mr Speaker, you would be letting down this House if you went through with this proposal in the way you have briefly spoken about today. The proposal ensures that members of this House have fewer rights than members of the other house will have. Under this plan that you have put forward here we most certainly will have fewer rights. Neither government nor opposition members will have a chance to say to you what we think about how the services that are provided in this building work, but senators will.I would imagine that one of the first problems Madam President is going to have if she made the same sort of speech in the Senate 15 minutes ago is that the first thing the senators will say is, `Has this been to the Appropriations and Staffing Committee? They seem to think that they ought to be consulted about everything that moves over there. That might be rightly so, but I think it is a bit rich that they will get that say and we will not. Your duty, Mr Speaker, is to ensure that we get that say; to ensure that this House is not stampeded into something in a few weeks time which will be to the detriment of the institution of the House of Representatives. If this goes ahead quickly like this it will be to the detriment of this institution.I have spent 18 years of my life here; I originally came to this place thinking it was pretty stuffy and probably ought to be blown up. Mr Speaker, you have achieved that objective in that short time. What you are going to do is blow it up. If what happens is as you have just said to us, then we are really in a position where members have had no say in what happens to what is the pre&hyphen;eminent house of parliament in this country—the House of Representatives. You will hand over control of services to the Senate and if a serious altercation between the houses of parliament occurs this House may not be the pre&hyphen;eminent house. Because governments of the day are unlikely to have a majority in the Senate in the foreseeable future—as they have not for the past 20 odd years—there is always the chance that that will happen.The Senate thought about that and, as you are probably aware, Mr Speaker, in recent years have ensured that, if the House of Representatives Presiding Officers ever decided that they wanted to restrict things for the Senate, the Senate had a whole range of things they could do themselves. They had their own printing operation over there long before this House did. They had a self&hyphen;contained operation which would ensure that the Senate maintained its independence.Absorbing these things into the chamber departments, as you say, will, I believe, impinge on some of the independence that the House of Representatives has. You might say that I am wrong. You might be right; I might be right. But that certainly is a matter that should be debated and looked at when we know all the facts. A one&hyphen;page statement at half past nine on a Wednesday morning allows no one to know the facts. That is not doing your duty on behalf of all of us. I do not say that in a nasty fashion. You have done your job as the Speaker of this House very well. You have been willing to say to the government that you think some things should be done differently. I am not trying to set you up in conflict with the government, but the government should understand this. Indeed the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) had numerous arguments with me and my colleagues who were Presiding Officers in the past about how this House ought to run, and he has been here longer than most of us have—since 1974. Someone who has been here for over 20 years and professes a great love for this institution should indeed take us into his confidence about how he wants to change it.This is a disgraceful way of doing this. I am sure it is not being done deliberately by you but by pressures from elsewhere. You and Madam President should resist these pressures at least long enough for everybody to understand what we are talking about. If the government then wants to come in here and do the opposition and Independents over on a point of view that we have, at least we will know what we are arguing about. At least we will know where you stand. At present we do not know any of this.I would seriously say to you, Mr Speaker, that you should find some way of saying that this was an advisory notice you have given us here this morning and that you as the Speaker will ensure that you will advise members widely and that there will be a debate on this. I know when my colleague the member for Cunningham wanted to change the way the parliamentary departments worked, he circulated members widely; I know when I wanted to, I circulated members widely; I know when Speaker Child wanted to, she circulated members widely. I must admit that at one stage I did think of an ambush, of coming in here earlier and saying, `Ive done it. Even I thought that was a bit rich; so that says something, doesnt it? Mr Speaker, I would hate to think that you have picked up even the worst traits that I ever had. Maybe you have gone up in my estimation—I do not know.I would seriously say to you that you cannot change the way the parliament works by stealth, and I know that you are not wanting to do that. But the reality is you are changing the parliament by stealth and you are doing it without consulting in any meaningful way with members. I do not know, you may have had consultation with the government. But the only consultation that I know of on this side is a short conversation with the Leader of the Opposition and with no-one else. I think you need to do far more than that.I can see that the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran), who is at the table, has not even seen this statement, and I thought the minister had seen everything—although one probably would not give anything to the National Party because they cannot read unless there are pictures on it.Mr Speaker, I would hope that you might say that what you have just done here now is to bring this to our attention, that you will be circulating us before the end of the week with what these proposals are and that there will be an opportunity for some considerable debate. If the government wants to do this quicker, then you should put this squarely in their court. The Prime Minister can be asked what his view of this is. If his view is that he wants to change the House of Representatives by 9.30 fiat, then we find that fascinating. We had some changes that we thought we ought to make to the constitution about whether Australia becomes a republic or whether you ought to do things like this, and the Prime Minister said, `Weve got to have national, wonderful, incredible debate—and that is right. But if we are going to change the way the House of Representatives in the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia works, then that surely is worth a little bit of debate because in the scheme of things that is just as important.If this House is going to find that all of a sudden its rights and its modus operandi with the other house change dramatically—and this will change it dramatically—then that is something all members should be very much concerned about. If this means that the Senate President will have unfettered power to do certain things which could impinge on the way this House works, then you, sir, have a responsibility to ensure that does not happen.If the role of the Speaker means anything in protecting the rights of members, then you have an obligation to do provide that protection. We all have an obligation of understanding what you want to do and how far we want to participate in that. I found and my colleagues found that the only way that you were ever going to seriously get some change here was if you tried to get everybody into your confidence.I can say to you, Mr Speaker, and you can tell the President that you do not get to change things that easy in the Senate. We might find ourselves in the interesting position this time of taking the speeches that were made by the government and repeating them back to them in that chamber. If it was not right in the past to do this after long and involved consultation, it is certainly not right to do it in an ambush like this.Mr Speaker, I would ask you on behalf of the opposition to reconsider your position. I would ask you to take all members—government and non-government—of this parliament into account in making any of these changes. While we have such a large number of new members on both sides, it is even more important, and incumbent upon you, to ensure that they understand what has happened. This is not something that should happen in response to some decision that the ERC has made.If the government believes that the parliament matters that little, then I think that is a sad commentary on what the government does. If the Prime Minister, who has stood up in this House year in and year out and talked about the importance of this House, thinks that to change all this by ambush is the way to do it, then my view of him as a parliamentarian has significantly changed. The one thing that I have always had for John Howard—I might not have liked the things that he said or did—is a lot of respect for the view that he often took in here as a parliamentarian. If the Prime Minister is a parliamentarian of any regard and if he has any love of the way this House works, then the government should ensure that there is far more discussion and that everybody understands just what we are doing.","N/A","PARLIAMENTARY ADMINISTRATION","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/speech[2]/break/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

It is not a government conspiracy, as you alluded to at different times, and is certainly not involving the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) least of all. This is a proper initiative by the Speaker.The Speaker concludes by saying that he will `advise the House as soon as practicable. The point is he will involve the House. We have full confidence in the Speakers preparedness to consult. But, on the issue of consultation, always remember that you will never garner a unanimity of view from this chamber—there are so many different points of view as to sitting hours, to the conduct of standing orders and the like. The Speaker, as is rightly the case, has the final decision. Some of those decisions may be hard or otherwise as he seeks to meet his objective, as he says in his statement, of `increasing demands for services at a time of budgetary restraint.

29,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr MARTIN","8I4","(Cunningham)","ALP","N/A",1967,"—I do not think anybody in this place is frightened of change. Certainly from this side of the parliament, as my colleague the member for Watson (Mr Leo Mcleay) has clearly demonstrated, on previous occasions it has been the Labor Party, when in government, that has sought to bring about some change in the way in which this parliament is managed. Both you, Mr Speaker, and Madam President, as part of the way in which our parliamentary arrangements currently operate, have very important responsibilities in that respect.The member for Watson alluded to the fact that on previous occasions Speaker Child, himself as Mr Speaker, and me as the Speaker in the last parliament endeavoured to bring before this place legislative changes which would bring efficiencies to the way in which the parliament operates. I do not think anyone disputes that that is necessary. I do not think anyone disputes that there is duplication. There are five government departments on the hill that look after the affairs of state with the parliament. Within each of those five departments there are separate human resources areas and separate pay areas—a whole range of areas where there is duplication.Behind driving change under previous Presiding Officers has been the desire to ensure that efficiencies were there, that it delivered some savings but that those savings would go back into ensuring that in no way was the opportunity for members and senators to carry out their responsibilities diminished. I think this is a paramount issue in this debate. The member for Watson has rightly talked about apparent disparities between the Senate and the House of Representatives and fears that he genuinely holds about the Senate driving the House of Representatives.We need to get an unequivocal assurance, Mr Speaker, not only from yourself, as the guardian of all of our concerns here in the premier parliament of Australia, but also from the government on this matter. Make no mistake about it, there is a very clear nexus between the parliamentary departments and the government. What the government wants at the end of the day the government will achieve, because the government allocates the funds for parliamentary departments. The concern we have is to ensure that any efficiencies which you, Mr Speaker, and Madam President drive in getting rational approaches to the delivery of services in this place do not diminish the ability of us as parliamentarians to do our job.There is a lot going on in Australia at the minute, there is a lot going on in the parliament and there is a lot of debate raging at the present time about members of parliament. There is a debate about entitlements and about what we do as members of parliament. It is all well and good out there for public mythology to believe that most of us do not do an honest days work for an honest days pay, that we are all out there with our snouts in the trough and dipping into the public purse. I refute that. Most members of parliament certainly take the opportunity, whenever they are talking to schools or to the public, to refute that. Most members of parliament that I know work, on average, 70 to 80 hours a week. They do a long, hard and arduous task on behalf of their constituents, not for any self&hyphen;gratification that they may get. I will always defend members of parliament right across the chambers on that very point.Therefore, I do not want to see any of these issues associated with making efficiencies in the operation of the parliamentary departments being driven by perhaps polling, or perceptions that the government has, that in some way this is going to make members of parliament look different in the eyes of the electorate at large. Our opportunities to work on behalf of our constituents, and more broadly the people of Australia, cannot be diminished in that respect.Also, as a former presiding officer, I know the difficulties that you are faced with in running your department. I know, for example, that in the last election campaign the present government went to the people of Australia promising that there was going to be a $10 million cut imposed on the five parliamentary departments if they were elected to office. They saw some efficiencies that were required there, but they did not know what it meant. They simply said you were going to have to cut back on the amount of money which you expended in those departments.In the case of the Department of the House of Representatives there was a $2 million cut required of them. I have to say, in one of the more selfless tasks I have ever seen, a senior public servant in an SES band was given responsibility by the Clerk of this department to examine how those savings might be achieved. At the end of the day, in a great act of selflessness, he actually recommended that his position be eliminated—and it was, and he left. The department saved an enormous amount just in one SES salary. He also recommended changes which the Clerk had to put in place—at great personal heartburn to himself because, as a departmental head, he had responsibility for ensuring that the services to the department and to the parliament were not undermined to any great extent and, of course, he had a great feeling for the people who worked in the place.The abilities of our parliament here and the House of Representatives committee structure, and so on, had to be examined. So we now see smaller secretariats looking after a couple of parliamentary committees in the one hit. They have had to say, `We cant do extensive examinations of issues because we havent got the staff or the resources, we havent got the travel budgets, and so on, to enable members of parliament to conduct their business as it should be done. This is one of the sad reflections of what happened.We know that the ERC is continuing to look at the process of driving efficiencies across all government departments, and the parliamentary departments, in no way, are going to be left out of that. It is all well and good for my good friend and colleague the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran) to stand up in here and say that this has all been driven by the President and the Speaker and that the government knew nothing about it.I have to say this, Mr Speaker. You achieved one thing which I never did as the Speaker, my colleague the member for Watson never did, and I do not think Speaker Child or Speaker Jenkins ever did. You actually got, with Madam President, to the ERC to argue a case on behalf of the parliamentary departments. I understand you had that opportunity last Thursday, if my information is correct, and I congratulate you for that. We used to have to rely on the Minister for Finance to go into an ERC and argue for parliamentary departments appropriations. That is not exactly a great recommendation because all Ministers for Finance are looking for cuts, not necessarily looking for support for those particular departments. But you have been there and have been given an opportunity to argue the case on behalf of the members you represent in this chamber. Do not forget, you have been elected, Mr Speaker, to represent the members interests in this place. That is what the Speakers position is all about. You have obviously been there with Madam President and she has put some points of view as far as the Senate is concerned and as far as the other parliamentary departments are concerned.When I put a question to you earlier this week—and you might reflect on this as well—about whether or not you felt you might achieve some more success in some of the discussions that were ongoing about improvements to the parliament and how the services of members and senators and the parliamentary departments more generally could be delivered, I suggested that you might have a little better success with the Senate if any of these changes required legislation. At the time you indicated to me that there was a possibility of some consultative group being established and I put a supplementary question to you about whether the opposition would be involved in that and you indicated that it would be.I thought that was a great suggestion. It took a few people by surprise because I do not think anybody really knew that was on the go. We thought that was great because we thought, on our side at least, that, if the changes that we had tried to make in previous parliaments were going to be achieved, then clearly we would have a role to play and we could have some negotiations and put a point of view. As my friend the member for Watson said, he and I, and those on this side of the parliament, have tried to do much of this in the past but have always got knocked over in the Senate.If you have been able to achieve some radical change in creating just two departments out of five, then clearly you seem to have some indication from government that they are going to support that. It seems to me that that means the senators have been put on board because it was coalition senators who knocked off the last three proposals in this regard.The member for Aston (Mr Nugent) is sitting up the back. He is one of the true believers of parliamentary reform. In the parliament before last, the member for Watson, as Speaker, asked the member for Aston, an opposition member, to chair an inquiry into the way in which we wanted to see some changes brought into the operation of the parliament so that efficiencies could be achieved, parliamentary departments could be collapsed down and some recommendations could be made as to how that might actually work for the betterment of this place.","N/A","PARLIAMENTARY ADMINISTRATION","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/speech[4]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

31,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr MARTIN","8I4","(Cunningham)","ALP","N/A",1967,"—Consultation was the hallmark of the report which was brought down. Interestingly, there was a minority report as part of it. That minority report was brought down on behalf of coalition senators and also, I seem to remember, a Democrats senator—who is no longer with us—who were got to by people on the other side of the building. Dare I say that it was the Clerk—I shouldnt, but it probably was—who convinced them that this was the start of all evilness, that this was the start of the evil empire where there was going to be only one parliamentary department and that any influence that he might have in the operation of the parliament may in fact be dissipated if in fact he did not get a say.He convinced the coalition senators about this and, of course, they refused to deal with it over there. At that time, the Leader of the Opposition was weak enough to say, `Well, all right, Im not going to take my own senators on about this. I think it is fair to say that the member for Aston, the member for Watson and I—because it fell on me to implement the recommendations that flowed from the member for Astons report—actually brought a bill before this parliament to effect some of that change. It got through this House with no dramas at all. The government had the numbers and we were right. But it got over to the Senate, and there it lay.My colleague and former President of the Senate at the time, Senator Sibraa, no matter how many discussions he had with Greens senators, Democrats senators, Independent senators and, dare I say, even coalition senators, could not get them to budge to even get it on the Notice Paper for consideration in that chamber at the time. So it lapsed with the passage of time and with the lapsing of the parliament.Then, early last year, I brought in a private members bill which sought to bring about three parliamentary departments from the five, and it sat on the Notice Paper . The government refused to give it priority to be brought on for debate. Yet now, as my colleague the member for Watson has remarked, here we have it on a Wednesday morning. You have come into the parliament and made a one&hyphen;page statement about how you believe this matter is to be resolved, that there will be a new structure that will be in place and that, by Tuesday, 18 March, your departmental heads will tell you how you can get the transition to that structure.I would read into that—I hope I am right on this—that that report will come before you saying how the implementation might work in a practical sense. I am not sure of this. I would hope that, at some stage, as has been suggested, that can be addressed. The practi cal mechanism is one element, but we have to consider how it can be achieved when you have acts of parliament, which have established the five parliamentary departments on this hill, that need to be amended to get down to the two departments that you are proposing.As I said, I do not have a great problem with change. I do not think that I will have, necessarily, a great problem with what has been proposed to get two departments. As long as the House of Representatives has certainly equal, if not a little stronger, influence on the way in which this might work in a practical sense, that is going to be fine. Originally, as I said, I put a proposal forward that had a third department, which, with the Department of the Library, the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff and the Joint House Department in one, provided the physical services, parliamentary information and so on.I thought that was a reasonable opportunity, but I am not dissuaded from what is being proposed. I just wonder, in part of the broader consideration of this, whether maybe we need to do what the member for Watson suggested; that is, have a bit more time for reflection and consultation about the methodology of this. We would like to know if legislative change is necessary. I think it probably will be. I think it has to be. You cannot just get rid of statutory departments by saying, `Were going to amalgamate these and just leave it up in the air. You have people such as parliamentary librarians and secretaries of joint house departments and the departments themselves, which are actually created as departments of state, already there.So if you are eliminating those, you must have legislative change to bring that about. We would like to know what that is all about. But, in terms of the broader overarching control of this, the member for Watson alluded to New Zealands parliamentary experience. I would also commend to you the board of management concept in the House of Commons and the House of Lords in the UK. From my recollection of the way that works, it was effective in as much as you had people from both sides of the parliament contributing as part of that. You also had the opportunity for things like some of the existing committees to continue to operate.One of the other practical elements of the implementation of this runs to the committee structure which is in place to oversight the way some of these departments presently work. The Joint House Committee, for example, the Library Committee, and I think there was a PISO committee, too, which was operating for a period, certainly in an advisory sense to the Presiding Officers. We would want to know whether there will still be an opportunity for people of the parliament—that is, the members themselves—to contribute in that sense to the way in which these departmental committees are run.My friend here the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), for example, has been a great contributor to the parliamentary Library Committee over a long period. I think on both sides of the parliament it would be recognised that if the opportunity was not taken to use his great ability for contribution in that sense, if that was eliminated as part of this overall structure proposal, that would be a very sad thing for the parliament. The board of management concept in the UK parliament probably still gives us the opportunity to keep those departmental committees going and to provide an opportunity for the members of parliament still to contribute to the way they want their own parliament to run.It is all well and good for our friends in the ERC to talk about bottom&hyphen;line figures and how we are going to get cost savings and so on. Given that I have suggested and tried to implement some of these myself, I am not averse to that—I say that to the Leader of the House (Mr Reith). I have talked to him about this in the past and suggested to him that if he wanted to achieve some of these savings the easiest way would have been to bring on my private members bill last year to give it a bit of a run to see how it would go. You would have gone down to three departments and some rationalisation and savings would have been made.But this will go a bit further. Our basic concern, of course, as has been expressed by the member for Watson, is the consultative process involved in this so that the members themselves have ownership of the end product. It is a simple fact of management that if you can get the participants in the process—and the Leader of the House as the Minister for Industrial Relations would know something about this now—to eventually have ownership of the outcome then it is a much easier concept to sell. We would certainly want an opportunity to participate in looking at how the implementation of this is going to work.Mr Speaker, as I and the member for Watson have said, you have achieved something which it would seem we have been unable to do in previous parliaments. That shows a little more of the resolve of the government of the day to give some assistance to that. But what we do not want to see is this being driven by ERC concerns for bottom line figures.As the member for Watson rightly said, it was all well and good for first&hyphen;time members of parliament, who were in here earlier after the statement was read, to start to heckle a little bit when we expressed some reservations about this. It is all well and good for those who have been here for five minutes to think, `This is great! Our government is doing something terrific, and all the rest of it. What they should think about is their responsibilities in representing the people of Australia in this place and having the facilities to be able to do that. We do not want to see that diminished. When they are here a bit longer, they will suddenly realise that that is the case.Mr Speaker, you are in the difficult position of trying to find that $2 million savings here in the House of Representatives, let alone in the other departments that you and Madam President have joint responsibility for. But when you get down to nitpicking things like reducing down to one a day the newspaper allocation for backbenchers in this place, then this is cause for concern. My colleague the member for Watson reminds me that, whilst you have taken that decision to reduce our allocation down to one newspaper, the senators get three.","N/A","PARLIAMENTARY ADMINISTRATION","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/speech[4]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

It is a fact of life that information drives us all. The decisions we make are based on receiving appropriate information. One way to do it, whether or not we like the tenor of some of the stories—I will not go into some of the ones in the Illawarra Mercury today—is to go to the information base and you will see that that still provides us with the basis of much of what helps shape our opinions and what we subsequently determine to vote on.I wrap up my contribution, and I am sorry that I have delayed the House a little longer than I had anticipated, by simply making a few points. We think that there is a need for more consultation—I try to say it in very much a bipartisan, apolitical way—for the parliament. We think there is a need for more consultation so that you, Mr Speaker, and Madam President can take the parliament—that is, the House of Representatives and the Senate—into your own confidence on this matter so that we have a fuller understanding of what is intended here.We do not have a philosophical problem about making changes, and we are not opposed to change. My record and the record of the member for Watson stand on this; we have tried to achieve this ourselves. So we are not opposed to it, but we want that consultation process. We want to see what it means for members and senators. We want to ensure that we have that opportunity to make that contribution. We do not, however, want to see you and Madam President being driven by bottom line ERC considerations.The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has always said that he believed the parliament was paramount; he believed the parliament was the chart maker of the destiny of this country. What we do not want to see is some small collection of ministers driven by people concerned with bottom lines and deficits and all the rest of it—although that is very important, and we do not dispute that. But if you are going to make savings by amalgamations of departments, then surely you can still contribute to the governments bottom line deficit reduction strategy and at the same time not continue a slash and burn policy within the parliamentary departments and the other departments.We as members have to be able to service our constituencies. We have to be able to service more broadly the people of Australia. As I have said before, if you look at the history of the way in which parliamentary committees and the House of Representatives have been effective conduits of information to governments and how governments have acted on that, you will see that you do not reduce those resources—you use them more fully.I say to the two ministers who are at the table here today: reports that the member for Lalor has brought down, reports of people like the former Attorney-General Michael Lavarch, when he was chairman of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, reports of the committee which I had the great pleasure to chair on Finance, Banking and Public Administration, which the Sergeant&hyphen;at&hyphen;Arms was secretary to at one stage, and reports of other members in this place have, over time, made a contribution to the government of this country and to improvements in the lifestyles of the people of this country. To eliminate those opportunities, to just snaffle out any of the creativeness that comes from members of parliament operating in those sorts of forums, is short&hyphen;sighted—very short&hyphen;sighted. We should not be driven by ERC considerations.We would like to think that your statement today is flagging a statement of intent.

We would like to think that what you have suggested here—that on 18 March you will be given an opportunity to receive from departmental heads an implementation plan on how this might work—will form the second tranche of this consultation process.We would like to think that you will bring it to the parliament and do what was suggested in your statement to me in answer to a question: form a committee with people from both sides—I am sure that you will get cooperation from our side of the parliament—to look at what has been proposed so that the objectives of both achieving efficiencies in the way this place operates and eliminating duplication are accomplished at the same time as not having a negative impact on the way in which members and senators can perform their rightful, elected duties to the people of Australia.If you can achieve that tripartite objective, then you have done well. We will give you full support on that, but we want that consultation. The member for Aston (Mr Nugent) can give you a bit of advice if you call him in. He has been involved in this.

36,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr NUGENT","UT4","(Aston)","LP","N/A",1973,"—I would like to say to the previous speaker that, given the testimonial he afforded me during his comments, I am sure he will accept my statement that I had no prior knowledge that this was coming up this morning. I came out of a committee meeting, went back to my office, looked up at the television screen and said to myself words to the effect of, `What on earth is that all about? I listened a bit and then came down.I do have a significant interest in this particular matter for the sorts of reasons that were alluded to. However, I do have to correct one thing in particular that the previous speaker mentioned: I do not think, when I became chair of that committee three or four or five years ago, that I was appointed by the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), who was then the Speaker. The committee was set up under his tutelage and, certainly, it was set up with a majority of non&hyphen;government members. I think I was actually nominated by the then opposition; the opposition whip may have had something to do with that particular activity. But I was chair of that committee. It had a majority of non&hyphen;government members, it deliberated for some length of time and it made certain recommendations in terms of mergers of some of the departments. It had a specifically limited brief, which was not as broad as the proposals that I understand you are bringing into the House now. Nevertheless, it certainly came out with a majority recommendation that there should be mergers. There was a minority report from three senators: two from the coalition and one from the Democrats. Subsequently, the matter stalled on its way through, as we have already heard.It seemed to me that, as we went through the assessment of merging the departments, there were a great number of benefits to be achieved through such a merger. At that time we were looking particularly at merging the Department of the Parliamentary Library and the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff—Hansard. We were not looking at the Joint House Department at that stage, although options had been looked at previously. It seemed to me there were considerable advantages in what we were going to do. We identified some specific dollar savings and, at that time, we got an assurance from the then government that those savings would be ploughed back into the parliament for further development of services for senators and members. That, of course, was a major attraction about the process.In terms of supporting the principle of rationalisation or mergers, such as your statement has put before the chamber today, there are a couple of things that need to be said. Obviously, the statement you have provided us with is fairly broad and I will await with great interest the details of how you intend to achieve the objectives you have laid before us. But it seems to me that, in looking at what you are proposing to do, there is a very important question of balance. Historically, the Senate has been the chamber that has jealously guarded its rights, its entitlements and so on. I am sure that I do not need to remind you but, for the record, I will say that I think it is important that the House of Representatives makes sure that, in any new arrangement, it is appropriately structured and supported in any joint arrangement. This is the chamber where governments are formed and this is the chamber the Prime Minister comes from. This chamber needs to ensure that it is adequately and properly supported in every sense of the word. That is something that you will have a heavy responsibility for in terms of the plans that will be brought forward.I am interested to see, Mr Speaker, that you are suggesting the merger of the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff, the Library—and, for the benefit of those in the gallery, the Library is not just a collection of books: it is also a major research service which, in many ways, is a more important function than just the collection of books—and the Joint House Department, which looks after all of the housekeeping and maintenance of the building. The practicalities of merging those and putting them under the control of the two chamber departments, the Senate and the House of Representatives, will present some unique challenges. I await with great interest the clear ingenuity that will obviously be needed to achieve success in that because you are talking about common services being split in some shape or form to provide separate services to senators and to members of the House of Representatives. Whilst I do not see too many problems in terms of the mechanics of splitting some elements, such as the reporting staff and maybe the library, when it comes to matters of security, building maintenance and so on there will be a necessity for some standardisation between the two chambers, probably more in terms of taking away things that the Senate might hold unto itself. It will be an interesting set of negotiations.Having said that, I think it is important that we do, from time to time, look at new struc tures. The structure for this parliament has been in place for many years and there is no doubt in my mind, from the previous exercise that I conducted as the chair of the committee that looked at merging some of those departments, that there are overwhelming reasons to rationalise, merge and restructure some of the departments in this building. A lot of those savings can be made purely and simply by doing away with some of the duplication of functions between departments, by streamlining administration and by not having to get duplicate sets of advice, duplicate sets of information and duplicate sets of consultants to advise different departments on different things. There is a lot of streamlining that will go on which will not only make dollar savings, which is obviously important in the current climate, but will also make efficiency savings and will help the chambers run more effectively.So, in principle, Mr Speaker, I am a great supporter of what you are trying to do. I echo the comments of the previous speaker that both he and the member for Watson, as former occupants of your chair, tried to tread this route. They are to be commended for that; but they were unsuccessful. If you have found a way of going down that route more successfully, that is to your credit. I look forward to the details of the plan.I would just like to make the point on which I think the previous speaker and I—and I am sure most members of this chamber—would have common ground. Although dollar savings are important and although efficiencies are important the paramount thing that you—and I am sure that you are aware of this—and those responsible for implementing the detail of such a plan need to bear in mind is ultimately the service of the members.These days we all understand that being a member of this chamber is a very hard, professional, full&hyphen;time job. Increasingly, because of the demands and the public scrutiny, and because of the frequent calls on your time in a whole range of areas, you do need comprehensive support in this place. It is important that the quality and quantity of that support for members is not diminished in any way although, obviously, savings and efficiencies can be made.I conclude, Mr Speaker, by saying that I commend your initiative. I wish you luck in steering the matter through. I know that all members of this chamber would wish to be informed and hopefully participate in some of the further detail. I await the detail with interest and I look forward to the parliament making a major step forward when it is able to achieve efficiencies and rationalisations of this nature.","N/A","PARLIAMENTARY ADMINISTRATION","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
37,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr McMULLAN","5I4","(Canberra)","ALP","N/A",1975,"—This statement raises a large number of questions, many of which I would like to have the opportunity to traverse today but the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) has requested, not unreasonably, that I constrain my remarks and I will therefore not traverse any of the matters raised so extensively by my colleagues the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) and the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin). I want to raise essentially new matters having had a few concerns, particularly in my capacity as the member for Canberra.Having had the opportunity to serve both in the Senate and here I can see some of these issues perhaps from a different perspective from some of my colleagues. What concerns me is that while from before I came to the parliament, certainly from the day I arrived, I thought the five&hyphen;department structure was absurd, on the face of it, Mr Speaker, I have to say that you seem to have come up with an equally absurd proposal—but I hope when the detail emerges that does not prove to be the case. I am sure you have thought it through and there will be some indication of how what looks on the face of it to be not an adequate alternative will develop to be so. I merely endorse the remarks made by my colleagues about the need for a fuller explanation and an opportunity for consultation.One of the two phrases in the statement that caught my attention and surprised me was the phrase `we have decided rather than `we are putting forward a proposition that or `we would like the House and the Senate to consider the following proposal. But that has been adequately traversed by others. The other phrase is `make significant savings. I have been here for nine years and I have been in public political life for 20 years; and I know what that code means. It means that the over 1,000 people who work in this building are in serious trouble. Their job security is under serious threat. That is what it means.I am concerned that you have announced here today `we have decided and I wonder what consultation there has been with those people who work in this building and with their representatives, the trade unions which represent them in this place. Many of these people live in my electorate and the electorates of my colleagues the member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis) and the member for Fraser (Mr Dargavel)—and also of course the member for Eden Monaro (Mr Nairn).I am sure they would share my concern that we have here a proposition that will dramatically affect immediately not only the security, confidence and optimism but in the very short term perhaps also the jobs of a large number of Australians, not in most cases highly paid. They will go into a labour market here in the ACT in the south&hyphen;east New South Wales region that is severely depressed and is correctly described by Access Economics as in recession. So I am very worried about what is proposed and its implications for those people. I am particularly concerned—and not having had the chance to speak to you, Mr Speaker, I do not want to assume this—because, as on the face of it the government did not know about it and the opposition did not know about it, it seems to me highly unlikely that there has been opportunity for consultation with those 1,000 people most directly affected. It is their jobs that are so politely affected by these code words `make significant savings. Everybody knows what it means.It is a serious intent. We do have to take care of the taxpayers money. We cannot simply go on running duplication and having five departments doing what a smaller number can do but these are Australians with the right to have their interests considered when major changes are made that affect their capacity to earn their income and where they face the prospect, if they cannot retain their existing employment, of being thrown onto a labour market already thrust into recession by previous decisions.I have not spoken about the complex questions of the parliamentary implications of this. I feel strongly about it and I would want to participate in the discussion about it. I think the small number of us who have served in both houses can contribute something to that from an interesting perspective. But that has been discussed at length and we are unduly taking time to duplicate it. I simply wanted to add to the concerns properly raised by the three previous speakers my concern about the prospects and consequences of these changes and the process of their implementation for the over 1,000 people who work in this building.","N/A","PARLIAMENTARY ADMINISTRATION","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

39,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr REITH","WI4","(Flinders—","LP","Leader of the House)",1976,"—Whilst I appreciate that this is on indulgence, after discussions with the opposition I think the proposition is that I will close the debate as best I can but that there will be further discussions informally on the matter during the day. I should say that my initial reaction is to say that you have shown a firm direction for some changes to the supportive administrative arrangements for the parliament and I would think there would be a lot of support for your initiative in terms of reforms to those administrative arrangements. I think that was well put by the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) when he made the point that some of these issues have been the subject of a lot of discussion over many years and in a sense you have taken the bull by the horns and come in this morning with a very clear proposed framework for reform to be undertaken.There is, of course, much merit in this particular proposition, but I confine my remarks to the most generalised sense as there have been a number of reform options developed over the years—and I speak ad lib and without an opportunity to prepare in any detail. The House of Commons, I think, went for a sort of megaservice department and two—lower house and upper house—departments, but that was a scheme that did not work. There are other Commonwealth parliaments that provide a steer as to the effectiveness of administrative arrangements, and the one that you have proposed I know from my past reading on this is certainly a viable option and would have much merit to it. Obviously that has been a factor you have taken into account in putting the proposition.I do, however, accept the point which opposition members have made that it is important to provide people with real detail as to what lies behind this proposition because there are some very genuine areas of concern which people will have. The jobs issue, of course, is very important; the service to members is important, and there are other matters that go to the balance between the houses which I suspect will also be the subject of concern—and proper concern at that.It is sometimes difficult, in looking at possible restructures, to know whether you should proceed with a planning stage and not tell people what your end objective is or whether you should tell people what your end objective is and then get the details done in a much more transparent way. You have opted for the up&hyphen;front transparent setting of the goal and a process to meet that goal. By having a relatively short timetable, I presume your intention is to minimise uncertainty in the minds of those who might be affected. I think uncertainty for people, particularly when it comes to jobs, is a real problem for people, most understandably, so I think that must lie behind what you have said.I must also say, Mr Speaker, that whilst we did receive a phone call this morning at approximately 9.20 that there would be a statement from you at 9.30, I was not aware of the contents of that statement except in the broadest terms of `something to do with administration. The fact that it was the announcement that it is was not known to me until I had completed my official duties at Government House at a meeting of the Executive Council and walked into this parliament at a quarter past ten or thereabouts.I do think it is important that there be some consultation on this. It is obviously a matter which affects every member. Ultimately these administrative arrangements can go to matters of great constitutional import as to the balance between the houses and the independence of the houses. There will be a lot of interest in this proposal.I do not propose to say any more than that, Mr Speaker, but, to reiterate my point, I do think that reform has been the subject of a lot of discussion over the years but has not really materialised. Certainly, with the President, you have taken a very firm lead. I think that will be generally welcomed, but it will also be important to the process that there be full and thorough consultation on the way in which the matter is now proceeded with.","N/A","PARLIAMENTARY ADMINISTRATION","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I thank you all for your contributions. Much of what has been covered will become clearer subsequent to 18 March. But be aware that the deliberations have been ongoing now for seven or eight months; it is not driven by the ERC.Shortly after we—that is, the President and I—took up our appointments on our election subsequent to the election last year, it became imperative that the basic organisation of the parliament needed to be reviewed. That has been an ongoing process. It has been deliberated on from within the parliament and without the parliament, and we have certainly taken cognisance of what has happened in the parliaments of Great Britain, Canada and New Zealand, among others.So this is, as acknowledged I think by the member for Cunningham and the member for Watson, perhaps the first shot in what will be an ongoing process. As further information comes to hand, there will be ample opportunity for consultation, not only amongst the members and senators themselves, but at all levels of the parliament.

48,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr SAWFORD","3J4","(Port Adelaide)","ALP","N/A",1977,"—As far as manufacturing industry is concerned in this country, this is a government without a skerrick of vision and a government without any commitment whatsoever to manufacturing industry. This is a government that sets no positive outcomes for manufacturing industry. Really it is pretty appalling when you sum up the governments total lack of empathy for and response to manufacturing industry. The whole trinity is actually missing. There is no rationale, there is no process, and there are no positive outcomes. The government has gone missing, the minister has gone missing and, particularly, the backbench has gone missing. This is a government that has dumped on manufacturing industry and simply walked away from their responsibilities.What greater evidence could you submit to support those propositions than the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill 1996? This is a government made up of the same mind&hyphen;set as the Fraser government which squandered opportunities for economic and employment growth from 1976 to 1983. This is a government that has learned precious little from the history of the past 50 years. A simple examination of any OECD country from the 1950s tells us that the gap between gross national product and employment is pretty much on a par.But today there is a huge gap, when you look at the graphs, between GNP and the levels of employment. Albeit brief, any analysis of the last 50 years clearly shows the following trends in industry. Firstly, capital investment in real terms has quadrupled. Secondly, energy consumption has tripled and manufacturing output has tripled. But the real catch is that employment has only grown by one-third. The developed world has created a chronic and endemic employment problem of around 10 per cent and growing, whatever governments do with their figures.Current economic orthodoxies will not solve the problem. Rather, they entrench unemployment at the unacceptable present levels. Traditional industries such as textiles and iron, steel and metals processing are all declining in employment, whilst electronics, telecommunications, information technology and biotechnology are growing, but not to the extent to take up the labour surplus.We know the microelectronic industry has spawned whole new industries, but it has also, in a very frightening way, reduced the need for labour throughout the world. Throughout the industrialised world we are substituting capital, energy and increased output for human labour which is in surplus. Traditional economic growth is no longer accompanied by a commensurate increase in the number of jobs.When it comes to the manufacturing industry, this government is simply not a player. It cannot cut the mustard; it is just not in the game. This government has forced the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) to opt out of manufacturing industry. This government has forced the minister to basically wash his hands of, and walk away from, manufacturing industry.It is much worse than that. As the shadow minister for has often pointed out in this House, it not just the axing of the bounties contained in this legislation which betrays the manufacturers of this country. There are also cuts in research and development, significant scaling back of the DIFF scheme, huge cuts to the export market development grants scheme, cuts to Austrade and cuts to AusIndustry. All up, that is about a $4 billion belt around the ears for manufacturing industry over the next four years. That cut of around $4 billion by way of industry support over four years is in the Howard governments first budget. No wonder the manufacturers in this country are a little shell&hyphen;shocked and under siege from this government.These decisions are driven by an ideological frenzy that fiscal consolidation will solve this nations problems. It will not. Of course it will not. What will happen will be a loss of economic growth, a loss of jobs and a loss of exports. The signals are very clear. The quarry mentality is back. Value added, manufacturing producing jobs earning dollars from exports cannot get a look in.When the coalition was last in government the number of manufacturing jobs in Australia dropped by eight per cent in one year. This happened in their last year in government. Now it will happen in the first four years, their first years in government. In the past the coalition did not understand manufacturing industry, and they do not understand it now.By contrast, under Labor, manufacturing industry exports grew by a whopping 405 per cent. The No. 1 idea of the new governments policy for business and manufacturing is that the government should get out of the way. The government want no role in business or manufacturing and they appointed a can&hyphen;do nothing minister to achieve exactly that.The cabinet has frozen out this minister so that he is so perfunctory that his brain seems to be in deep freeze mode. The government wants to eliminate what it calls `business welfare. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) has stood up in this parliament and called those manufacturers who have claimed the R&D tax concession `tax rorters on more than one occasion. In fact, he seems to take special pleasure in the tax rorters claim. Research and development is cut.A survey of 125 large and medium sized companies revealed that, as a direct result of the decision to cut R&D tax concessions, 34 per cent of companies were considering moving their R&D operations offshore, 57 per cent would reduce their research and development, and many more will now import the technology rather than conduct their own research and development. What a recipe for disaster. This bill axes four industry bounties despite promises to the contrary during the election campaign. It terminates the ships, books, machine tools and robotics bounties.A couple of months ago I asked the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) whether he would refer to his cabinet unemployment committee the impact of the abolition of the book bounty on companies like Griffin Press in Adelaide, where 140 full- and part-time workers were given redundancy notices. It has to be said that he basically avoided giving a real answer in stating that the decisions cannot be disaggregated.The book and publishing industry were operating on the understanding that the bounty would continue until the end of 1997. In fact, contracts, which in this industry operate from periods of up to five years, were entered into on that basis. This government has compromised the ability of this industry to make sensible business decisions.Printing and publishing firms estimate that around 50 per cent of the 2,600 jobs in the industry could be at risk and lost. This is an industry that the book bounty encouraged to increase exports by over 200 per cent. Its premature abolition threatens export earnings, 1,300 jobs and 1,300 families. Opportunities for young Australians are diminished and, basically, it is just a kick in the teeth to the printing and the publishing industry.The abolition of the ships bounty just defies commonsense. The government wants to cut the five per cent support for Australian shipbuilders of vessels, nearly all of which are exported. In the eight years since Labor introduced the bounty, the Australian shipbuilding industry has grown dramatically. It is a world leader in high&hyphen;speed catamaran production. Production is up by 200 per cent. Exports are up by 150 per cent. Employment is up by 50 per cent. You would have thought that that is a very good recipe for growth, progress and jobs. But the governments response is to give it a belt around the ears. At five per cent support, Australia could more than compete with Norway, with a subsidy of 13.2 per cent, with Denmark, at 13 per cent, and with Italy, up to 25 per cent. But they cannot compete at zero per cent.Has the government taken into account the fact that the so-called OECD agreement to end shipbuilding subsidies by the end of 1998 will not go ahead now because the USA will not sign up to it? Consistency certainly is no hallmark of this government. The government continued to support the ships capital grants scheme by funding $23 million to help companies like Shell and BHP import ships made in Holland, but it will not help Australian shipbuilders. For a saving of a measly $9 million to the budget, the abolition of the ships bounty cost one company $225 million in lost contracts. The company suffers. The employees suffer. The nation suffers.In addition to the abolition of the book and shipbuilding bounties, the government has terminated the machine tools and robotics bounties and will abolish the computer bounty on 1 July next year. That the computer bounty abolition is to be delayed raises some very interesting possibilities. Is it not the case that the minister has considerable interest in companies that claim the computer bounty?But the impact from this legislation is far greater than books, shipbuilding, machine tools, robotics and computers. It sends a chilling reminder to manufacturing industry, the steel industry—and we are setting up a steel committee—the car industry, the pharmaceutical industry, the plastics industry, the automotive supplier industry, and you could go on and on, that this government simply does not seem to give a damn about them. It is going to hang them out to dry and simply let the market rip.The signals are clear from this legislation that not only will existing manufacturing industry be affected—the ones that improved exports by over 400 per cent under Labor and which secured economic and employment growth directly assisting the battling families this government so fraudulently purports to represent—but it has been a complete vacuum, an empty void, as to what the future holds for industry policy. Where is the government providing leadership to the future enhancement of job growth?Take a simple move to solar energy: that would create jobs. The production of solar collectors for space and water heating includes glass or plastic for the covers, copper, aluminium and steel for the frames and absorber plates, and fibreglass, rigid foam or the wool stockpile for the insulation. All of these are established industries, many working below capacity. The occupations include sheet metal workers, carpenters, plumbers, pipe fitters and construction workers, many working in regional areas.Simply raising the goal of the current five to six per cent of homes with solar heating to 25 per cent—and this has been done in a study by the Australia New Zealand Solar Society—would create 25,000 jobs nationwide, without importing anything. Solar potential in this country remains largely unfulfilled. Incentives are required not only for research and development but also for the manufacturing and marketing on a large scale to make it cost efficient. This country has the potential to be the world leader in and a major exporter of manufactured solar thermal technology.Take another area, weatherisation—energy efficient housing. For every $1 million spent in that area, you get 80 jobs. Again, Australia has the potential to be a world leader.What about public infrastructure? In this country you just want to pull your hair out at the idiocy of transport policies from state and federal governments over the last 30 or 40 years. A German study shows that, when you spend $1 billion on road construction, you create around 10,000 to 14,000 jobs. But if you spent that same $1 billion on heavy rail, you get 22,000 jobs—and we are talking about permanent jobs. If you spend it on light rail, you get 23,000 jobs for the same expenditure—around double the jobs you would get for anything on road construction.Every year in Australia the cost—`subsidy is more correct—for road transport is well in excess of $10 billion. In fact, I think it is more like double that. That is $5 billion we spend on the actual road building and maintenance and $5 billion on the result of road trauma, and goodness knows how much on compensation claims and associated legal costs. Little thought appears to be given to the size of this subsidy for road transport. A country rail line loses $20 million or $30 million and everybody goes feral in this country, but they never apply the same rules to the building of roads.Subsidies for light and heavy rail, as we all know, are not so kindly treated. That does not make sense. It is dumb. It is stupid. A balance is required between all forms of transport. Unlike road building, which imports the road making and the road maintenance equipment and the majority of vehicles that travel upon roads, investment development in heavy and light rail could be 100 per cent Australian—materials, design, manufactured, marketed, exported.We live in an area of the world where many cities in South-East Asia have enormous urban transport problems. Enormous potential exists for the export of cost efficient urban transport systems in our region. I think the Hong Kong light rail system was planned and marketed in Melbourne. It is not only Sydney, Brisbane and Adelaide; it is Taipei, Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City, et cetera.The fundamental role of any economy is to provide jobs. That is the role of government, and governments around the world are just running away from that responsibility. They replace public good with private good. They replace moral good with a principle of user pays.The second principle is that there be a fair distribution of income among its citizens. For that to occur, governments need to lead. They need to be proactive. They need not to opt out of their responsibilities because they do not have the guts to raise the necessary revenue to meet the expectations of citizens.There is a belief around the Western world that corporations and business will deliver full employment. What absolute rot! How can people think so stupidly? It is the role of government that will look after families. Why would a corporation—a big business or a small business—take on the responsibility of the citizens of a country? That is just absolute nonsense. Why would they? Of course, they would not. They do not have the long&hyphen;term responsibility for stability in families that governments have.Governments—this government and governments in other parts of the developed world—are moving away at a rate of knots from the commitments and the social contracts that governments should have with battling workers. This legislation is yet another example of the abandonment of public good and the moral contract governments should have with their citizens.It is interesting to note that the leaders of government and the leaders of industry around the world in the 1950s and 1960s went through school in the 1930s and the Depression. Many of these people, highly skilled people, waited sometimes three or four years before they got a job. They went through the Second World War, the Korean War and the Cold War, but they believed in the responsibility and were acutely aware of unemployment.Today, the leaders of government, our own generation, and the leaders of business have come from an era of full employment due to the efforts of that previous generation. The sensitivity and the edge for jobs is simply not here. It is something we need to rediscover. It is something that this government should rediscover. If it does rediscover this, then the government may have the courage to lead. We might then have ministers on the front bench over there who have the courage to lead.If the government cannot do that and if governments around the world cannot follow their own advice and do not get out of the way, electorates in this country and many other countries in the developed world will very quickly change government in the next 10 years, because the expectations of their citizens are high. So they should be. If governments walk away from their responsibilities, as shown in the Bounty Amendment Bill 1996, they will act at the ballot box far more quickly than people imagine.","N/A","BOUNTY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
49,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr OCONNOR","WU5","(Corio)","ALP","N/A",1981,"—The Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 now before the House gives effect to yet another broken promise made by the Howard government before the 1996 election. It joins the long list of broken promises made to Australian industry at that election. This legislation violates the mandate that was given to the Howard government at that election.In the first Howard government budget we have seen the withdrawal of over $3.9 billion in industry assistance over a four&hyphen;year period. That is in violation of the explicit commitments made to Australian industry in the lead&hyphen;up to that election. For example, the government gave an express and explicit commitment to maintain the research and development taxation concession to Australian industry at 150 per cent. In its budget it announced that it had slashed it to 125 per cent. It gave an express commitment to maintain export incentive programs, and in the budget they slashed them mercilessly. With regard to the bounty schemes relating to books, computers, machine tools and robots, and ships, which are the subject of this legislation, the promises given to manufacturers in these industries have been broken as well.What makes the ahead of schedule termination of the bounty schemes significant is simply the specific nature of the impact of the budget decision—specific in the sense that the impact is on easily identifiable industries and manufacturing firms and on regional communities. When the government slashed the R&D concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent the impact of that decision was felt by many firms in manufacturing industry. A similar impact has occurred as a result of the reduction in expenditure on export assistance schemes.In the case of the bounty schemes which are the subject of this legislation, the damage wrought by the government decision is localised, identifiable and substantial. While the amendments in this bill represent some marginal improvement on the original measures that were announced in the budget, the opposition regards them as regressive; and we will oppose them. With regard to the governments backdown on the books bounty, we consider that it has not gone far enough with the amendment it is proposing in this legislation. The opposition is of the view that the govern ment should have restored the original expiry date of 31 December 1997 put in place by Labor when it was in government—an expiry date the coalition signed up to before the 1996 election.With regard to the ships bounty, the government backdown extends it six months beyond the 30 June 1996 expiry date put in place by Labor. However, the measures which the government has announced are quite inadequate in meeting the needs of shipbuilders in this country and they have responded to the governments initiative by labelling the governments measures the Claytons bounty and a failure.The opposition will oppose this government amendment because of its failure to adequately link the bounty to an OECD agreement to eliminate shipbuilding subsidies. The OECD agreement is due to commence in July 1997 but has yet to be ratified by signatory countries. The weakness in what the government is proposing is that it does not provide a sufficient guarantee to industry that the government will extend the bounty if the OECD agreement is not ratified by that date.The oppositions amendment in contrast would ensure the continuation of the ships bounty until the OECD agreement comes into force. This will establish a more secure investment climate for the industry in which it can negotiate its further contracts and get into the exporting ring in a bigger way.This is not the only weakness of the governments bill. The other major weakness relates to the phase&hyphen;in period. There is an inherent advantage to overseas shipbuilders under the terms of the OECD agreement when compared to what the government is proposing in this legislation with regard to Australian shipbuilders. Under the OECD agreement, shipbuilders can still claim a subsidy up to three years after the agreement commences, provided the contract was signed before that date.Under the governments legislation, the bounty can only be claimed for ships completed by the end of 1997. The advantage to overseas shipbuilders is patently obvious. The amendments that the opposition is proposing align Australias arrangements squarely with the OECD. This at least gives Australian producers the same tilt at industry assistance as overseas shipbuilders.The shipbuilding industry in Australia has left us all in no doubt as to their assessment of the governments about&hyphen;face in this legislation. They still regard the governments measures as a Claytons shipbuilding bounty, as I mentioned before. I refer the House to a press release issued by the Australian Shipbuilders Association on 12 February 1997. In that press release they explicitly state that this is a Claytons shipbuilding bounty and that the governments failure to address the bounty issue correctly heralds job cuts and more export losses. At a time when the national economy is struggling and we need extra jobs in manufacturing industry, and at a time when the balance of payments needs exports to bring that deficit down, here we have a deliberate measure being proposed by the government which will, on the advice of the shipbuilders of this nation and other manufacturers who receive the bounty, lead to a decrease in employment opportunities across those industries, particularly in regional areas, and will lead to a decline in exports. This is what the Chairman of the Australian Shipbuilders Association, Mr John Rothwell, had to say:The Australian shipbuilding industry is no better off than it was prior to the Federal Governments announcement to extend the shipbuilding bounty, and substantial stand&hyphen;downs will be experienced in the near future.Further on he said:While the industry was initially very excited and relieved by the announcement, it has proved to be nothing more than a disappointing teaser, and in reality of no value at all. We remain hugely disadvantaged.This is an industry which employs over 13,000 Australians directly or indirectly and last year earned in excess of half a billion dollars in export earnings. Here we have Mr Rothwell saying that what the government has announced is purely a tease. We have an industry minister who is a big tease. That is about all he can deliver. He does not deliver measures of substance and industry assistance measures of substance; he merely teases the industry while it struggles to compete with heavily subsidised overseas manufacturers in the shipbuilding area.I think it is pertinent at this point to ask why the government is proposing these amendments in its legislation at all. Really, they are simply a humiliating backdown for the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), a minister who is regarded across the length and breadth of manufacturing industry in Australia as both hopeless and hapless.But, of course, the government has changed its view on the measures that it announced in the 1996 budget because of the pressure that we have applied to it here on the floor of this House and out across the regions of Australia. I pay tribute to manufacturers in the industries that are affected by these measures and to the regional communities in which those firms are located for their substantial lobbying efforts on behalf of their workers and their families and their regional communities, because it has been that combination of pressure from the opposition, from regional communities and from industries themselves that has brought this pathetic change—if you can call it that—to the governments proposals.I suppose we should be grateful for small mercies, that the industry minister has gone away and argued the toss before the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and come back with a few concessions to industry. But they do not go far enough. And the only measures and the only amendments that will really address the industry concerns are the ones that have been put on the floor of the House by the opposition.Of course, the government could have saved itself a whole lot of trouble in this particular area, with this legislation, simply by sticking to its election promises. It gave specific commitments to manufacturers in the shipbuilding industry, in the computer industry, in the machine tools and robots industry and in the book printing industry. They were very specific commitments, and those commitments simply said that the government, when and if it came to power, would continue the arrangements that Labor had implemented when it was in power.The Prime Minister also said that those promises were predicated on the basis that, even if there was a deterioration in the deficit, or even if their worst fears were realised, the bottom line in all of this was that the Prime Minister would keep his promises to the Australian people. Well, he didnt. He didnt keep them to the shipbuilders of this nation or the book printers of this nation. He certainly didnt keep them to the regional communities who are now going to be affected by this exercise in industry assistance stupidity, and certainly not to the workers and their families who are employed in those particular industries.At least we have extracted some concessions out of the government, as a response to the pressure that Labor brought to bear both in this House and out in regional communities. In the context of this debate, I am very pleased to make some comment on the remarks of the Treasurer yesterday when he arrogantly strutted this House claiming that no-one really knew what Labor stood for. This arrogant Treasurer is very much out of touch with what is happening in regional Australia.In Tasmania, they know what Labor stands for in regard to industry policy and the shipbuilding industry in particular. In Western Australia, the shipbuilders know exactly where Labor stands in regard to this element of industry policy. In Maryborough, Victoria—I acknowledge the presence in the House of the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), who knows the midlands area and that town very well; he should know the devastating impact that the government measures will have on that particular community—they know very well what Labor stands for in regard to the assistance given to the printing industry in particular.We on this side of the House are very perplexed about what this arrogant Treasurer really stands for himself. We know that, as a founding member of the H.R. Nicholls Society, he had very strong views on the course of industrial relations reform, as he calls it—I call it a regressive series of actions with regard to industrial relations—and two, three, four or five years ago we were left in no doubt as to what the Treasurers views were on industrial relations in this country. The Howard government has brought down its so-called industrial relations reforms. The H.R. Nicholls Society has come out in the last week and said that it is a betrayal and a sell-out. When asked in this House yesterday whether the Treasurer concurred with the views of this society that he established, all he could say was no—an arrogant no to a very substantial question which was asking the Treasurer where he stood on measures that affect the livelihoods of workers in regional industry.We on this side of the House have very great concerns about the competence of this arrogant Treasurer. The Treasurer is the only economist or chief economist in the Western world that can claim a four per cent growth rate, a two per cent inflation rate, single digit interest rates, low levels of industrial disputation and burgeoning levels of exports and job growth, left to him by the previous Labor government, as an economic mess. We have a real problem in this country when the chief economic officer regards a four per cent growth rate and a two per cent inflation rate as an economic mess.The impact of the governments budgetary measures in the bounty legislation will be felt acutely in the regions of Australia—especially in Tasmania, Western Australia and Victoria. Last year when this measure was announced, I travelled to Maryborough in Victoria—a regional town which relies very heavily for its employment on the printing industry. I talked with industry leaders, community leaders and companies such as McPhersons which are going to be affected by the withdrawal of the book bounty and the withdrawal of other industry assistance measures that the government is emasculating in its budget. They expressed a total lack of confidence in the industry minister and also in the direction of the governments industry policy.There is one thing that came through in the discussions that I had with those community leaders and particularly with those companies; that is, they require certainty in their investment environment. They made very specific investment decisions and plans on the back of the book bounty and on the back of industry assistance measures that were guaranteed to them by the previous Labor government; and they were given an express commitment by the coalition that those measures would be continued if a coalition government were elected in the 1996 election, regardless of the budgetary circumstance.This twister of a Prime Minister, the honourable member for Bennelong—who goes around this country trying to persuade people that there is such a thing as a core and a non-core promise—violated the mandate that he was given, in the measures that are contained in this legislation before the House.Those people had some very harsh things to say about the industry minister. It is a simple fact that we have a lame duck occupying one of the most significant portfolios in this country. There is no&hyphen;one on either side of the House who can objectively look at the Prime Ministers ministerial code of conduct and come to any conclusion other than that the industry minister should have been sacked. The only thing that saved him was the fact that two minor heads rolled before the Prime Minister got to consider his particular position and his violation of the ministerial codes of conduct. The Prime Ministers failure to do what he should have done has sent shock waves reverberating throughout regional Australia, because they have lost confidence in this industry minister and they have lost confidence in the industry policy of the government. It is an industry policy that is full of inconsistencies and is in tatters within one year of this governments life.The one thing that has really led to a drop in confidence in the regions has been the downright betrayal of the regions in the measures that were announced in the budget. These measures include the $150 million that was withdrawn from the regional development program; the $620 million that was dragged out of road funding programs; the $1.8 billion that was dragged out of labour market programs; and the cuts to the number of university places which gave regional workers and their children a chance to get a better education—these are the measures that have sapped the confidence of people in regional areas. They have been severely compounded by the measures that are contained in this legislation. I reiterate once again that the industry minister ought to be sacked.

50,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr REID","VT4","(Bendigo)","LP","N/A",1985,"—I am pleased to participate in this debate on the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill, because I represent Maryborough in central Victoria, which has the highest concentration of printing industries and probably book printers in the whole of Australia. I have represented and have been proud to represent that area since 1976, both in state politics and in federal politics since coming here in 1990. I am pleased to respond to some of the claims being made by members of the opposition.It is remarkable how short their memories are. I can recall that in response to an Industry Commission report in 1992 the opposition, which were then in government, introduced a bill into this House which was going to abolish the book bounty. It was only the serious and strong representations and amendments moved by the member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), who was at the time the coalition industry spokesman, and me that convinced the government they were heading in the wrong direction at that time.It is all very well for the member for Corio (Mr OConnor) and the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) to come into this place and attack me on my track record. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that my track record in the Maryborough area in defence of these industries has been extremely strong. After receiving representations from the Australian Print Group and McPhersons Book Printer, which are two substantial industries in that area, I have once again opened up discussions with the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), and he has given me an undertaking that he will look at the tariff on inputs.I want to refer to this aspect because it is an important part of the debate. A submission that I had from the Australian Publishers Association indicated that the abolition of the bounty would leave the book printing industry in a position of negative assistance unless the tariff on imported paper was removed in parallel. That is what I was referring to when I said I have opened up discussions with the minister, and he has indicated that he will look at a tariff on the inputs into the manufacturing process.I want to refer to the majority report of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. It recommended:. . . the Government should amend the tariff regime to address any anomalies resulting from termination of the Bounties, in particular the situation where imported inputs are dutiable but the corresponding imported final goods are duty free.The minority report agreed with this finding. I have made representations to the minister on this matter and the minister has indicated that he will look at that situation.The member for Batman, a comparative newcomer to this House, has easily forgotten the situation that was in place in 1992 after the industry committee report was brought down when his party, which were in government, were going to remove the book bounty. He has simply forgotten all about that. That is removed from his memory—very conveniently, I might add. I can assure the printing industries and also the residents and employees in the city of Maryborough that they have my support on this. In fact, they had my strong support late last year when the government decided to change the termination period of the book bounty.I recall the speech by the minister, who relied on the draft Industry Commission report on book printing in August 1996 which recommended the abolition of the bounty when the current scheme was due to expire on 31 December 1997. The budget legislation speeding up the process of the abolition of the scheme on budget night has been varied with the termination of the bounty now scheduled for 30 June 1997. I had extensive discussions with the minister at the time and I know that he took note of those and that action was taken. For the member for Batman to come in and conveniently forget all about what his party were going to do in government really leaves one in a state of amazement.It seems to be a campaign of the member for Batman to attack both me and the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson). He is vigorously going around trying to pick up anything. I want to remind him of what his party did, when in government, to the motor industry. The motor industry in Australia lost 25,000 jobs under the Labor Party government. But I want to strictly stick to the area of the book bounties, because it is extremely important for my area. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I am very keenly aware of it and have been since the build&hyphen;up of the book industry in the Maryborough area.I might add that my term in state politics probably led to the most major change in industrial expansion in the city of Maryborough that ever occurred. I was able to convince the Hon. Dick Hamer, the then Premier, that Maryborough needed natural gas. During my time as a state member there, the whole city of Maryborough was reticulated with natural gas, and that led to the expansion of industry and employment opportunities in the Maryborough area. There was a substantial growth in industry during that period.In fact, both of the firms I have mentioned—Australian Print Group and McPhersons Book Printers—have expanded as a result of the availability of natural gas and all the other infrastructure support that is available in the city of Maryborough. They have also been able to attract Nestle, the big sweets and confectionary manufacturer, as a result of natural gas being reticulated through that whole district.I take you back once again to the comments by the member for Batman in this debate and his allegation that I was not supporting the city of Maryborough. I certainly am. In fact, the member for Barker and I, during the debate following the IC report in 1992, played a major role in overturning the ALPs direction of removing all of these bounties. I find it quite staggering that members from the Labor Party have now conveniently forgotten all about that.The member for Batman also made a number of other allegations about me. One of them was that:There was a commitment to the city of Bendigo prior to the last election which meant a further investment in the form of construction of a new art gallery with additional jobs of benefit to the local community.I want to make one comment on that, Mr Deputy Speaker. The person who made that commitment of $2 million was none other than the Prime Minister at the time, Mr Paul Keating. He did not deliver on the promise, nor did he put it into the budget estimates. It is very convenient for the member for Batman to be selective about his quotes. He is saying that I, as the member for Bendigo, have gone missing on the question of future book bounties and support for key jobs in the town of Maryborough and his electorate. I can assure you that that is not so. I have been very active on this issue. I have received representations from the Australian Publishers Association. I have made representations to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism and the minister has agreed to look at the situation of tariffs on any inputs into the book printing industry. I thank the House for the opportunity to respond to those scurrilous allegations.","N/A","BOUNTY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
51,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr HOLDING","CH4","(Melbourne Ports)","ALP","N/A",1986,"—I want to approach the issue before the House in a somewhat different way from those of my colleagues, because I think the arguments have gone back and forth. I want to start on the basis that I think there would be a general consensus in this parliament, on all sides, that the biggest single problem facing our community is the problem of unemployment and how we solve it. I do not think we solve it by having a work for the dole scheme, whatever merits or demerits that may have, but we can advance the situation by having a coherent, well thought through policy on industrial development. That means that we look to the development of our manufacturing industry.It is the role of government to consider how it can enhance the existing structures, how it can develop policy which enables the environment in which we live to advance industries in any particular area. It does not really help the argument to get into the sort of exchange, which tends to happen often in this House, where one member says, `Look what you did. Were going to do the same thing, but we hope we will be able to solve the problem.If one looks for the reasons for this proposal and where it emanated from, it obviously did not emanate from the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) and I do not think it emanated from any of the policy considerations or discussions that took place in the government party meeting. I suspect that where it emanated from was precisely where it emanated from when we were in office—out of Treasury. Part of the problem that the Labor government faced, and I think this government faces, is that Treasury has produced, over a period of time, a group of advisers and senior officers who are committed to the concepts of economic rationalism. The problem with this government is that they, equally, adopt the same ideology. This is the most ideologically driven government that I have seen in all my time in two parliaments.I have some sympathy for the honourable member for Bendigo because the best that he can do is line up with his party to vote for this legislation which will create a problem for an industry in an area that is important to him. The best he can then do is say, `Im having discussions with the minister to see whether we can use another device to limit the damage to these industries.Frankly, with all respect to the honourable member, I do not think that is good enough because the government is facing the same sort of dilemma that people on this side of the House faced when we were in government when in fact a Treasury driven economic imperative does not reach out and look at the problems that confront people in manufacturing industry. If we want to increase employment in this country, if we want to get rid of the spectre of unemployment, then we have to have a coherent economic policy which is directed towards strengthening our manufacturing bases and improving them.I take just one area of Australia which is particularly relevant to my own electorate: the development of the shipbuilding industry in Australia is no accident. The contract to build the frigates went to a set of consortiums operating out of Melbourne. Adelaide has produced the technology and the capacity to build the submarine. Cairns is producing the hydrographic ship, and catamarans are produced in Tasmania.","N/A","BOUNTY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

53,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr HOLDING","CH4","(Melbourne Ports)","ALP","N/A",1986,"—Western Australia. That was not an accident. It was based on the capacity of those who had the responsibility for running quite large enterprises and their initiatives. But there was government backup and a considered policy. Where is the considered policy here? Where is the considered policy that emerges from Treasury? It says, `Weve been looking at the budget in global. Let us adopt a policy of reducing bounty exports.Has there been any thought emanating as to the impact that that is going to have—not merely upon an emerging and well&hyphen;based manufacturing industry? I am not just talking about ships; I am talking also about the printing industry. Has there been any discussion about the ramifications before the government puts this policy in place? What will it mean in terms of jobs in this industry throughout Australia?Who is in a position to advise the government? The people who are in the best position to advise the government are the people in the industry. What do they say? They say that it will lead to further unemployment and a reduced level of manufacturing capacity. Ultimately, it means that Australian industries in this area, in a competitive world, are competing against other nations which have developed skills in these areas over the years and have provided considerable bounties, not merely to attain a technological level of expertise but because they see it is critical to the development of those industries and to their economic base.What is happening in this country is that, although we are agreed as individuals in this parliament that the greatest social problem facing this community is the problem of unemployment, we adopt a policy which every member in his heart knows will reduce employment in a key sector of industry. We are going to lend ourselves to the export of jobs to overseas competitors which are maintaining bounties. Does that make economic sense? I suppose it could be argued by the economic rationalists, `Well, at the end of the day, itll all be all right. But they are all right.The people who give this advice to Treasurers—irrespective of governments, because governments in our democratic system come and go—on the basis of their economic theories have never had the responsibility of running a manufacturing industry, never had the problem that confronts people who are operating those industries in Maryborough in my electorate and in electorates all around Australia and never had the difficulty that confronts this parliament as we have a Treasurer (Mr Costello) who shares their economic philosophy.It is an economic philosophy which, in Great Britain, has divided their society, has produced a permanent underclass and produced levels of unemployment and levels of poverty. The government of Great Britain is now facing a massive defeat in the election because the people of Britain will vote against this very system.Do we have to get to a stage in Australia where these sorts of lunatic policies are going to produce that level of social disharmony, that level of social misery, and where an esteemed colleague says, `Look, Ive got to put my hands up for this, but Im having a bit of a talk to the minister and he will have a look at it? Does this colleague think, deep in his heart, that when the minister has a look at it he is going to be able to withstand the pressure of those people who are driving these policies in Treasury? I wish him good luck.What this House needs from this government, if it is to keep faith with the electorate in terms of its electoral promises, is an ongoing and considered, well thought through policy for the manufacturing industries and other areas of economic activity in Australia which are designed to increase unemployment.I believe that there is nobody in this House who believes that, if this legislation goes through in this form, there will not be people losing their jobs, there will not be increasing levels of unemployment—unless the government can find some other way of dealing with it. It seems to me that it is a bit like closing the stable door after the horse has bolted.The Labor government made mistakes in these areas. If we have not learned from the mistakes that we made in the footwear, textile and clothing industries in Australia, we have not learned anything. This government is heading down the same course and it will get the same result. This is ill considered, ill thought out Treasury driven legislation. Isnt a coherent, long-term concept of where we are taking our manufacturing industry and of how we can enhance employment opportunities not only the moral imperative of the government but also the economic imperative?I know that the Treasurer is getting some fairly colourful abuse from an organisation which he founded—the H.R. Nicholls Society. It is all right for the Hugh Morgans of the world—born with a silver spoon in his mouth, never had to face the prospect of unemployment and ushered into daddys position as head of a major corporation. I do not say that in any sense of personal antagonism: he was very fortunate. But there are lots of people in this society who are not so fortunate. There are lots of kids in my electorate whose father is unemployed or their mother cannot get work and who are forced to live on the dole and suffer all the social consequences that that brings with it—the social tensions and the dysfunctional relationships.I will be voting against this legislation not simply because of my partys position but because it not only involves a serious breach of an electoral promise but more importantly is evidence of the fact that we have not learned from past mistakes. There is nothing wrong with the government saying, `Labor has made these mistakes in one industry and we are not going to make it in another. No government ever gets it 100 per cent right.It is time, given the commitment of this House and the commitment of individual parliamentarians, to deal at a serious level with solving the problems of unemployment in Australia. It is time to look seriously at what is occurring in the many areas of manufacturing which are the core base for future employment and the maintenance of existing employment before we go down the path of saying, `We are really very good because we are going to adopt the doctrine of economic rationalism and the whole world is our marketplace, when other competitors throughout the world, including the United States and many European nations, are not going down the same track.It is a lonely place to be when you confront decent, hardworking Australians working in these industries and have to say, `Oh well, bad luck, although we know that you are likely to lose your job, hopefully we will be talking to another minister and it will not be quite so bad. That is not an answer.If we are serious about unemployment, and if the government is serious—and I believe most of its members are—about unemployment, we would be adopting policies which strengthen our manufacturing base throughout this nation and we would not get ourselves into the position which has happened so often where, because of some current economic policy, we finish up exporting jobs. The government ought to have a second look at this legislation. If it has any commitment to its objective of increasing employment, it ought to withdraw it.","N/A","BOUNTY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[4]/break/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
54,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr McCLELLAND","JK6","(Barton)","ALP","N/A",1989,"—On several occasions in recent weeks the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has taken it upon himself to brand us on this side of the House as the forelock tugging Labor. One can debate whether that is appropriate parliamentary language or not. In any event, it has come from the mouth of the Prime Minister, so it is there. I suppose that expression necessarily implies that we have forelocks. That is more than I can say for the government on this issue. They are completely lacking in the necessary anatomy to take up the issues on behalf of Australian industry. They are literally completely neutered when it comes to industry policy.As the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) has just said, they are obsessed with the so-called free market—they almost hold it up as a religious icon. Their one and only philosophy is that, if you get the broad macro&hyphen;economic settings right, this divine intervention of the free market is going to come and fix every thing up, as if the free market can bestow miracles.Unfortunately, it will not happen, it does not happen like that and it is not happening like that in the rest of the world. While ever our government has this view, we are letting our side down and we are very much letting our industry down. As the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) in his speech on this matter said, this legislation will mean a fall in exports, a fall in jobs, a rise in the balance of payments deficit and a rise in the budget deficit.The situation is particularly severe in Western Australia and Tasmania, but in effect it affects all Australians because of the much broader implications across all the industries affected—the publishing industry, the computer industry, the tool and robotics industries as well as the shipbuilding industries.Dealing first with the shipbuilding industry, it was reported this week that Austal in Western Australia will dismiss 20 employees next week directly as a result of the governments decision. So, like the Red Baron chocking up kills on the side of his plane, the government can clock up 20 there immediately. Austal has indicated that 100 more employees will go in the next few weeks directly as a result of the governments decision. Wavemaster in Western Australia has also indicated that 100 employees will go in the next few weeks.The facts of the matter are that our European competitors are providing assistance at somewhere between nine and 25 per cent, and current measures through the OECD to remove or reduce the assistance provided to shipbuilding in those countries are being blocked—substantially as a result of United States pressure. But, whatever the reason, the European competitors are going to be put in the box seat for at least another 18 months and more likely for two years. The question becomes whether our industry can survive. Unfortunately, the feedback is that it probably cannot survive by staying in Australia. The government is being reckless in the extreme and irresponsible.It is not as if the shipbuilding industry has got flabby and inefficient under the assistance of the bounty scheme—quite the contrary. Since 1990, its production has increased by 40 per cent. It is now earning well over $500 million a year, and it is confidently predicted that it will be an industry earning in excess of $1 billion per annum by the year 2000. Almost all of that is in exports. Almost all of that is coming off our balance of payments deficit.But, rather than me condemning the government in a partisan sense, as one speaker before me said, they really should look at industry experts. In the Financial Review of 24 January, Mr Clifford—one of those involved in the shipbuilding industry—was quoted as saying:Our industry cannot survive against European competition unless we get some support.In the Australian of 29 November 1996, a Liberal colleague, Mr Court, the Premier of Western Australia was quoted as saying:. . . removal of the 5 per cent bounty would do severe damage to the `incredibly successful shipbuilding industry.It is noted in that article that several shipbuilders have already warned that they would be forced to move offshore in order to survive. That certainly has to be an inevitability.It is worth having regard to the comments of an academic—Dr Mark Beeson, research fellow at the Murdoch University Asia Research Centre—because they are an objective analysis in a non&hyphen;political setting. In an article in the Australian of 20 December 1996, he said:It might be expected that an industry that looked like generating $1 billion in export sales by the end of the century, and which already directly provides nearly 3000 highly paid manufacturing jobs, might be the subject of a good deal of attention and assistance.Not so—he points out—The light weight aluminium&hyphen;based fast ferry industry that has produced this remarkable export and job creation performance is to be left to its own devices.As he points out—and consistent with what the member for Melbourne Ports said—these industries did not just happen because of some process of divine intervention or spontaneous production. There was a lot of planning and a lot of strategy that went in—assisted, in many instances, by a partnership between government and industry. As Dr Mark Beeson said:. . . successful industries dont just happen. Without a supportive policy environment that encourages particular forms of strategically important activity, the danger is that such industries may happen somewhere else.That is not only a danger but an actuality. Our competitors realise that. They are well and truly backing their own industries, and they are getting manufacturing jobs. We are letting ours wither on the vine. Indeed, this is worse than allowing them to wither on the vine; it is direct sabotage and vandalism of very successful, highly sophisticated industries conveying very sophisticated skills on to our work force—the flow&hyphen;on in technologies spreads right throughout industry. To risk losing that, as this government is doing, is nothing short of an outrage.In terms of the governments actions, it is all very well for us in a partisan sense to say, `They do not understand what they are doing, but that has also been said by Mr Robert Clifford from Incat in Tasmania. In the Sydney Morning Herald of 22 August 1996, he was quoted as saying:I dont believe the Liberal government understands the economics of the industry. They just dont understand the importance of the bounty to us.That has got to be the case. For them to act as though they have, they simply have not done the necessary research; they have acted from a blinkered state. Anyone who cannot see more than one perspective of mind has to be regarded as mentally retarded in that sense. This governments obsessive adherence to this demigod or religious icon—the market force—has, literally, mentally retarded them so they cannot receive the views of industry. Regrettably, we have a government which is mentally retarded because of its ideological straitjacket and our industry is suffering.The member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) referred yesterday to an article in the Financial Review which reported comments by the ASA chairman, Mr John Rothwell. He pointed out to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) that the governments display of beneficence—the extension of the bounty by six months to the end of the year in response to not only Labor pressure but, it has got to be said, pressure from Senator Harradine—is meaningless. As Mr Rothwell says:Minister, it takes 12 months to build a vessel of the car ferry size, which are the majority of exported ferries from Australia.What this means is that presently no shipbuilder can enter into a contract to build a ship with the aid of the bounty, as it will not be possible to complete the ship by the end of this calendar year.I recall the member for Fremantle described how two contracts had been lost because the industry in her state cannot forward plan its contracts because of the removal of the bounty and the time it is going to take to construct the vessels. That is short&hyphen;sightedness, ignorance and incompetence.Speakers before me in the debate have pointed out that it is poor government in terms of creativity. The member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) said it is an obsession with short&hyphen;term debt cutting at the expense of long&hyphen;term investment. Not only that, they are removing revenue which far exceeds the amount they are paying out in terms of the bounty. That is shown very much in research provided by the Australian Publishers Association with respect to the book bounty. Similar facts exist with respect to the ship bounty where we have received from PAYE tax revenue and payroll tax revenue in the order of $62 million from the ship bounty at a cost of $24 million. So we are well and truly ahead.With respect to the book bounty, the Australian Publishers Association has quantified the decline in PAYE taxation revenue at $9,634,000, a decline in payroll tax revenue at $2,733,000 and increases in unemployment benefits of over $21 million, at a total cost to the government in excess of $33 million, far exceeding the amount the government pays by way of this bounty. The removal of the books bounty six months ahead of time is going to mean the loss of some 1,500 jobs. That is unquestioned. With respect to the seat of Bendigo, Prentice&hyphen;Hall has for the first time in nine years published a textbook offshore. That is the start of things to come. They were previously doing all that publication in Aus tralia—and a very respected publisher it has become.In terms of the effect on the balance of trade that the loss of the book bounty is going to have, Merino publishers in Brisbane is another example. Merino publishers has obtained contracts to provide to Californian schools all Latino&hyphen;American textbooks, there being a very big Latino population in California. That state has a population of some 28 million, almost one and a half times that of Australia. The loss of that export opportunity is obvious.In addition, our book bounty has enabled us to be import replacing. Imported books have gone down since 1991 from $400 million to $300 million—and that trend is continuing. As I have pointed out, in terms of the budget deficit we stand to lose more than we will save. Again, there is an obsession with this free market concept. That just is not going to happen. In the case of the book bounty we were actually winning the war against international competition as the Australian Financial Review pointed out on 28 February:The value of Australian book printing in 1995&hyphen;96 was $270 million, compared with $180 million in South&hyphen;East Asia.There are very few industries where we are succeeding over our competitors: publishing has been one of them. Again, to cut the bounty off at this time is reckless in the extreme.In terms of the computer bounty, it is already having an effect. The company Netcomm, which is almost a household name—I know on my kids computer we have a Netcomm modem—is ceasing its production of modems in Australia. That, in this day and age when so many people are connecting to the Internet, is a real tragedy. There is no other description for it. In terms of the computer industry it must be said that trade barriers are coming down, at least in the Asian region. But as a former Labor minister said in November 1995:The computer bounty plays an important role in facilitating investment and value added production in Australia, including the manufacture of essential hardware fundamental to the information age and it is clear that a healthy and broad based hardware manufacturing capability underpins innovative software and services development.There is a rapid trade growing in software and services development and the Asian market, as its economies are improving, presents real opportunities for Australia. The government is turning its back on that opportunity and, again, vandalising another section of Australian industry.In terms of the machine industry—tools and robotics—again the government is short&hyphen;sighted in the extreme. Obviously, if we are going to compete with our Asian competitors, we must do so from the point of view of not technological comparisons but technological superiority. Unless we have that, we will be forced to compete on the lower wages regime. If we want to maintain our standard of living and preserve our wage rates, the only way we can do so is by having the technological sophistication.This move to take away the bounty from the development of our tools and robotics industry is short&hyphen;sighted. Before it was elected, the government promised to create 250,000 jobs in manufacturing. You cannot do that unless you build factories; you cannot build factories unless you equip them with tools and technology. Tooling is therefore essential if we want to develop sophisticated tools to equip our factories and if we want to develop the sophisticated robotics technology such as has been at the heart of progress in our car industry. As much as possible we want to tool our factories with these sophisticated pieces of machinery. Unless we do so, it will mean either that our factories do not have those tools or this technology or that they import it from overseas. Again this will have a dramatic effect on our balance of payments.This government has not appreciated that it is all very well being symbolic. It is all very well to tell mainstream Australians who are sitting `comfortably and relaxed in their living rooms that you are looking after their interests, but if you are not in fact looking after their interests one thing is for sure: it will not be too long before Australians see through the bulldust. They do not want to be patronised; they want to see results, they want to see runs on the board. They want to see our manufacturing industries not only matching but beating our competitors. They want to see jobs, and they want to see jobs in sophisticated manufacturing industries. They want the government to have a decent and sustained revenue base from ongoing taxation receipts, not an ongoing liability to pay unemployment benefits.As I have said, this government is short&hyphen;sighted. They are mentally retarded because of their own ideology. They are completely lacking in any courage. Indeed, they stand to be condemned for what they are doing to the Australian economy.

55,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr WILTON","YK6","(Isaacs)","ALP","N/A",1992,"—Like the member for Barton (Mr McClelland), I am somewhat saddened to rise to speak against the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill, as it serves as yet another stark and harsh example of one of the many popular and highly successful programs that the previous Labor government established to support Australias small and medium size businesses which this government is best perhaps described as foolishly dismantling. It also serves as another stark example of the Howard governments duplicitous and misguided treatment of Australias small business sector.The Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) in his second reading speech made quite clear the driving force behind this bill. In the first lines of his speech he stated:This bill amends four bounty acts to achieve savings announced by the government in the 1996&hyphen;97 budget.A little further on in that same speech he said:The government has decided to terminate the schemes ahead of their scheduled dates . . . because of the overriding objective to eliminate the budget deficit.I am sure that government members, along with Treasury officials, have a well&hyphen;known dislike of schemes such as industry bounties which do not accord or fit neatly with their dry economic rationalist view of leaving the market to its own devices and hang the consequences. This bill is clearly not being driven by any real desire of the government or the minister to establish, as the member for Barton quite rightly contended, viable and long&hyphen;term growth in Australian industry.We are not dealing with this bill because the government in any sense of the word believes that it is part of a broader strategy which may build upon the effective reforms already well under way and entrenched by the former Labor government. However, I do believe that the bill that we are debating here today and the underlying issues involved do indeed go to the heart of the difference between the Labor opposition and the coalition government in both their philosophy and approach to economic policy, and specifically to industry policy.This bill terminates the books bounty, the ships bounty and the machine tools and robots bounty with effect from 20 August last year and, as we have heard other speakers submit, it terminates the computer bounty with effect from 1 July 1997.Those of us on this side of the House will be opposing this bill on a number of grounds, including its deleterious effects on specific regions of Australia which have become home to these particular industries, the fact that this bill represents yet another broken promise by the government and because, last but not least, it is simply poor policy enacted in the shabbiest and most duplicitous of ways.I will go to some detail in regard to each of these bounties. Turning to the books bounty, Australias printing and publishing companies and their workers have made significant gains in productivity reform and improvements in competitiveness throughout the course of the last decade. It is unfair and, indeed, unjust to attack in this way an industry that is making such profound progress halfway through its restructuring program merely to satisfy the governments short&hyphen;term desire to balance the books. As the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) contended, this simply involves a short&hyphen;term desire to cut debt at the expense of long&hyphen;term investment. Indeed, our industries need some measure of certainty. This is an underpinning requirement for confidence before long&hyphen;term investment can be generated.In the case of the books bounty, printing and publishing firms have been operating for some time now on the clear and unequivocal understanding that the measure would be in place at least until the end of 1997. But the governments decision to prematurely end the bounty as of budget day last year makes it very difficult, and perhaps even impossible, for some firms in this industry to make long&hyphen;term investment decisions with any degree of confidence whatsoever.Even the Industry Commission, in its August draft report on the printing industry, recommended that the bounty be allowed to run through to 1997. Of course, the books bounty has had a significant impact on the international competitiveness of both the printing and publishing industries. The export of books, for example, has increased by some 200 per cent over the past 12 years. At a time when the government and economic analysts are calling for measures to deal with the level of Australias foreign debt, the decimation of the book industry will have a disastrous effect on Australias current account.According to the Printing Industries Association trade consultant, Mr Ronald Fisher, surveys by the Printing Industries Association indicate that up to 50 per cent of book production in Australia would be lost to overseas printers with the termination of this bounty. This would see a loss of book exports up to a value of $40 million to $50 million per annum and an increase in imports of up to $80 million per annum, an adverse impact on Australias balance of payments to the tune of some $120 million.The ending of the bounty will cut short this growth and significantly reduce employment in the industry. Of course, in the printing industry, job losses of up to 1,500 have been predicted, with a particularly severe impact upon regional centres such as Maryborough in Victoria, notwithstanding the best efforts of the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid). He has, I am sure, spoken long and hard in defence of industries within his own electorate, but that certainly has not been enough to stop companies like Prentice&hyphen;Hall publishing a book offshore for the first time. The numbers of those in general working in the book and related industries will be cut by almost one-third.I turn briefly to the issue of the ships bounty. We have seen over the last decade the growth of what might best be described as an innovative and export oriented Australian industry in the construction of fast ships and ferries. With the assistance of the ships bounty, companies like Austal Ships in Fremantle and Incat in Launceston have grown from nothing to become major exporters in both the European and Asian markets.The member for Barton in his submission to the House quoted the manager of Incat in Launceston as saying that the government does not know what it is doing in this regard. Maybe he would have a better idea of what the government should be doing had any representative from the government taken the opportunity to visit him during the Liberal Partys national conference in Hobart in the latter half of last year.The abolition of the bounty in this bill will mean that this industry, which has so much potential, will not be able to compete with our international competitors who have subsidies of anywhere between nine per cent and 50 per cent. The Premier of Western Australia, Mr Court, in his letter to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) urging him to reconsider his decision in regard to this particular bounty put the case very clearly and, I believe, very cogently. Mr Court states in his letter:It is inconceivable that this huge export dollar earning industry can successfully survive when competing against subsidies such as those of Norway at 13.2%; Denmark between 8% and 13% and Italy between 15% and 50%.Mr Court goes on to say:Of great importance is the fact that the shipbuilding industry is not promoting hand outs. It can successfully compete in the international market on quality and expertise, but not if it is disadvantaged to the tune of 9% of the contract price. It is only asking that the present rate of 5% be retained until other OECD countries eliminate their subsidies.Prime Minister, I urge you to reverse your governments decision to terminate this five per cent bounty until all other worldwide bounties are removed. It would be a tragedy to destroy what might best be described as the star of Australian manufacturing industries when a small amount of subsidies will ulti mately be an extremely good investment for Australia in the long haul.As Mr Court also attested in his letter, the beneficial impact of the ships bounty is clearly significant. Since the bountys inception, production in the industry has grown by some 200 per cent, exports have grown by 150 per cent and employment levels have grown by 50 per cent.I am sure Mr Court would share similar concerns about the computer bounty, given that there is the genesis of an effective and efficient west coast based computer industry being generated in the Perth area. It was the Labor government who, in 1995, had legislated to extend the operation of this computer bounty right through until the end of the year 2000.During the election campaign, the coalition had matched this commitment. However, in the budget, adding to its ever growing list of broken promises, the government has abolished the bounty from 1 July 1997. Having recently taken part in the debate on the child care amendment legislation, where once again the opposition is in the unusual position of trying to keep one of the governments election promises not to means test child-care benefits, I am not greatly surprised to find another situation where the government is trying to worm its way out of one of its election promises.The Industry Commission, in its 1995 report on the computer hardware and software industry, found that firms used bounty moneys effectively, that in the absence of the bounty they may invest less or undertake less R&D and that, for some firms, investment, R&D, exporting and employment would cease without bounty assistance. Although the IC report recommended that the bounty should lapse, this was predicated on the continuation of schemes like the 150 per cent R&D tax concession, the export market development grants scheme and the AusIndustry initiatives, all of which have been cut and slashed by this government.The bounty has been one of a number of measures which have assisted the growth of Australian information industries. Along with partnerships for the development program, the computer bounty has seen information industry exports treble in the last five years.Mr Peter Upton, the Executive Director of the Australian Information Industry Association, described the governments decision to hasten the phasing out of the computer bounty as having `knocked one leg from under the chair of the information technology industry. I am sure that Mr Upton would have similar sentiments had he been actively involved in the machine tools and robots industry because since the mid&hyphen;1980s that industry has not become internationally competitive. It has shown an encouraging increase in both production and exports.For example, in the last three years, Australian production of bountiable machine tools has increased from around $95 million to $144 million when exports have doubled over the same period. The Industry Commission, in its draft report on the machine tools and robots industry, recently recommended that the bounty be retained until its legislated expiry date of 30 June 1997. In scrapping the bounty in the budget, the government has once again shown that it is happy to commission reports and then equally content simply to ignore them.I would like to turn briefly to some comments I made earlier when I spoke of the fundamentally defining nature of this bill and the broader issue of industry policy. The member for Hotham (Mr Crean) has moved the following amendment to this bill:. . . the House(1) rejects outright the Governments failure to develop and implement a policy for Australian manufacturing industry, and is of the view that because of the inevitable impact this bill will have on employment the bill would be more appropriately referred to as the Bounty Legislation (Export of Australian Jobs) Amendment Bill; . . .The former Labor government had a proud record of working hand in hand with industry because we both believed and accepted that there was a strategic role for government to play in working with the private sector to develop our industry potential for the benefit of us all. That role is not about picking winners. It is not a heavy-handed approach. We believed then, and still believe now, that the government has a pivotal role to play in ensuring that the best economic conditions exist in which our businesses can flourish through building a strong and enduring base from which they can branch out into export markets.The MTIA has stated the need for the government to produce an environment for business in Australia which includes a culture which values innovation and success in the global marketplace. Whether through providing high quality infrastructure in transport and communication, through establishing an industrial relations system which encourages both harmony and productivity rather than conflict and division or through simply recognising that the Australian firms have a competitive advantage over their international rivals through their access to and use of technology and innovation, government has an obligation to ensure that the conditions that are necessary for a healthy and growing economy are set in place. This is central to the beliefs of those of us in the Labor Party. That is why we are here in this nations parliament.Of course, the Liberal Party and those opposite have a diametrically opposed view to the one I have just espoused. The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, who is in the chamber this afternoon, knows perfectly well what is at the heart of this bill because in his own words he said `these measures will help the government to meet the challenge of reducing the budget deficit. That is what is driving this decision, nothing more and nothing less—and that is the basis for the coalitions approach to industry policy. It is the primacy of the fiscal bottom line.The governments economic policy and philosophy goes no further than the simple and discredited view that the only role for government in the economy is to get out of it, to leave it alone, to let the market prevail. It believes in cutting spending to the bare minimum, privatising everything and leaving the market to fend for itself. This view is not shared by industry. We have ample evidence of this in their responses to each of the governments proposed changes to measures which support industry.The previous Labor government had a fine record in the development and implementation of sector specific industry policy, and the current government and Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism could learn much from this example. It was the approach through the Button car plan and other similar sectoral industry plans which saw that Labor government achieve real results in reforming and modernising Australias industry, yet by contrast the coalitions approach is piecemeal and antagonistic.I fear that there is no ample evidence to suggest that the government has no interest in a cooperative and strategic approach to industry policy, as it has shown through the crass nature of the measures contained in this bill. The evidence suggests that the government simply has no interest in industry policy or in Australian industry at all. Industry in this country is calling out for a statement of vision. It has not been forthcoming, and it has not been forthcoming because this coalition government has an obsession with short&hyphen;term debt cost cutting at the expense of long-term investment.

58,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr MOORE","EI4","(Ryan—","LP","Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism)",1996,"—Your presence makes my day. We have heard a considerable amount in this debate about how essential these various bounties are to the survival of the firms and sectors that use them. The government has, on a number of occasions, acknowledged the role bounty assistance has played in the development of shipbuilding, books, computer manufacturing and machine tools and robot industries. The fact remains that the actual rates of assistance have fallen significantly over recent years as a result of policies implemented by the previous Labor government. For example, book bounties have fallen from 30 per cent in 1983 to 4.5 per cent from 1 January 1997. The machine tools and robots bounty has fallen from 40 per cent in 1988 to five per cent on 1 July 1996.The industries that utilise the four bounties covered by this bill have been able to adjust. This has been acknowledged by the member for Hotham and by a number of independent reviews. The Industry Commission book bounty review noted, for example, that production of bountiable books had increased over 50 per cent in real terms since 1992 and at a time when the bounty rate was falling. The various reviews of bounties have also found the assistance measures have effectively run their course and should not be extended.Nevertheless, the government has recognised that circumstances do exist which warrant some alteration to the provisions of the existing bill to put in more generous transitional arrangements. For this reason, I will be moving in the consideration in detail stage several amendments to the bill which extend the termination dates for the shipbuilding and book bounties.In conclusion, the government believes that the future of different industry sectors does not lie in debate about the possible long-term retention of low level bounty assistance. Rather the priority is to put in place a more comprehensive framework or strategy for industry that reflects the need to establish an appropriate environment for investment, access to overseas markets and effective business assistance programs.Question put:That the words proposed to be omitted ( Mr Creans amendment) stand part of the question.The bells having been rung—","N/A","BOUNTY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[7]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

67,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr CREAN","DT4","(Hotham)","ALP","N/A",1998,"—The opposition supports the first of these amendments, the amendment before the House at the moment, which in effect deletes the subsection of the Bounty (Books) Act which wound up the books bounty on budget night. We support totally the deletion of this provision from the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill. The effect of its deletion will be to restore the books bounty in its entirety. That is the position that we want supported in this House.However, I would remind the House that the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) has a further amendment which will restore the books bounty period until 30 June 1997—six months short of the original position. The original position was that the books bounty would remain until 31 December 1997. The first amendment that the government has brought forward is a backdown, but it is only a partial backdown. As a result of the campaign that we in opposition ran in the regions—we convinced those in the communities to pursue the campaign—we have seen a partial backdown, but the partial backdown does not go far enough.No-one can deny the significant impact that the books bounty has had on the growth of the industry. The industry has increased its book exports by 200 per cent over the past 12 years. These are not assistance measures to protect industries, they are measures that level the playing field. The countries with whom our book publishers must compete all have these bounties and other arrangements in place. The level playing field does not exist.The reason these bounties were inserted by the Labor government was to enable these industries, which should be world competitive, to compete in the marketplace, but they cannot do so because other countries have got measures in place that support their industries.The purpose of the books bounty was to get our book publishers into the game. It is true that under Labor the books bounty would run out by the end of this year but we had undertaken to conduct an inquiry into what should occur post 31 December 1997. We would have required the Productivity Commission to have regard to two important things in its deliberations: first, the pace of change of our trading partners; and, second, the impact of the decision on regions and their jobs.We sought to get the government to accept these amendments when they introduced the Productivity Commission legislation in the last sitting fortnight, but they opposed them. They have no commitment to understanding what our trading partners are doing. They are expecting our participants in industry to unilaterally disarm and expose themselves to the rest of the world without any support, without any assistance, and to flourish in that environment. It does not happen.We are saying, Minister, that you should not only put this amendment forward but also desist from the further amendments you will be moving. The first amendment will reinstate the books bounty and will enable the inquiry to proceed to decide where we go after 31 December this year, but your next amendment will curtail that. It will end the bounty six months down the track. We have had a partial victory but we want a total victory. We will be persisting with that view in this House.","N/A","BOUNTY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
68,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr MARTIN FERGUSON","LS4","(Batman)","ALP","N/A",1998,"—I am pleased to be associated with this amendment to the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill. It is clear from the lack of attendance today and the lack of support for the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) that he is pursuing an amendment to what is, on balance, a fairly successful scheme. He is not supported today because the members of his backbench, especially those in regional Australia, know that they are the real losers.What are the real savings? We are talking about savings in the order of $4 million. That is not big bickies according to the current members of the government. Until they were forced to back down because of the results of the polling conducted by Andrew Robb, they were prepared to move the Speakers chair at a cost of $500,000. That $4 million is not big bickies in the mind of the minister for industry—after all, in terms of his lifestyle, it is not even worth a big drink. That is what he is on the record as being concerned about.It goes to a question of the impact of these proposed changes on regional Australia. Yesterday afternoon, in the debate concerning this all&hyphen;important bill, I raised the question of the impact on regional Australia. It goes to a question of a fairly fundamental issue—jobs.I find it strange that the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), for example, is not here this afternoon speaking in support of the amendment moved by the shadow spokesperson for industry. If anyone ought to be on his feet at the moment, rather than cowering in the corridors of Parliament House, it is the member for Bendigo. He ought to be in here this afternoon standing up for the town of Maryborough.In case the member for Bendigo does not know, Maryborough is in his electorate—it is not in Queensland, it is actually near the town of Bendigo. Twenty&hyphen;five per cent of the work force in Maryborough depends on the book industry through two key employers. Worse still, it is an area of high unemployment.It is an area that demands government assistance. It is an area that is prepared to stand on its own two feet, provided the government has a well thought out industry policy which creates opportunities for that town. Twenty&hyphen;five per cent of that town—which covers quite a considerable number of families—depends on the bounty system.As I said, the people of that town are prepared to stand up and be counted. They are prepared to deliver. All they are asking for is a helping hand in accordance with the original proposal with respect to this bill. Instead, they will suffer as a result of the initiatives of the minister for industry. They will suffer a full frontal attack on the welfare and livelihood of that town. One&hyphen;quarter of the local work force is dependent on this bill. Two big printing firms—the Australian Print Group and McPhersons Printing Group—are central to that local economy.That might not mean much to the minister for industry, because I dare say he has not got shares in those two companies, but it means a lot to the livelihood of that town. The government ought to embrace this amendment. It is not big bickies, it is not even a big drink in the mind of the minister for industry—it is $4 million. However, in terms of that town it is big bickies—25 per cent of the work force.I can understand why the minister for industry is feeling the pinch this afternoon. They might not be game to come here, stand up and speak about the importance of this bill, but out on the back bench they are vitally concerned. If I were the member for Bendigo I would be concerned about an unemployment rate of 10.5 per cent. I would be concerned about the potential job losses from the impact of ripping away additional assistance for a very short period in a town of high youth unemployment, a town that needs government assistance, an area that is already suffering from high unemployment, an area that is crying out for a reasonable industry policy approach.On balance, it is about time the government took up what was a fairly objective criticism by the former chief executive officer of the Metal Trades Industry Association. Everything is not a cost, it is an investment—it is about investment in industry and investment in regional Australia. Embrace the amendment, look to the future, and support regional Australia where it requires assistance.Support industries that have proven themselves capable of growing on the export front and, in so doing, create additional jobs. Do not run away from your responsibilities, face up to them. Embrace the amendment before us, support regional Australia, and vote for jobs in regional Australia.","N/A","BOUNTY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The member for Bendigo could last only 10 minutes on this debate and part of that was talking about the art gallery in Bendigo. What has that got to do with the books bounty? I suppose there will be fewer books on art in the library because they will not be published in Australia. But that was the member for Bendigos contribution.The member for Bendigo happens to have Maryborough in his electorate and he was claiming some credit for getting some gas reticulation into the city. Do you know what industry is the biggest employer of people in Maryborough? Of an employment base of 2,400 employees in Maryborough, 600 of them are employed in the book publishing industry, an industry that was not there before the books bounty commenced.

Do you know what he did after he got the representations? He went to New York for four weeks. The only thing he was doing in terms of books in New York was getting an up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date copy of the New York Review of Books . This is the member for Bendigo representing the so&hyphen;called industry in his electorate. What a pathetic effort! Where is he now? Where is he now in this debate demonstrating what he is prepared to do from here? The fact of the matter is that it was only because Labor took this issue up that we have got some progress in restitution of the bounty.If the member for Bendigo is serious about representing his constituency, he will be in here supporting our position because our position is to support full restitution of the bounty and then to have an inquiry. Let the member for Bendigo understand that he is voting against jobs in Maryborough today. He is voting against jobs in his electorate. He is betraying his electorate. He is betraying them because he is not prepared to stand up in this chamber, stand up to you, stand up to that ideologically driven front bench, and stand up to the Treasurer.Minister, we know that you want to stand up to the Treasurer (Mr Costello). You relish the fact that you can beat him in these little debates from time to time because we know you do not like Victorians. You are a Queenslander in the Liberal Party and you do not like Victorians. He does not like them. He is on record as saying he does not like the Victorians, so any time he can beat the Victorians, he loves it. Here is your chance to do the Treasurer. You get two hits at once, you get jobs in Maryborough for your friend in Bendigo and you also do your Treasurer. Why wont you stand up for Australian industry? Why wont you support jobs? Why wont the member for Bendigo come into this House and support the people of Maryborough? The fact of the matter is he is running scared. He is not prepared to stick up for the people of Maryborough and they will remember that at the time of the next election.Let me say to you, Minister, what the industry has said about your decision. McGraw-Hill, one of the largest book publishers in this country, said that there is no doubt that substantial damage has already been done since the budget announcement of 20 August. They go on to thank the Labor Party for the support they got from us in having this decision partially reversed. But what you need to do is to fully reverse it because what you have done is to cause damage which can only be repaired if you enable the industry to get back to a position in which it can have full opportunity to plan, to invest, to get the jobs back in this industry in a way that continues to trend.The real problem for you, Minister, is this. You have a target of 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing but you are introducing policies that will see jobs disappear. They have already started to disappear and they will disappear because you are dismantling programs that saw the growth of jobs in the manufacturing industry. One quarter of the work force of Maryborough is at risk here.

76,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr MARTIN FERGUSON","LS4","(Batman)","ALP","N/A",2001,"—Here is a real chance for the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) to draw the line. We read in the paper from time to time about his so&hyphen;called industry policy. We also read in the paper from time to time about his desire to stand side by side with industry to make sure that not only are they capable of growing on the export front, but also capable of increasing job opportunities in Australia.But the problem is that every time there has been a fight in cabinet to date he has thrown the towel in. He has only been forced to make some concessions as a result of a huge community campaign where the impact has been too high for the government to suffer with respect to their potential electoral prospects. That is why, for example, some changes have already occurred with the bounty legislation.I take the view that the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism is not associated, in his heart, with the anti&hyphen;jobs group that is running the cabinet at the moment. He does not want to be associated with people such as the Treasurer (Mr Costello) who have no concerns for mainstream Australia. Under it all, he accepts the need for an industry policy. That is what he keeps telling all the industry groups about. That is why he keeps giving them, under the lap, a campaign strategy to take on the Treasurer and his cohorts in cabinet, the anti&hyphen;jobs group that dominates cabinet at the moment.We are lucky. Some of the opposition have been able to get hold of that strategy about where the pressure points are and who you have to pressure to achieve a change in government policy to protect industry and to protect jobs. I am saying to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism today, `Look my friend, look my mate, we are with you, but you have to have a bit of Dutch courage.Maybe we ought to have this debate after lunch, then you can come back in here reinforced with a desire to fight on—to go for the jugular, to stand up for Australian jobs, to stand up for industry and to stand up for Maryborough because you need a helping hand. I think you want to win, but in some ways you have adopted the view, `I am in my last term of parliament. I have proven that I can be a minister again. With all due respects to the minister, it is not just about the perks and lurks of a ministerial officer; it is really about delivering out there for mainstream Australia. What they are concerned about—I am sure their polling is showing this—is a sense of security with respect to jobs and their ability to look after their families. The minister has to take a stand. He has lost all the fights to date on industry policy.What happened to the tax incentive for research and development? Lost that fight. What happened to the export market development grants scheme or the development import finance facility? Threw the towel in again. Stand up and be counted. Support our amendment on the books bounty. Do something about jobs in regional Australia. Do something about our young people. Say to the member for Bendigo, `Look, dont hide in the corner any longer. Come in here, exercise a bit of courage and put your hand up. Cross the floor and vote for your local community; cross the floor and vote for the security of the 25 per cent of jobs that exist in Maryborough; cross the floor and vote for companies which have a proven track record of being able to deliver the goods, deliver exports and deliver jobs. That is what it is about. Dont be part of the anti&hyphen;jobs group that is dominating cabinet at the moment. It is not in your heart. You know better. Embrace the amendment. Adopt a bit of Dutch courage. If you want, we will delay the debate until after lunch so that you can come in here reinforced with the desire to fight.The coalitions abolition of the books bounty six months ahead of its expiry date is wrong. It potentially means 15,000 job losses with a particularly severe impact on regional centres. In all seriousness, this is an amendment that ought to be seriously considered. The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism knows it in his own heart. Stand with us. Vote for regional Australia. Vote for jobs and vote for industry that has a future.","N/A","BOUNTY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
77,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr CREAN","DT4","(Hotham)","ALP","N/A",2002,"—We have already indicated that the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), if he has a conscience at all and if he has the interests of his constituency at heart, should be voting with us on this Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill. But there is another that should be voting with us, Minister: the member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes). The problem is that jobs have been lost in South Australia as a result of this ridiculous decision of the government to axe the books bounty. Three hundred jobs have been lost at Griffin Press as a result of the decision you took on budget night.It is not just us expressing concern about the ideological drive that is taking you forward in this way, your inability to win an argument in cabinet. You really support us. That is why you are out there having meetings with the textile industry, telling them, `I cannot win an argument in cabinet. Cabinet is full of dries. I am the only wet amongst those dries. He goes along to these meetings and says these things: `I will tell you what to do. We will get a campaign running. I will help you in this campaign because we have really got to do these fellows in Treasury. We have really got to do these ideologues, because I am on your side. But the trouble is that he cannot stand up to the people in cabinet. He cannot win an argument in cabinet so he has to resort to cloak and dagger stuff to try to get support for his positions.Three hundred jobs lost in Griffin Press in Adelaide, and what did the member for Kingston have to say about it? Very interesting if you read the Advertiser of today, which says with regard to the member for Kingston:The Member for Kingston, Ms Sue Jeanes, yesterday urged the Government to be more critical of the advice it received in preparing its second Budget.She said cuts to industry assistance in last years Budget had already hurt the State . . . and any further cuts could destroy the local economy.Economic rationalism is becoming our nations newest form of cancer, she said.. . . . . . . . .N/ABut she said the Governments focus on fixing the economy needed to be balanced by a commitment to spending money on jobs and industry—. . . governments have a very legitimate role to play in supporting industries, and we havent focused on our manufacturing sector enough.That is under todays date. That is the member for Kingston. That is another one of your backbenchers who is not in this chamber today. She is prepared to go to the press and get a headline but she is not prepared to vote for South Australia in this chamber. The member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) will not stand up for the workers in Maryborough and now the member for Kingston wants to get a story in the paper expressing concern but will not support the policies that will help the people in her state.That is why I say that they are hypocritical. They know that what the Labor party is pursuing on these issues is correct. They know that they should be supporting our amendments. They are hoping that pressure can be kept on this government to reverse its decision even further, but they have not got the courage to vote with us in this chamber. They are the people that claim that they vote for and represent constituencies but they are hidebound by the rigidity of their position and not allowed to vote as they really believe that they should.The fact of the matter is that industry policy under this government is in chaos. It is in chaos because the member is incapable of articulating a vision. In fact, listening to him on a lot of things, I think he is incapable of articulating anything. But he is certainly incapable of articulating a vision for manufacturing industry. Not only has he been condemned by every industry group in this country, but he has now got 10 of the top chief executive officers of the country condemning the lack of vision and the lack of support for industry.The fact of the matter is that this decision today that he is putting forward is another nail in the coffin for one of Australias successful manufacturing industries. It is a nail in the coffin for regional development; it is a nail in the coffin for jobs in Maryborough, in Geelong, in Adelaide—and you do not care.The problem is that you have made a commitment to getting jobs but you are introducing policies that will see them disappear. The Labor Party will oppose the amendment that you are putting forward, Minister, because it is the wrong decision. It breaks promises, it is unsoundly based and, most of all, it is anti&hyphen;regions and it is anti&hyphen;jobs. It will not support the manufacturing industry in this country which has grown so significantly because of the policies that Labor had in place. We oppose the amendments and call on those on the other side who say they share a belief in this view to join us in so opposing.

79,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr JENKINS","HH4","(Scullin)","ALP","N/A",2003,"—This is the most important part of this amendment because it reduces the period for this bounty back six months. For the paltry sum of $4 million, this government is going to place in jeopardy many jobs in the printing industry and the fact is that there has been no argument put in this debate. No argument has been put by the minister in this consideration in detail stage about any rationale for not keeping the bounty until 31 December 1997. There has been no attempt by the minister to give any full explanation of why that is so. He relies on the joint press release he made with the Treasurer (Mr Costello) but that has no explanation of why the bounty period is to be reduced by six months. Here we have an argument in this chamber over bringing the expiration of the bounty back from 31 December to 30 June 1997. As my colleagues, the members for Hotham (Mr Crean) and Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), have indicated, what the minister has to understand is the regional consequences of the decision that his government is involved in. We have acknow ledged that perhaps these are decisions that do not rest easy with him, perhaps these are decisions for which he argued a different case and lost but the simple fact is that on the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill—the original bill—the only basis for it was as part of the budgetary strategy of the government for fiscal consolidation.I see the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) in the chamber. Perhaps he has been flushed out by the efforts of the honourable members for Hotham and Batman but perhaps he will take this opportunity to tell us how he is going to defend the workers of Maryborough. It is important in this debate that a member like the member from Bendigo comes before us to defend those workers from Maryborough that are likely to lose their jobs.The thing that we wish to see is the response from the minister on this point. He sat there, babbling away, interjecting, not putting any concrete case to justify either the original decision or the ensuing backflip. Why is the six-month period so important? Obviously it is only important because of the budget bottom line and the $4 million that it is likely to save in the budget. That is just not good enough for the people of Maryborough where the printing industry employs something like 25 per cent of the townships employment force. They need answers from the government about the alternatives. What are the alternatives? Simply put, the overall macro settings that they rely upon have not eventuated into jobs. What the Australian community is looking for is Australian jobs. This is an argument about Australian jobs. What we need to see from the minister today is some indication of what it is that he is arguing in cabinet against those cabinet ministers who are from the dry faction of his party and are very much anti&hyphen;job. What the minister needs to understand is that these policy matters are complicated. In the Australian Financial Review of Friday, the Australian Publishers Association put a proposition. The Australian Publishers Associations proposition was based on the fact that the cost to the budget of the governments policy is likely to be $28.6 million over 12 months based on the lower tax revenue and the higher unemployment.Unfortunately, that associations solution is to ask that the tariff on imported paper should be removed at the same time that this bounty is decreased. Which state would be most affected if this tariff was removed? Which state would be the most affected? Tasmania. So, in juggling the regions we are going to trade one region off against another.This is the whole problem. When the Productivity Commission legislation was before us and the opposition said that the Productivity Commission should take into account the regional aspects of policy ideas, the Minister denied that that should be part of the Productivity Commissions considerations. The survival of the regions is dependent on this.

Are we going to have jobs in Maryborough, Bendigo, Ballarat, Townsville, Cairns and Dubbo, or are we going to give jobs to Indonesia and the Philippines? That is what you are voting for today. That is what you will be guilty of if you vote with the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore). What the member for Bendigo has got to think about is whether to vote for jobs for Australians or for jobs offshore.There is only one way he should vote. He should vote against the government. He should cross the floor and stand side by side with the electors of Bendigo. It is important, not just because of the jobs that are part and parcel of the town of Maryborough and the book industry, but the real problem the government has to consider is the multiplier effect that those jobs create in the local region. Jobs in those towns are more important than jobs in Indonesia or the Philippines.The book bounty has a multiplier effect in the economy in the order of 13 times the initial outlay. It is not a cost, it is an investment—13 times the return for the initial outlay. Even the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism would consider that a pretty good investment! We know he is not a bad investment manager. Maybe he ought to think about investing in these plants. I am sure that would give him a bigger return than some of the blind activities he is now conducting in the share market through some of his mates.Unemployment of the order of 10.5 per cent in Bendigo is intolerable. The member for Bendigo ought to stand up and be counted. He ought to be the voice of the town of Maryborough. He ought to be prepared to stand up and say that youth unemployment is a major problem in his electorate. He ought to be prepared to say that he is concerned about the chronic loss of jobs in his electorate. He ought to walk down View Street and say, `I am going to fight, rather than write yet another letter.I understand he has just about run out of stamps. He writes a lot of letters, but he cannot put up his hand when it comes to voting. I am prepared to vote for an additional stamp allowance so that he can write a few more letters, but on this occasion he should put his hand up and vote with his feet rather than run away from his responsibilities! It is all about voting with your feet and standing up for your electorate, not writing letters.The member for Bendigo should be voting for the art gallery in View Street, Bendigo. He should be voting for the book bounty so there are jobs in Maryborough. He should be voting to reduce unemployment, which is over 10 per cent in his electorate at the moment. He should be voting for regional Australia. He should be voting for families. He should not be running away from his responsibilities, as he has consistently done since he was elected to this parliament in 1990.","N/A","BOUNTY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
93,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr REID","VT4","(Bendigo)","LP","N/A",2006,"—I welcome the opportunity to respond to the challenge from the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson). As a member of the ACTU, the member for Batman was running away at 100 miles an hour when the Whitlam government was abolishing tariffs, and he was remarkably silent on the book bounty when the book bounty legislation came before this House in 1992. There was not one word on behalf of the workers whom he was supposed to represent. When you think back to that 1992 legislation as a result of the Industry Commission report, it was not worth one word in their defence.It is all very well for the member for Batman to raise a whole range of other issues. He raised the Bendigo art gallery. The only person who promised $2 million to the gallery was Mr Paul Keating, the Prime Minister at the time. And what did he do? Did he provide a dollar? Not one lousy dollar did the former Prime Minister provide. Nor did he put it in the budget estimates. When Mr Paul Keating made this promise, he was actually the Prime Minister and in control of the Treasury.I want to get back to the bill because the allegation from the member for Batman is that the book bounty should be retained. I put a proposition to the minister and the minister has agreed to look at it. That is more constructive than the ALP has been. The proposal I put to the minister was put to me by the Australian Publishers Association who believe that there should be a correction on the other side of the ledger that would be related to the tariff on inputs into the industry. The minister has given an undertaking that he will look at that situation and I will be anxiously looking towards what outcomes that provides.I can assure the House that this is sheer hypocrisy on the part of the Labor Party. After all of their years of cutting tariffs one after the other while supposedly looking after the employees in various industries, just remember that 25,000 jobs were lost in the motor industry during that time. And now you come out and try and make some capital out of this.The minister has taken note of the comments I have made on tariffs on inputs. I will be monitoring that situation on behalf of two very important industries in my electorate.","N/A","BOUNTY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[10]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
94,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr CREAN","DT4","(Hotham)","ALP","N/A",2006,"—The member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) writes the letters. He is the new Alastair Cooke, Letters from America— not letters from Bendigo, letters to the minister from New York. When the member for Batman was talking about View Street, he got out the old New York street directory because he had been so used to traipsing around there getting used to his new lifestyle that he had forgotten about Maryborough.Let me just come to some of the issues that the member for Bendigo has raised. He talks about the loss of memory and about the fact that I, in this House, supported a resolution to abolish the books bounty. I think that this is what he was inferring, although he never quite stated it because he did not know what he was talking about. In 1992, the Labor government did propose the abolition of the books bounty. But it did not do it and do you know why? The member for Rankin (Mr Beddall) and the member for Hotham were in there saying, `Dont do it, and it was not done. That is why the book bounty exists. I say to the member for Bendigo that if the book bounty had been abolished, why would we be up dealing with it today? The only people seeking to abolish it are the Liberals, aided and abetted by the member for Bendigo.The question of the art gallery in Bendigo is really getting under the guard of the member for Bendigo. You try to say that the former Prime Minister promised the $2 million. He did, but so did you. You went to the press and said, `We need to be able to match this promise. You promised them $2 million. Do you know what? He then got the Treasurer (Mr Costello) out, and the Treasurer said, `We are not going to give you that $2 million but we will fund a feasibility study and we will give you $100,000. This is the Alan Bond solution. This is payment of 5c in the dollar. That is your treatment of the electorate of Bendigo. That is your approach. You promised them $2 million, and you gave them $100,000. You are a disgrace. You are a disgrace to the electorate of Bendigo, because you will not stand up for them.I make this further point. You talked about what Labor did in 1975 and did under the tariff plans that Labor introduced for textiles and clothing. None of the companies that we visited the other day—Empire Rubber, Stafford Ellinson, ADA—would have been in existence had it not been for Labors automotive and textile plans. You go and talk to them. Your problem is that it is a bit expensive to make the long distance phone call from New York, and they will not pick it up, in your case. You are irrelevant because you cannot do anything for Bendigo. You cannot deliver the art gallery. You cannot deliver jobs in Maryborough. You cannot support the ongoing plans for the automotive industry.Go and talk to the component parts manufacturers. Go and talk to BTR—who run Empire Rubber, in case you did not know. Go and talk to Stafford Ellinson. Go and talk to the Australian defence establishments who have introduced state&hyphen;of&hyphen;the art clothing, who have invested in technology and in the future, and who have actually made a commitment to the region based on the certainty that our tariff plans produced. We understood the importance of reducing tariffs to make us internationally competitive but we also understood the importance of getting companies into overseas markets.In other words, our market is too small in Australia. The market that we have got to participate in is the global market, but you cannot do that by dismantling tariffs unilaterally and giving no support to get into exports. That is what our approach on industry policy is. That is what you have dismantled, and that is what the books bounty has dismantled. That is why jobs are threatened in Maryborough. That is why, unless you back our position—the majority position—in terms of cars, the jobs at Empire Rubber will be threatened; and that is why, if you go down the same crazy route in terms of textiles and clothing, Stafford Ellinson and ADA will be under threat.I ask you, as the member for Bendigo, when are you going to stand up for your constituency? Are you in retirement now? I can see you jumping to your feet. Why did you only take 10 minutes? I have still got a bit more time, and I will have some more. Why did you go to New York when this issue was on? Why did you desert the constituency, and why will you not cross the floor on this amendment? If you have got any commitment to Bendigo, you will vote with us. If you do not, you are only going to betray them.","N/A","BOUNTY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[11]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

When we went and talked to the people about the book bounty, we saw that the proposal that was before the government at the time would damage local industry.As the minister, I came back and talked to the portfolio minister, John Button, about the proposal and the bounty remained. We had effective local representation going to the minister and the minister seeing the merits of the argument. Now here we are; another minister has a proposition to knock over the book bounty. He should listen to the local people and not knock off this very important bounty.Bounties are important in the way that we build our local industries. The bookbinding industry is important in Australia, particularly to regional Australia, and I know my colleague the member for Bendigo is a very dutiful chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology and I am his deputy chair. We work closely together on these issues. As the chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, he probably has more knowledge than the minister does. What the minister should do is listen to the chairman.

105,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr JENKINS","HH4","(Scullin)","ALP","N/A",2008,"—The honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) has revealed his Reid plan for the book industry which sounds faintly familiar. It is exactly the case being put by the Australian Publishers Association I suspect. I am amused at the Australian Financial Review report of last Friday because it concludes:Government officials reacted cautiously to the submission yesterday. The coalition is considering the implications of its budget decision to abolish the book bounty without any changes to tariffs on imported paper.If that is the case, this debate gives the minister at the table the opportunity to tell the House, and to tell the industry, how long this consideration will take. But the report in the Australian Financial Review goes on further where it says:The APA—that is the Australian Publishers Association—is understood to have support from key coalition backbenchers, several of whom have big printing factories in their regional electorates.I do not know whether it is over flattering to the honourable member for Bendigo to be described as a key coalition backbencher. Perhaps he is not a key coalition backbencher and there are others within the ranks that are supporting the position, but the point is that we have the opportunity in this debate for Minister Moore to tell the House what consideration he has given to this proposition.I remind the minister that the report in the Australian Financial Review , in its brief analysis of the proposition being put by the APA, says that the basis of that submission is that the tariffs on imported paper should be removed. I remind the minister that the report goes on to say that the impact of that will be job losses in Tasmania. The overall effect of the bill that we have before us is to drive Australian jobs offshore; to drive the jobs of those in Maryborough that are working in the print industry offshore to our neighbours in the Asian region. The proposal now being put as a solution to save the jobs of those in Maryborough is to deny the jobs of those in Tasmania. Perhaps there is some forgetfulness in the people that are proposing this, like the honourable member for Bendigo, in that they need to be reminded that, whilst Tasmania might be overseas, Tasmanians jobs are Australian jobs.We have people like the honourable member for Bendigo who represents a regional centre in Victoria. We have the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) who has an interest in the important regional centre of Geelong. I hope that their submissions to government take into account the effects of the policies of this government on the regions. As the honourable member for Rankin (Mr Beddall) indicated, when the proposal was made earlier by a Labor government to remove the book bounty it was consideration of the impact on regional Australia that led to the decision not to go forward with the removal of the bounty. This government seems incapable of understanding that the directions of their policies have to take into account the impact of those policies at the regional level. If one looks at the month to month unemployment figures—and this debate is about jobs, Australian jobs, keeping them in Australia not driving them overseas—the government needs to take into account the regional impacts.We have somebody here from the National Party prattling on about opportunism. There is no opportunism in my position. My interest is the jobs of Australians. That is the paramount consideration.The issue before us in this consideration in detail stage is to ensure that the book bounty continues through to 31 December of this year. At no stage in this debate has there been any justification for removing the bounty after the end of June, because the only justification is the saving of $4 million to the budget bottom line, totally ignoring the impact on employment, especially in regional Australia.

They came to Bendigo and Maryborough, as I understand it, but as soon as they came back they tried to force the legislation through the House.They still had the same line after that visit. They still tried to force that legislation through this House. They took absolutely no notice of people in the regional areas of Australia. I am pleased to see that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) is coming into the House, because he probably would be aware of the spirited debate at that time.The Labor Party had legislation before the House to abolish all book bounties. There is no escaping that fact. Members of the party went to the central Victorian area, had discussions and then came back with an even harder line on abolishing book bounties. It was the work of the member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) and the member for Bendigo that led to those amendments. It was probably because the then government was getting a tremendous amount of opposition at that time because of what was happening in the regional areas of Australia.They did not do it of their own accord. They came into this chamber with an even harder line than they had had. It is sheer hypocrisy on the part of the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) and the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) to speak as they have on this particular issue. In particular, the member for Hotham was one of the driving forces behind the original legislation. He was on the frontbench. In other words, he was part of the decision making process supporting what the then government was doing in introducing that legislation which was going to abolish all book bounties.Where was the member for Hotham then? At that time he was a minister—he has admitted that he was a frontbencher—and he was part of the decision making process. Why was he not standing up against the legislation then? He was not supporting the regional areas of Australia then.We are seeing the hypocrisy of both the member for Hotham and the member for Batman who, although he now sits on the frontbench, at that time was involved with the ACTU, and he totally rolled over. He rolled over on this issue. He was not out there defending his workers at that time, and he is in serious bother on this issue. It is sheer hypocrisy for those members to object to it now when they supported the proposal put by the ALP in 1992 to totally abolish the book bounty at that time.","N/A","BOUNTY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[15]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

You might be interested to know that the figures released today showed a revision to zero growth in the March 1995 quarter.

Indeed, the March 1996 quarter was revised downwards from 2.1 per cent to 1.6 per cent.The Deputy Leader of the Opposition asks why we would see things slowing over the course of 1996. Most people who follow these things closely would know that probably the principal reason for that was the way in which monetary policy was tightened at the end of 1994.

In particular, what initial steps is the government taking to ensure major national projects are not held up by unnecessary departmental delays?","N/A","N/A","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[1]/question.block[2]/question/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
122,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr HOWARD","ZD4","Bennelong","LP","N/A",2011,"—Since coming to office, the government has followed a coordinated strategy to encourage major investment projects in this country. We have followed policies which have created fiscal and monetary settings which give confidence, encour agement and hope to major investors in Australia. We have set about the process of reducing the cost of doing business in this country. We have passed, after some obstruction from the Labor Party and, initially, from others in the Senate, the Workplace Relations Act, the provisions of which are progressively coming into operation. They provide a far better, a more beckoning and a more benign climate for major projects in this country. The provisions of that act are far more likely to encourage people to invest in this country than did the old industrial relations regime which the new Workplace Relations Act has replaced.We have also set about reforming elements of infrastructure in this country in electricity, gas, water and telecommunications. We have strongly promoted the national competition policy and, of course, we have foreshadowed essential reforms in the area of waterfront and shipping. Some of those reforms have occurred already and others will be tackled during the course of this year.Importantly so far as regional Australia is concerned, we have acted to create certainty of access in some of the resource industries. We have begun and successfully concluded the negotiation of an agreement in the Gippsland area so far as forests are concerned, we are grappling with the difficulties thrown up by the High Court decision in the Wik case, and we have set about rationalising Commonwealth&hyphen;state responsibilities in environmental policy in order to reduce compliance costs. It is very encouraging to note that business investment in this country has grown by no less than 20 per cent during the past year.As foreshadowed in my statement to parliament at the end of last year, I have established a part&hyphen;time consultancy position in my office for somebody who will act as a facilitator of major projects. I am delighted to confirm that Mr Bob Mansfield will fill that position. Mr Mansfield is a former Managing Director of Optus, a former Chief Executive with the Fairfax organisation, and he recently carried out a review of the functions and the charter of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. He will serve as a part&hyphen;time consultant attached to my office on the basis of estab lished conditions which have applied to part&hyphen;time consultants employed by former Prime Ministers. It is anticipated that he will devote, on average, two to three days a week to his new task. His appointment will be for an initial period of 12 months, with scope for extensions if that is the mutual desire of myself and Mr Mansfield.His major task will be to bring about the speedy approval of major nation&hyphen;building investment proposals which conform with government policy. For the first time, the federal government of this country will have at the elbow of the Prime Minister somebody with strong business experience with a specific brief to cut through the red tape which so often holds up, delays, frustrates and, in the process, destroys jobs that can be created by the coming into being of major investment projects.Our commitment to improve the climate of operation for small business in this country is undoubted and undiminished. There is also a very major role in the future of Australias economy for the development of major projects attracting large levels of investment, both domestically and from overseas. We need a heightened, more concentrated effort to sweep away the obstruction, the bureaucratic delay, the red tape, the unnecessary obfuscation which is often involved in the process of government approval and determination. I believe Mr Mansfields appointment will strike a very strong blow in that direction.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[1]/question.block[2]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The first line of that article says:Australias policy on the disposal of radioactive waste is definitely not a shambles. Far worse—it doesnt even exist.For 13 years you did absolutely nothing to the point now where 1,600 spent fuel rods will reach the point of storage exhaustion next year and the government must take action.As I said to you to the same type of question, to all intents and purposes the exact question you asked on 28 February, the government has a number of options available to it. It has not decided on one of those options. The question of sites does not arise because we have not decided on the Synroc technology option. Why wouldnt we consider the Synroc technology option? You spent $40 million over the last 13 years developing it up. And what? We spend $40 million of taxpayers funds and suddenly we are not meant to consider it as an option in the best interests of the Australian community to dispose of this problem of spent fuel rods.

132,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr COSTELLO","CT4","Higgins","LP","N/A",2013,"—I thank the honourable member for McMillan for his question. Today, the national accounts showed a 0.5 per cent growth for the December quarter and 3.1 per cent over the course of the year. I note that there were substantial revisions to each of the preceding quarters, including the last quarter of September, although it was the March 1996 quarter that was substantially revised downwards.One of the principal detractions from growth in the December quarter was around one per cent, as a result of strong imports. As I said in the House yesterday, the strong imports were not altogether a bad thing, coming as they did from intermediate and capital goods. What they do, in relation to imports of intermediate goods, which in the quarter increased by 7.7 per cent and capital goods of 4.5 per cent, is to lay down the basis for good investment and good growth over the future year.Taken with more up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date indicators, including a very strong rebound in retail trade of 2.7 per cent in January and leading indicators in the housing sector, which show building approvals rising—as I referred to in the House yesterday—what this shows is strengthening growth throughout 1997, low inflation, high business investment, good capital imports and the opportunity, with lower interest rates cutting in over the course of this year, for growth to strengthen throughout the course of 1997-98. Since March 1996, the Australian Bureau of Statistics has reported 160,000 new jobs in Australia and, on an adjusted basis, there could in fact be up to 200,000 jobs created over the period.The member for McMillan also asked about the implications for the regions of Australia. In relation to his area, the regions of Australia, he would know that it has been this governments stand in relation to forest and forestry agreement which has given wonderful job opportunities which were denied by our predecessor governments down in his area.He would also know that, over the course of this year, this government will put in place the most exciting environmental development Australia has ever seen—opposed by the Labor Party, I regret to say—and put in place by a government that is concerned about the environment; a $1 billion environmental trust to rebuild the environment of Australia. It is something that this government, I believe, and this Prime Minister, if I may say so, will be able to look back on in decades to come and say that the government in 1996 had the courage to put this trust together—one of the most long-sighted environmental developments that we have ever seen in this country and, I regret to say, opposed by the Labor Party root and branch at every step that we took to put in place this environmental trust.That will be of enormous benefit, I believe, to the regions of Australia as we go about rebuilding the infrastructure, as we go about revegetating Australia and as we go about cleaning up the rivers. The member for McMillan, I believe, will be proud that his electorate has been treated so well by a visionary initiative of this government which will grow and prosper for decades to come.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[2]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

136,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr FAHEY","HQ5","Macarthur","LP","N/A",2014,"—I thank the honourable member for North Sydney for his question. There have been a number of recent media reports in respect of the sale process for the long-term leases of Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth airports. I am pleased to say that we have received a total of 18 individual, strong, competitive and high quality bids from nine consortia. Each of those bids has been thoroughly reviewed by the asset sales team, which includes BZW—the governments advisers—against a comprehensive set of evaluation criteria based on the governments stated sales and ongoing privatisation objectives.The long-term lease of airports will maximise efficient airport operations and it will facilitate future airport development on a commercial basis. The evaluation criteria for the bids included the price, ownership diversi ty, contribution to regional development, airport management capacity, airport development plans, awareness of environmental issues and consideration of the interests of the stakeholders of these airports, including the customers and local and state governments. Following that extensive and exhaustive evaluation process, the government, as flagged as an option in the tender documentation issued to the bidders, has decided to leave 13 individual bids, from six of the bidding consortia, on the table for the next stage of the process.Revised bids from the short&hyphen;listed bidders for one or more of the airports are to be submitted by mid&hyphen;April following access to due diligence information and meetings with the government sales team. Completion for each airport is expected to be undertaken in sequence. The sequence will be determined after receipt of the revised bids.I acknowledge the contribution in this process made by the opposition, particularly by the former Minister for Finance, the now Leader of the Opposition, who actually commenced this process. We all know that he was a strong supporter of privatisation when he was the Minister for Finance. I am not so sure that new Labor shares the same support that the Leader of the Opposition formerly gave.I noted that the honourable member for Melbourne in a recent speech to CEDA made it very clear that he had a different view from what old Labors view on privatisation was. I sincerely hope that his view does not come through in the end. I am confident, however, that over the next few months we will draw the sale of the first phase airports to a very successful conclusion in the interests of the people of Australia.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[4]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

146,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr JULL","MH4","Fadden","LP","N/A",2015,"—In December last year, before all this current focus on entitlements, I requested my department to review the report ing systems with the aim of eliminating any deficiencies. I think all in this place would agree that what we need is better information to help both members and senators manage their entitlements and to enable us to detect any problems in the use of entitlements. So the department is about to engage a consultant to assist with this priority task. Most of the work has been done.I have also asked my department to consult with the parliamentary departments which pay the travel allowance entitlements of senators and members on the feasibility of instituting facilities to crosscheck claims against records of official travel held by the department. In addition, I have invited KPMG, which under Ken Baxter is reviewing the DAS structure, to include in its review the administration of entitlements by the department and to make recommendations for further enhancing accountability procedures. Once we get these procedures in place, we will have a much better system of knowing exactly what is going on.I take some objection to the fact that at the moment we seem to be burdened with having to do all this. It is a bit like the big black hole: the allegations that are being made in the Senate at the moment basically happened under the former administration and now we are being left with the situation of having to clean it up. Let me just say that we are going to clean it up and we are not going to give any comfort to those who are found to have undertaken any impropriety in the use of their entitlements.I also say this: we will not do so at the expense of natural justice. It is all right for members of the opposition to sit over there and make these comments, but the reality is that these allegations happened when you were in government and you did absolutely nothing about it. We have had a Leader of the Opposition who has got on television nightly and made the claims that he is all about natural justice. But we get daily doses of muck&hyphen;up in this place and unsubstantiated allegations—and we are expected to cop this.In the meantime, this place is being denigrated and each and every member of this place is being denigrated. As I said yesterday, most people in this place are absolutely honest. What are you trying to do to this institution?

Is the Attorney aware that thousands of mainstream Australians are demonstrating today against the governments destruction of our legal aid system? Does the Attorney recall telling the House yesterday that the Queensland government will enter into an agency agreement to deliver Commonwealth legal aid in that state, which, the Attorney added, `is exactly what we were seeking? Isnt it a fact that, on 10 January this year, the Attorney wrote to all state and territory Attorneys&hyphen;General advising that his preference was to continue the present cooperative agreements in a revised form, as the government now proposes to do with the ACT? Isnt the legal aid system now in chaos because of the Attorneys inconsistent statements and his inability to win an argument in cabinet?","N/A","N/A","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[7]/question/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
157,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr WILLIAMS","7V5","Tangney","LP","N/A",2017,"—There are two things wrong with legal aid. One is that the Labor government allowed the system to drift for 10 years under out&hyphen;of&hyphen;date agreements. The other arose out of the budget deficit black hole, which required cutting of programs like legal aid. The honourable member for Banks has, I know, a genuine interest in legal aid, but I am surprised he does not have a greater interest in Aboriginal legal aid, about which he has not asked any questions at all.Let me deal first with the question relating to Queensland. Queensland announced yesterday, completely consistent with what we have been seeking, that they will have a system under which they will be accountable for state funding provided for state matters, which enables us to join with them in a cooperative delivery of legal aid services in Queensland on the basis that the Commonwealth is accountable for funding for Commonwealth legal matters. That is exactly what we set out to achieve.We have maintained the present cooperative arrangement in Queensland by having a one&hyphen;stop shop. A one&hyphen;stop shop provides the service. All the Commonwealth money is spent through the one service and all the state money is spent through the one service. We are having negotiations with a number of jurisdictions and we have reached broad agreement with two of them. We are progressing negotiations on a daily basis.For the member for Banks to suggest the system is therefore in chaos or crisis I think suggests that his motives are not consistent with the interests of legal aid clients. Lets get behind getting the system working in a way that enables governments to account to legal aid clients. Lets reform the system so that the old&hyphen;fashioned delivery service that went for some 10 years under Labor is removed and so that we have an efficient system whereby the legal aid dollar is spread and we dont have a system under which 70 per cent of funding for referrals goes to only 20 per cent of cases.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[7]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

159,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Dr WOOLDRIDGE","8E4","Chisholm","LP","N/A",2017,"—I thank the honourable member for his question. There has been very substantial interest in newspapers and magazines over recent weeks in this issue after the announcement that, at the Roslin Institute in Scotland, a sheep had been successfully cloned.Cloning is nothing new. It was first achieved in 1952 in tadpoles. But what is new is that it has been successful in higher animals. Two days ago it was announced at the Oregon Primate Research Centre in the United States that a monkey had been successfully cloned and it was on the basis of this that President Clinton announced overnight that federal funding would not be available for research into human cloning. He was responding to a situation that exists in the United States. The situation in Australia is different, as I will outline in a moment.Of course, the problem for society is that the technology of cloning and its experimentation are progressing at a much faster rate than that at which society can contemplate the scientific, social or ethical implications of such experiments. It has been given more urgency because the cloning of a primate is something very significant as it is the species most close to the human race genetically. It is very difficult to contemplate what the long&hyphen;term prospects might be.The situation in Australia basically has three points to it. The first is that, under NHMRC guidelines, human experimentation with the aim of producing two or more genetically identical offspring, which is in fact cloning, is prohibited. The NHMRC has the Australian Health Ethics Committee, a subcommittee which has published ethical guidelines on assisted reproductive technology. These were tabled in parliament in November last year.The NHMRC is of the view that such experimentation is unethical. It would not be funded under the National Health and Medical Research Council. The other great body of funding in Australia is the Australian Research Council and they take note of the NHMRC guidelines. The NHMRC also has a statement on human experimentation. Supplementary note 7 has been issued to that. It prohibits gene therapy that has the potential to change the genetic material that can be passed on from one generation to another.Human cloning is governed by state law. The Commonwealth does not have the right to legislate in this area. In Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria it is illegal. However, in the other states and territories what is not covered by the NHMRC or the Australian Research Council would almost certainly be found to be unethical through either hospital or other research institute guidelines. I can assure honourable members that the government is of the view that experimentation on human cloning is beyond the bounds of what are acceptable guidelines. The National Health and Medical Research Council is aware of our view.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[8]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Is it not a fact that Australias Uruguay Round obligation for sugar is a tariff of $70 per tonne by the year 2000? Is it not the case that the current tariff, abolished by the government yesterday at $55 per tonne—an effective 13 per cent—is comfortably within that obligation? Is it not the case that the sugar tariff on many of our export destinations is massively higher than that? For example, the US is at 100 per cent, Thailand is at 104 per cent and the European Union is at 170 per cent. How does the governments establishment of a zero sugar tariff for Australia stand with the Prime Ministers statement to the parliament last year that the government would take into account what other countries are doing or, as the Australian Financial Review put it, `PM says we wont go it alone on tariff cuts?

If he bothered to examine the structure of the sugar industry he would know that the future of the sugar industry in Australia lies in developing a strong export focus.What the government has done is give the Australian industry a hope of winning a strong export market, and the Leader of the Opposition knows quite well that the package that I brought down yesterday offers greater hope of expanding the exports of Australian industry. If the Leader of the Opposition thinks that he is going to win any credibility amongst the people who for 13 years his government systematically ignored by some kind of opportunistic and theoretical backflip on tariff policy, he is treating the Australian people with the kind of arrogance and indif ference that he displayed when he was in government. By doing it, he is doing absolutely nothing to retrieve his electoral fortunes.What we have done is to give the Australian sugar industry the guarantee of single desk selling. It is a decision that was recommended by the inquiry. It has been endorsed by the Queensland government and welcomed by the Queensland industry. I believe the subsidy measures that we have put in place will be warmly welcomed by the New South Wales section of the industry.

It is interesting that the Labor Party seem to be taking such delight in trying to talk down the prospects for small business—basically trying to suppress any good news. So the last couple of weeks would have been a disaster for them. The ABS statistics on building approvals released yesterday say that over the 12 months there has been a 22.5 per cent improvement. In fact, for the month of January it was 10.4 per cent. For the building industry and the pull through trades that will have a significant effect.I will keep going. Let us look at retail trades. Retail trade figures are showing, seasonally adjusted, a 2.7 per cent improve ment. These figures, in accordance with what the Treasurer is saying, build on the improving trend that we are starting to see come through. The Labor Party do not like it. Motormouth over there does not like it one little bit. He does not like it that for 13 years they tried to destroy small business but in the last 12 months we have done one heck of a lot to turn it around.After 13 years of trying to wipe out small business, what is their policy now? What is the policy of new Labor with regard to small business? It is interesting. New Labor had a Labor review as part of their platform. New Labor reviewed the party platform. On the basis that old Labor tried for 13 years to destroy small business, you would think that new Labor would want to try to do something for small business.

I am glad to report to the House that the government has taken a number of initiatives aimed at increasing Australias profile and also the potential for expanding sports exports in the Asian region particularly. This might relate to technology, sports expertise and education.Recently we established the Sports Export Advisory Council, which is chaired by the Managing Director of Ford Motor Co. of Australia, Mr David Morgan, who is assisted by a range of sports experts around this country. They are charged with the task of providing linkages between business and sport and will report to the Minister for Trade and me.Also, the Australian Sports Commission, for which I am responsible, has some 15 bilateral arrangements with countries in our region in relation to the development of sport contacts. At the Atlanta Olympics, the government took a number of initiatives. We were proactive in developing contacts with a range of nations and sports ministers, and I developed a liaison with many of them, and we are developing those contacts particularly with South Africa and Malaysia. But also through the Sport and Recreation Ministers Council, the governments all agreed—that is, all states and the Commonwealth—on a cooperative approach to the federal and state levels in attracting interest in the use of sports facilities for visiting teams for the 2000 games.You will be aware that I have released a directory of sports facilities and training venues, which I think has been made available to every member in the House. I certainly know the member for Cowper, Mr Nehl, an eminent rower and sculler in his own right—","N/A","N/A","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[3]/question.block[6]/answer/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

222,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr WARWICK SMITH","GJ4","Bass","LP","N/A",2023,"—I mean the rowing sort of sculler. He has been assiduous in promoting the international stadium in Coffs Harbour and he, like many members, recognises the potential for pursuing those opportunities. There is obviously a range of opportunities for teams to be involved here but also for governments and members to pursue that. Those who are not aware should know that the Australian Institute of Sport has, with the College of Sports Education, of which it is a partner, developed educational services, and that information will be distributed widely throughout South-East Asia.Late last year, I did release a detailed report prepared by Price Waterhouse and Maxwell and Druce International about the expanding opportunities in our region, in South-East Asia, for the development of this industry. The interesting figure is that it is estimated that there is some $600 million worth of sports exports to Australia in a variety of forms, to which I refer, up to the year 2000. This is a growing industry in its own right. It provides an immense number of jobs for Australians, and I certainly commend the report to members.Also late last year, I announced the appointment of Kevan Gosper, who is a member of the International Olympic Committee, to be a special representative and adviser to the government for export development of Australian sport. Likewise, he will report to Mr Morgans committee and also to the National Office of Sport and Recreation Policy, for which I am responsible.Finally, and in conclusion, can I indicate also that one of the examples of the achievements that we have been able to see from our sportspeople is in the recent result in the cricket match in South Africa. Four of the members of that team—Glenn McGrath, Shane Warne, Greg Blewett, who got 214 runs, by the way, and Michael Bevan—were all graduates of the Australian Institute of Sport Cricket Academy in Adelaide. That is the sort of example that can go to showing the rest of the world what we can achieve and help further this industry to expand.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[3]/question.block[6]/answer/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

Very simply, we were left a situation when we took office: the previous government had not developed a sustainable defence industry—that means an industry where firms can afford to lose a contract from the Department of Defence and still stay in business.Accordingly, we are working to develop a policy whereby foreign firms doing business here comply with five principles that require them to invest in both facilities and Australian personnel in particular. In the last few weeks at the Avalon Air Show, there were announced three very significant projects which will result in new jobs being developed and that sustainable industry being developed.The first announcement was the Transfield&hyphen;Lockheed Martin joint venture program, which will be based in Melbourne, which will result in 1,000 jobs being created in the next four years. It also means that they will be using their advanced systems engineering, integration and software development capabilities and technologies not only in Australia but also in South&hyphen;East Asia. They will also be using their expertise in civilian projects and meeting the guidelines. The first contract they will be taking over is the JORN contract where the last government allowed 80 per cent of the money to be paid for 20 per cent of the work. We will now get it back on track.The second announcement was made by McDonnell Douglas, which has chosen Aerospace Technologies of Australia to produce trailing edge flaps for the FA18 E/F Super Hornet. The first order will be worth $200 million to Australia. Indeed, it is a worldwide opportunity and more jobs will flow from it.

They announced that they have doubled their exports in the past 12 months and in the next 12 months they expect to double them again. The important and significant point that comes up from British Aerospace, which is based largely in South Australia, is that defence industry is worth three per cent of South Australias state domestic product and is just as important as the wine industry is to that state. They employ 1,800 people and their determination to comply with the five principles this government has laid down means that there are more job opportunities and more exports coming into this country.Basically, the principles that have been laid down and the willingness of firms like Raytheon and Hughes, which are all looking to do better and have more investment in this country which will produce more jobs, is all in pursuance of creating a sustainable industry, to maintain a self&hyphen;reliant Defence Force, but, importantly, to create new jobs for Australians.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[3]/question.block[8]/answer/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

I know she is very concerned about environmental issues and I know she is also concerned about jobs, including for the people of Kingston and the people of Adelaide and South Australia. The government has received advice of the European Unions negotiating target proposal for all OECD countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 15 per cent compared to the 1990 levels by 2010. The EU intends to submit this proposal to the negotiations currently taking place in Bonn.The House may be aware that the Australian government is arguing for what is described as a differentiation proposal in these climate change negotiations. That is to ensure that there is an equitable sharing of the burden amongst all of the so-called annexe 1 countries, which are in effect the OECD countries. There is no reason why this country should be asked to bear a disproportionate burden in addressing the climate change issue.The European Union proposal contains a differentiation proposal itself. It contains differentiation for individual EU member states but excludes this possibility for the OECD countries. So there are different targets for individual member states—for example, Portugals target allows emissions in 2010 to increase by 40 per cent, Greeces target is to increase by 30 per cent, Spains by 17 per cent and so on.Australia, along with other non-EU OECD countries, is being asked to accept a uniform flat rate reduction of 15 per cent, and that is clearly not going to be acceptable. It is inconsistent for the EU to deny others what they are using as a key element of their own efforts to address climate change.The fact is that a 15 per cent reduction target by 2010 is unrealistic. As we see it, it is little more than a negotiating tactic at this stage by the European Union. It also has to be said that the European Union proposal is frankly unworkable because it does not provide a sound framework for long-term cooperative action to address the climate change issue.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[3]/question.block[10]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I assumed, in my good natured way, that the minister had just been reading some press releases, some scientific reports that had come across his desk or perhaps the recent ANSTO annual report and this topic had stuck in his mind and it had just come out as a slip of the tongue during the interview.But then I remembered that this minister has form on this topic. He has prior convictions when it comes to nuclear energy. This is the same minister who in 1993—although he was in opposition back then—proposed nuclear power facilities right across Australia.

252,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr MARTYN EVANS","N36","(Bonython)","ALP","N/A",2027,"—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Of course this minister, as the then opposition spokesman, was forced to withdraw this proposal in January 1994. In an interview of the day, he went on the record saying that he no longer felt this was an economically viable proposition. Indeed, he rejected the hypothetical proposition which he had been advancing for the electorate. He went on to say:And we—that is, the coalition parties—believe that nuclear enrichment and nuclear powered electricity are alien concepts to Australians and theyre economically unfeasible.Indeed they are alien concepts, as is the concept of nuclear fuel enrichment plants in Australia. This minister has form in this area. This is an alien concept. It was an alien concept in 1994 and it is an alien concept in 1997.What are we referring to when we talk about nuclear fuel reprocessing? Most members are familiar with nuclear power plants. They are familiar with the very safe operation of the Lucas Heights facility over the last 40 years. But most people are not so familiar with nuclear fuel reprocessing.You have to wait some 30 years for the spent fuel rods to cool sufficiently for them to be reprocessed. They are then treated with concentrated nitric acid, forming a very hot liquid and some gaseous components as well. This hot, thermally active and radioactive liquid is then separated into its respective components.Those components are uranium and waste material which is still very radioactive and in liquid form, and there is the potential for a small amount of plutonium to come from this process as well. That plutonium is very significant, and I think honourable members should keep sight of that as we proceed through this discussion.One thing nuclear fuel reprocessing does not do is that it does not reduce the level of radioactivity of the material concerned. At the end of the process, you still have very substantial quantities of radioactive material, although you have it in separate components. Instead of a mixture of nuclear fuel, you now have the uranium, the plutonium and the liquid waste separated out. You do not have any less radioactivity, but you do have a massive increase in the volume of this material. We are now required to deal with massive amounts of liquid radioactive waste, and this is what the minister proposes to locate at Lucas Heights in the middle of suburban Sydney. Minister, this is not a vision for science; this is more an illusion which is going to become a nightmare for the people of Sutherland Shire.In the past, the reasons one might propose for reprocessing have been threefold. First, for the military there was obviously the purpose of extracting the plutonium. I think this is an issue which will come back to haunt this minister.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

255,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr MARTYN EVANS","N36","(Bonython)","ALP","N/A",2027,"—This government has joined with the previous government in moving towards the Canberra Commission proposition which will ensure that Australia takes a very strong stand in this world against nuclear proliferation. That is one of the most serious objectives which the previous government had in dealing with the Canberra Commission and on the international stage. The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) has picked this topic up and continued to proceed with Australias favourable outlook in that regard.What will our friends in the Western world say when we are in possession of plutonium? How does that leave our non-proliferation treaty obligations when, as a result of the ministers reprocessing ambitions, we have significant quantities of plutonium? How will we deal with those quantities—something that we do not want to have to deal with?Secondly, there used to be economic reasons for reprocessing. It used to be necessary to extract the uranium from the reprocessing in order to have uranium to feed back into the nuclear fuel cycle. Uranium, of course, is now quite plentiful. Australia is not short of uranium, if it wishes to supply its reactor, and that is no longer a necessary objective. The third reason is that it does in some small way facilitate disposal because you have separate components with which to deal rather than a homogenous group. But taken in totality in 1997, this is not an adequate reason to proceed with the reprocessing of nuclear fuel in this country.Naturally, if the minister was to proceed with a pilot level plant, it would be a very expensive proposition. Japan is proceeding with one at the moment which will come on-stream some time after 2000. This is a pilot plant for reprocessing fast reactor fuel in Japan. It will cost them something of the order of $1.5 billion. It will be a six-storey building with a two-storey basement, and it is still just a pilot plant. So precisely what is proposed for the Lucas Heights region here? Something of the same order? I sincerely hope not.Nuclear reprocessing is an option in England. The British government has established a number of very major reprocessing facilities in Dounreay and Sellafield that have been in operation for some time. There is a very strong view in the nuclear industry that the only reason those plants are continued, maintained and indeed expanded is because Britain and France—its colleague country in this regard—have already made substantial investments in the nuclear fuel cycle, and they have significant plants which need to be maintained. That is why they are in that business.Other countries, like Germany, which has recently abandoned a proposal to get involved with reprocessing, and the United States, which does not reprocess fuel, have rightly moved away from this technology and towards storage. That ought to be Australias option, not the option of reprocessing fuel for our very modest nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights on Australian soil.As an alternative to a pilot plant, the minister may have in mind—and given his past enthusiasm for the nuclear industry—importing waste from other countries. Indeed, he has commented on this as being part of the fast growing Asian nuclear region. He may want to attack some of his theories in the nuclear club by having Australia be part of this arrangement and import nuclear waste. I think the honourable member for Hughes (Mrs Vale) would need to ask what the hidden agenda is behind the governments plans for an airport at Holsworthy. Is one of those agendas the importation of nuclear fuel through that airport? I sincerely hope not, because that would expose us to even greater risks than the ministers bizarre proposal already does.If you want to see exactly what this kind of reprocessing plant can leave you with after a few years of operation, you can do no worse that look at the United States. One of the main reasons they have now moved away from this technology—if you look at Hanford—is the massive amounts of liquid waste which they have had to deal with and the enormous environmental degradation which that has produced on that site. The United States now has a super&hyphen;fund to clean up these kinds of areas. The cost of that is massive to the US economy; the damage to the local environment is enormous; and the technology is far from useful for that country, which is why they have moved away from it.Minister, you have some very hard decisions to make in this area. These decisions have come up on your watch. I know that is tough but that is the reality of politics. You wanted to get into government. Now you are in, you will have to take some of these hard decisions, make some of the hard plans and put in the work that is required to ensure Australia has some sound policies in the future.This reactor is now nearly 40 years old. It is not quite as old as he or I, but the reality is that I suspect the reactor is in not quite such good condition as either of us. The reality is that we need to plan for the future. Minister, instead of coming up with this kind of distracting proposal which focuses public attention on an entirely absurd proposal to reprocess waste at Lucas Heights, why dont you focus public attention instead on the real questions?Australia needs to address the issue of the future of the Lucas Heights reactor and the future of the Lucas Heights site, because the Nuclear Safety Bureau has very clearly said they will not continue to recertify this plant much beyond 2003. ANSTO itself says that it is essential we start making decisions at about now.The reality is that the minister should be putting the effort into determining the future of that site and not into proposing strange new ways of getting ANSTO into the world nuclear club. That is a technology looking for a solution, instead of a reasoned plan for the future of Australias nuclear industry focused on that research reactor. This is where you need some serious vision.We do have an issue about the storage of the fuel rods from Lucas Heights. They continue to mount up. Governments for the last 38 years have known that they would, and the reality is that that has to be dealt with as and when the problem arises. We have now reached a point where that needs further serious consideration.The previous government sent one shipload back for reprocessing, and that will return to Australia in some 25 to 30 years in reprocessed form. The significance is that that site is now reaching a point where in the next two or three years, or sooner, you will need some serious answers to those questions. Not only will you have to look at the issue of the future of the plant, but also whether Australia needs another research reactor and, if it does, whether that should be at Lucas Heights or at some alternative site. Those are the kinds of questions to which the people of Australia, particularly the people of Sutherland Shire, are demanding answers to. They are not looking for new ways of getting us further and deeper into the nuclear cycle or of creating further and deeper environmental problems in that region. They are looking, instead, for long-term answers and serious work to be done on this topic.You must also face the reality that Synroc has had substantial investment in it over the years. I understand that. But if we are going to use a reprocessing plant at Lucas Heights merely as a demonstration technique for Synroc, then I think that is a very wasteful extravagance in terms of federal funding. It is a very dangerous proposition for the people of that area and it is not a suitable way to ensure the continuation of that technology.Normally, I would be the first to join with the minister in support of Australian industry and Australian science through the commitment of government resources. It is unfortunate that his government has not displayed the same commitment to industry when it reduced the research and development grants, when it abolished syndication, when it pulled back funding from ANSTO, AIMS and CSIRO and when it has sought to wipe out industry policy in general, as well as some of that scientific collaboration in research.Normally, I would come out and support the minister if he was proposing to invest federal funds in the development of a technology. But this is not the way to further the development of the Synroc technology. You cannot use the people of Sutherland Shire and Lucas Heights as pawns in a game which is merely for the development of a technology.I support the furtherance of that technology, if it is possible. We have a long-term investment in it—governments of both political colours have that. It deserves a degree of bipartisan support, as does ANSTO in its general activities. That is something you have always had and will have from us on this side of the House. But this is not the kind of proposal which is deserving of bipartisan support. This moves right outside of that area when it puts the citizens of that district at risk.ANSTO have a very strong record of safety. They have a first&hyphen;class record of research in the past, and it is very contemptuous of them to put their reputation at risk by this kind of proposal. You do them a great disservice by injuring their public reputation and their position of public trust and confidence in this way. There was no need to involve them in this kind of proposition. It is not a solution you need to propose in order to deal with the nuclear fuel rods from Lucas Heights.Most governments in the world are coming to the conclusion that dry storage is the way to go in the medium&hyphen;term future for these kinds of fuel rods. There is no reason why that could not continue in the way that it has. Indeed, the Senate last year, in an all-party report, recommended this kind of method of storage for Australia. It certainly did not recommend—and I am sure that its members would disagree with you now—the reprocessing option for Lucas Heights.This is not a good new industry for Australia, Minister. Focus your attention on the good science which is coming out of Australian industry, on the good science which is coming out of our national science agencies like CSIRO, ANSTO, AIMS and the universities. Do not expose them to this kind of nuclear `cowboyry. Certainly, do not put the people of Hughes and Sutherland Shire at risk through the environmental degradation which this proposal would implement. Guarantee them today that you will not proceed with this.For the sake of those people, for the sake of those families and for the sake of the future of that area, give the guarantee which for the last two weeks you have failed and refused to give in this House and outside of this House. Give them the assurance which they and we seek from you today—that you will abandon this absurd proposal for a reprocessing facility at Lucas Heights in Sydney now.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/break/break/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
256,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr McGAURAN","XH4","(Gippsland—","NP","Minister for Science and Technology)",2031,"—The member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) must have woken up this morning, seen that Sydney Morning Herald front page story and thought all of his Christmases had come at once. That story had nothing new to reveal, no extra information and no interpretation beyond what I have been saying for several weeks and what most other news organisations in this country have been reporting for several weeks. Let us deal with that first and foremost.There is nothing new in the story in the Sydney Morning Herald . It correctly reports that the government is examining the options available to it for the disposal of the 1,600 spent fuel rods at Lucas Heights. I have been grievously misrepresented by the member when he concluded in his address—leaving aside a number of misrepresentations during his address—by saying that we have decided on a reprocessing plant at Lucas Heights. That is completely wrong.Despite the member for Bonython understandably rejoicing in the event of today and in the attention that it has brought him and the issue, he has three major problems—and he did not overcome any of the problems during his address. The first is that the Labor Party did nothing in government for 13 years to address this problem. We have inherited this. We have come to government, and the advice from ANSTO is that next year the storage facilities at Lucas Heights will be exhausted. The spent fuel rods have to be dealt with. They have to be reprocessed. So you have no credibility. This is opportunism of the worst kind. It is politics at its most base.Instead of seeking a reasoned, sensible and calm debate on this issue, the Labor Party seizes on a front page story dramatically presented with a headline, photos and sketches but which reveals nothing new or different. They come in here and turn up the temperature. During his whole address, the member threw around words like `nuclear power, `nuclear fuel enrichment and `nuclear proliferation, instead of addressing the one issue—that is, how do we dispose of the spent fuel which is an unavoidable by-product of the research reactor?The second problem is that the Labor Party spent, in round figures, $40 million in research into Synroc technology. If I understand them correctly, we are now not entitled to consider that as an option. You tell the Australian taxpayers, firstly, that you spent $40 million over 13 years on a technology that you were never going to use in government—and which never sees the funding, by the way—and, secondly, that we are not entitled to consider it as an option. You tell them that you have wasted $40 million. You will not. Of course we are entitled to consider the Synroc technologies. You would have done in government, I suspect. But from your remarks now, I am not so certain.What has happened to the $40 million? It has just been wasted? It has been worthless technology? Of course we have to consider it. Thirdly, you have no policy yourself on how to dispose of these 1,600 spent fuel rods. I listened very carefully to every word, particularly to see whether or not you would finish up with a declaration of how you would dispose of the 1,600 spent fuel rods. The member for Bonython failed to do that, Mr Deputy Speaker. So what credibility do you have? With what seriousness should we regard your protestations on behalf of the people of Hughes, for whom we have real interest because we want to dispose of the spent fuel rods?It is a ludicrous MPI and, quite frankly, a waste of this parliaments time. The government has said that we can send the spent fuel rods back to the United Kingdom for reprocessing. Do you want that? Should they go back to Dounreay, Scotland? No answer. They can go back to the United States for reprocessing. Do you want that? Should they go back to the United States? No answer. Or we can process them domestically. We will consider them, looking at all of the environment, social and economic considerations.How do we deal with an opposition that can inflame what can be, at times, a sensitive community issue if people in responsible positions do not handle it properly, yet still fail to tell us what they would do with the problem they gave us after total inaction over 13 years? Do not take my word for it. You have been quoting the Sydney Morning Herald . I refer you again, as I did in question time, to a report by Leigh Dayton on 22 August 1994. Did she cane the then Labor government! She said:Australias policy on the disposal of radioactive waste is definitely not a shambles. Far worse—it doesnt even exit.The article goes through your cowardly inaction on this issue. Even though it was drawn to your attention in the media in August 1994, the Labor Party did nothing until it lost government in March 1996. Twenty months later you still had done nothing. The shadow minister puts up this idea that we can leave them there. Correct me if I am wrong, please take a personal explanation, but to the best of my understanding, you said, `Leave them in dry storage. But they are corroding. We cannot leave them indefinitely.That is the opposition we have to deal with. How do we take you seriously? You have no credibility, you put up no alternative and the storage is exhausted in 1998. The government does have to take a decision. You were gracious enough to say there are hard decisions; you were not so gracious as to give us any indication of what those decisions should be. So you are scaremongering. I expect it from the extremist groups and the Democrats on these types of issues most of the time, but not from the Labor Party opposition. I would have expected a lot more.You can exaggerate, you can hype up and terrify people if you really want to on this issue. The fact is that you have a responsibility, particularly as much of this problem is of your making, to assist the government to solve it, or else, if not supporting the final decision that we make, to put up your own alternative. Until then, quite frankly, I—and I do not see how anyone in the community would—cannot take you seriously. You had the gall to lecture me about the need to respect and support ANSTO. The member for Bonython should know that the government has a very strong commitment to ANSTO.We recognise that the spent fuel represents an unavoidable by&hyphen;product of the HIFAR research reactor which is used to produce almost all of Australias nuclear medicines. Some 260,000 Australians benefit from the radioisotopes every year. As a major national scientific facility, the reactor also plays an important part in education and research outside of ANSTO with 7,000 hours of research time provided to universities in both Australia and New Zealand on an annual basis. It is one of the worlds largest sources of irradiated silicon used in advanced computer chip production. HIFAR is also used to analyse more than 33,000 samples each year for the minerals and oil exploration industries in Australia.The government is very supportive of this essential facility. In medical, environmental, industrial and research terms, ANSTO serves the nation extremely well. It does not deserve the adverse publicity which the opposition and the minor parties are now visiting upon it. The hypocrisy of anyone, including the member for Bonython, to accuse me or the government of letting down ANSTO is astounding. It is they, the opposition, who are stirring up community feelings on this issue. We will fully, properly and responsibly consider all of the factors that go to make up the different options available to the government for this unavoidable problem. It is not going to go away.Nobody at ANSTO is going to be fooled by this phoney, mealy&hyphen;mouthed defence on their part. It is the member for Bonython who should be ashamed and embarrassed to show his face anywhere near the Lucas Heights site. We have full support for ANSTO and what it does. It plays a crucial role in Australia for both health and manufacturing terms. So many thousands of Australians owe their lives to the research carried out at ANSTO.Remember that ANSTO is Australias only producer of radioisotopes which are used in treating and detecting illnesses which include cancer, thyroid disease, heart disease and others. There are over 100 nuclear medicine departments in Australia performing an estimated 300,000 diagnostic tests and 4,000 treatments annually with a combined value approaching $200 million. In an average year, more than 250,000 Australians—I mentioned 260,000 Australians earlier on—will have a nuclear medicine procedure and, on average, one in every two Australians can now expect one in their lifetime.These and other non-invasive procedures have replaced the need for much exploratory surgery to assess a patients condition, significantly reducing discomfort and cost to patients. Use of these tests also reduces the length of hospital stays. Sales of ANSTOs radio pharmaceuticals to the Australian market now exceed $11 million annually. Some $700,000 of ANSTOs radio pharmaceuticals are also exported to South-East Asia, where the market is estimated to be $25 million and growing at more than 10 per cent annually.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

263,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr McGAURAN","XH4","(Gippsland—","NP","Minister for Science and Technology)",2031,"—The member for Bonython is policy-free on all the issues. He has the temerity to sit there and say, `Its your decision. Of course it is our decision. We will make it. That is why I have always been open and honest and set out the options available to the government.Now we want to know what his policy is, especially how the opposition are going to tell Australian taxpayers that they have spent $40 million over 13 years and the Synroc technology is going to be junked. For any opposition frontbencher to taunt the government by saying, `Youre the government, youre the minister, thats what you get paid for, make the decision, and not have any alternative is hypocritical and cowardly. We will make the decision—make no mistake about that. Events will be forced on us. The storage facilities are exhausted next year, so we will make the decision in the next few months.But you tell us what your policy is. We have to go into all of the detail, make all of the calculations and take into account so many different factors. I am not asking that of you; I am just asking for a one-line policy from you. I will not require you to prepare a Fightback of 600 pages, with all of the supporting documentation, but you just tell us what your bottom line is. What is the member for Bonythons one-sentence destination for the 1,600 spent fuel rods? Until then, you have no place in this debate and you ought to be condemned for the way you are stirring it up for your own purposes.ANSTO of course uses the radioisotopes in a variety of ways to boost productivity, from checking gas and oil pipelines to the development of newer high&hyphen;tech materials. In the environmental field, by using radioisotopes, we can trace sewage from ocean outfalls or small leaks from complex systems, such as power stations and heat exchanges. HIFAR is used, as I say, to analyse more than 33,000 samples each year for the minerals and oil exploration industries in Australia. So it is a major scientific facility. It plays a very important part in education and research out of ANSTO.For all these reasons, the government will support the institution. We will solve the problem that we have inherited from Labor and, notwithstanding some of the worst kinds of opportunist politics imaginable by the opposition, we will win the confidence of the local and, indeed, the more widespread community. (Extension of time granted)I will not need long, but I just want to reinforce a couple of points. What did the Labor Party do over 13 years? What were their decisions? None. Instead, it seems that they put their head in the sand and thought the spent fuel rods would go away naturally. The Labor Party refused to make any decision regarding the spent fuel rods.Worse still, they continued to fund, at the rate of millions of dollars a year, the Synroc technology, seemingly—from what the shadow minister now tells us—without any intention of ever using it, without any intention of capitalising on that research which extended from 1980, but most of the money was spent during Labors 13 years. Even now, they will not tell us what their policy is.On all those grounds, the Labor Party and the shadow minister are revealed for what they really are. They are just cheap political opportunists who stand condemned for the way they are stirring up local feeling with total disregard to peoples natural feelings on this issue. The way they throw around the nuclear spectre, next we will be hearing from the shadow minister the imagery of Chernobyl or Three Mile Island. This, instead, is one of the options available to the government, which is reasonably and responsibly considering them before reaching a final decision.For those members who have just come in, let me remind them of a priceless, memorable interjection, never to be forgotten, by the member for Bonython. When I asked him whether he would send the spent fuel rods to Dounreay in the United Kingdom for repro cessing I received no answer. When I asked him whether he would send them to the United States for reprocessing I received no answer. When I asked him whether he would reprocess them domestically I received no answer. His only reply was, `Youre the government, youre the minister, you make the decision.We will make the decision—a decision they avoided studiously at great expense to Australians for 13 years. But you tell us what your policy is. Just tell us in one sentence the destination: United Kingdom, United States or Australia. That is all you have to tell us. Until then, you have no credibility and, until then, you are revealed for the political opportunist you really are.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/break/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"
264,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr McCLELLAND","JK6","(Barton)","ALP","N/A",2034,"—One may well ask what this government is doing to my friend the member for Hughes (Mrs Vale). First, they are giving her an airport. Now they are throwing in a nuclear reprocessing plant. When are they going to throw in a quarantine station or a hospital for contagious diseases, just to take another 20 per cent off the property values of residents in her electorate?The development of such a reprocessing plant is going to have a dramatic effect on not only the residents of Sutherland but also all those in the surrounding areas, including my electorate of Barton and the surrounding electorates of Banks, Watson, Throsby and Werriwa because they would be the routes that all this nuclear material would be shipped and transported through in order to get to Lucas Heights. It is an issue that very much affects that entire region of Sydney.Indeed, the issue affects Australia. The minister has asked, `Why have you spent all this money on developing the Synroc technology? The fact of the matter is that that technology is extremely valuable and is to be used overseas in other reprocessing plants that already exist. But because that investment is being made in that technology, you do not have to dive headlong into the water—indeed, contaminated water—of developing your own nuclear facility at the grubby, literally poisonous end of the nuclear cycle.The minister said that we were being emotive when we used terms such as `nuclear power and `nuclear fuel. I do not know what the subject matter of the debate is if it is not about the by-products of nuclear power and nuclear fuel. Let us talk about radioactive contamination and the effects of radiation as indicated in No time to waste , a report of April 1996. It says:The long term health effects of radiation exposure are manifested by mutation of cells, increased aging capacity of the body, and increased incidence of leukemia, birth defects and cancer.The government asks, `What are we going to do? What they are doing is pre&hyphen;empting research and investigation which was under way during the period of the Labor government. One was an investigation into the future of Lucas Heights—my strong view is that it should have no future; it is right now smack bang in a very beautiful residential area—and the second was to identify a site for the future disposal of waste, including an investigation into the characteristics of that site.This government is proposing to dive headlong into the contaminated pool of this reprocessing plant without first of all investigating those issues. In other words, they are trying to inject life into the nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights by giving it another purpose rather than investigating whether its current purpose should be continued—a very live and sensitive issue in the entire region.The minister—with respect, he has fallen victim to the Yes, Minister men; perhaps with experience he will be able to detect where they are coming from—has said that the Sydney Morning Herald is only reporting what he has been saying for the last few weeks. Todays Sydney Morning Herald said:Officials envisage using Australias experimental Synroc technology for immobilising nuclear waste, thereby demonstrating its first commercial use to the burgeoning nuclear power industry in the Asia-Pacific region. After reprocessing, the waste would be buried somewhere in Outback Australia.If that is not saying that the conduit to outback Australia is coming through a reprocessing plant at Lucas Heights, I do not know what is. They are diving into the Asia-Pacific nuclear processing technology area without Australians deciding whether it is an industry that they want at all. I think that if there were a referendum, Australians would say, `Stay right out of this one, just as Europe, Germany and the United States are doing. Without a mandate whatsoever, they are diving straight into this technology—a commercial enterprise for the whole Asia-Pacific region—which collects all their waste and reprocesses it. That waste is going to come in from ships and presumably it will come in through Port Botany, through my electorate and through surrounding electorates. Even if it is not going to bring in supplies from overseas, a reprocessing plant most certainly is going to collect waste from areas all around Australia, such as hospitals and irradiation plants that we used to use for irradiating carpets and food and so forth. In mass quantities, to one big bulk store, it will be coming through all the electorates in that area of Sydney.The government has already demonstrated that it is not prepared to consult with local residents. In March of last year there was the disgraceful incident when the government shipped out spent fuel rods to Dounreay through my electorate of Barton in a clandestine operation between midnight and 2 a.m. without telling people in the electorates.Recently, a British ship was carrying Japanese nuclear waste around our shores and the government did not tell the Australian public that that was occurring. The Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) is reported as saying that it was a security risk for the route to be public knowledge because of the potential for terrorism to sink the ship. That is precisely the response I got from ANSTO to the March shipment issue. ANSTO considers itself above the law because its nuclear science is so sensitive.But in the meantime the residents of all our electorates have to bend over and cop it. They do not have any input whatsoever into what is happening. It is a circumstance where there has been no identification of accountability and no assumption of risk. For instance, who was responsible in that Dounreay shipment—was it ANSTO, the truck driver or the police who were supervising in case of an accident or some terrorist attack? Who would the residents have sued if it had occurred?I point out to the government that you cannot buy insurance for a nuclear disaster. Mercantile Mutual, for example, says that loss, damage or liability as a result of the use, existence or escape of nuclear weapons material or ionising radiation from, or contamination by radioactivity from, any nuclear fuel or nuclear waste from the combustion of nuclear fuel is excluded from their policy.Homes and residents in all our areas are not insured against damage from nuclear material and trucks are going to be coming past them day and night. In the April 1996 report of the Senate Select Committee on the Dangers of Radioactive Waste, entitled No Time To Waste , there is this comment about the compliance with the transport code in respect of the transportation of waste:. . . the [Transport] Code requirements are often not followed simply because of the unavailability of appropriate transport containers, or the lack of understanding of the Code or both.With the code unworkable, nuclear fuel from all over Australia coming through our electorates into Lucas Heights and ANSTO exempted from state law, our residents are again supposed to cop it. Their kids are sleeping at night, and they do not know if there is a truck carrying contaminated material is going past their front yards. That is an outrageous and unnecessary situation.The minister did not have to go anywhere near this area. He could have left it at examining what is going to happen with Lucas Heights and the feasibility of other sites for the disposal of waste. Instead, he has pre&hyphen;empted all the inquiries that were taking place, saying: `Let us dive into this new economic opportunity—that is, contaminating Australia. The government is to be condemned for causing the fear that it has.

It talks about the consequences of a proposal. If any of the honourable members opposite had bothered to listen to the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran) at question time, they would have realised what a terrible MPI this was and withdrawn it on the spot. The member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) has made a complete fool of himself, and so has his mate the member for Barton (Mr McClelland), who had to follow on after having heard the minister make it very clear in his answer to a question at question time that the government has not made any decision. It could not be any clearer than that.I feel sorry for the poor members of the Labor Party who have had to get up and put this MPI. Obviously, the Labor Party were desperate to find something to put up here. They thought about the poor old member for Bonython and thought: `He hasnt really had much, and he put this one up because he could not think of much else. It is very sad. But it reflects the judgment that the Australian people made just over 12 months ago when they put the Labor Party over there because they realised that they were no longer fit for government.That is doubly or trebly true of the former member for Hughes—I will come back to that, because that really was the consequence of what had happened. Thank God, he is no longer here, because of some of the damage he did. If you want to look at what can be damaging for the Australian community and for the people of Hughes in particular, have a look at what the former member was trying to do to this country.Not only is this a sadly misguided MPI but it is also—because of the way the arguments have been presented to the chamber today—one of the most irresponsible in a long time. It is most unfortunate. It does nothing for the credibility of the opposition and very little for the credibility of this chamber to have people coming in here and making such utterly irresponsible and misleading statements.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

I did not hear the Labor Party complaining at the time about all the good things that were done by ANSTO for the health of Australians.The way the Labor Party has behaved is quite extraordinary, and I would be far more concerned for the people of Australia and for the people Hughes about having a recycled member for Hughes in the form of Mr Tickner. Look at the damaging consequences of what he did. Look at the Hindmarsh Island fiasco and think what a reincarnation of the Keating government would mean.

The minister, in his complete demolition of this matter, made some very salient points about the Labor Partys problems. He made three points very clearly and enunciated them in a way that all honourable members opposite should have listened to.Firstly and most importantly, he pointed out that Labor had 13 years to look at the problem of what to do with the nuclear fuel rods, and they did nothing—except spend $40 million thinking about what they might do. They never actually did anything. That is the first point, and all honourable members opposite ought to be reminded of that, particularly those who were not here during the debate earlier.The second point he made clearly was that the $40 million was spent on developing Synroc. Then the member for Bonython said, `Thats okay, but we are not allowed to use it in Australia. We will develop it, but that is for someone else—not in my backyard. It has got to be in another country. We do not care where, as long as it is not in Australia.The opposition, having failed to learn from 13 years in government, has no policy today. There was absolutely nothing put forward in the debate today to tell us what we might do. So all we get is this scaremongering and, frankly, I think it is damned irresponsible the way the Labor Party put all this up.

291,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr ANDERSON","4K4","(Gwydir—","NP","Minister for Primary Industries and Energy)",2039,"—I move:That the bill be now read a second time.This dairy produce levy bill has two purposes. Firstly, this bill, in conjunction with the Australian Animal Health Council (Live&hyphen;Stock Industries) Funding Amendment Bill 1997, will establish a statutory levy to fund the dairy industrys contribution to the Australian Animal Health Council Ltd. Secondly, this bill will double the maximum research levy rate specified in the Dairy Produce Levy (No. 1) Act 1986.The Australian Animal Health Council Ltd, or AAHC for short, has been established as Australias peak animal health body. Its mission is to ensure that Australias animal health service system is capable of maintaining acceptable national animal health standards which meet both consumer needs and market requirements in domestic and international markets.AAHC is jointly owned and funded by the Commonwealth, state governments, the Northern Territory government and the peak representative bodies of Australias livestock industries, including the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation. To date, the dairy industrys contribution to AAHC has been met from surplus moneys paid to the Dairy Research and Development Corporation upon cessation of the exotic animal disease program and supplemented by a payment from the Australian Dairy Corporation.The peak industry body, the Australian Dairy Industry Council, has sought the establishment of a levy mechanism as a transparent means of meeting the industrys funding commitment to the AAHC, as currently occurs with Australias other livestock industries. The levy would be imposed in the same manner as other dairy industry levies, that is, on the milk fat and protein content of an individual producers milk supply.The need to increase the maximum research levy rate has arisen because the current operational research levy rate, which partially funds the activities of the Dairy Research and Development Corporation, is very close to the legislated maximum rate. The present situation provides very little scope for further increases and may significantly curtail the ability of the Dairy Research and Development Corporation to respond to the needs of the industry in the near future.I would point out that a doubling of the maximum research levy will not automatically lead to a rise in the actual research levy rate paid by producers. Rather, it will provide scope for the dairy industry to seek government approval for an increase in the actual levy rate, as the need arises. The increase in the maximum research levy rate has the full support of the Australian Dairy Industry Council.The dairy industry has enjoyed significant growth in recent years, with milk production in 1996&hyphen;97 expected to pass nine billion litres for the first time on record. Around half of this production will be exported with the value of exports expected to be about $1.8 billion. These amendments will enhance the capacity of the dairy industry to undertake animal health and research and development activities which, in turn, will contribute to further industry growth and improved competitiveness in domestic and international markets. I commend the bill to honourable members and hand over the explanatory memoranda.Debate (on motion by Dr Theophanous ) adjourned.","N/A","DAIRY PRODUCE LEVY (No. 1) AMENDMENT BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

293,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr PROSSER","RI4","(Forrest—","LP","Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs)",2040,"—I move:That the bill be now read a second time.The purpose of this bill is to amend the Excise Tariff Act 1921 (the Tariff Act) to ensure the continuing excisability of all beverages which contain distilled alcohol, including spirits, regardless of their alcohol content.Under item 2 of the schedule to the Tariff Act, `spirituous beverages are subject to duties of excise, which are calculated at a dollar amount per litre of alcohol in each beverage. The term was introduced into the Tariff Act in 1985 with the intention of making excisable any beverage that contained a spirit. Since that time, all such beverages have been treated as excisable regardless of their alcohol content, including beverages whose alcohol content ranges from five per cent to nine per cent, for example, the rum and cola mixer drinks.In November 1994 Carlton and United Breweries, CUB, commenced the manufacture of the product known as `Subzero Alcoholic Soda which had an alcohol content of approximately 5.5 per cent. The Australian Customs Service, the ACS, considered `Subzero excisable under subitem 2(H) of the schedule to the Tariff Act as a spirituous beverage. CUB appealed the decision of the ACS to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the AAT.On 7 June 1996 the AAT determined that the production of `Subzero, with such a low alcohol content by volume, could not be described as spirituous and was therefore not excisable under subitem 2(H). The decision was based on what the AAT considered is commonly regarded as the definition of `spirit in the community, which is a strong alcoholic liquor usually containing not less than 37 per cent alcohol by volume. The ACS is appealing this decision to the Federal Court.Since the AAT decision, CUB has ceased manufacturing `Subzero using alcohol derived by distillation. However, there are several other companies—UDA, Remy Australia, Swift and Moore and Angove—who manufacture beverages of low alcohol content which are based on, for example, brandy or whisky. The ACS has continued to impose excise duty under subitem 2(H) on these beverages as they are considered by the ACS to be spirituous beverages. The payments of excise duty by these other manufacturers are being made under deposit in accordance with section 154 of the Excise Act 1901 on the basis that, since the AAT `Subzero decision, these manufacturers allege that these beverages are no longer excisable.Prior to this decision, there was no dispute with manufacturers of the low alcohol beverages using distilled alcohol as to their excisability nor to their proper classification to subitem 2(H) of the schedule to the Tariff Act.In order to ensure the continuing excisability of all beverages containing distilled alcohol, it is proposed to amend the Tariff Act to:(i) delete all references to `spirituous beverages in the schedule and item 2 (item 1 of schedule 1 refers); and(ii) clarify that excise liability is imposed upon all beverages which contain distilled alcohol (new subitem 2(H), item 2 of schedule 1 refers).The combination of these amendments will remove any connotation as to the strength that an alcoholic beverage must be before it will be excisable. All such beverages will continue to be excisable regardless of their alcohol content and the excise duty will be calculated according to the alcohol content of the beverages.It is also proposed that the amendments will take effect on and from 3 February 1996. The effect of the retrospective commencement date of the amendments will be to extinguish all rights of appeal to the AAT in relation to the excisability of low alcohol beverages and all rights to refunds of excise duty in respect of such beverages. The commencement of the amendments on this date is considered justifiable on the following grounds:(a) As previously referred to, the intention of the term `spirituous beverages was to make excisable any beverage that contained a spirit and there had never been any dispute as to this intention prior to the `Subzero case. It is considered that the amendments are not altering the law with respect to alcoholic beverages as it stood at the time of the `Subzero decision but are merely clarifying what was the status quo. It is therefore considered appropriate that the amendments commence on 3 February 1996 to remove the technical loophole which was uncovered in the Tariff Act by that decision which this amending legislation is now removing.(b) The commencement of the amendments on 3 February 1996 would not require the retrospective recovery of any excise duty from the manufacturers of the alcoholic beverages. The excise duty has continued to be paid by the manufacturers, under deposit, and the 3 February 1996 commencement would protect the government against all claims for recovery of this duty. If the amendments do not commence on 3 February 1996, however, the government might be liable to pay $12.6 million in refunds of excise duty if the Federal Court confirms the AAT decision in favour of CUB. Given that the products manufactured by these companies have been sold duty paid, such a favourable decision to the companies would represent a windfall gain to them, with little chance that it would be returned to the consumers of the product.The proposed amendments, including their financial impact, are outlined in greater detail in the explanatory memorandum. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.Debate (on motion by Dr Theophanous ) adjourned.","N/A","EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This legislation is an important part of the quality assurance process. It is a continu ation of the scheme that was introduced by the former government as a result of the unfortunate fact that 15,000 or so overseas students had to be bailed out by the taxpayers after their ELICOS colleges had gone under.The original legislation counted every student equally for the purposes of the registration charge. This amendment specifies that students doing courses 26 weeks or less will only count for half that value for the purposes of the registration charges. It acknowledges the large number of students doing short courses. I suppose the amendment means that the scheme can be rendered analogous to the purchase of motor car insurance: we are not only providing a discount for fleet buyers but also, in a sense, providing a discount for low mileage.The problem with the original piece of legislation was brought to the attention of the government by the industry associations, by the opposition, by the Australian Democrats and by the Greens. As a result, this amendment has gone through the Senate and it has now come before the House. May I say that the process by which this was achieved in the Senate is an example of how a responsible upper house can improve legislation.

312,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr TANNER","YU5","(Melbourne)","ALP","N/A",2043,"—Further to the comments of the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), I would just like to add with respect to the abolition of the accelerated depreciation provisions regarding Australian ships that this is part of a broader attack on Australias maritime industry by this government and it is particularly inappropriate when you consider the availability of accelerated depreciation for a range of other equipment, particularly in the agricultural and mining sectors.There are two key points that I would like to make in this debate on this issue. The first is that, almost without exception, the countries that Australia competes with in the maritime industry support their industries in some form or other with provisions such as accelerated depreciation, tax rebates for their seafarers and other initiatives. This is widespread throughout the world. It is not a level playing field. The situation in this industry is that virtually all of the players substantially subsidise their shipping industries.Australia has little hope of being able to be a significant player in the maritime industry without such supports. The former government put these supports in place, and not at huge cost—significant contributions but not at enormous cost to the budget—and without those supports the Australian shipping industry is likely to dwindle fairly rapidly into virtually nothing. It is something that suits the ideological orientation of this government, which essentially sees transport as nothing more than a cost, that it is a cost to miners and farmers and that it is not an industry of importance in its own right. Yet, in areas like aviation and the maritime industry, transport delivers substantial export dollars, improves our balance of payments situation and, of course, provides skilled and well&hyphen;paid jobs for Australians.If this provision is passed by this parliament, it will ensure the further export of Australian jobs and the further incursion of flags of convenience shipping into Australia with all of the threats that that imposes, particularly to our marine environment, and it will ensure that we have a reduction in our overall trading situation.Australia is the fifth biggest maritime nation on earth. In terms of volume carried per kilometre, Australia is the fifth largest market for shipping in the world. A situation where something like 97 per cent of that market is filled by foreign shipping is something that I do not think should be allowed to continue, yet this government clearly wants to see it at 100 per cent.The second point that I would make with respect to this provision is that, when you actually look at the various accelerated depreciation provisions that are available in other sectors, the hypocrisy of the governments position becomes very apparent. When you look at things like bulldozers, crop&hyphen;dusters, tractors, a whole range of agricultural equipment—and I am sure the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) knows this only too well because of his background—you see that accelerated depreciation of 20 per cent, which is what the former shipping provision was, up to as high as 40 per cent for things like crop&hyphen;dusters is almost universal across a wide range of high cost major capital equipment in agricultural and pastoral industries.One of the things this proposal exposes is that this government does not mind subsidies and does not mind a bit of assistance here and there provided it is to their mates. When it is for industries that they do not approve of, when it is for industries that they are ideologically opposed to, they then say, `No, you cannot have any assistance, even when there is a strong case for it because of the nature of the international marketplace where there is widespread assistance amongst our competitors.This is a very stark contrast: a government that is prepared to have accelerated depreciation for the industries where it draws a lot of its political support from but for those where it does not see itself as politically favoured—even though they are just as important to Australias overall economic position—it says, `No, we will get rid of that support. We do not want to have anything to do with it.The Australian community, the Australian maritime industry, the Australian shipbuilding industry and the various industries associated with the provision of maritime services will be the losers. It will not just be the Maritime Union of Australia and the seafarers, which the government hates. It will not just be those people and their jobs that are affected. There will be a range of flow&hyphen;on effects as a result of the attacks on the maritime industry, of which this abolition of accelerated depreciation is but one part. Those flow&hyphen;on effects will spread right through a variety of industries and a variety of economic opportunities and will ultimately have a negative impact on our balance of payments.","N/A","TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 4) 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Division 13A concerns the determination of the market value of shares involved in this amendment.There has been some concern around the place—amongst professionals anyway—that the changes will force many taxpayers to retrospectively alter the methods of calculation they currently use to value these shares. That will involve, where it comes about, a considerable amount of inconvenience but, more importantly, will impose compliance costs on those taxpayers which might have been possible to avoid had the amendments been more sympathetically drafted.Items 1 to 7 agreed to.Schedule 3, item 8.","N/A","TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 4) 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We see no sense or rationale for reducing the invitation threshold for employee share schemes from 75 per cent to 66 per cent. This might be seen as a change of a small proportion, but it is still a significant proportion. To move to a situation where, hypothetically, one-third of employees could be excluded from the share offer is, I believe, a step in the wrong direction.We have had no clear explanation as yet from the government as to why it is proposing in item 8 of schedule 3 the move from 75 per cent to 66 per cent. The government should explain to the House the rationale that the government and the cabinet are advancing. We believe these share schemes should be as broad based and as inclusive as possible. Moving from 75 per cent to 66 per cent is a step in the opposite direction, and for that reason it is opposed by the Australian Labor Party.","N/A","TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 4) 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

322,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr ROCHER","ZI4","(Curtin)","IND","N/A",2048,"—Whilst we are dealing with schedules 4 and 5 together and the governments amendments to them, I will try to break up my remarks a little to give the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) an opportunity, if he wishes to take it, to respond to some concerns I have with the detail. They are not only my concerns, I might add; they are also those expressed by the Taxation Institute of Australia and the Corporate Taxpayers Association.They have told me that they do not accept the view, when talking about schedule 4, major underlining interests, that the concept of backdating from the date of an unusual trade has always been part of the framework of section 160ZZS or its administration. I did touch on that in my speech in the second reading debate and I referred to an income tax ruling by the commissioner. I have already made that point, but I do not think, in summing up the second reading debate, that it was addressed. The parliamentary secretary may be able to comment on that.Furthermore, the two bodies to which I have already referred are not of a mind to accept that it is appropriate for schedule 4 to specify dates by which underlying ownership analysis should be completed to impose substantial sanction where this does not otherwise occur. They are also very toey about the reservation being provided at the discretion of the Commissioner of Taxation to override the one per cent notional shareholder test. Furthermore, they make the point more than adequately that the definitions of abnormal trading are excessively broad. I might go into that in a little detail, depending on the way this debate goes. The TIA and the Corporate Taxpayers Association support the use of `reasonable approximation testing as at a date proximate to 20 September 1985 and similar flexibility, in their view, should be allowed in respect of subsequent testing dates.Still on schedule 4, perhaps I could refer to the transitional provisions as spelt out in section 160ZZSA. These appear to be circular to say the least. Section 160ZZSA(1)(b) seems to exclude the new regime whenever section 160ZZS(1) has been attracted prior to 20 January 1997. But subsequent provisions appear to proceed on a contrary assumption. For example, section 160ZZSC(4) presupposes that the new regime may apply in cases where a prior public ruling imposed a requirement to test and that the test would have been failed prior to 20 January 1997. The intention appears to have been to exclude the new regime only in cases where there has already been an adverse determination under section 160ZZS and that the taxpayers involved have conceded that it applies. In all other cases, it would appear that it is intended that matters can be dealt with and, if necessary, determined independently by the commissioner under sections 160ZZSC(3) and 160ZZSC(4).The new regime imposes a positive obligation to `make a determination by an examination of its records showing whether majority underlying interests were relevantly held. (Extension of time granted) The drafting presupposes that the determination will yield either a yes or no answer. The reality may well be that such matters remain unclear, notwithstanding all the diligence that can be reasonably required and expected within the period allowed.In those cases, the company may be unable to make any determination. That might be through lack of information or merely uncertainty concerning the effect of the provision. In short, it is inappropriate to assume in such cases that the company should make an adverse determination. The failure to make a determination leads to not inconsequential outcomes for the taxpayer.The purpose or effect of requiring by examination of its records is worthy of some further consideration and clarification. For example, is the intention that the basis for determination be limited to an examination of corporate records and, if so, when? That sort of limitation may well be inappropriate. Is the intention that there be no right or obligation to go beyond records? I would like to quote direct from written information I have from the Taxation Institute of Australia. They say:Where the company fails duly to make a determination within the time allowed, the test is effectively deemed to have been failed at the commencement of the test period. The penalties or consequences which flow from this will often be inappropriate. Thus (for example) if a company fails to make a determination as at 20 January 1997, it is deemed to have acquired the asset on 20 September 1985 for a consideration equal to the market value on that date. That would be entirely inappropriate if the failure arises because the company is unable to make the determination, or fails to do so because it is not aware of an abnormal trading triggering event. It would also lead to entirely inappropriate results if, for example, the test had clearly been satisfied up to December 1985 (and had appreciated in value to that time) but it was unclear whether or not it was satisfied thereafter. The risk of such an outcome could be worse than any risk of application of Sec.160ZZS(1). It is also not in accord with the principle espoused in the Budget Papers which was that the amendments would defer the date at which assets lose their pre&hyphen;CGT status from the date when the majority underlying ownership changed to the time when the test of underlying ownership is required to be conducted.The institute goes on:The determination must be made within the `prescribed period which is defined as a period generally of 6 months duration. This period may well prove to be insufficient and unworkable.Where an adverse determination is made at 20 January 1997, the consequences may depend on whether or not the entity was `required before 20 January 1997 under a ruling to apply the tests under Sec.160ZZS . . . (3) and (4). Presumably the rulings to which this refers are IT2530 and IT2361. In cases where such rulings required that a test be made, Subsec.(4) should make it clear that the `abnormal trading or other events triggering the need to test supply the determination time.The institute goes on to demonstrate that the definitions of `abnormal trading have the very real potential to operate in circumstances which rulings 2530 and 2361 would not have been regarded as requiring that the test be made and, as a consequence, it may give rise to considerable uncertainty.

Of course, that is a judgment which has to be made in these matters.","N/A","TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 4) 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[13]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
324,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr ROCHER","ZI4","(Curtin)","IND","N/A",2049,"—I thank the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles). I am not sure whether he is aware of the detail of the TIAs concern, but the definition of `abnormal trading does bear looking at. I do not think it is just a matter for judgment; I think it is a matter of equity and perhaps even of this element of the legislation operating as intended. The definition of `abnormal trading, as proposed, might lead to it being contended that the only trading which can qualify as normal trading is trading which occurs on a stock exchange and then only if the volume is within a very narrow range.Should that be the case, the allotment of shares, however small, might be regarded as requiring that a test be made. That gets to the point, which the parliamentary secretary, I am sure, will be interested in, that allotments under employee share plans—also referred to in another schedule in this legislation—or dividend reinvestment plans might trigger these provisions. Allotment of shares, on the basis that it was abnormal, or that they might trigger the provision that it was abnormal, or on the basis that involves five per cent of the shares—although it does not alter the underlying interests at all—is part of the problem.The width of the definitions for abnormal trading, read in conjunction with the consequences of failure to make a determination, make further inappropriate results quite likely. The determination, in fact, might not be made because the company is simply unaware of facts subsequently contended to constitute abnormal trade. That is where you get into problems, once again, with giving the commissioner discretion. The interplay—I noted the assurance of the parliamentary secretary and for which I am grateful—of ITs 2530 and 2361 is presently constituted.The end result is that a failure to make a determination results in a failure of the tests under 160ZZS. I see that that may not be in the mind of the parliamentary secretary and, therefore, the government and is a matter of concern. I do not know if the parliamentary secretary wants to answer that or if I could go on to something slightly relevant, but in the same vein.","N/A","TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 4) 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[14]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

That strikes me as being totally inappropriate in light of the history—some of which I have touched on—referring to the commissioners rulings under present legislation. The special rules for holdings of less than one per cent are intended to provide the basis on which the rules are saved from being unworkable.They also provide the major criteria on which the new regime can be said to assist corporates. This section, 160ZZSQ, effectively empowers the commissioner to withdraw these features while leaving in place the various aspects of the legislation which have the effect of making changes in policy applied to the section which are adverse to taxpayers. The TIA says, in this context, that the provisions obviate the need to trace through com plying superannuation funds. It would be preferable if these provisions were excluded to foreign superannuation funds and not non-complying funds. (Extension of time granted) This will conclude my remarks under schedule 4, unless the parliamentary secretary in response raises something worthy of further comment.The need for rulings in respect of which such rulings are necessary if the new regime is to have prospects of operating fairly are of interest. For example, there are a number of provisions which provided for the exercise of discretions on the part of the commissioner—some of which I have referred to—and I would refer the parliamentary secretary to sections 160ZZSA3B, 160ZZSC(2) and 160ZZSD(2) in addition to 160ZZSQ. It was previously understood by the TIA that rulings would be made available in relation to the exercise of various discretions as long ago as last December. That understanding was arrived at last December.They seem to be under the impression that the rulings would specifically address matters such as the used dates reasonably approximate to 20 September 1985 and application of the old regime recognising a safe harbour where past events are not captured by the new rules. They and I urge that drafts of these rulings be made available for comment as a matter of priority and preferably while the legislation is still before the parliament, albeit the Senate.","N/A","TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 4) 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[14]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

My interest in schedule 5 arises out of the length and complexity of the bill. There are 26 pages dealing with the small business capital gains tax rollover concession. I would say that the complexity has in very considerable measure subverted the governments policy intentions in this area.The major reason for the length and complexity of the legislation seems to be a perceived need to quarantine goodwill from the other assets of a taxpayers business—in turn, to prevent small businesses from rolling over a capital gain from the disposal of goodwill into a non&hyphen;goodwill replacement asset. This seems to be because there is a fear that operators might try to convert a capital gain—for example, a building development—and shift it into a business with excess goodwill and then claim the partial goodwill exemption for that goodwill.If someone sets out to do that, the general anti-avoidance provisions of part 4A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 would undoubtedly apply. This is an example of how the provisions have been made unduly complex by the inclusion of unnecessary words. The Taxation Institute of Australia, on this matter, had this to say:The problem is that the Bill now leaves the genuine entrepreneurs with no effective rollover relief. For example, someone who has built up a business from nothing, so that the assets of the business will be predominantly goodwill, and who wants to attempt to turn around a moribund business where the goodwill may be worth very little, will be locked out of the concession.It is unfortunate that with the introduction of the new rollover provision, the opportunity was not taken to align it and the partial goodwill exemption provision. What policy reason can there be for the different thresholds and differing rules about associated businesses.Further, there are a number of conditions limiting the value of proposed rollover to businesses which will ultimately discourage business from seeking to make use of it. Why, for example, must current and prior year losses be first offset?Why indeed. That is not a general requirement for other rollover provisions, and its reason for inclusion in these provisions is obscure to say the least.","N/A","TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 4) 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[18]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

I think that comment came out on Tuesday, 4 March of this week in an article which responded to the fine print of the so-called CGT rollover relief. Mark Abernethy says:Central to Mr Hayes concern is the exclusionary nature of the CGT relief. On the surface, the relief seemed open to sole traders, partnerships, companies and trusts.But a closer reading of the bill showed the majority of Australias more substantial small businesses would not be eligible.Our response to that is that the provisions that apply are regardless of the structure used to run a small business.For a sole trader in a partnership, the rollover relief is available at the individual level. For a company, the rollover relief is available at the company level. For a trust, the rollover relief is available at the trustee level. This treatment merely reflects the governments announcement that rollover relief will apply to a direct interest in an asset. With regard to partnerships, if one partner buys out another partner in a two&hyphen;person partnership, the selling partner can get the rollover relief if the partner buys a new business, either as a partner in a new partnership or as a sole trader.","N/A","TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 4) 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[19]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
336,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr LATHAM","K26","(Werriwa)","ALP","N/A",2052,"—The point that has been doubted by the Society of CPAs on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) is whether the government is standing by its $215 million costing. This was also doubted, in very effective terms, by the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) in his second reading contribution earlier in the debate. If the government is standing by that amount—if that is the costing and the amount of relief to be provided—can it also provide a guarantee to the House in terms of the integrity of the tax system?It is my understanding that Treasury officials have advised the government of their concerns about the way in which some of these provisions might be open to abuse and tax minimisation. I believe it is always very important in a debate looking at a new form of tax concession to consider the flip side—a flip side that the average working PAYE taxpayer is always concerned about; that is, that the corporate sector in Australia is not being opened up for the possibility of shonky practice and that the government is standing as guardian of the integrity of the tax system. That is a very important guarantee for the government to provide in this debate, particularly when a number of parliamentarians have been made aware of concerns expressed within the bureaucracy. I would ask the parliamentary secretary if he could clarify those two matters. Does the government stand by the $215 million costing after the amendments that have been carried earlier and the public critique that has been offered by a number of organisations? And, if it is standing by the $215 million, does it also offer a guarantee to the House in terms of the integrity of the Australian taxation system?","N/A","TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 4) 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[20]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I am pleased to see, Mr Deputy Speaker Reid, that you are in the chair because, before the question time break, we actually had the effect of inducing you into the House. What do we see here now when we are debating the bounties legislation, which is going to see jobs lost in all sorts of regions around the country? Not one government backbencher in the place; not one. The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), who is at the table, is pointing to himself. He has to be here. The member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) reckons he has had the effect of changing your decision, but where is the member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes)? She has not come in in all of this debate.The member for Bendigo is prepared to come into this chamber and at least stand up for what he thinks he has done—not very effectively—but the member for Kingston is still not here. Let me remind the House of what she said. Yesterday she urged the government to be more critical of the advice it received in preparing its second budget and that cuts to industry assistance in last years budget had already hurt the state. That, indeed they have. This is one of those cuts. This is a cut to the book bounty. It has cost 300 jobs—and the minister laughs at it—at Griffin Press alone because of their inability to plan and their inability to deal with a secure investment environment because this government unilaterally cut the bounty from under their feet.The fact is—and it is important because you are in the chair, Mr Deputy Speaker—that these issues of cutting the bounty were always attempted and put up to us by Treasury. But as a government we resisted them. There were attempts to reduce these measures in the so&hyphen;called interests of the level playing field—which does not exist. We all want to get there but we are not there now. What we have is a government proposing unilateral disarmament, flying in the face of what is happening in the rest of the world and expecting our industry to be able to cope. The simple reality is that these firms could compete with overseas countries if those overseas countries did not have support and assistance. That is the truth. They are world competitive. But what they cannot do is compete and get into markets that are restricted to them in those countries.I can remember the circumstances in relation to book publishing where people in this country would lament every time they picked up a new publication which said `Printed in Singapore—printed somewhere else, printed everywhere except Australia. Australians are some of the most avid readers in the world, yet we could not get a book publishing industry in this country until Labor introduced a plan for the book industry. It did so by support through research and development initiatives as well as the book bounty—the bounty to level the playing field, the R&D to get them to invest in state&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;art technology.But these are programs that this government has come in and slashed, regardless of the consequences. It believes it has got to pursue the budget bottom line rather than consider the consequences. It has established a Productivity Commission, but it will not give it legislative teeth to have regard to the impact on regional economies or to have regard to what our trading partners are doing when it comes to their level of assistance and support.We say that has to change. The member for Bendigo, who is in the chair, has recognised it has to change. It is just that he is impotent in getting that change. He says he has taken representations to the minister. If you have taken representations and been successful to date, as you claim, Mr Deputy Speaker, take some more submissions—because the industry is telling you. If you go and visit Maryborough, they will tell you they want this decision restored, that they want it to the end of next year—and Labor supports the extra six months.But it is also entitled to an inquiry that has regard to what is happening in the rest of the world, that has regard to how an industry can continue to position itself. If there is any commitment to regional development, to the people of Maryborough and the people of Adelaide who depend on this industry for jobs, support our amendment. I call on the member for Bendigo, when he is out of the chair, and the member for Kingston to come in and vote with us.

343,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr MARTIN FERGUSON","LS4","(Batman)","ALP","N/A",2054,"—In addressing the bounty legislation this afternoon I am fearful that tomorrows press in Bendigo will basically have a front page story going to the failure of the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) to vote for local electorate jobs. I am really concerned about this because it is an important issue to have the front page of the local papers in Bendigo tomorrow with a banner across the front `Reid votes against Bendigo electorate jobs. That is what it is really about: will the member for Bendigo vote for local jobs or will he walk away from his responsibilities?The proposition that we are in support of is very simple: the government proposes that the book bounty be abolished from 1 July rather than 20 August. So far as we are concerned, that is six months short of the original expiry date established by the Australian Labor Party. That expiry date was established in consultation with local industry in places such as Maryborough, South Australia and Queensland. It is about saying to those local employers, `If you are prepared to give it a go, then we are prepared to give you a go. We are basically saying that we are prepared to provide the necessary assistance to ensure that you are capable of growing on the export front and as part and parcel of that export growth, capable of providing additional jobs in areas of high need.It is not just places such as Bendigo that we are talking about. We are also talking about Queensland. Let us have a look at some of the high unemployment levels that currently exist in Queensland. I know the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) is not too interested in these facts. As at January 1997 what was unemployment in the north&hyphen;west of Queensland? It was 10.6 per cent. In the Rockhampton area it was 11.6 per cent and in Far North Queensland around Cairns it was 8.9 per cent—all above the national average. That is why I put it to the House that it is wrong to abolish these industry bounties, especially for the state of Queensland, the ministers home state. The abolition of these industry bounties will take Australia in the opposite direction from what is needed for its development at the moment. I suggest that, if this legislation is passed, Queensland businesses—and it will be on the head of the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism—will lose nearly $7 million.Mr Prosser interjecting —","N/A","BOUNTY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

He has not done a thing to try to create an environment for investment and jobs growth in Australia.In Queensland we are talking about a loss of $7 million a year in assistance from the federal government. Do you know what it means for businesses in Queensland? Some 251 Queensland businesses benefited from the industry bounty scheme in the last financial year, not an insignificant number when you are talking about high unemployment—such as in Rockhampton—of the order of 11.6 per cent. These are secondary industries that are needed to further develop that state. They are needed to broaden its industrial base. They are needed in places such as Townsville, Cairns and Rockhampton.I am waiting to see how the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), how the member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch) and how the member for Capricornia (Mr Marek) vote on this amendment. They have a lot to say locally, but when they get to Canberra it is almost as if they have their feet tied together when it comes to standing up for their local electorates. They go missing in action. That is what it is about: they are not prepared to stand and fight for a decent industry policy that assists in creating job opportunities in their local regions.They are the big losers—not only with respect to the bounty legislation but they have already lost on the closure of the CES offices; and they have lost as a result of the increase in HECS payments and with respect to changes in Telstra and the loss of local jobs in the service centres.

I simply make the point that you were missing in action in New York last year when it was time for standing up for the book publishing industry. We would hope that you would actually exercise a vote in favour of the people of Maryborough in your electorate, a quarter of the work force of which town depends on this book bounty. It is an industry that did not exist before Labor introduced the book bounty, an industry where, if you ever wanted to read a book in this country, you opened the first page and found that it was printed in some overseas country.The fact of the matter is this was an uncompetitive country and it could not get into the game because all the other countries were supporting their book publishing industry. Labor introduced a two-pronged attack: it said, `Invest in the technology and well give you tax deductions for it. As a government they have wiped out the tax deductions despite the fact they went to the last election promising to keep them. Broken promise, bad policy—two bad hits.But then we also had the book bounty, which we were always being told we had to get rid of. The member for Bendigo made reference to this earlier—that Labor trotted out a plan to get rid of the book bounty itself. It is true that the bureaucrats put that forward, but we opposed it. It did not come and it did not get passed. If it had have been passed, why would we be debating the issue today? So for you to come in and say that we voted down the books bounty back in 1993 is just plain wrong because, if it were true, we would not be debating this issue now.Let us understand that the only people who put book publishing on the map in this country were Labor: Labor through the books bounty, Labor through industry support. Labor has seen the growth of this industry, an industry which has seen a doubling of exports in the space of time in which it has been in place, an industry which previously saw non&hyphen;existent jobs growth. There has been 200 per cent export growth over the past 12 years that this plan has been in place under Labor, and it has taken them six months to abolish it, despite the fact they told no-one during the election campaign they would do it.I would have liked to have seen Deputy Speaker Reid out campaigning in Maryborough saying, `Have we got a plan for you when we get into government. We are going to get rid of the books bounty, which is going to wipe out a quarter of the work force in Maryborough. That would have been a great campaign! But he did not say that, of course; he said quite the opposite. He said, `Were going to keep it, and then he comes along and is part of the decision to abolish it. It is a disgrace.We have the member for Kingston shedding crocodile tears in todays Adelaide Advertiser saying, `Cuts to industry assistance in last years budget already hurt the state, but will she be in the House today? She has not attended except to vote, and then she voted the wrong way. She is inconsistent the position she talks about in the press and inconsistent in representing her constituents in this chamber.The facts of the matter are that Labor is the only party that has been prepared to support the book publishing industry in this country and it is the coalition which has come along as the new vandals—wreck the industry, wreck regions and put them at the mercy of the international marketplace where there is no such thing as a level playing field.","N/A","BOUNTY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/debate.sub1/speech[5]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

I kept hearing the shadow minister carrying on about your decentralised electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker, and the electorate of Kingston in South Australia, which is quite distant from all the major markets of Melbourne and Sydney. Quite clearly, book producers and book printers have to transport large quantities of paper to their premises and, of course, redistribute those books and they use road transport.The first thing that the Keating government did was put a special tax on that transport. The man is so dull that he does not think transport affects the efficiency of industries throughout Australia. He is winding his finger around saying it does not matter. The problem is that I think you believe that transport has no effect on Australian industry. It has been said by some of your colleagues on occasions that it represents about one dollar in every seven that Australians are obliged to spend. You put a substantial tax on it after the election where you promised no tax increases at all.Do not come in here with your arguments about consistency. I used to say of the Democrats that you cannot buy them, you can only rent them by the hour.

366,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr CREAN","DT4","(Hotham)","ALP","N/A",2058,"—I thought we were actually going to get something of an explanation from the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), but as always he is quick to cut the programs and never explain. We now have the com puter bounty. The coalition government made a core promise during the election to retain the computer bounty. This promise was clearly made because it was something that the Labor Party committed to do and committed to keep running until the year 2000.What did they do in their first budget? They broke that promise comprehensively. Now this is one of the areas that has not yet seen a reversal of form. This area plus the machine tools and robots areas have not got any relief or respite yet. Books and ships have, but not enough, and computers and machine tools and robots have not.Where, might we ask, is the consistency in that position? Do you know what the consistency is, Mr Deputy Speaker? There has been a more effective lobbying campaign run to date by the shipbuilders and book publishers in this country than there has been by the computer and machine tools and robots industries. We will still keep pursuing their interests because certainty has been taken from them.Understand that you have a computer industry in this country which has invested massively in research and development, massively in exports, massively in production and we have seen huge growth in all of those areas of activity. For example, in the last five years exports of information technology related products have trebled in this country. That has occurred because there was a certain regime introduced by Labor—a regime that was built around the partnerships for development program and included the computer bounty and the R&D concessions.Under the partnerships for development program there was a requirement for firms entering into the program to commit to levels of growth in production, R&D and exports. All of those targets and commitments have been met until now. Why will they not be met now? Because the government deceived this industry during the last election by promising to retain the bounty. It wiped it out—3&half; years in one fell swoop. It also reduced the tax deductibility from 150 per cent to 125 per cent with the minister saying, `You should be thankful because it could have gone to 100 per cent. His defence was, `I have really saved you because the cuts could have been worse.This level of growth would not have occurred had it not been for the plan and the certainty introduced by Labor. The simple fact of the matter is that the manufacturing industry has grown in this country. We have seen huge growth in the exports of certain key industries—the information technology industry being amongst them—but it only happened because there was a plan behind those industries. What does the industry itself have to say about the governments decision? Mr Neville Roach, the Managing Director of Fujitsu, wrote to us saying:Both the present government and its predecessor supported the extension of the computer bounty as recently as 1995. This bipartisan support only came after a long and exhaustive period of consultation between the industry and government. Both recognised that the bounty is not a subsidy but rather a compensation to local manufacturers for additional component cost and they result from other decisions that the government had taken.N/AThis was addressing market failure. This was recognising that, if the industry was to grow, it had to have this market failure addressed. The minister is on record as saying that he recognises the need to intervene where there is market failure. Well, he recognises the need to intervene, but he has cut away the intervention. Some intervention! You recognise the problem, but you are not prepared to address the cure. It is no wonder you have had criticism from this industry.We believe this is also an area that has to be reversed. The government has to return to the commitment they made during the election and support the local information technology industry. We will be persisting with this measure to get that reversal. (Extension of time granted)What we have got is the circumstance in which there is no commitment from the minister to support an industry, though it was his promise, his policy. He went to the last election saying it. No doubt he went to his leader and said, `This is a vital area to secure because there are lots of employees in the manufacturing sector in computers, and weve got to keep them onside. We dont want to frighten anyone during the election cam paign. The minister went and sold the promise. He put it out in public terms in a document and said, `We will keep the computer bounty. Do you deny that, Minister? I know you will not get up and speak in this debate, because your position is indefensible.Mr Moore interjecting —","N/A","BOUNTY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/debate.sub1/speech[7]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

This is the person who said, `Were going to do it differently to Labor. I tell you what: the commitments we made in terms of industry support were honoured. That is the reason why the manufacturing industry in this country had started to grow and had started to contribute.The minister might be interested in looking at todays national accounts figures because they address the question of production over the last quarter. The manufacturing sector has seen a 2.6 per cent reduction in outputs. That has occurred because of the policies that you put in place as a result of the budget.There is no point saying to the industry, as the member for OConnor (Mr Tuckey) would have us believe, that you have got interest rates down or you have done these other things if in fact you are putting them out of the game. There is no way they will stay in it. If you are undermining these industries by stripping away the mechanisms by which their exports have grown, then what you are doing is really denying this country the opportunity for significant, huge advances.The fact of the matter is that the minister has made a commitment. The only target the government has set, I might add, is a target of 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing. But every time the minister has been asked in this place to tell us what his strategy is to get there, he has not done it. He has not even asked his department to produce a strategy for it. How are you going to achieve it when, in one quarter alone, you have had a decline in manufacturing production by a massive 2.6 per cent? You come into this place and claim that everything is doing well in terms of the national accounts and that growth is on course, but growth is going down and manufacturing production has gone into the negative.","N/A","BOUNTY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/debate.sub1/speech[7]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

Manufacturing production has gone down by 2.6 per cent in the last quarter. It is no coincidence that that reduction has occurred against the backdrop of the massive cuts to industry programs.It is no wonder the member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes) is telling you through todays Adelaide Advertiser that the cuts to industry assistance in last years budget have already hurt her state. They have not only hurt that state; they have hurt the nation—and they have hurt it to the tune of a reduction in manufacturing production.How are you going to get jobs if you have got reductions in production in the manufacturing sector? I ask you that. Where do you think these jobs are going to come from? Unless you have the supportive framework and the certainty that encourages industries to invest and to make the commitment to continue to get into those overseas markets, it simply will not materialise.I believe we have a minister in this chamber who is incapable of getting a message through and incapable of winning an argument in his cabinet. He has fallen for the view that he has to deliver budget cuts at any cost, but the costs are horrendous. They are costs to jobs, they are costs to regions and they are costs to exports.Why would you get rid of a program that saw an increase in exports and an increase in jobs? I thought the priority of this government was twofold—to correct the current account deficit and to increase job opportunities. Here you have a program that did both of those things, and they have axed it—but it is not the only area which has been axed.This is another massive betrayal of Australias manufacturing industry. This is a government that pretends to have the interests of industry at heart but will do nothing for them. This is a government that has been condemned by those same industry groups.

370,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr MARTIN FERGUSON","LS4","(Batman)","ALP","N/A",2060,"—I, like the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), am concerned about what we regard as a blatant decision by the present government to break what I thought was a fairly fundamental promise made by the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) prior to the election just on 12 months ago. I refer to the fact that, during the election campaign—and I am sure the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) was consulted; after all, he is the Prime Ministers number cruncher—the coalition matched Labors commitment to retain the computer bounty to the end of the year 2000.I think that was a fairly important commitment. It was made in good faith, and industry took that commitment on board—as did a lot of workers and their families who depended on that commitment for the purposes of their job security and their ability in the end to look after their families.I know the Prime Minister likes to talk from time to time about the question of security—security at work, security at home, security in the community at large. But the problem is that, since the election, the Prime Minister has decided that your word is not your bond. That is what he has decided. With respect to the computer bounty and their undertaking that it shall prevail until the year 2000, your word is no longer your bond.What does the government say is the justification to achieve so-called savings? As the minister said in his second reading speech, the savings are to be achieved through the termination of the computer bounty with effect from 1 July this year. He then goes on to suggest that these bounty schemes have run their course.I suggest to the House that these bounty schemes have not run their course. I will tell you why: the level of unemployment in Australia suggests that they have not run their course. The problem for the government—and it is walking away from its responsibilities—is that not only is unemployment a major problem at the moment, but it is especially a huge problem in regional Australia and is especially a huge problem for the long-term unemployed.In that context, there is a role for government to involve itself in assisting industry; there is a role for government to involve itself in regional Australia; and there is a role for government to involve itself in trying to push and prod industry. The government needs to encourage industry to invest and to create decent job opportunities—real job opportunities—not half-baked suggestions or proposals as brought forward by the Prime Minister just on a week and a half ago with respect to the work for the dole scheme.If there are any real concerns about these issues, I refer the House to the fact that, in seasonally adjusted terms, the numbers of long-term unemployed rose from 229,500 in December to 232,700 in January. The minister wants the House to accept that the schemes have run their course. I do not accept that the schemes have run their course when you have 232,700 people in Australia who are long-term unemployed. It is interesting that there are now 30,100 more long-term unemployed Australians than in May 1996 when the Howard government began cutting decent labour market programs, including Skillshare, throughout the length and breadth of Australia.These schemes have not run their course. Australian industry expects support. The bounty scheme that prevailed in the computer industry encouraged industry to make investments, because a companys ability to make investments depends on a sense of stability and security. It is on that basis that companies are prepared to make medium- to long-term investment decisions.The coalition had a clear commitment prior to the federal election that the computer bounty scheme would exist through to 2000 and on the basis of that commitment they made decisions. They were prepared to put their money up&hyphen;front for the purposes of investing in Australia, for the purposes of securing export growth and for the purposes of securing for a large number of Australian families a sense of job security.I think it is high time that the minister stood up to the Prime Minister and said in no uncertain terms, `Where I come from in Queensland, the Liberal Party way is to honour your word. Your word is your bond. A commitment to the Australian electorate to make sure that this scheme existed through to 2000 should prevail. We should not break our word. We should ensure that industry continues to have a sense of security and on that basis they can continue to plan their investment opportunities for the future.

407,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr LEE","MG4","(Dobell)","ALP","N/A",2063,"—I will try to make this as brief as possible. These are opposition amendments. Basically, these amendments simply seek to provide for automatic indexation of the income thresholds at which the private health insurance tax rebate cuts out. Reading through the Senate Hansard , there was a bit of confusion about whether our amendments were going to index the value of the tax rebate or whether they would index the income threshold at which the rebates cut out. Everyone who has studied this knows that it is about how we index the income limits. That is why the proposed index is average weekly earnings. I will not dwell on that, but that is the point that these amendments go to.I have two questions, Minister, that I will go through very quickly. One was that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services and Parliamentary Secretary for the Attorney&hyphen;General (Senator Ellison) in the Senate said that one of the reasons the amendments could not be accepted was that there is no provision for them in the forward estimates. I would have expected that the forward estimates are based on a certain number of people having private health insurance. I thought in the past we had spoken about a figure of 35.5 per cent. Given that there are now only 33.2 per cent of people who have private health insurance, I would have thought there is a bit of fat in the forward estimates.Unless there is a sudden jump in the number of people with private health insurance on 1 July, there will be a bit of fat in those forward estimates which would allow, perhaps, the funding of this automatic indexation. If I am wrong, I am happy to tap the mat on that. Perhaps we can deal with that question first.","N/A","PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
408,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Dr WOOLDRIDGE","8E4","(Chisholm—","LP","Minister for Health and Family Services)",2064,"—My understanding is that we are dealing with the best figures we have so far, in the December quarter. We cannot really predict what will happen by the two quarters hence. There is no fat that I am aware of. I am informed that the cost over four years of doing this would be $73 million. While I can see the merit in doing it, what we have attempted to do is simply implement what we promised before the election. Honestly, if I had another $73 million, I would probably be spending it on another area of need in health. I feel we have more than acquitted our undertaking to the Australian community by implementing what we propose to do. I note in passing that similar indexation arrangements were not promised in the Labor Partys election proposal. To the best of my knowledge, there is no fat and I do not have the capacity to make that without offsetting it in the rest of my portfolio—$73 million over four years is a substantial amount to offset.","N/A","PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
409,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr LEE","MG4","(Dobell)","ALP","N/A",2064,"—A brief debating point first, Mr Deputy Speaker. If the minister believes that an extra $73 million could be better spent in other areas of the portfolio rather than in providing tax breaks for private health insurance, I am wonder whether he is willing to now accept the oppositions point that perhaps the whole $1.7 billion could have been better spent in paying for extra operations in public and private hospitals or in other areas of private health care. I do not think I will persuade him on that point, but I thought he left me an opening on that.Finally, concerning the second question I spoke about before, at various times we have been trying to find out what the governments intentions are about the thresholds. I think we have been told that, if at some future time the government wanted to increase these income thresholds, it could do so by introducing legislation and amending the act. At one point I think we were told incorrectly in the Senate that this could be done by regulation, but my understanding is that it will require an amendment to the act and so we would be seeking to know from the minister whether the government is planning to change the thresholds. That is a crucial point. Are you planning to change the thresholds that apply to this Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 1996?","N/A","PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

There are no plans to increase the thresholds at this stage. It does not mean we would not do it; it means that we really have, only in the most early stages, started considering the 1997&hyphen;98 budget. I do not say at a future date we will not do it but, like Medicare levy thresholds under the previous government, they were not indexed but they were increased from time to time as a policy decision. We have no plans to do that at the moment. That does not mean we will not do it at some stage in the future.","N/A","PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The minister might remember that, in the debate on these matters previously, I did express concern that at the next budget the government might bring in a proposal to lower the threshold, perhaps from $100,000 for a family down to $80,000 and, in the following budget, down to $60,000. That is why we are seeking to introduce this automatic indexation, so that the real value is maintained in real terms.That is the debating point. I have one question on this issue. It is the same one that we put before.

482,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr KELVIN THOMSON","UK6","(Wills)","ALP","N/A",2069,"—This schedule relates to the machine tools and robotics bounty, which has been described by the Metal Trades Industry Association as fundamental to the whole manufacturing sector, in that it supplies enabling technologies to most other sectors and is an important source of innovation and skills. As they point out, the decision made in last years budget to terminate the machine tools and robotics bounty will result in the cessation of an extremely successful industry program.The bounty has been instrumental in the growth of a high-technology export oriented industry. It has provided cash flow, and the MTIA say that over the past 10 years the machine tools and robotics industry has produced an export growth rate of 20 per cent per annum. The year before it generated $117 million in sales and $80 million in exports, and it paid $12 million in tax. This year, the MTIA predicts that export sales are likely to be closer to $130 million. By comparison, the cost of the bounty to the government or the taxpayer was only $2 million in 1995&hyphen;96. As the MTIA points out, cessation of the bounty will see an immediate reduction in the rate of growth of exports, and they describe that outcome as perverse. And indeed it is. It is counterproductive, because you have a decision taken on the grounds that its objective was eliminating the budget deficit, but you have a reduction in the rate of growth of exports happening here and that will have precisely the opposite effect.The MTIA also point out that the burden of the cutbacks in government spending borne by the machine tools and robotics industry is disproportionate. Not only has this industry had to bear the abolition of the bounty, which is what this schedule is all about, but over the past six months this industry has had to bear the burden of cuts to research and development programs—both the tax concession and the discretionary grants—imposition of a three per cent duty on industry inputs under the tariff concession system, substantial dismantling of export facilitation programs such as the export market development grants scheme and abolition of the development import finance facility, the DIFF. As the MTIA sum up, these new arrangements mean that now Australian producers are not operating on a level playing field but on one that is tilted straight toward our competitors goals where you have machine tools coming into the country duty free while Australian producers importing components are paying a three per cent duty. That is an extraordinary outcome. In the face of the reversal of the budget decisions to abolish the ships bounty and the book bounty, termination of this bounty represents a further slap in the face.This is a matter of particular concern to me because of its importance to manufacturing industry in the Wills electorate. By way of example, as I have mentioned previously, Farley Cutting Systems is a company based in Glenroy. It commenced business back in 1983. Its mission statement is to be a leading world supplier of systems for cutting flat metals and similar materials. It has achieved success both domestically and in penetrating markets abroad with the sale of cutting ma chines into specifically targeted sectors, such as shipbuilding and the heating, ventilation and airconditioning industries. At last count, it had 300 machine installations in more than 20 countries around the world, a staff of 75 people, turnover in excess of $12 million, with exports accounting for approximately 75 per cent of sales. It is actively involved in ongoing research and development activities—including activities with a range of external partners—and is implementing various manufacturing improvement programs to enhance competitiveness.That is a terrific achievement, but underpinning it all is the kind of support Farley Cutting Systems got from this bounty. In 1995&hyphen;96, they received $325,000 from the machine tool bounty, $100,000 from export market development grants and $900,000 from the tax concession for research and development. They have been able to claim assistance under the export market development grants from 1984 right through to 1991, and they used that sort of assistance to get into new export markets in Malaysia, China and India. What we have here is abolition of support under the export market development grants and abolition of the research from research and development. But the thing which has really knocked this company around is cancellation of the bounty—$300,000 straight off the bottom line.

This is another example of the betrayal by this government of manufacturing industry. The machine tools and robotics bounty has seen huge growth in this industry sector. Since the mid&hyphen;1980s the Australian machine tools industry has become increasingly internationally competitive. For example, in the last three years we have seen Australian produc tion of bountiable machine tools increase from $95 million to $144 million, with exports more than doubling over the same period. These are not dud programs, these actually work; yet you cut them out—you cut the very base out from under them.Is it any wonder that manufacturing has declined today in the national accounts? There are a few more members of the government backbench here now—it is good to see that we are having some effect in getting them in—and if they read the national accounts figures today, the ones the Treasurer (Mr Costello) was crowing about in this chamber before, they will see that those figures show that production in manufacturing industry in the last quarter has declined by 2.6 per cent. Congratulations on overseeing the demise of the manufacturing sector in this country, Minister!Is it any wonder that the member for Kingston is forced to go into her local newspaper today and condemn the cuts that her government has introduced?

494,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr ADAMS","UNKNOWN","(Lyons)","UNKNOWN","N/A",2072,"—The amendments deal with a matter which is very important to the robotic and machine tooling industries in Australia which needed a bounty to give them the opportunity to grow and get into the world market so they could compete against those in other countries who were also getting advantage and opportunity from their own governments. We have allowed our companies, by using these bounties, to achieve that goal. We have allowed them to grow and to get access into the world markets. This was a deliberate policy of the previous Labor government.This new government has come in and has cut the bounty without really thinking about or working through what sort of impact it would have. The government did not know what impact it would have. It was trying to reach that bottom line on its budget. In doing that, it has slashed away at everything. The consequences of its slashing away at everything have been the cuts in these bounties from shipbuilding to the bookbinding industry to the robotic and machine tools industry.That comes back and reflects directly onto jobs in Australia. In many respects it reflects onto regional Australia and regional jobs which are going. It is a great disappointment that the government has not even given consideration to accepting some of these amendments from our side. The government needs to become a little bit mature in the way it deals with industry policy and to take up something I believe it should take up. It has played around the edges of the shipbuilding industry bounty. It really did not do anything to try to get over its electoral problems as a result of the bad press, so it came up with a changed mechanism which really did nothing for the industry.It has gone down the same track in the bookbinding industry with the bookbinding bounty. So it has not achieved anything. It will not look at the amendments, which I believe are reasonable. It is just doing away with jobs in our country, not encouraging our industry in any way and therefore it shows itself up as the bad government that it is and it shows itself to have bad policy direction in relation to industry policy.Industry policy reflects straight back to the job situation and jobs policy reflects straight back to family policy. I do not think that this government has even thought about that. It has not thought through how one thing links to another in the overall workings of the economy. This government has failed in its industry policy and, in relation to these cuts in the bounties, it has been bad for regional Australia and for working people in Australia. I will be supporting the amendment as put.","N/A","BOUNTY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

496,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr JENKINS","HH4","(Scullin)","ALP","N/A",2072,"—Mr Deputy Speaker, I will try to ensure that I am speaking about items 6 to 9, which hopefully are about the machine tools and robots industry—because that is what we should be speaking about at this stage.Throughout this debate what the opposition has been seeking from the minister at the table, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), is some clear direction about where he sees industry policy going, under the government. There can be no clearer example than this decision with respect to the bounty on machine tools and robots where, by the actions of this bill and these clauses, the bounty will be ceasing 10 months earlier. It ceases on the night of the budget but was supposed to run through to 30 June 1997.Indeed, when the Industry Commission last looked at this industry it recommended that the scheme cease when it was due to end on 30 June 1977. This is something that the industry had been able to factor in. But just for the sake of the fiscal consolidation that the government has claimed was required we see that this bounty has been terminated.This is a very successful industry, and I wish to mention one particular company in the northern suburbs of Melbourne. Mentioned in debate earlier, it is Farley Cutting Systems in the suburb of Glenroy, which was in the electorate of Scullin when I was first elected to this place but was later redistribut ed out. When I had some contact and dealings with this company in the late 1980s, it had commenced only four or five years earlier. It is a truly Australian success story.Here is a business that literally started in somebodys garage. Slowly but surely, the company has been able to build its business up to where it is successfully selling its cutting machines not only to the European market but the Asian market. It has not only relied upon its expertise in putting in place the electronic controllers that control its cutters but also it has been able to be innovative in the way that it exported its product.One of the things it realised was that if it designed its cutting tools in a certain way they would fit into containers that could be airfreighted and that because of its relationship to Tullamarine airport this was an efficient way of sending its goods through to the European market. It was a company that early on saw that it had a great advantage if it had its own sale representatives in the markets.Indeed, in evidence before the Senate committee, Mr Farley, the principal of the company, talked about how it had been able to increase its business in Singapore. Four years ago it had sold something like $400,000 worth of the stuff—that is the way he talks about it. But now after placing somebody in Singapore that amount had increased to $3 million worth of orders.Simply put, what this industry needs is the confidence that it has the support of the government. Today, a media release from the MTIA has the headline `Machine Tools and Robots Industry Receives Unfair Treatment. They believe that they have been singled out, because along with the computer industry they have suffered the full effect of the announcement on budget night.This press release goes on to indicate that the bounty plus other forms of government assistance should be taken into account in the way in which this industry is able to operate in the international market. I quote from the press release:The new arrangements under the TCS—that is, tariff concession system—mean that now Australian producers are not operating in a level playing field but one that is tilted straight toward our competitors goals. Imports of machine tools are coming into the country duty free while Australian producers importing components are paying a 3 per cent duty.The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism has to address these problems, because they jeopardise Australian jobs by sending those jobs offshore. On behalf of the people who work for companies like Farley, I ask the minister at this consideration in detail stage of this bill to rise to his feet and tell Australian industry how he is going to give them protection, cooperation and assistance to ensure that they can embark upon their successful export schemes and import replacement that they have been able to achieve under the forms of assistance that have been available to them in the past.

497,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr CREAN","DT4","(Hotham)","ALP","N/A",2073,"—On this machine tools and robots bounty issue, I am very pleased that the members for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) and Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) have referred to the examples of companies within their electorates that have been very successful as a result of being able to operate within the certain environment that Labor had created with the R&D expenditures and with the machine tools bounty.I, too, have a company in my electorate, Laser Lab. I have visited companies not only in my electorate but also in other electorates. I would suggest that, if the member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave) thinks this has been a backward going industry, he should go and visit these companies to see what they do. At times I cannot believe the ignorance which people on the other side of this parliament display. They claim to be the party of business, but they have no idea at all of how these programs that have supported industry have created jobs and exports.The fact of the matter is that we have seen huge growth in manufactured exports over the last decade. There was the report the other day that indicated that manufacturing was now 31 per cent of our export income. The Australian Chamber of Manufactures says that there is a possibility of manufacturing exports being the single biggest component—in other words, more than 50 per cent—by the year 2010 if we have an industry strategy. That is the same group that says your government has deserted them, the same group that says that there is no vision for industry and the same group that has condemned the $3.9 billion in cuts in the last budget that has seen manufacturing industries slump in this country.If there is any doubt about the slump, have a look at todays national accounts figures. They show what the impact of the $3.9 billion cut has been. Manufacturing output in the December quarter—one quarter alone—fell by a massive 2.6 per cent. Today the Treasurer (Mr Costello) was trying to claim credit for growth of three per cent over a year and 0.5 per cent in a quarter, but he is presiding over an economy that has seen manufacturing output slump by 2.6 per cent. Cant you see the danger signals?The member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes) sees the danger signals. She is prepared to go out publicly in the newspaper in Adelaide and condemn the government for its cuts to industry—to say that these cuts have really hurt South Australia. They have not only hurt South Australia; they have hurt the nation. If she really believes that they have hurt them, why doesnt she put some pressure on her government to reverse these decisions? Why doesnt she get to the minister at the table, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore)? He has been got to by the book publishing industry and the ship industry because he has had those industries reverse themselves. It is the computers, machine tools and robotics industries that still require significant assistance. He will not give it to them. He goes to the election saying that they are entitled to it, but he will not give it to them.The other thing that is most disturbing, I must say, about the machine tools and robots bounty is that the Industry Commission, in its draft report on machine tools and robotics, recently recommended that the bounty be retained. What we have is a government that commissions a report and ignores it. I just hope that they show the same approach in ignoring what they have recommended for cars and what we know they will recommend for the TCF industry.This is a government that is not prepared to take account of the realities, is not prepared to reward success, is not prepared to encourage the growth of our manufacturing sector, is not prepared to get behind regional development and is not prepared to support programs that get jobs—jobs for Australians—and correct the balance of payments.The key measure in all of this is export growth and jobs growth. The two most important criteria that you set your standards by—correction of the current account and employment growth—and you wipe a program that achieves it. Do you understand the stupidity of that program? What I am saying to the backbench of this party is: get real in understanding the impact.

498,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr MARTIN FERGUSON","LS4","(Batman)","ALP","N/A",2074,"—I am pleased to stand this evening with the member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes). I think she was right, as reported in the Adelaide Advertiser today, when she said, very clearly, that the coalition was badly advised. I agree that she needs to stand up and be counted. She got the headline in Adelaide today. The question is whether she will get the headline in Adelaide tomorrow for voting with the opposition—for voting with respect to concern about jobs and the need for certainty in industry.I take note of the fact that the member for Kingston is concerned. She has questioned the quality of the Howard governments economic advice and attacked economic rationalism as a cancer on the nation. That reminds me of the type of speech that the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) would make. He is also concerned, as is the member for Kingston, with the lack of decent economic advice that has been given to the Howard government.The member for Kingston went on to say that she urged the government to be more critical of the advice it received in preparing its second budget. She understands the damage that the decisions of the current government has imposed on Australian industry. She understands that decisions such as the decision to bring forward the date on which the robot bounty will cease to operate is wrong.The Howard government is going the wrong way if it is concerned about the needs of industry and about a degree of security and certainty required in industry on the basis of which investment decisions should be made. Even the Industry Commission itself recommended retaining the bounty until its legislated expiry date of 30 June 1997. We are proposing an amendment to ensure that we give the Industry Commissions recommendation an opportunity of being put in place.I suggest to the House that bounties established under the Labor government were aimed at encouraging investment in industry, aimed at encouraging investment in local manufacturing and aimed at trying to facilitate job growth and exports. More importantly, they have achieved their desired results. That is why, because of those ill&hyphen;informed decisions of the last budget, the member for Kingston is correctly reported in the Adelaide Advertiser today as being concerned about the wrong economic direction that the Howard government is taking and about the impost of economic rationalism. It is a cancer on the nation, it is a cancer on the government, and it is time that the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) stood up, stood beside people such as the member for Scullin and the member for Kingston and forced this government to review its decision.I believe, as do many in the House this evening, that this is not about savings; this is about investment in Australias future. The bounties have continued to deliver with respect to the future of Australia. We should leave them in place to ensure that companies which made investment decisions on the basis of this legislative framework are able to retain the full benefits that they were promised before the last election.Consideration interrupted.","N/A","BOUNTY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/debate.sub1/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

500,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr ALBANESE","R36","(Grayndler)","ALP","N/A",2075,"—I rise tonight to raise the issue of legal aid cuts. I spoke at a rally in Marrickville against these cuts some two weeks ago that was attended by many members of the community and by the Marrickville Legal Centre. Today, most importantly, I lodged a petition with 6,817 signatures to be presented to this House, calling on the government to restore funding.Today there were demonstrations right around this nation. Approximately 2,000 people gathered in Queens Square in Sydney to express their anger and there were similar gatherings in every capital city in this country. This is not an issue that is going to go away. The slashing of the legal aid budget has significant ramifications for our system of law and the opportunity of every citizen to be equal before the law in this country.Speakers at the rallies today included Patrick Fair, the President of the Law Society of New South Wales, David Bennett, the President of the New South Wales Bar Association, Nora Maguire, President of the Combined Pensioners Association, Harry Herbert of the Uniting Church, Angela Chan from the Ethnic Communities Council, Maurie OSullivan, the President of the PSA, and Meredith Burgmann from the New South Wales parliament. I think the diverse backgrounds of these speakers shows the depth of the opposition to these cuts.These cuts represent an attack on the right to fair trial and due process. The capacity of individuals to launch an action against others is also threatened. The cuts to legal aid in New South Wales of over $10 million represent a significant proportion out of the $33 million to be cut nationally because legal aid is not in the form of a tied Commonwealth grant. This is a cynical attempt by the Commonwealth to rewrite over two decades of legal funding policy. We are now being accustomed to this sort of revisionism, and it is traditionally disadvantaged groups that will suffer most, as they always do, when cutbacks occur in the public sector.Legal aid staff and community legal centre staff are already overworked and have been for as long as I can remember. I am not a lawyer, but I do know that our legal system is far from classless already. When you cut legal aid, you put at risk the rights of all the people who rely on those services—the elderly, children, women, the disabled, indigenous people.The Howard government talk about battlers, but do they really know what it is like to not have the money or access to the expertise that could either help them defend a trumped up charge or prosecute an unscrupulous company? The fact is that they do not. Without adequate legal aid funding, the rights of people to defend or prosecute a criminal or civil matter will not only be jeopardised but, in many cases, eliminated.As a case in point, the victory by retirement home tenants last year in the Supreme Court of New South Wales against massive increases in their weekly rental licence fees may not have even got to court, let alone resulted in an overturning of that unscrupulous action. On a more basic level, what about the rights of women who seek community legal centre advice about an abusive spouse or partner? Cut out those community legal centres and you cut out this vital lifeline for victims of abuse.As recently as two weeks ago, we saw the New South Wales state government having to step in and fund a criminal retrial following a hung jury. These are expensive trials and the state government simply cannot step in wherever there is a funding shortfall. The other side of the coin is that we may be jeopardising the physical safety of the community by not being able to fund these retrials.Already we have seen a number of cuts—legal aid in victim compensation matters and legal aid for committals, and caps have been placed on the funding of criminal and family law matters. So you either do not get help or you get help until the money runs out. That is no way to run a legal system in this country in 1997.This is a measure which is essentially about taking away the legal rights of ordinary citizens, and I say to those opposite, particularly those from non-urban areas, that this will have a devastating impact on regional areas in Australia. Approximately 110,000 advices of representation in New South Wales are out side of Sydney. The sort of person in these regional areas who normally seeks representation, who goes through this system, quite often is a woman with children. These cuts are unconscionable and should be opposed.

501,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Ms JEANES","EK6","(Kingston)","LP","N/A",2076,"—It seems that my comments in the House on Monday got the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) more than just a little bit excited earlier today. I would have to say it got me a little bit excited when I heard that he had accused me of talking up my view on the future of the automotive industry at home in Adelaide but not here in Canberra.It also got me a little bit excited when I heard that he wanted me to defend the workers at Griffin Press when he was grizzling in this House about the book bounty. I am always happy to defend workers, but Griffin Press is at least 10 kilometres out of my electorate, so the member for Hotham offers the House just another example of his ignorance on South Australian matters.I would like to expand upon the views that I expressed in this House and that were later reported in the Advertiser after I spoke here on Monday, the very place where he apparently accuses me of not standing up for the industry. The doctrine of economic rationalism commenced its pervasion of the Canberra bureaucracy under the previous Labor government, a government of which the member for Hotham was a minister for some six years, I understand. The member for Hotham entered this parliament in 1990. A year later, Michael Pussey warned that economic rationalists had `invaded the bureaucracy by exposing the extent of the spread of their doctrine through Canberra in his book entitled Economic Rationalism in Canberra .I would like to say just a few words about the economic performance of the previous Labor government, particularly in relation to the automotive industry. The current debate, as everyone knows, has centred on the issue of tariff reduction. The Labor Party in government reduced tariffs in the car industry from 57.5 per cent in 1984 and committed it to a target of zero per cent in 2010—and they called the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) `Captain Zero. Now they have suddenly become the saviours of the automotive industry by proposing a slow down in the rate of reduction by announcing that they have adopted Ian Webbers position. Thank you very much, but we on this side of the House do not need their help. We will support the industry as we believe fit, by working with the industry.I would like to offer you a bit of advice, seeing that you have adopted Mr Webbers position as your policy. I suggest that you approach Mr Webber and offer him the job as your industry spokesperson. He might give us real opposition on this matter backed up by real arguments, not opportunistically adopted ones.The member for Hotham was the Minister for Employment, Education and Training in a government that spent billions of taxpayers dollars on labour market programs that did not create the jobs to put the people they were training into. They spent $800 million on some programs that had a success rates costing up to an astonishing $140,000 per job obtained.The programs were so expensive that the Labor government had to flog off their crown jewels, like Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank, in order to pay for them when they should have been retiring their debt in order to reduce the strain on interest rates which was one of the many factors that they let kill off the small businesses that could not afford to employ the people they were churning through the member for Hothams training programs.What the member for Hotham and perhaps another member or two on the other side do not like very much is the fact that the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), the member for Sturt (Mr Pyne), the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) and many other members on this side of the House, including myself, are sticking up for our constituents who work in the automotive industry.We are expressing views in support of our car industries, and those opposite do not like it. We are actively participating in the debate to do our best to ensure that the automotive industry in this country not only remains viable but continues to grow through its increasing export activity on the international markets.You would have to be blind not to notice that there are a range of views expressed on this side of the House. Naturally, I believe that my view is the correct one and the one that will ensure the future growth of the industry. Any member who has anything to do with the automotive industry in their electorate who did not get up in this place and outside to promote their vision for the future of the industry would be derelict in their duty if they sat quietly and let the debate go by. I therefore welcome and enjoy the views expressed by the member for Corangamite.Those on the other side of the House can continue with their attempts to seek political mileage out of the range of views that government members legitimately hold, but your attempts at opportunism will fail because we can see through your thinly veiled efforts. The member for Hothams attempts to pick up on our language, to get members like myself to support his amendments when his government had 13 years to address the problems that we are now having to fix, are just a little bit too transparent. You are going to have to do a lot better.I stand by my comments that the doctrine of economic rationalism has too much influence throughout the bureaucracy, and those opposite let it happen. What the people on the other side really do not like is the fact, as I pointed out to the House on Monday, that the one thing that the Industry Commissions draft report has achieved is the pulling together of a very diverse group of people—people like a number of my South Australian colleagues and myself; the South Australian and Victorian Premiers; your traditional supporters, who see that we are genuine in our efforts to save their jobs; the car industry workers and their union representatives; the car companies and component companies. That leaves no place for those opposite, and they do not like it. So stop playing around with the jobs of my automotive industry workers. They will not thank you when your opportunism explodes in their faces.

502,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr SERCOMBE","QK6","(Maribyrnong)","ALP","N/A",2078,"—The 12th of June is the National Independence Day for the Republic of the Philippines and 12 June 1998 will mark the centenary of national independence for the Philippines. The circumstances surrounding that declaration of independence were that for a number of years the Filipinos rebelled against Spanish colonial rule and on 12 June 1898 they declared national independence. They did this at the time of a war that was being fought between Spain, the colonial country, and the United States. In July 1898, after Filipino independence had been declared, United States forces arrived in the Philippines and Spanish forces surrendered to American forces. There was considerable Filipino resistance to that situation. Nonetheless, the Philippines was ruled until 1946, with a period of Japanese occupation, by the United States. Nonetheless, Filipinos regard 12 June as their National Independence Day.Australia has a strong bilateral relationship with the Philippines. If one looks at some of the indicators, one can see that in 1995-96 merchandise exports from Australia to the Philippines were worth $1.1 billion, which represented a growth of nearly 30 per cent on the previous year. That compares to merchandise imports from the Philippines of only $0.3 billion. Australia has an overwhelming trade advantage.The Philippines is the fourth highest country, coming after PNG, China and Indonesia, in terms of development assistance. There are a range of security arrangements associated with our relationship. There are also in excess of 120,000 people in the Filipino community in Australia. Very notably, they assume Australian citizenship at a very high rate.Next year provides a very real opportunity for Australia to take forward its bilateral relationship with the Philippines in meaningful ways. The Philippines government has established the National Centennial Commis sion, which is planning a great year to showcase Philippines culture, society, technology and economic development. The event will be attended by participants from around the world.One of the key features of the event will be a centennial exhibition which will run from December 1997 to August 1998 at the Clark special economic zone, which is a 60&hyphen;hectare site. This presents an ideal opportunity, in my view, for the Australian government to significantly take forward Australias bilateral relationship with Philippines. The Philippine authorities are extending invitations to countries around the world. One of the features at the exhibition is described in their document as follows:Global Island . . . Philippines and the World: 1898 and Beyond . . . participants will address the past, present and future relations of the Philippines with other countries. A thematic approach shall be adopted for this island where friends of the Philippines with close historical and special ties with the country, which have been invited to cooperate to honour the centennial in concrete ways . . .There are obviously a range of demands on Australian foreign policy in promoting bilateral relationships, but the Philippines, as I have indicated, is a very significant trading partner. Large numbers of former Filipinos make their homes in Australia. They have very real and strong connections with Australia.There are opportunities for considerably taking forward our two&hyphen;way economic relations. In that respect, it is a bit disappointing that the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer), in his recent report on trade outlook to this parliament, did not significantly address opportunities and issues with respect to the Philippines. I simply put to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) and the Minister for Trade the outstanding opportunity that the centennial year, 1998, presents and suggest that they instruct their officials as a matter of urgency to ensure that Australia is very much present at that event and very much takes the opportunity of contributing to a closer bilateral relationship.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/debate.sub1[3]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
503,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr HARDGRAVE","CK6","(Moreton)","LP","N/A",2078,"—Tonight I would like to raise a serious matter and, as a consequence of this speech, praise not condemn, enhance not detract, the reputation of members of the Australian Defence Force. I would like to address the matter of the death in September 1994 of Private Jacinta Watson at the Greenbank Rifle Range just outside my electorate.Jacinta was a proud member of the ADF reserve and was in her early 20s at the time of her death. She was robbed of her true potential contribution to our country by the accidental discharge of a weapon at Greenbank. Since then, her parents have wanted justice and answers.I want to refer especially to a letter dated 10 June 1996 which was sent by Jacintas mother, Mrs Genia Otuszewski, to the Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General John Sanderson. It took General Sanderson four months to reply to the letter from my constituent, Mrs Otuszewski. The reply came on 8 October 1996. I contend that this is a very poor and insensitive treatment of a family—to think that it took four months for the Chief of the General Staff to respond to some legitimate concerns expressed by the family in that letter.Many people have suggested to me that the Department of Defence often employs a standard operating procedure in matters involving the death of personnel—to essentially string out the paperwork until the established three&hyphen;year statutory limit has expired. This claim was certainly evidenced by the Senate committee in their inquiry into the Nomad tragedy. They recommended a five&hyphen;year statutory period in their findings.General Sanderson outlined in his letter of 8 October a number of reasons for not disciplining the particular army personnel involved, Sergeant R.C. Thorpe. Quite frankly, so many of the reasons seem inadequate to me.A board of inquiry was originally convened following the death of Jacinta Watson. It recommended disciplinary action against Sergeant Thorpe at the time, but that particular recommendation was suspended because charges of a similar nature were laid by the Queensland police against Sergeant Thorpe. He was charged with unlawful killing and the unlawful wounding of another soldier, Corporal Michael James Gardiner.Defence, according to General Sanderson, were going to charge Thorpe in two possible ways—under section 36(2) of the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982, which is `dangerous behaviour causing death by recklessly handling a weapon; or under section 36(3), which is `dangerous behaviour, causing death by negligently handling a weapon. But those charges were never laid.On 4 June 1996, the Queensland Supreme Court found Sergeant Thorpe not guilty of the civil charges. General Sanderson claims section 144 of the Defence Force Discipline Act precludes:. . . trying a member with an offence which is substantially the same as a civil offence of which a person has been acquitted in a civil court.General Sanderson claims his judgment is that certainly would have been the case in the matter involving Jacinta Watsons death so he decided against pursuing any action against Sergeant Thorpe. General Sandersons letter said:My decision aside, I am also aware that Sgt Thorpe is carrying a huge burden which he must live with for the rest of his life.That is certainly true, but I do not think anybody in this place would deny that the family of Jacinta Watson—and, for that matter, all members of the ADF—will carry a tremendous burden out of this unfortunate accident which resulted in her death.Mr Speaker, I am well aware of your distinguished career within the Defence Force, but my contention is this: the reputation of the entire Australian defence forces can suffer from this sort of decision. It seems to me that the person who was in charge when someone was killed and another was hurt should be disciplined in some way—perhaps as a token gesture, but there should be some discipline. Disciplinary action would demonstrate to all service personnel and to the Australian community that the ADF enforces the high standards expected of it. Rank carries responsibility, and even ordinary members of the ADF often carry far greater responsibilities than the general Australian community. Accordingly, such responsibilities justify the exacting of strong and certain penalties if standards are not met.The parents of people who have been killed in the too many accidents involving ADF personnel in recent years are well motivated in their pursuit of answers to their questions. They are understandably proud of their childrens involvement in the ADF and they bear no grudge against the Commonwealth; rather, they just want their fears put to rest. General Sandersons slow response to Jacinta Watsons mother certainly did not help the cause.I submit that it is certainly time for the army in particular to take greater care and to move to analyse the common causes in these various incidents—for example, the training and the attitude of personnel involved—to apply these findings to prevent further incidents, as well as define and impose appropriate penalties. If the Defence Force Discipline Act is inadequate, let us amend it.

504,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr MOSSFIELD","MK6","(Greenway)","ALP","N/A",2080,"—I rise in this adjournment debate to congratulate the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, on his statement last week that the coalition government should introduce a freeze on automotive tariffs at 15 per cent until the year 2005 with a further review in 2003. Mr Beazley urged the government to take a bipartisan approach so that car makers faced more certainty in their long-term investment decisions.I believe a tariff freeze clearly has widespread support from some coalition backbenchers—and I certainly think the member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes) would be included in that—and from the Premier of South Australia, John Olsen. Mr Olsen is quoted as saying that the Australian industry was hamstrung by the lack of economies of scale at home and the fact that the international trade playing field was not level.I refer to the car manufacturers themselves. Toyota Australia told the Productivity Commission:None of the four local car makers would survive if the Industry Commissions major recommendations were implemented.Our own Australian icon, Holden, told the Industry Commission in Adelaide:. . . its international parent would not have approved the project to build the Vectra mid&hyphen;sized car alongside the Holden Commodore for 1998 if the Commissions interim recommendation to cut tariffs on imports to 5% by 2004 had been known at the time.Mr Thomas of Holden said:. . . the move to cut tariffs to 5% could lift to 23,000 the number of jobs lost in the car industry over the period from 1992 to 2004, equal to about 50 per cent of the 46,000 people directly employed by the sector earlier this decade.N/AThe car and automotive component sector is vital to the Australian economy and no doubt tariff cuts would threaten fresh investment and jeopardise thousands of jobs throughout Australia. In New South Wales, where I know manufacturing industry is struggling, the car component industry employs thousands of workers.The helpful proposals by Kim Beazley need to be repeated over and over again, and I will do that with pleasure this evening: first, a freeze on tariffs on motor vehicles, original equipment and replacement components at 15 per cent to at least 2005—while maintaining our commitments under APEC; second, the establishment of transparent measures by which the progress of our trading partners in reducing their tariff and non-tariff barriers can be judged; third, a review of the industrys position in 2003 to determine the assistance needed beyond 2005; fourth, continuing the export facilitation scheme, modified as necessary to be consistent with our World Trade Organisation obligations; fifth, continuation of the duty-free allowance to support domestic market value-added products; and, sixth, provision of measures which ensure a more supportive industrial research and development environment.In close proximity to my electorate, a number of car component plants—such as BTR, TRW and Astra—currently provide hundreds of blue-collar jobs. As a former trade union official, I serviced manufacturing industry and the car component industry over a long period of time. I have been shocked to see the number of jobs lost in these industries due to economic rationalist policies. I might say that many of these policies were vigorously opposed by the trade union movement.But it is not only people from my side of politics who are alarmed by the Productivity Commissions draft report recommending that tariffs be lowered. Mr Allan Handberg, the national Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, was quoted in the Financial Review as saying:The draft report offered no positive encouragement for global manufacturers to maintain their investment in Australia.He went on further to say:A withdrawal of capital by car makers would send a negative message that would have disastrous implications for all foreign investment in Australia.Mr Handberg also slated the report for its lack of plans for industry, saying that it did not indicate what shape it would be in after the recommendations took effect. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has said that the idea that Australia would lose a car manufacturing industry is quite unthinkable; yet if he does not support the approach taken by Kim Beazley, that is exactly what could happen.

505,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Dr NELSON","RW5","(Bradfield)","LP","N/A",2081,"—In little over a week, the Federal Council of the Australian Medical Association will meet to consider a recommendation from one of its key committees that, if adopted, could ultimately destroy the egalitarian principles upon which private health insurance has been built. After almost a century of tireless support for health insurance, the AMAs Health Economics Committee is recommending to its governing body that Australians be advised against maintaining it. Not known for making irrational or ill-considered policies, the AMA would be well advised to well and truly think this one through.Higher income Australians probably could afford to go without private health insurance and simply pay cash at the hospital door. Paul Keating and the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) are two notable examples who admit to such practices. However, what about those 850,000 contributors over the age of 65, the half a million people earning less than $20,000 a year or the one million families surviving on annual incomes below $40,000? I do not know how long they would survive without access to some kind of insurance pool.Whilst it is easy to suggest that, as 40 per cent of private hospital episodes are now day procedures which cost approximately $2,000 to $2,500 each, who could responsibly suggest a battler go without effective cover for several years whilst they save the money? If the financially fit drop their health cover, they abandon those with mental illness, with intractable disease or with meagre resources to the collapse of a system that provides their only hope of affordable and timely access to quality care.I think people should be under no misapprehension that, if private health insurance collapses or if low income people cannot afford to buy it, private hospitals in the private hospital sector would continue to flourish—with the exception of those in regional and certain rural areas—but the market to which they will be appealing will be those who are of higher incomes and who can afford to pay cash. At the moment there is also a very untapped but lucrative market in South-East Asia for people who would be prepared to come here—and in fact are in increasing numbers—and pay cash for hospital care.The AMAs seemingly radical considerations reflect its opposition to proposals by the health insurers that have been put to the Productivity Commission for the establishment of what is described as US-style managed care programs. These programs have been described by Hillary Clinton as `an assault on the doctor-patient relationship. Insurers would control both the quantity and quality of care delivered through the ownership of hospitals and the contracting of doctors.I would advise the AMA Federal Council, when it considers this matter in just over a week, to wait for the Productivity Commissions report on changes to the regulatory environment in which health insurance operates and the governments response to it before abandoning its social obligations to the poor and the weak. Important as the governments private health insurance rebates may be, of more significance are the regulations that currently shackle the private health insurance industry.If the AMA adopts a position of advising people to drop their private health insurance and subsequent regulatory amendments are adopted by the government, do they then turn 180 degrees? Do we find that some of the most vulnerable people in this country—frequently elderly people, quite a number of whom have been ringing my electorate office recently about this issue—are then told by the AMA in a few months time: `We retract our earlier advice and now suggest that you take up private health insurance? What of the confusion amongst those with chronic illness?Would a person quit their private health insurance on the advice of the AMA—whose advice frequently is taken by the community—and then subsequently sought to take it up again, and if they then suffered a serious illness and found that they suffered misadventure on a public hospital waiting list, would the AMA and its officers be held liable for the sort of advice which they had given?Whilst I understand the basis of the recommendations that are coming from the AMAs Health Economics Committee and the frustration that underlines it, I think the Federal Council of the AMA as a group would be well advised to wait for the governments response to the Productivity Commission report—the regulatory environment is very much in need of reform—and consider the social obligations that it has to the vulnerable people in Australia.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/debate.sub1[6]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

532,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Mr TUCKEY","SJ4","(OConnor)","LP","N/A",2084,"—This legislation could be categorised as an omnibus bill because it has 10 separate measures incorporated within its covers. Some of them are of a more routine nature, but there are those that, to my mind, require special attention. While I wish to spend most of my time on the capital gains tax arrangements, I would like to record my significant support for the changes within this law relating to equity investments in small and medium enterprises whereby changes to the tax law are allowing and simplifying a process where major lenders can take some equity in a business, as compared to lending them money.One of the great difficulties for small business has always been the fact that their only source of growth capital has been to borrow the money, making them subject to the vagaries of the interest rate market and, frequently, not allowing them to take that option. Too often, debt has been the downfall of a business when, without the capital, they simply could not grow their business which is essential in modern&hyphen;day economics.When there is an equity position, the equity holder has to take the good with the bad. Their component of the investment does not become a burden when things are tough. It becomes a form of burden when things are good, because dividends are paid to the equity holder. But, as I say of taxation, if you are paying taxation, you are making profits and the tax man does not yet want 100 per cent of your profits, so it is always a much more advantageous situation.I thank the government for taking initiatives to simplify that opportunity and I think it has to be grown. In fact, our whole capital market structure has to be further reformed. The idea of a second board for medium sized companies has to be better understood as a speculative market. Admittedly, we have to watch out for the crooks, but the re&hyphen;establishment of a second board, which is now back on the agenda, is required.For very small companies, a company structure is required that particularly allows family members to invest in a company without liability. In other words, they do not have to go in as a retired couple and risk their family home to help their kids start a small business, but if they have a bit of spare cash that they are prepared to apply in that direction they should be able to put it in. Whereas in that type of small business company, as compared to a partnership, there is still the opportunity in a legal sense to require that the principal shareholders or directors have a degree of liability, which overcomes a lot of the other problems associated with granting credit to small business corporations. The whole capital structure of the small business sector needs to be reviewed and special provisions made so that people can get capital, as compared to debt. I welcome the initiative that is included in this legislation.It is interesting that we again revisit capital gains tax. I have been around for a reasonable time and, going back in history, when we were in opposition our then leader, Andrew Peacock, campaigned with a simple slogan—that, as sure as night follows day, if the people of Australia were to re&hyphen;elect a Labor government we would get a capital gains tax.As a consequence that was denied vociferously by the government at the time and, of course, history records we got a capital gains tax. We also got it without very much regard for the effect that it would have on, particularly, small business. There is a very simplistic argument that capital gains should be as taxable as any other gain and, of course, you can progress, if you like, to a wealth tax which says that people who are extremely wealthy should have their wealth assessed on an annual basis and that taxed at a flat rate.All of it is very negative to the accumulation of wealth. There are two points of view in Australian society. One is that everybody should be poor and the other that if some people are wealthy they assist the poor. I subscribe to the second view. I am not at all embarrassed to see someone drive down the road in a brand new Rolls Royce because I know a lot of people have got a job out of building it, maybe in a foreign country. There are also, of course, a lot of people getting a job out of the taxes that were paid to buy that vehicle and maintain and keep it on the road. Any suggestion that that sort of consumption only benefits the purchaser is silly. If someone can afford a butler then a butler gets a job as far as I am concerned. I am not at all concerned with the fact that by their efforts someone has achieved that level of income and they can afford to pay other people to assist them around their house. In fact, I hold the view, personally, which may not be even supported by my colleagues, that such household expenditure can be tax deductible. I see no reason why, where there is a family with two members, husband and wife, with skills in demand who should be both out there growing our economy, they have then got to come home at 5 oclock and do the household duties while someone else remains unemployed who would be ideally suited to doing those household duties and sharing in the income of those two people who have skills in demand.The incentive to do that would arise from saying to those people: part of your effort in both going out each day to earn a living and contribute to our economy requires that you employ someone in your household. I can see no reason whatsoever why that cannot be seen as a business expense. Furthermore, it would create a lot of employment that currently does not exist. It is all a bit silly. That is a personal view. I am not speaking on behalf of my government colleagues when I make it. I think we miss an opportunity because we have somehow still got this fixation with upstairs downstairs which is also, in my view, silly. I think all forms of employment are honourable employment. If peoples skills limit them to household duties, why not? Not everybody is going to have the skills to be a computer programmer or somebody in that category. Computer programmers marry computer programmers, doctors marry doctors et cetera, and we are suggesting to them that the society should still demand that one of them gives up work to look after the house when in fact there is a demand in society for them. But I will not continue on that particular subject. It has strayed a little bit away from this legislation.The reality of capital gains tax as I saw it in business was as follows: somebody goes out and expends say $50,000 to buy a small business. It is run down and they work extremely hard and extremely long hours and they build it up to a point where it has reached its capacity. It is not going to grow any more. They have ambition to go on to bigger and better things and they offer it for sale for $100,000 with the intention of buying another business for $150,000 and starting the cycle all over again. That is good for the economy. It is good for them and it is governments responsibility to encourage them. But what is the outcome under the present and past capital gains tax regime? They have made a $50,000 capital gain. They are going to sell a business for $100,000. They have probably sold it through a real estate agent so they have to pay commission on the sale. Then, of course, when they go to buy the new business for $150,000, the state authorities put out their hand for stamp duty. To add to their concerns we add a capital gains tax.In simple arithmetic those three costs consume the whole $50,000 of profit that they have built into the enterprise by hard work. It is silly and of course there is an absolute disincentive to sell the first business because in fact you are back to square one. That is what has been happening and the losers have been the real estate agents who could not turn businesses over and all sorts of other people and, of course, the state authorities with their rather iniquitous stamp duties which have got to the point of the ridiculous. They, again, are very much like a capital gains tax. I would like to address that issue in a moment.Suddenly we find that the idea that you are taxing people on this sort of hidden profit of capital gain has been very negative to the revenue. People have not been using it. Furthermore, it has discouraged people from going on and doing what is best for society. That is trying to expand their business activities and have this incentive to grow. This legislation specifically addresses that problem. It could not be more simple. It simply says that if you are in that situation and you wish to reinvest in another business, then you have the right to do so without paying capital gains tax. You are given two years to make that decision, which I think is very generous. To the great credit of the government, notwithstanding their policy position pre the election, they have wiped out the like&hyphen;business component.I campaigned very strongly against that by correspondence with our Treasurer and the committee that was looking at it. There are thousands of reasons that people would want to shift from, say, a newsagency to another business. More particularly, in my electorate, we find farmers wishing to move out of the farming industry sometimes because of physical injury—their back has given out or things of that nature—and they are seeking to invest in another business, say, a newsagency or a caravan park or something like that. And why not? The reality is that they might have inherited the family farm and found that they were not even suited to the farming business for whatever reason and that they would be more skilled in another. They should be able to move into different types of business within, of course, the $5 million turnover limit that is applicable.I congratulate the government on taking this step. They could stand to lose revenue in the process but I think, in the end, that may not be the case. I think there will be additional turnover in businesses resulting from this arrangement and I think the real estate industry is in for a bit of a bonanza. There are a lot of people just waiting for 1 July to be able to participate in this new arrangement and change from one business to another. We will see some quite significant activity which will benefit other governments such as state governments in their stamp duties. Taxes will be earned from the profits of real estate agents and others who will be the beneficiaries of this arrangement. It is, therefore, a very good proposition.Nevertheless, it is also worth addressing at this time the overall tax situation as it applies to business. I have been in business for all my life. I commenced in my first business while I was still at school. I went out painting houses on weekends and my school holidays and actually used to employ my school mates on certain of the less skilled jobs that were associated. I could give them as much in a day as the then department stores paid them for a week, over the Christmas period.But the reality is that a business, strangely enough, never enjoys profit. A business, for all intents and purposes, is a piece of paper that constructs that business. Those who enjoy the profits of a business are either the partners or the shareholders and I have never been able to work out why we therefore tax business. We have a hatred for them. We read in the papers constantly that nasty old BHP—that employs millions of Australians—made a big profit and we should be cutting them down to size. In fact, we should be leaving them with the profit so they can invest and create more jobs and more economic activity and maybe pick up the 800,000 or 900,000 unemployed we have in this country.Of course we should tax them the minute they pay money out to their shareholders or transfer it to another entity or want to transfer it out of the country. But that is the point. And, of course, that is the great opportunity that Treasurer Keating missed when he went for imputation. There is some reference to imputation in this particular legislation. Treasurer Keating had the choice with imputation. He could have taxed the company, as he did, and passed the franking credits on to the shareholder or he need not have taxed the company and he could have taxed the dividends. And, of course, he could have quite properly taxed them by way of withholding tax.The difference would have been that anybody who was prepared to reinvest in their business would not have paid tax on that investment and there would have been a massive incentive to do just that. It could have international implications—people in other countries making judgments that they had this opportunity to operate in this environment in Australia and bring their investments here, be it in petrochemical plants or any of the other secondary processing facilities, in particular, that Australia is wide open to considering its natural resources base.I welcome reading in todays paper how in Western Australia proper investors, quite properly, are going to bring our solar salt production and our huge gas production together by way of a petrochemical plant. We export them both to somebody else to do that particular job and that sounds silly to me. But, again, any incentive that says to business, `If you reinvest you do not pay tax seems to me to have a lot of merit. What is more, I do not believe government revenues would lose eventually because there would be a growth in PAYE earnings, a reduction in dole payments and the benefits from all the other things that follow from economic development. It is an issue that I would like to see considered.As you would be aware, I have advocated for quite some time that it is time the parliament of Australia—people from its own ranks—for the first time in history sat down with a select committee and studied our national tax system, right down to local government—not as a government but as a parliament. My proposition would be that the opposition got half the say because the reality of taxation is that unless the people of Australia, through its parliament, are prepared to take a bipartisan view and not play silly politics with taxation—put the national interest ahead of our political interest—then we are not going to get reform. We are going to go on, for instance, arguing about what level of tariff we should have on motor cars when in fact we put $800 worth of lead in the saddlebag of every car manufacturer for every car they produce through our indirect tax system—the height of the ridiculous.","N/A","TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 4) 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[1]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

I have always been rather stunned at the logic behind that particular argument. We have all these other taxes flowing into the system which they cannot escape. They add four per cent to the cost of growing a wheat crop, which we export. We see the great benefits to our balance of payments that this years wheat crop is providing. It is just silly, and yet apparently we have not got the capacity as a parliament—as a government and an opposition—to sit down and have a look at the proposition of whether income tax should apply to business or shareholders.I have expressed a view. I will express another view: in the international environment a VAT type tax is essential. Furthermore, it should be levied by the federal government but in two groups: firstly, for federal revenue at, say, 10 per cent and, secondly, for state revenues at, say, five per cent. At that point in time we say, `Thats where you get your revenue; the Commonwealth provides you nothing. Of course, that means that state governments lose this wonderful opportunity they have to blame the Commonwealth every time they put up their taxes but become answerable to their own constituency for the services they provide with that money. They are the realities. It goes right down—if you give state governments a reasonable revenue base then maybe they would abandon land taxes and stamp duties on such transactions and allow local government to raise their rate revenue at no real cost to the community and they would become independent.These are the issues that we should be confronting, but we are too busy worrying who is going to win the next election. Of course, we used to say of the Australian Democrats, `You cant buy the Democrats; you can only rent them by the hour. That is now a perfect description of the Labor opposition. You only have got to watch them. We knew what they used to stand for. Today, it is an hourly change; you are renting them by the hour.That stands in contrast to our term in opposition when on issues of privatisation and others we stood by our principles; we supported the government when they had problems in their own caucus. But the realities are that we need that in the national interest. Let us have a look. I am not predicting or demanding what the outcomes might be, but I think it is outrageous that a parliament for the nation cannot look for the first time ever at its own tax system.","N/A","TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 4) 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[1]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
535,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Mr BOB BALDWIN","LL6","(Paterson)","LP","N/A",2089,"—It is a great pleasure to rise to speak about the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill No. 4 (1996). At the outset, I must commend my colleague, the very energetic member for OConnor (Mr Tuckey). Today he has given a great presentation of his thoughts on the capital gains tax which are exactly consistent with the thoughts he expressed prior to this hideous tax being introduced back in 1985. For many months he repeatedly asked questions of the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and the then Treasurer, Mr Keating, about the tax. He was told many times during that period that there would be no capital gains tax. I am sure that as he leaves the chamber now he would agree with those sentiments.The main amendments in this bill deal with the change of entities involving capital gains tax rollover relief from capital gains tax for small business—a change to accelerate the depreciation rate cut&hyphen;off date for Australian trading ships, insertion of generic definitions of Commonwealth education and training programs, franking account concessions for companies which have not converted them for the purpose of imputation and beneficial changes to concessional tax treatment relating to employee share acquisition schemes.Capital gains tax is payable on the difference between the sale price and the index cost base of assets acquired after 19 September 1985 when the asset is disposed of. Assets changing ownership, even if acquired before that date, will attract capital gains tax as well.As you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, it can be said that this was very much a core promise of the coalition in the election campaign of 1996. It has been argued however that there could be some administrative problems with companies listed on the Australian Stock Exchange and having to compare and trace stockholders interests. However, such argument would apply only if a literal interpretation of the Income Tax Assessment Act is applied rather than the view adopted in the various rulings made by the commissioner.A series of changes to subdivisions in division 20 of part IIIA of the Income Tax Assessment Act define the requirements of entities to calculate whether there has been a change in the underlying interests in the entity and if the continuity of ownership has been affected. On the basis of this information, capital gains tax will apply.This measure is consistent with the governments objective of reducing compliance costs and increasing the efficiency of capital gains tax systems. Rollover relief from capital gains tax applies in a number of circumstances, such as involuntary disposal, transfers to wholly owned companies, changes to superannuation trust deeds and the merger of superannuation funds.Prior to the 1996 general election, the coalition announced that, as part of the capital gains tax reform, rollover relief would be available where a business disposes of an asset to purchase a like kind of asset. This relief would be subject to certain conditions, including that the disposal and purchase occur within 12 months and that the disposal price does not exceed $5 million and that the relief would be available only once every five years.Since the 1996 budget, the scheme has been substantially the same but with the following amendments: rollover relief will be restricted to taxpayers whose net assets do not exceed $5 million; relief will be available only in respect of active assets and the acquired asset is used in the same business or a like business.Further amendments were announced by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in a release dated 3 September 1996. These are that the like business test will be removed and that the period between disposal and acquisition will be extended to two years.That is a sign of a very progressive government, a government that has gone out and listened to the needs of business, in particular small business. To sell a business and buy a like business might be all right for a very large corporation, but imagine the average Mum and Dad or, indeed, just the single sole trader who has gone out and started a small business and built it up and then found that that is not quite his niche market, but that there is another niche market. I heard my friend and colleague the member for OConnor (Mr Tuckey) say, an example is a farmer which I have and which, indeed, many colleagues in regional and rural Australia have. Farmers may be forced to sell off the farm and, perhaps, move to town and rather than sitting back and going into a very early retirement they look to set up a small business.If you applied the objective of the intention of the amendment prior to those changes announced on 3 December, there would be capital gains tax applied to that sale of the farm business because it was not transferring to a like business. But the Treasury and cabinet, in their infinite wisdom, have determined that sometimes it is a matter of a situation out of their control where one has to sell one business and go into a totally different type of business. But the main thing is continuity. By allowing a period of up to two years, it does not mean that one has to risk all of the assets that one has built in that business, by rushing into a business that, perhaps, may not be secure or sound or, indeed, where time has not been available to do the necessary market research to ensure its long&hyphen;term viability.A new division will also be inserted into part 111A of the Income Tax Assessment Act, providing a definition of an asset currently used for capital gains tax purposes. These include any form of incorporeal property, such as goodwill. The usual capital gains tax definition will include motor vehicles used in the production of income, and will exclude personal use assets, rights under superannuation, or improved deposit funds and life insurance policies. Further assets will be excluded, which will result in total savings to small business.When the bill was originally suggested, the savings to small business were $150 million in 1998&hyphen;89, and $160 million in 1999 to 2000. However, with the announcement by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on 3 December 1996, this has expanded to $200 million in 1998&hyphen;99 and $215 million in 1999&hyphen;2000. While some would say that the government is giving away money again to small business, it is actually an investment in small business. It is small business that employs the majority of the people. It is small business that takes the risk. So, to provide a small investment in that amount, spread across the 800,000 small businesses that are out there, is a very small outlay for a maximum benefit of return.We have long heard it said that if all of these small businesses increased their workforce by one, our unemployment figures would disappear. But the members on the opposite side of the House have absolutely no understanding of small business. We have only to look amongst their dwindling ranks over there and see how many of them actually come from small businesses—","N/A","TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 4) 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[1]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

540,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Mr BOB BALDWIN","LL6","(Paterson)","LP","N/A",2089,"—I apologise, Mr Speaker. As the honourable member over there would know, he was a member of the former government that inflicted the greatest pain on small business. They reigned over the period of absolute record high numbers of bankruptcies and drove interest rates up to a level that would never have been dreamt possible. The only ones who benefited—and God bless their souls—were the pensioners who had a few dollars tucked away. But small business suffered. Small business could not afford to borrow or invest. Then, when people had to sell off that business to reduce the overdraft because the banks were putting the pressure on them, the former government, in their wisdom and absolute support for small business, decided that they had better nail them a little bit more and take some capital gains tax out of them. Even though they might have wanted to go on and start another business, or reinvest into something like their superannuation, the former government said no. They wanted it all.They got it all on 2 March when Australia voted them out of power. It was not just a trickle, it was not a small run; it was a massive flood. The initiative of this government has been well received, and I will quote quite a few eminent people in the small business industry who do understand what small business is about, unlike the members of the former government and now the current opposition. In the Financial Review of 4 December 1996, Mr Robert Bastian, Chief Executive of the Council of Small Business Organisations, described our initiative—this bill—as:. . . absolutely fabulous, an excellent gesture to small business.He also said:It gives a psychological lift which far exceeds the $50 million input by the government.He was a bit incorrect with his $50 million; it is a bit more than that. That psychological lift is what it is all about. If we talk up the economy, show that we are serious about getting things going in this country, and show some leadership—which our government does, but which was never there under the former government—that psychological lift will be there for small business and it will get them going.At the moment, the shadow Treasurer, the Leader of the Opposition, and others, continually talk down the future prospects for small business. And this is at a time when the government has been able to deliver interest rates, and now interest on overdrafts, at the lowest levels not seen since the 1970s. I ask: who can be serious about talking down the economy for small business? In that same article, Mr John Martin, the Executive Director of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said:It is an important step in increasing the confidence of small business and freeing up investment.Mr Kurt Rendall, the small business spokesperson for the Institute of Chartered Accountants said:The decision highlighted the difference between the coalition government and its predecessor.He went on to say that these guys had a really good understanding of small business. Mr Deputy Speaker, do you know why that is? It is because a lot of the people in government today understand small business because they have come from small business. They have invested in themselves. They have invested in their employees and they have continued on. That is something that cannot be said for anywhere near a majority of the people in the current opposition.In a press release issued late last year—I think it was in August—Mr Jonathan Ilbery, National President of the Taxation Institute of Australia, in reference to capital gains tax relief, said:This will obviously assist small business which would otherwise have incurred a tax liability on the disposal of the original asset. It will go some way to reducing the already heavy tax cost for small business.N/ATo have something grow and develop, we need to provide an incentive. If we provide an incentive, people will pick up the reins and run with them. As they run, so it will grow and become a river rather than a rivulet, and it will lead to an ocean. What will eventually happen is that we will be flooded with jobs and we will bring this nation back to a healthy, employed nation. But we cannot do it whilst we have an opposition that is hell&hyphen;bent and determined to keep up the structure of destroying small business.Perhaps they wanted to get rid of small businesses under their previous regime of government. By having small business out of the way, and having more large employers that the ACTU could go and apply pressure to, they could build up the dwindling number of union members. Even union members walked away from you because they felt you could not deliver the one thing that they needed, security in jobs. We do not get security in jobs if we do not have businesses employing people.We are going a long way towards that but let us look back a little in history at the yells and screams, particularly of the former Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, who was asked repeatedly about a capital gains tax. As I said, one of the people who asked questions about this on a regular basis is my friend and colleague the member for OConnor. On 16 February 1983, the former Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, said:And here let me make one point so that even our opponents can understand it; and let me make it beyond all their powers of misrepresentation and distortion.Wait for it.There will be no new capital gains tax.N/ADo you remember those words, etched in history? No new capital gains tax. You did not seem to understand that what it was was a disincentive for people to invest in Australia to start to create jobs.What happened way back in February 1985? Remember Placido Domingo? You must; you worked with him. In May 1985, the then Treasurer Paul Keating said, `The government has decided to introduce a capital gains tax. Where is their credibility? The situation is that during that period the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said that the coalition government, on coming to power—and he was referring to the next election thereafter—would remove a capital gains tax.It would be ideal to remove a capital gains tax right now but, unfortunately, the former government—the current opposition—have driven a need for dependency on tax revenue in this country by having such high levels of unemployment, such high levels of welfare and such high levels of debt that we cannot afford to get rid of capital gains tax in its entirety. What we can do is we can start to create an incentive that again will get small business going.As I said, how many of them are from small business? Very few. Let me remind this House that I do come from small business. I know what it is like to go out to my mum and dad and say, `Mum and Dad, I want to put your house on the line; I want to start a small business. That is something that a lot of my colleagues would also be able to understand. Having put their house on the line and taken out the overdraft, I went out and started a small business. Let me tell you it was in wholesaling. I bought an old ute and, because I could not afford to live the flash life of union officials, I slept in the ute at night so that I could save on the accommodation as I travelled around the coast of Australia selling diving equipment. But I had my money and my parents money on the line invested in that business. And it went on.Do you know what it is like, members of the opposition, when people do not pay their accounts in 7 days or 30 days and they have strung you out for 60 days, 90 days and 120 days? You have to put on a brave face when you are asking for your money. Do you know what it is like to have to live on Vegemite sandwiches because you cannot afford three proper feeds a day because your money is at risk? Let me tell you that a lot of people in small business in Australia understand that. They understand what it is like to have their money at risk. They understand what it is like to have `No said to them. They understand what it is like to have to deprive their kids because other small business operators are finding it tough. But you do not. You do not and you never have. That is why small business has totally rejected you as a government as, indeed, most of your former union membership rejected you on 2 March.But why do people go into in small business? They do it because there is nothing of greater pride than to work for yourself and to occasionally see the bank balance go into the black. As it goes into the black and you build up that account, you start to acquire a few assets for that business. A lot of people build that business for one reason only. They build that business as their superannuation retirement fund. They work hard all their lives, building that business up. They cannot afford, in the early stages of business, to pay out superannuation for themselves so that they can invest in their long term, so they do it through their business.Under the former government—a government that had no idea or understanding—what they wanted to do was just rip the majority of that away in capital gains tax. What we have said to the people now is, `You can take half a million dollars of that money—and there are not many small businesses that build up an asset worth half a million dollars in a business to be able to sell off—`and you can put it into an approved rollover relief fund. If that is not incentive for people to keep going, then I do not know what is.As I said, most of the people on the opposition benches would not understand that. Why? Because they have never had a small business. They have always had their superannuation packages because the union has provided for them on the way through, it has always been there. They have had a level of security because they have worked, in the majority, for large companies and they have had their superannuation deducted and put away. They have had total reliance and support on that business to provide for them in the future. I only ask and wish that more of them could have experienced what it was like to be in small business; to have to be called in to the bank manager and to have to explain why your account is in overdraft; to have to explain to the people that you owe money to, `Well, I cant afford to pay you this week but maybe next week.Time is running away, but this is one subject in particular that I do know and understand. It was one of the reasons why in July last year we had in my electorate a Small Business Summit attended by over 230 local business people. They were clear on one thing: they wanted action. And this government is delivering action. One of the things it is delivering, by the introduction of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1996, is a core promise to ease capital gains tax. It is an investment in small business and, more particularly, in the long term it is an investment in the job futures of all Australians.","N/A","TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 4) 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[1]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start[4]/para","N/A","N/A"
541,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Mr VAILE","SU5","(Lyne)","NP","N/A",2094,"—I certainly support the question before the Main Committee that the words proposed to be omitted do stand part of the question, because the amendment being moved by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) really is a pious amendment. How could anybody move against the measure that is being introduced by the government? There are a number of measures in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) but, obviously, the one creating the greatest amount of interest is with regard to the capital gains tax rollover relief that we are providing to small business—which is the manifestation of a government commitment at the election last year to provide that relief. It has since been embellished further by the Prime Minister and the government, and extended to rolling over profits not just into like businesses but also into any other business.Like the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) and previous speakers from the government side participating in this debate, we certainly welcome what the government is doing in this regard. It is something that the small business sector and a lot of people generally have been very concerned about since 1986, when a line was drawn in the sand by the previous government such that if you purchased property before that time you were not going to be liable for capital gains tax but that, after that time, you were liable. I remember that, at the time, I had a couple of real estate businesses, and there was from the small business sector a mad scramble to get properties exchanged prior to that September 1986 date.It has taken all these years for some element of equity to be reintroduced into the system, particularly with regard to small businesses. My understanding would have been at the time that the concept was about trying to tax speculative gains; and that, in itself, I suppose, is not something that we would argue against. But, like the FBT introduced by the former government, the net of this particular measure has gone a lot wider and it has been a disincentive to investment and development, and has slowed down growth in some sections of the economy. Certainly, along with a lot of other things, it has been a monkey on the back of small business over a number of years.I certainly welcome this measure and the other measures contained in the bill that we are debating today. As I say, the capital gains tax rollover relief for small business is a measure which was a pre&hyphen;election commitment, and it has been warmly welcomed by small business right across the board in Australia. It will take effect from 1 July 1997, and the people that I know in small business have certainly welcomed the announcement and look forward to the legislation being effective from that date.The coalition announced that, as part of the capital gains tax reform, rollover relief would be available where a trading business disposes of an asset to purchase a like asset, or where a business is disposed of to purchase another business of like kind. A number of conditions applied to this rollover relief, including that the disposal and purchase occur within 12 months; that the disposal price not exceed $5 million; and that the relief only be available once every five years.In the 1996&hyphen;97 budget, the decision to implement the measure was announced in the coalitions first budget. It was subsequently the same, except for relief being restricted to taxpayers whose net business assets did not exceed $5 million, relief only being available to respective active assets, and the like kind asset test not applying. That was the big move that was made at the end of last year from the original election commitment.In the election, we committed to Australian people that we would provide rollover relief on capital gains tax moving from selling a business to re&hyphen;investing in a like business within 12 months, with a limit of $5 million and availability only every five years. In the budget at the end of last year, we extended that and removed the test of like kind so that, if you wanted to sell one business and buy another business that was unrelated, provided that it was reinvesting in the small business sector as we know it, the relief would also apply.It was interesting to note the Treasurers statement on 3 December 1996. Following consultation with small business, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) announced further changes to the rollover relief provisions, including the removal of the like kind business test and the extension from 12 months to two years of the period between disposal and acquisition. As I say, that embellished what was a good policy at the last election and provided a better application of the policy, extending it more widely to encompass a broader decision making process as far as small business is concerned. On 3 December, the Treasurer said:This will be another boost to small business, another delivery on the coalition mandate, another encouragement to small business to grow bigger, and new opportunities for jobs in new, growing Australian businesses. This government takes its commitment to small business seriously and this is a government which intends to deliver.And certainly we have delivered in a number of areas, as far as small business is concerned. On 4 February this year, during question time, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said:From 1 July this year it will be possible for any man or woman in Australia running a small business who sells that business with proceeds of less than $5 million to invest those proceeds in another business, not necessarily a business of a like nature, without there being any capital gains tax liability. I remind the parliament of what was said by the Business Review Weekly . Managing editor Robert Gottliebsen said that this particular announcement was the most important corporate tax reform for 30 years because what it will do from 1 July this year is transform the landscape for the operation of small business in Australia.It is all about getting the monkey of government off the back of small business, along with what we have done as far as the election commitment goes to instigate a small business deregulation task force, now known as the Bell committee, which reported back to government at the end of last year. We maintained our commitment to the small business sector by trying to alleviate some of the burdens and regulations that government imposes on them and that cost them so much in time, energy and resources taken away from running their businesses and making a profit.With the announcement of the capital gains tax rollover relief measure and the changes announced in December by the Treasurer, the response has been overwhelming from small business. I quote Robert Bastian, the CEO of the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, who, in the Courier&hyphen;Mail of 5 December, described the changes that we announced thus:. . . exactly what small business was asking for. . . the psychological lift this will give to small business owners is far more important than the $50 million the Government estimates it will cost.I repeat: the psychological lift to small business owners will be far more important than the $50 million the government estimates it will cost. He probably best summed up the feelings of the small business community when he said, `It is bloody fabulous, an excellent gesture for small business. And that is what it was: a gesture with substance to small business that we were doing something positive for them.Government was at last, after so many years, doing something positive for small business—and it was done within 12 months of a coalition government being elected. The chairman of the Small Business Coalition, Mr Tom Meucke, in a media release on 3 December 1996 said:By this action the Government is indicating that it is both listening to small business and being prepared to modify its policy when this will result in significant practical benefits.It is further encouragement to confidence and expansion of the small business sector following the positive signals from the recommendations of the Small Business Deregulation Taskforce.N/AIt certainly is. I have a series of quotes, which I will not go on with at this stage, from different people involved in organisations representing the small business sector, all congratulating the government on this measure and highlighting its importance and positive nature.I was in this chamber late last night when this debate had resumed and it was interesting to listen to some of the representatives from the opposition parties, particularly the Labor Party, criticising this measure and the government. A number of speakers had a problem confining their comments to the bill. But it was interesting that the coalition government was being criticised by the Labor Party for not paying enough attention to small business. Some of the comments by members of the Labor Party were beyond belief.Since we have been in office, which is just on 12 months, one of the things we have achieved that we were committed to achieving for small business are low interest rates. There is nothing more important that a government can do than to try and encourage and create the environment for sustainable low interest rates for the small business sector. Just remember what happened during the 1980s and early 1990s in this country. The most devastating thing that happened to small business in the entire history of this nation was the high interest rate regime which was overseen by the former Prime Minister who was then Treasurer. He sent tens of thousands of small business people out of business. Whether they were small business people in towns, cities and urban areas, or small business people on the land, the monetary policy run by the former Prime Minister sent tens of thousands of them to the wall. That was the most damaging thing ever done to small business in Australias history.If you want to look at where the unemployment we are still struggling to deal with today started from, a major contributing factor was the high interest rate regime overseen by the previous government. It was under the previous government that unemployment rose to the unacceptably high level of about 11 per cent. A lot of those people came out of the small business sector that the former Labor government sent bankrupt purely through the interest rate regime and the monetary policy they were running.The most telling article on this is one I keep in my office all the time to keep repeating in this parliament and reminding members of the opposition of what their former leader, who has evidently now been junked as the great icon by the Labor Party, did to the nation Australia when he was Treasurer. The article is by Max Walsh in the Sydney Morning Herald and is called `A pocketful of wry from the Reserve. It is about former Treasurer Paul Keatings boast that he had the Reserve Bank in his back pocket.The article has some interesting comments that are drawn from John Edwards biography of Keating, Keating—The Inside Story . I will quote from the article which is very important to this debate because those were the darkest days of small business in Australia. I know, because I was operating a small business at the time interest rates went through the roof. I am not sure whether the member for Fowler (Mr Ted Grace) had his small business at that time or not, but they were devastating days for small business.","N/A","TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 4) 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[1]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

543,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Mr VAILE","SU5","(Lyne)","NP","N/A",2094,"—You did not have interest rates that high during the Menzies days. The article by Max Walsh says:The Treasurers direct involvement in day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day monetary policy was an accident of history and personalities. With the floating of the exchange rate and the removal of exchange controls, monetary policy assumed a much greater role in economic management than it had previously.N/AThe Reserve Bank, accustomed to taking its riding instructions from the Treasury, approached its new responsibilities with apprehension and caution—two words not in the Keating vocabulary, especially when backed by his equally hubristic adviser, Don Russell.If its policy approach was sometimes confusing, its hardly surprising.Edwards quotes Keating as saying: This is all bull. . . . about the science of monetary policy. All bull. . . .. Every month for years we had papers on credit growth, the yield curve, etc etc, the relation to GNE, and it was never any good in prediction. Never. You have to be able to feel what is happening.Two paragraphs later, Edwards writes: Beginning in March 1988, Keating would encourage and authorise—sometimes in the face of objections, insist upon—a series of interest rate increases which were the cause of the subsequent recession.Keating had returned from his summer holiday all fired up about the way in which Noosa was full of bulldozers. He wanted the Reserve to lift rates by 2 percentage points in one hit.The Reserve procrastinated but, under daily urging from Don Russell, lifted the rate by 1.75 percentage points.Between March 1988 and November 1989 the cash rate was lifted by nearly 8 percentage points, with Paul Keating cracking the whip. Rates were pushed too high for too long.Then, at the end of 1989, Don Russell (as he told a seminar a few years later) heard the economy snap: not a slowdown or a steady decline, but an audible snap.N/AWhat that snap represented, Mr Deputy Speaker, was tens of thousands of small business people going bankrupt and going out of business because they could not afford the interest rates. They could not afford the interest rates that the former government and the former Prime Minister and Treasurer oversaw in this country in the late 1980s.So, Mr Deputy Speaker, we are not going to be lectured by the Labor Party in this debate. We are not going to be lectured by the Labor Party about what we are doing for small business and what they did or did not do for small business. This government, in 12 months, has overseen a regime in this economy which has seen interest rates fall; which has seen inflation come down; which has seen a strong growing economy; which has seen reform of the industrial relations system, including the removal of Labors job destroying unfair dismissal laws; and which has seen, in this bill today, a range of incentives for small business, including the capital gains tax rollover relief incorporated in this legislation. It has seen the report from the small business task force of the Prime Minister on deregulation. They are the things that this government has done in 12 months for the small business sector of Australia and that is the commitment of this government to seeing that we create a stable economic environment for small business to prosper in this country.We have done that in a 12 month period, whereas we know history has already recorded what the Labor Party did over 13 years to small business in this country. I can guarantee that what the Labor Party did over 13 years in government to small business is one of the key motivating features why a lot of the members of the coalition parties are in this place today—because they are motivated by what happened to small business over those 13 years, and particularly in those dark, black years when Paul Keating was the Treasurer of this country, driving interest rates to the level that he did and then coming out with the glib comment that `it was the recession that we had to have. It was the recession that Paul Keating wanted. It was the recession that Paul Keating wanted because he wanted to bust the developers that he saw investing money in Australias future in Noosa when he was on holidays up there. That is evidenced in that article that Max Walsh wrote and it is evidenced in that biography that is written by John Edwards about the former Prime Minister and Treasurer.So, Mr Deputy Speaker, we are not going to be lectured by the Labor Party with regard to what we are doing for small business in this country. We made a commitment at the election last year. This is the manifestation of part of that commitment and we are going to continue on that path so that we can create a stable economic environment in the Australian economy for small business to prosper, because they will provide the future growth of Australia and they will provide a lot of jobs in the future. I commend the legislation to the parliament. If we divide on this and if the Labor Party want to divide on their amendment, let the people of Australia know, and let the small business people of Australia know, that the Labor Party did not want to provide them with the capital gains tax rollover relief that the government does.","N/A","TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 4) 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[1]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/break/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
544,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Mr MILES","BI4","(Braddon—","LP","Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister)",2098,"—I would like to sum up this debate, and I think that summing up is probably encapsulated by certainly the last two speakers: the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) and the member for Lyons (Mr Vaile). Also, I would make the observation that, in regard to a debate centrally focused around the engine room of employment in this country—small business—we find that of the 14 speakers, 10 were from the government and only three from the opposition. So I think the enthusiasm with which the last two speakers have spoken in regard to this motion and debate, on behalf of the government, indicates their empathy and understanding of the actual small business sector.The very fact that there are only three people who came in here from the Labor Party to talk about small business and how important it is to employment really illustrates how out of touch the opposition has become in this place. We know that from the way in which the Australian people voted just over a year ago. This is a great opportunity to come in here and talk about the $200 million benefit to small business by taking away the capital gains tax. It really is a mark of this government that we are interested in small business people and small business operators. This is a fulfilment of a government promise prior to the last election that we would address some of the real difficulties that small businesses were placed under by the previous government. This is a quantum leap forward by the government to assist families, to create jobs and to assist businesses throughout this great country of ours. I think for the opposition to ignore this debate in the way in which they have illustrates their lack of interest in small business in this country.The opposition has foreshadowed a second reading amendment and the government will be opposing that amendment. That amendment deals with three particular issues. Firstly, the second reading amendment provides that the House calls on the government to ensure capital gains rollover relief is restricted to situations where a net increase in employment will occur. If the opposition spokesman on this really understood small business, this section of the amendments would not have been put. It is really about short-term populous politics as against principled positions by a government. That is what it is about—nothing more, nothing less. In framing the policy, the government, unlike the opposition, listened to small business. We actually went out there, listened to them and understood them. Small business said that the capital gains tax was an impediment to expansion and growth. Does that not imply that they were saying that the way to get employment in their sector was to take away the capital gains tax? I am not sure what the opposition really is on about in moving that sort of amendment. We believe that small business is the engine room of the economy and that the rollover relief will encourage further expansion and employment growth in this sector. It is pretty obvious to anybody who thinks about it. We listened to small business in this area and this is one of the major planks of what they were saying to us. Clearly the opposition and certainly their opposition spokesman did not listen at all.Secondly, the purpose of restricting rollover relief to active assets is so that the relief is only available in respect of assets directly linked to generating employment. That is why that is there. Again, I do not think that the opposition have actually read what is in the bill.It calls on the government to closely monitor the integrity of the tax system in the light of the capital gains tax changes. They are nice sounding words in this amendment but I really find this criticism very interesting indeed. The opposition is all over the place on this measure; there is no doubt about that. On the one hand, it is frustrated that it was not able to come up with such an idea as we have and is showing its annoyance. On the other hand, it criticises us saying that company shares are not eligible for the rollover relief. It then states it is concerned about the integrity of the taxation system. How can you run both arguments on the floor of a parliament; they are totally contradictory.Thirdly, this amendment put by the opposition says:Reverse the reduction in the minimum proportion of the work force which must be invited to participate in an ESOP.As the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) would know, the provisions in the bill implement the coalitions election commitment to provide more generous tax treatment for employee share schemes. That includes easing the employee participation conditions.We, unlike Labor, framed these changes to recognise that the employee share schemes contribute to strengthening employee participation in Australian business and to encouraging voluntary savings. These changes have been welcomed by all but the Labor Party. Everybody out there—employees and employers—have welcomed these changes. It is fairly natural that they would. Why is the Labor Party being totally ignorant of the desires of the overwhelming majority of Australian employees?Finally, the second reading amendment asks the government to reverse the proposed limitation of accelerated depreciation to shipping. The repeal of section 57AM gives effect to the governments election commitment to repeal the Ships Capital Grants Act 1987 and related accelerated depreciation provisions. This government believes that the Australian taxpayer cannot be expected to continue pouring capital grants and depreciation concessions into the shipping industry when it failed to address the serious problems impeding development as an efficient and competitive world class industry.I would also like to touch briefly on a number of issues raised in debate concerning the capital gains tax rollover relief for small business. Certain speakers referred to comments reported in the Financial Review today by the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants. The ASCPA have raised two major concerns, and I would just like to quickly go over them. Firstly, there is the ineligibility from rollover relief where shares in a small business are sold and where that relief is available only as a trade&hyphen;off against the 50 per cent goodwill exemption. When a taxpayer chooses to rollover a capital gain made on a disposed or goodwill replacement asset, the 50 per cent of goodwill exemption is deferred, not lost. The exemption will be available when the replacement asset is eventually disposed of.Secondly, both of these design features were specifically highlighted in the budget announcement and are necessary to prevent abuse of the provision. Thirdly, the ASCPA were involved in the consultative process on the legislation for the measure after the budget. They did not raise any objections to either design feature at the time, so there was consultation with the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants. We did listen to them, and they did not raise any objections to that design feature.Fourthly, a small business operated through a company structure can be sold in two ways: by selling the shares in the company, or by selling the underlined active assets. Rollover relief will only be available where the underlying assets are sold. While this may not always be the preferred method of disposal in some cases, this must be weighed up against the value of the rollover relief to the taxpayer, and a threat to the revenue of the measure to be extended to the sale of shares. If the measure were extended to the sale of shares, the legislation would be even more complex if the revenue were to be protected.Comments were also made concerning the proposed amendments to section 160ZZS relating to additional compliance costs. The point that was overlooked in those comments was that the budget announcement and this legislation contain some significant concessions. Firstly, the amendment defers the date at which the assets lose their pre&hyphen;CGT status, from the date when the majority underlying ownership changed to when the test of underlying ownership is required to be conducted. And, secondly, where a change in ownership has been found, entities will be able to determine the cost base for CGT purposes on the basis of market value at the date that the test was required, rather than valuing the assets at the market value on the date on which the underlying ownership actually changed.We are opposed to the amendment which was brought by the opposition into the Main Committee and, hopefully, I have addressed some of the issues which were raised by some of the speakers and by some of the bodies outside this House that have expressed some concerns. We believe, as the government, that this legislation is vitally important to small business throughout this country of ours. It will underpin employment opportunities and will give small business a break. It is costing the budget $200 million per year, and that is a massive boost, we believe, to small business. We think that Australian families throughout this country will benefit from this measure. We oppose the amendment put forward by the opposition and I request everybody to give support to the amendment bill as proposed by the government.Amendment negatived.Original question resolved in the affirmative.Bill read a second time.Motion ( by Mr Miles ) agreed to:That further proceedings on this bill be conducted in the House.","N/A","TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 4) 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[1]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

548,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Mrs WEST","XK6","(Bowman)","LP","N/A",2101,"—It gives me a great deal of pleasure to speak today in support of Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and cognate bills. The bills cover a wide range of departments and will impact in many positive ways right across Australia, including in my own electorate of Bowman.I am going to concentrate on areas which, in my opinion, will have a significant effect on many of my constituents. Unlike many of the members opposite, I will not waste time quibbling over areas on which I may or may not personally agree. It is better to take these matters as a whole rather than waste time tearing them apart and moving amendment after amendment.Members opposite have spent much time deriding these bills and pulling them to pieces, suggesting savings here and there. Would they like money cut from the veterans childrens education scheme, or cutbacks on pharmaceutical benefits, or perhaps the War Memorial or the War Graves Commission could do with a cutback? However, there is one payment they will not be arguing about, and that appears on page 17 of Appropriation Bill (No. 4). It deals with legal costs incurred by, or on account of acting for, Dr Carmen Lawrence for or in relation to the Marks royal commission. The amounts are: additional appropriation, $49,776; total appropriation for the year, $319,927.I digress. I actually came to speak about the positive aspects of these bills. Let me start with the environment, of which I am very fond—particularly the environment of Moreton Bay and surrounding areas. I have made no secret of my love for this area. I am deeply honoured that I am fortunate enough to be the member responsible for such a magnificent area.These bills include provision for National Landcare, the Australian Heritage Commission, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Australian Institute of Marine Science, Australian fisheries management, fisheries resource research, Australian maritime safety and search and rescue. All of these areas have an impact on my electorate.Moreton Bay is recognised as one of the most significant breeding grounds in Australia for a variety of fish, crustaceans and marine life. There is also a substantial colony of dugong and a large population of dolphins. With the increased usage of the bay for both recreational and industrial purposes it is increasingly important that proper management of the bay be considered.Currently, there is a major dispute over state government plans to change policy on crabbing operations in the bay. A number of professional and recreational crabbers and fishermen have approached me with their concerns. It has been put to me that, should the current catch quota continue unabated, Moreton Bays crab stocks will be depleted within a matter of two years.There is also a considerable problem with the continual raping and pillaging of all varieties of sea life through trawling. It would seem that some professional fishermen have little regard for the future viability of the bay. The commercial fishermen have put it to me that as an industry they need these changes to the catch allowance, as there is growing demand for their product at the markets.Their other point is that this industry supports a growing number of families. If this is the case, then better management strategies need to be used to ensure future viability of fishing for all those involved, not just the commercial fishermen but recreational fishermen as well. It is the long&hyphen;term future of the fishing industry that is at stake at this point in time. With over 7,000 recreational fishermen using the bay regularly, depletion of fish stocks has been a concern for many of these fishermen. To ensure the future viability of this industry, it is essential that we continue to fund research into fish stocks in this and many other areas of Australia.In Bowman, I am fortunate to have a variety of research and breeding facilities. In Cleveland, there is the CSIRO, which is conducting research into a variety of marine species. I have met with Dr Ian Poiner and Mr Peter Rothlisberg and have seen the variety of facilities that are being used to continue their most important work. They are also doing considerable research into aquaculture.Down the road at Thornlands, I have a prawn farm and a yabby farm, both of which are working on new and more efficient means of farming their product. And on North Stradbroke Island there is the University of Queensland Marine Research Station. This station, which I have referred to previously in this House, is conducting research into everything from exotic marine algae to the effect of yabby pumping.The work of these groups will benefit both the recreational and commercial fishing industries. In fact, through the work of the marine research station, new research methods have been developed which have led to advances in environmental monitoring. Future research includes a study into the influence on sand erosion of dredging, land reclamation and the construction of jetties, boardwalks, groynes and seawalls. This sort of research will be of benefit to many areas, not just to Moreton Bay.Only recently, there was discussion on the Gold Coast about the effectiveness of seawalls. Every time we have big seas combined with king tides, the beaches on the Gold Coast disappear. The popular solution has been to build another seawall. Recent data would seem to show that this is not the correct course of action.Similarly, how many members present have enjoyed a moonlit walk along the boardwalk at Noosa? It is very pleasant indeed, but what is the long&hyphen;term effect of this structure? Without continuing research where will our coastline be in 20, 15 or even 10 years?I also ask those keen fishermen present: when was the last time you took home a decent feed of fish? I do not mean two or three whiting or a couple of bream; I mean a catch that would feed half&hyphen;a&hyphen;dozen friends at a barbecue. Recreational fishermen in my electorate tell me that the humble mud crab is becoming increasingly scarce in Moreton Bay and surrounding estuaries.If we continue down this track, where will the fish be for my grandchildren? A fishing trip of the future could well become a sitting trip where you may be lucky to spot the marine life. There will come a point in time when we will not even bother to bait our hooks because there will be nothing to take our worms.I say again that we need to manage our fisheries now and we need to do it properly. To this end, I would like to congratulate the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer) for his work in this area. The minister, to his credit, chose North Stradbroke Island to launch the governments new fishing code.However, Moreton Bay and the surrounding coastline are more than just a significant fishing ground; they are also the habitat for a variety of seabirds, and the wetlands area around Manly was considered as a Ramsar site. We must do what we can to protect this delicate area, and I believe that through the coasts and clean seas initiative we will be able to do just that.Future development of the foreshores needs to be closely monitored to balance environmental concerns with maintaining its economic viability. The complete oversight of all the activity carried out in the bay, along the foreshores and around and on the islands, needs to be carefully managed and monitored to cater for the diverse groups that share this waterway and adjacent environment.All relevant interest groups that use the area for recreational, residential, industrial, manufacturing or employment purposes need to be encompassed under an umbrella of one authority to coordinate the whole development of the bay. For too long, the overall management of everyday business in the bay has been ad hoc and uncoordinated, with conflict arising from special interest groups having too great an input into the extraction of resources and riding roughshod over general environmental concerns.One single authority would include representatives from the port of Brisbane and the Gateway port authority, local, state and federal decision makers, environmental groups, commercial and recreational fishers, business, tourist and residential groups. As all sections with a specific interest in the bay are represented, the continuous monitoring of development and use of the bay would be in a better state than they are at present.The objectives of the recently announced Australian oceans policy can foster and develop such a concept of a single Moreton Bay authority with further work and consultation from all interested parties. I admit this is not a new idea. Previous elected representatives have raised this concept but nothing eventuated. Anyone with a genuine commitment to the long&hyphen;term future for the sustainability of human habitation and industry in the bayside area could see that this policy can provide a wonderful opportunity to apply for assistance to make this come to fruition. It will not be an easy task but it is well worth fighting for.It is possible to have both economic viability and environmental management; we just have to be smarter about how we handle these developments. Unfortunately, when you have such a magnificent body of water, and enticing islands, you will also attract a large number of people. This, in itself, is not a huge problem. However, not everyone is as responsible as we would like and not everyone has the skill or knowledge to handle difficult situations. Mother nature can be both kind and cruel and Moreton Bay is not a place for the faint&hyphen;hearted when she turns nasty.On one of my recent trips across the bay to North Stradbroke, I had the privilege of accompanying the state minister for emergency services and the local Air Sea Rescue crew. They were possibly the roughest conditions I have ever encountered in the bay—there were 25&hyphen;knot winds; I do not mean the company on board! However, these men told me that it was nothing compared to what some fools will attempt and, unfortunately, when these reckless idiots get themselves into trouble in the middle of the bay it is these brave men and women from Air Sea Rescue who have to risk their lives to save them. The men and women of Air Sea Rescue give up their time and put their own bodies on the line for very little reward. It can also be a very gruesome job. Quite often it will be the Air Sea Rescue crew who have to pull the body of a victim from the water. This is not a job I would care to do. However, when the rewards come they can be great. This was obvious from the emotion shown by the Australian Navy officers who recently effected the rescue of the round the world yachtsmen. The sense of achievement these men must have felt would have been enough to make them forget the risks they took. For my local Air Sea Rescue crew, the elation of saving a life on Moreton Bay would be no less than it was for these brave naval officers.There is also a great need for the provision of emergency services on Moreton Island, another of the idyllic but remote areas in my electorate. Representatives of the Koringal community approached me recently to see what could be done to overcome a most extraordinary problem. When an accident occurs on Moreton Island the locals contact the Royal Flying Doctor Service in Charleville, an arrangement which seems strange when the Royal Brisbane Hospital is just two hours away and the recently upgraded ambulance station on North Stradbroke Island is just half an hour away by helicopter.I will digress for just a moment to congratulate the work being done on North Stradbroke by Dr Frank Carrol and Sister Dorothy Gerkhe of the Marie Rose facility. They do a tremendous job under sometimes trying circumstances.Back to Moreton: in recent times there have been two deaths both of which could have been prevented had they received emergency care sooner. I will continue to work for the Koringal residents association to ensure that this and other remote areas of my electorate receive adequate emergency medical services. You may be forgiven for thinking my electorate of Bowman consists solely of water. This is not the case.I would like to turn my attention to another section of the bill, and that is the additional appropriation for assistance to people with disabilities. Just this week I had great pleasure in confirming additional funding and employment places for people with disabilities in my electorate. Both the Horizon Foundation and Bayside GATE Employment Service have received extra funding for the disabled. I met with representatives from both these organisations recently to discuss their needs. So, naturally, I was very pleased to be able to ring them earlier this week with the good news.These services provide a vital service to the local community. The projects being run by the Horizon Foundation include Dial&hyphen;A&hyphen;Mower service, a service called Wire and Wood, and Link Personnel. As its name implies, the Dial&hyphen;A&hyphen;Mower service is operated by a team of workers and run as a mobile garden care business. Wire and Wood is a business activity which produces wood products and which currently holds a significant market share. Both Link and Bayside GATE are open employment services which provide employment opportunities for the disabled in the local area. In total, the new services funding is for 11 positions.With the increase of over $70,000, the total recurrent funding for Bowman is just short of $700,000, an increase of almost 12 per cent. I spoke to the directors of these services shortly after receiving the information and both were very happy with the increase. Both services have assured me that the increase in funding will go a long way to providing much needed employment opportunities for the disabled. These people have an enormous contribution to make to our communities and the governments commitment to these services is to be applauded. I am committed to helping these people gain and maintain employment and it is only through budgetary measures, such as the ones we are discussing here today that we can achieve this.Another area in which my constituents will benefit is through the increased funding for black spots. Road trauma costs the residents of Redland Shire $10 million per year. In the past 12 months we have seen four deaths in the Redland Shire and 57 casualties. Under the governments black spot funding program, local communities are being encouraged to identify black spots in their community. In my electorate of Bowman we have several potential sites. I will be encouraging local residents and community groups to put forward submissions to the minister for funding.Two such areas are School Road in Capalaba and the corner of Finucane Road and Cambridge Drive in Alexandra Hills. School Road is being treated as a speedway by local hoons who show very little respect for either the local residents or for the hundreds of school children who use the road every day. The corner that I mentioned was the site of a fatality on New Years Day this year. An elderly lady was struck by a car as she crossed the road. It is not uncommon for pedestrians to come to grief on this corner, as usually confusion reigns supreme. To make matters worse, it is used by a great number of school students and parents. It links a child&hyphen;care centre, a primary school, a high school and a shopping centre—a lethal combination if ever there was one.The black spot program, initiated by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp), is one of the most worthwhile introduced by this government. Again, it would not be possible without the funding being provided by these bills. The road toll across this nation, particularly in regional and rural Australia, is unacceptably high. However, instead of legislating to solve the problem, as the former government was prone to do, this government would rather educate and give the community ownership of the program.I could speak on many more of the worthwhile aspects of this bill, however, I know many of my colleagues would also like an opportunity to do so. In short, if we are to see this country go forward we have to pass these bills. It is for this, and for the reasons that I have outlined, that I commend this bill to the House.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1996&hyphen;97 Cognate bills: APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 4) 1996&hyphen;97 APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1996&hyphen;97","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
549,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Mr MOSSFIELD","MK6","(Greenway)","ALP","N/A",2105,"—I rise to speak on the appropriation bills as they apply to the coalition governments industry policies. This is not unrelated to the debate that we had in this chamber this morning. My speech is made against the background of a mixed industry response to government industry policy. Last Saturday, 1 March, in the Australian , there were headlines that said `Flotsam of policy leaves captains of industry all at sea: John Howard promised a cohesive plan for industry. A year later, business is still waiting. There was also an article last week in the Australian Financial Review relating to manufacturing increasing as a percentage of exports. The article says that the national chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, Mr Alan Handberg, stressed that the growth in manufactured exports was unlikely to be sustained without a national plan, and that manufactured exports still lagged a long way behind manufactured imports.So there is still a long way to go, but I see manufacturing as having the potential to fill the employment gap between the high wage, high skill industries, where there is not a lot of employment growth, and the low wage, part&hyphen;time and casual employment areas where most of this countrys employment growth is. The recently released ABS employment figures show that 38,400 new jobs were created in January. However, nearly 35,000 of these were part time. To highlight a problem that this is creating in the training area—I know the honourable member for Latrobe (Mr Charles) would be quite interested in this—I will quote from a paper given by Richard Sweet from the Dusseldorp Skills Forum at the Tasmanian Education Consortium in Hobart, which was held on 10 to 12 October last year. It states:In May 1996 part&hyphen;time work accounted for a quarter of all employment, but in retail trade and the accommodation and hospitality industries it accounted for one job in two. In the service sector in particular the rapid growth of part&hyphen;time casual employment, among both adults and among young people, has severely limited the scope for apprenticeships or traineeships to establish themselves, as the existing models are largely based upon the assumption that both young people and those that supervise and train them in the workplace have a full&hyphen;time job.I believe that the manufacturing industry can provide the real jobs, the training and employment growth and the fair wage rates that middle Australia is crying out for. Yet under the coalitions policy of cutting assistance, manufacturing industry is not being able to reach its full potential. In fact, the long&hyphen;term prediction for our manufacturing industry is far from rosy. Surely this must be of some concern to the government.If we look at what industry is saying, we can get a clearer position of how industry sees the future. I looked back over the last nine months to see what business commentators, business reports and surveys were saying. In June last year, a survey by the Australian Business Chamber and the State Bank of 500 New South Wales companies showed that the June quarter was the sixth in a row where production, sales and orders had all weakened. In response, companies were reducing prices and cutting back on employment.We saw the same two organisations reporting in September that Australian manufacturers were continuing to experience adverse conditions. The prediction in that survey was that manufacturing could shed as many as 15,000 jobs in the year ahead due to these adverse conditions. Mr Philip Holt, the managing director of the Australian Business Chamber, said at the time that several factors were affecting business conditions in manufacturing—and he listed them—but, clearly, Mr Holts major concern related to the governments lack of commitment to a strong, clear industry policy.This lack of leadership in industry policy was further amplified at a dinner hosted by the Heavy Engineering Manufacturers Association, whose membership includes major companies such as BHP, Transfield and ANI. The chairman of the St George Bank and Howard Smith Ltd, Mr Frank Conroy, told the dinner that there was a `vacuum of embarrassed silence on key issues relating to industry and employment. In his speech at the associations dinner, on 9 October in Canberra, Mr Conroy said:Perhaps even more frightening is that there is no apparent answer to the problem of employment. Worse, there is very little serious public debate or understanding of what might be an acceptable level of unemployment in todays fast changing economy.Indeed, the phrase itself has fallen into disuse politically, perhaps because there are no apparent answers, perhaps because scapegoats are easier to find than answers.N/AMr Deputy Speaker, you can see that industry itself is certainly not conveying a lot of confidence in the governments policy. In August, a visiting Harvard economist Mr Jeffrey Sachs, while praising some of the economic reforms introduced in Australia was nevertheless critical of Australias lack of encouragement for manufacturing exports. In his talks in Australia, Sachs referred to the successful Asian economies where special export manufacturing zones, with tax holidays and other assistance, are designed to attract foreign investors. Some of those may well be disgruntled Australian manufacturers.In October we saw a report which referred to a survey carried out by Price Waterhouse that showed that the federal governments decision to drop research and development tax concessions from 150 per cent to 125 per cent could reduce business expenditure on R&D to early 1980s levels. The survey covered 250 businesses in technology, mining, telecommunications, building, food, chemicals, pharmaceutical and manufacturing, and showed that more than half expected to reduce their R&D investment by 20 per cent or more because of changes to R&D assistance.An article in the Financial Review of 13 February this year says:Companies have little faith in government industry policy and the cut to the research and development tax concessions has made them less likely to undertake risky R&D or even claim the reduced concession.The article referred to a survey released on 12 February by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu which showed that only 16 per cent of respondents believed that the government was achieving its industry policy objectives. Seventy&hyphen;five per cent of respondents said that the government was not providing adequate support for promising new industries with strong international potential. The survey also found that 83 per cent of firms believed that cuts to R&D tax concessions would inhibit industrys quest for high growth. What an absolute indictment of a government decision.The growth areas in manufacturing are those that require a high degree of research and development. Some of these areas cover groups such as computers, general electronics, scientific instruments, cars and pharmaceuticals. Yet we have seen the government stripping back assistance to these industries. The Metal Trades Industry Associations December 1996 quarterly survey of business conditions showed a pick&hyphen;up of sectional activities, but this was largely seasonal. The MTIA Chief Executive, Mr Bob Herbert, said:No early return to the more robust demand conditions that prevailed in 1994&hyphen;95 is anticipated.The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has called for an overhaul of the federal governments industry policy, including the restoration of the research and development tax concession.Among the many ACCI submissions to the governments review of industry assistance programs was a call for Australia not to move too quickly on tariff reductions until the government was satisfied that Australia has a fair and reasonable access to overseas markets. A report in the Australian of 18 February said:Female factory workers have borne the brunt of job losses caused by tariff cuts in the textile, clothing and footwear industry, with 26,000 laid off in the last two years, a study shows.An analysis prepared for the Productivity Commissions inquiry into the textile, clothing and footwear industries reveals manufacturing production is the lowest in 20 years, with profits approaching the low level recorded in the 1990&hyphen;91 recession.The productivity slump has cost 20,000 jobs in two years with employment dropping from 124,000 workers in November 1994 to 104,000 in November 1995.N/AThe Australian Chamber of Manufactures in its submission to the Mortimer review of Australias business program said that the manufacturing share of the Australian economy had fallen from 24 per cent in 1970 to 14.7 per cent now. The ACM calls for: firstly, restoration of export development and R&D funding to at least the level applying before the 1996&hyphen;97 budget cuts; secondly, bilateral negotiations to secure for Australian manufacturers the same treatment in overseas markets as exporters from these countries receive in Australia; and, thirdly, expansion of the activities by the Industrial Supplies Office and establishment of a major regional development program.I want to expand a little on the third point of the ACMs submission to the inquiry relating to the Industrial Supplies Office. I was pleased to receive in the mail recently a copy of the New South Wales Industrial Supplies Offices annual review for 1995&hyphen;96. The role of the New South Wales ISO is to source for Australian industry goods and products manufactured in Australia and so reduce Australias reliance on imports.The executive director of ISO reported in the annual review that 1995&hyphen;96 had been a very successful year for the New South Wales ISO, with the organisation having participated in projects which have returned $145 million worth of business to Australian manufacturers. New South Wales manufacturers received $65 million in orders, which, according to ISO economic multipliers, converted to approximately 1,900 New South Wales jobs.As a nation we are relying too heavily on imports to meet local demands for manufactured goods—as we all know. Our reliance on imports is a major contributor to Australias disastrous balance of payments figures—our current account deficit was $1.4 billion in December last year.Mr Bert Evans, Chairman of the New South Wales ISO, said in the annual report:Consider our 1995/96 import bill of $77 billion. If we replaced just five per cent of that with local production we could create 113,000 new jobs; over $1 billion in extra taxes and charges to governments; nearly $1 billion in welfare savings; and nearly $900 million in extra consumer spending. These are the objectives that the ISO is endeavouring to achieve.Rather than depend on restricting imports by tariff and non&hyphen;tariff barriers, the ISO lets the market decide what imports should be replaced. By matching the needs of purchasers, who would otherwise be importing, to the industrial capacity of Australian manufacturing the ISO has replaced imports on a commercially viable basis.The ISO has been successful in convincing many Australian industries to switch to locally made products based on cost and quality. This means that the economic growth which occurs with the replacement of these imports has been achieved without adding to inflation. By buying better value, these purchasers actually contribute to the control of inflation.During its 12 years of operation, the ISO has been demonstrating how to develop industry and create jobs through import replacement. The annual report highlights a number of major projects that the ISO has been involved in over the past 12 months. I intend to briefly mention some of these projects as outlined in the review.The Sydney airport noise attenuation project required airconditioning of houses and schools under the flight paths and for these premises to be completely sealed and insulated against noise. A major problem arose as to how to provide fresh air and how to aircondition insulated buildings. These problems were overcome by the ISO Commonwealth purchasing consultant developing a unique in&hyphen;loft airconditioning unit. The solution of this problem has resulted in Emailair and its Australian suppliers benefiting by more than a million dollars, and it has placed Australian companies in the forefront of domestic airconditioning internationally.ISO involvement has led to Australias only spark plug manufacturer, Champion, replacing its wide use of imported steel rod with a BHP product which will result in millions of dollars worth of export income for Australia. ISO has also targeted overseas manufacturers to replace steel intensive imports with Australian made steel. The program has resulted in one manufacturer of 50&hyphen; to 120&hyphen;tonne mining trucks, who was about to import onto the Australian market, being introduced to local manufacturers capable of producing payload trays. An additional $3 million of work for Australia also is being targeted in the ship container market.Also, the close working relationship developed between the New South Wales ISO and the Australian defence industry has exposed many Hunter region manufacturers to the world of leading edge defence technology. This exposure has come about through the construction, at Carrington, of one of the most advanced naval vessels in the world. After just two years into an eight&hyphen;year contract, the Australian industry involvement in this project is already set to exceed 69 per cent of the $1.2 billion total contract value. Of the 1,150 active suppliers to the project, over 900 are Australian and New Zealand companies and more than half of them are based in the Hunter region. The approach by ISO and ADI has enabled local capacity to develop the Hunter region into one of the worlds most advanced shipbuilding centres.The ISO annual review also reported on a successful project involving ISO, Davey John Brown Pty Ltd and BHP Steel. The joint effort related to the No. 6 blast furnace at the BHP Port Kembla facility. While ISO located suitable Australian manufacturers for different components, Davey John Brown Pty Ltd and BHP negotiated with offshore equipment designers to have their designs built locally rather than in foreign workshops. The $10 million of extra local business for this project will create approximately 300 extra jobs and place some $2.6 million in consumer spending power into the pockets of Australian families. The development of regional manufacturing capacity, as detailed in the minehunter and BHP projects, is being encouraged by the New South Wales ISO establishing regional offices in the Illawarra, Orange and Albury.Mr Deputy Speaker, it is appropriate that you arrived in the chair at this time, as I was speaking about the great value that ISO has brought to the industry in Port Kembla. I am a strong supporter of the Industrial Supplies Office—I am not too sure whether you are familiar with its role. As I understand, it is basically funded by the New South Wales government. However, there is a peak national body called the ISO network, and I would appeal to the current federal government to look strongly at the work that this organisation does because it does a great job for Australian industry.You can see from these remarks that the ISO network is playing a major role in sourcing work for Australian industry. I understand that, under the previous Labor governments industry policy, some 13 consultants were funded to work with various ISO networks throughout Australia in specific fields. I am concerned that this current government will cut the funding for these consultants. I would urge the government to follow the Australian Chamber of Manufactures suggestion and expand the activities of the Industrial Supplies Office in the interests of manufacturing industry in Australia.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1996&hyphen;97 Cognate bills: APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 4) 1996&hyphen;97 APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1996&hyphen;97","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
550,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Mr EOIN CAMERON","6V5","(Stirling)","LP","N/A",2109,"—I would like to bring to the attention of the parliament a report following my original concerns in regard to Cash Converters which I aired in the last parliament. The report was prepared by Mr Terry Donnelly of Western Australia. Mr Donnelly is not a professional investigator; he has no personal or vested interest in the subject matter of this report. He does have a history of honorary work in crime prevention and control, being the founder of the concept of Crime Free Day, as well as having been chairman of Citysafe Perth Community Policing Committee and a member of the Safer Australia board, established by the then federal Minister for Justice, Mr Duncan Kerr.Many of the documents on which the author has relied came to him directly from former employees and franchisees of the Cash Converters group. As a result of his experiences over three years, he feels entitled to ask one question:When I was able, with so few resources, to unearth so much that cried out for investigation, why is it that these are areas where the various law enforcement agencies of Australia appear so reluctant to enter?N/ACash Converters Pty Ltd was registered on 6 January 1988. According to its documents of incorporation, the companys principal business activity was to be that of `franchisor.The trading company began its operations in Western Australia where it opened a handful of stores. After that, expansion was rapid. In April 1995, following some changes in the composition of its board of directors, the trading companys shares were acquired by a new company called Cash Converters International Ltd, the `holding company. Thirty&hyphen;five per cent of the share capital in the holding company was floated on the London stock market in December 1995. By that time there were 129 Cash Converters stores in Australia. In addition, there were 85 overseas stores.The public trading activities that the Cash Converters group support are pawnbroking and dealing in second&hyphen;hand goods. Both are regulated businesses, the first being concerned with lending on the security of goods and the second with the simple purchase and resale of goods. Because of the high interest rates charged by pawnbrokers to their customers and the wide margins expected by dealers on buying and selling goods, both these operations form highly profitable businesses. But, above all else, they need substantial working capital. The Cash Converters group has gone beyond the simple practice of pawnbroking and dealing to develop the concept of packaging and franchising those activities.There are a handful of key individuals whose influence on the organisation is all&hyphen;pervading. Brian Cumins is the founder of the business. He personally opened the first Cash Converters pawnbroking shop in Perth, Western Australia. George McIntosh Smith was involved formerly with Brian Cumins in his Bed Shed business. He is a director of Kundahera Pty Ltd, the franchisee of Cash Converters Subiaco; a director of Cumbri Enterprises Pty Ltd, the franchisee of Cash Converters Fremantle; and a director of Sunvale Pty Ltd, the franchisee of Cash Converters Bunbury.Craig Eric Green operates franchises at Melville, Cannon Hill and Stones Corner in Queensland. Peter Cumins is the younger brother of Brian Cumins and a qualified accountant with a civil service background. Michael Ian Cooke is a solicitor who has practised for some years in Western Australia. His practice has handled Cash Converters non&hyphen;contentious legal work since 1992. Wayne Hubbard and his brother Russell are the largest franchisees in Australia, having numerous stores in Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria.I would now like to highlight some accounting and administrative irregularities. First, the cost of establishing each new trading outlet is typically between $200,000 and $500,000. Apart from initial setting&hyphen;up costs and usual business overheads, trading itself makes enormous cash demands—at least during the first two or three years. The operation was only established in 1988 and it now has nearly 200 outlets around the world. This has required far more money than is disclosed anywhere in the accounts of the various group companies lodged with the Australian Securities Commission.Second, individual bookkeeping irregularities are necessarily complicated to demonstrate, but are to be found throughout the companies financial documents. For the sake of convenience, these are highlighted as and where they have been discovered among the case histories of failed franchises set out in appendix 6 to the report by Terry Donnelly.Third, there is a curious anomaly in the April 1994 prospectus concerning the finance company. In it, the auditors are shown as Messrs Murphy Sherry and Co., 1st floor, 885 Albany Highway, East Victoria Park, Western Australia. The independent auditors report is provided on the letterhead of Messrs Murphy Sherry and Co. showing their address as 305 Abernethy Road, Cloverdale, Western Australia, and giving telephone numbers pertinent to Accountancy WA and Half Price Accounting, of which R.J.Murphy is the principal.The reality is that Murphy Sherry and Co. did not move out of the Victoria Park address—Cash Converters own main office—until after or about April 1995. The false statement maintained, over a very long period, the illusion of the auditors physical separation from the trading company. It ought to be a matter of concern to the ASC that this irregularity was allowed to persist in the important area of information provided in a registered prospectus.Fourth, when the holding companys shares were floated in late 1995, Henderson Crosthwaite, as the companys UK institutional directors, correctly stated on behalf of the holding company that the potential for its continued growth depended on the requirement that `all existing outlets continue to trade, and continue to make their contracted weekly payments.Similarly, the directors of Franchise Investments International Ltd—another group company—stated at pages 25 and 26 of their prospectus, dated 24 July 1996, that the risk factor of investing in their company was `the financial security of Cash Converters International Ltd and hence the reputation of the Cash Converters system is substantially dependent on the continued success of the Cash Converters franchised outlets linked to `the continued ability of franchises to pay contracted fees to the company as and when they fall due.Notwithstanding the above statement contained in prospectus documents for the information of potential investors, the accounts of the holding company prior to its flotation failed to make any provision for the fact that by October 1995 the companys Victorian franchisees were in arrears to the extent of over at least $400,000 and that the majority of its Victorian franchisees were struggling to meet their obligations. Those same facts were not made public in the holding companys prospectus dated 16 October 1995, which was approved by its directors, its auditors and both the Australian stockbroker, Morgan Stockbroking Ltd, and the UK stockbroker, Henderson Crosthwaite Corporation Finance Ltd.Franchising, as a business solution to the inherent problem of expanding while under&hyphen;capitalised, was explored for the trading company in a thoroughly researched feasibility study prepared in 1988 by Penny Kirby of All Media Direct. She is the wife of Barrington Kirby who was originally a director of the trading company but had resigned in 1990. In the `Cash Converters story, 1995 at page 64, Brian Cumins lists the common benefits of franchising as follows: first, the franchisee gets to operate under an accepted and well known trading name. Second, a business management system which is proven and tested is supplied. Third, head office makes sure that physical support is available during the commissioning process of a new franchise. Fourth, information on how to handle legal, accounting, taxation and employment regulations is immediately available. Fifth, training is provided and professional marketing services are handled on a centralised basis which allows for economies of scale. Sixth, it is in the interests of franchisors to make their businesses work, it is against their interests to allow a franchisee to fail, and they tend to react accordingly. Seven, new franchisees are chosen with great care, and not simply because they have the licence fee available. This has the effect of screening out those who are patently unsuitable. Eight, statistics show that 90 per cent of franchised businesses survive and flourish.Such ideals have not characterised the Cash Converters system of franchising. Nearly 70 per cent of their Victorian franchises have failed.Subjugation by debt has been achieved by Cash Converters Pty Ltd by enforcing the following key elements: first is the enforcement of initial and weekly licence fees, the former being known as a fixed fee, though in reality it is a sum of money ranging from $50,000 to $200,000 per store, apparently based on no better criteria than what each franchisee could bear. The weekly fee tends to start at around $500 and rise annually to $1,500 reviewed thereafter on CPI changes.Second is the enforcement of a training levy debited monthly to the franchisee whether or not he uses the Cash Converters training program. Third, there is an advertising levy of 7.5 per cent of gross bookings charged to each franchisee. Such advertising is controlled entirely by the trading company, which retains any discounts obtained and fails to account properly for its charges. Some amazing calculations and extracts from the trading companys standard franchise agreement are set out in appendix 5. The real effect is that the genuine franchisees are in fact subsidising the advertising costs of those outlets under the control of the trading companys core directors.Fourth, every franchisee must initially invest $5,000 in the Cash Converters finance company and agree to vest all share voting rights and interest earned in Cash Converters Pty Ltd. In addition, each franchisee must advance to the finance company a monthly sum to build a capital fund to enable renewal of the franchise on expiry of the prior term. These payments are received by the finance company as subscriptions for unsecured notes, and therefore constitute an interest free loan to the finance company. The right, title and interest of the franchisee in and to the notes is assigned and mortgaged to the franchisor.Upon assignment, expiration or termination of the franchise agreement, the franchisee is required to sell his shares to the franchisor for $1 per share. Ostensibly, these payments are for the renewal of the franchise at the end of each 10 years. In fact, with the constant turnover of franchises, this scheme allows the key players access to a massive ongoing cash flow—an enhanced debt subjugation of the franchisees. Most loans that the author of this report has cited have been made to enable franchisees to pay arrears of advertising and franchise fees.Brian Cumins has often remarked that Cash Converters franchises are sold on the sizzle and not the sausage. Much of that sizzling has occurred in Victoria, which was targeted by the company following Mrs Kirbys bullish feasibility study. Some of the result in human cost is exemplified in the case history summarised in appendix 6. These represent just a handful of the many franchise breakdowns where the only beneficiary was the trading company or one of its associated companies.It can be argued that the franchisees entered freely into their standard contracts and have to accept them. Against that, all the evidence is that it is the policy of the trading company to dissuade incomers from taking independent legal or accounting advice. The accounting practices are unfair; the contracts themselves deliberately fail to provide any dispute resolution procedures or arbitration clauses; and the manipulation of the contracts by the trading company amounts to systematic oppression of those who are in a manifestly weaker bargaining position.One of the main themes of the report has been the inherent commercial impossibility of expanding so rapidly a cash hungry business that has no obvious sources of funding. The existence in Australia of large sums of black money is an officially acknowledged fact. Money laundering, in the sense of trying in financial terms to legitimise such cash in the hands of its possessor, is a task that occupies the minds and ingenuity of many. One typical way is to feed the cash into an apparently respectable business so that it can be drawn out again in what appears to be a lawful payment or expense.It is from sources such as those that Brian Cumins was able to borrow, at interest rates of around 40 per cent per annum, the funds that would be lent through the stores that he and his fellow directors controlled. As illustrated in appendix 2 of the report, the same funds would be lent to Cash Converters clients, borrowing at interest rates of 30 per cent per month.Even on the evidence of disclosed accounts, huge amounts of cash have been injected into Cash Converters businesses, always provided that they have been stores in which Brian Cumins has had a personal financial interest. This happened systematically during the companies expansion in Victoria during 1991. As then managing director of the trading company, Brian Cumins lent or invested cash sums totalling not less than $634,043.62 in Cash Converters stores at Dandenong, Moonee Ponds, Preston, Clayton and Forest Hill—all of them stores in which he was financially involved. The details of these are listed in appendix 7.Over the past seven years there has been a sharp increase in the nations crime figures, particularly those involving juveniles. In Western Australia, where Cash Converters has its roots, the number of offences relating to stealing and breaking and entering rose from 87,238 to 133,247—an increase of 65 per cent. In order to fund their expensive habit, young drug addicts steal—often from family and friends—and take the goods to Cash Converters and other pawnbrokers and second&hyphen;hand dealers. Within two hours of committing a break, young criminals have sold the goods, organised their drug purchases and hit up.Modern homes, as we all know, brim with smart items—television sets, computers, hi&hyphen;fis, videos and camcorders—whose great merit is that they are portable, valuable and instantly marketable—as good as cash, in fact, just waiting to be converted. In its simplest form, a desperate addict with a $600&hyphen;a&hyphen;day drug habit will steal goods worth several thousand dollars and pawn or sell them for a few hundred.When South Australian police raided a Cash Converters store in Gouger Street, Adelaide, in April 1996, they found that 40 per cent of the goods held there were reported stolen. The store had been open for four months, but still its opening stock had not been recorded in its books, as legally required. Peter Cumins admitted later that the franchisee at Gouger Street failed to follow the proper procedures in this respect. You can only ask what the proper procedures might be!Another police operation in New South Wales, known as Operation Basalt, led to 135 people being charged on a total of 2,612 counts involving stolen goods worth about $2 million. The much heralded and publicised Cash Converters ID card has not reduced crime against property. Rather, it has led to an increase in the volume of stolen goods being processed through Cash Converters stores. A single example of multiple pawning by a young drug addict holding such a card is set out in appendix 8.The reality is that almost anyone can pass the 100&hyphen;point test to get the ID card and, once in possession of it, there will be few—if any—checks on whether its holder is selling stolen goods. The words of the many innocent victims, helpless in the knowledge that the loss of their possessions has been facilitated by an apparently unregulated system, are represented by the examples set out in appendix 9 of the report. Their names have not been divulged, but all such details are available with supporting documents.On Thursday, 30 November 1995, the holding company, Cash Converters International Ltd, was launched on the London Stock Exchange. In the light of all the comments above and the criticism at the time in the Australian parliament regarding Cash Converters operations, it is surprising that the flotation went ahead and was counted a success. Apart from all other considerations, why should the controlling directors want ownership of the phantom money in the group to pass to outside shareholders? The answer is that it did not. When you have phantom money, it is best to have a phantom flotation.Appendix 10 shows a list extracted from the holding companys register of shareholders following the flotation. It reveals that of the 34 million shares issued by the holding company more than 73 per cent are held behind a screen of nominees. A further two per cent of the floated share capital is owned openly by Brian Cumins and his co&hyphen;directors, Peter Cumins and Michael Cooke, or his other close associates, Simon Martin and Russell Hubbard. All of this, of course, excludes the retained 66 million shares, which remained at all times in the hands of the controlling directors and their associates.In conclusion, having obtained the accolade of a Stock Exchange flotation, the holding company is anxious to press ahead with the marketing of its franchises internationally, but indications are that this is proving more difficult than expected in Europe and the United States of America. It is easy to find victims in the pages of this report: those who have been unwise enough, as outsiders, to invest money as franchisees in the Cash Converters group; those whose goods are stolen, often by family and friends, to provide the raw stock for the pawnbroking and dealing trades; those who pay their taxes knowing that others in their midst are above such concerns; even those with a dependency on drugs who remain beyond help while such a well&hyphen;organised system makes it easy for the desperate to get what they think they need.It is not the task of this report to lay down what should be done, but rather to draw attention to the activities of people who care for nobody but themselves while pretending to offer a public service. If that is the public service, then it is the service that powers the needle on the end of the syringe. I would like to conclude by reading, for the information of the House, a letter that I have sent to the Hon. John Day MP, the Minister for Police and Emergency Services in Western Australia. It reads:I am writing following a complaint concerning Cash Converters. You may be aware of my concerns regarding this chain of stores, and I attach a speech I made to the House of Representatives concerning it. My concern is still as strong as when I made those comments, because still, today, Cash Converters continue to launder stolen goods, unwittingly or otherwise.You may be aware of a theft at a private girls school recently where approximately $20,000 worth of various equipment was stolen, such as microscopes, computer equipment and so on.The thief allegedly took the goods to Cash Converters and sold them to the pawnbroker. It is alleged the computer, worth $7,000, was sold to Cash Converters for $300. There were allegedly no checks made of the equipment, which if any had, would have identified the schools ownership engraved on the equipment.The thief was allegedly tracked down through the compulsory identification checks that now apply and has apparently been charged, however, in the interim, some of the equipment had already been sold and could not be returned to the school.One such piece of equipment was a computer which Cash Converters sold for $3,000. The person who bought the computer `booted it up and the schools identity immediately came up on the screen at the opening of the starting program. The person apparently contacted the school to ask if they had `lost any equipment lately, and was advised that a theft had occurred and equipment had been stolen.The person when advised of the circumstances in which he attained the computer returned it to the school for which Cash Converters refunded him. Unfortunately, the school did not get everything back, and I understand, were not compensated by Cash Converters for the missing equipment. Luckily, they will be protected by their insurance company, but that is not the point (no wonder premiums keep increasing!!).I am dumbfounded that a company receiving and selling stolen goods is able to wash its hands of responsibility for identifying the ownership of goods before it places them on sale. Further, I am appalled that even though they may conduct identification checks, Cash Converters apparently does not check out the property for other identifying marks, in the event it could have been stolen. Surely, when a schools engravings are on the equipment, plus the installed software, then why werent they contacted to determine if the school was missing the equipment before they put it on sale.There is a bit more to go on with, but I have run out of time. I thank you for your time, Mr Deputy Speaker.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1996&hyphen;97 Cognate bills: APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 4) 1996&hyphen;97 APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1996&hyphen;97","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
551,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Mr ADAMS","UNKNOWN","(Lyons)","UNKNOWN","N/A",2115,"—I wish to speak on the appropriation bills on the matter of the economy, with a focus on regions and, in particular, Tasmania. I recently submitted a paper to the Nixon inquiry, which is an inquiry into the Tasmanian economy. I believe that we have to consider the implications of past, current and future policy on the direction that can be taken by areas outside the urban fringes. Tasmania is a good case study, as it holds many of the problems that other states also face.Australia has had a number of challenges over the years. Change has been massive in the past three decades, with technology changing as rapidly in the past 10 years as it has in the past 100. Politicians need to understand the processes of change to adapt their strategies to cope with the results of that change. It is often a fine balancing act of knowing where and when to intervene and when not to, and this is particularly poignant in Tasmania because of its small population and isolation. It being my home state, it must be my prime consideration. However, I am interested in the overall regional economic questions for the country.Current trends in regional development which affect the economic wellbeing of rural and regional areas are infrastructure, transport, unemployment, communications, health, education, energy, banks and commerce, changes in the major industries, growth or decline of regional markets and foreign markets, exports and tourism—to name the major ones. There are also the difficulties of cutting back the public sector without replacing it with some mechanism to assist those who live and work outside urban areas. We should look at the implications of social and technological change on our major resource industries. The sale of government assets—and the impact of the Hilmer report on a community that cannot benefit by either the public or the private sectors economies of scale—is considerable.The size and distribution of the population is a contributing factor to a states ability to deal with regional variations. When the state moves out of an area such as health, who moves in? Those that would like to make a profit at it, and they may not be Australians. Who is buying Australians right to health? Is this bit of the farm being sold as well?In the 1970s, Australia was going through the first throes of massive industrial change and structural adaptation. It was a time of great discussion, and new ideas were on the horizon, with the future being predicted through populist books like Barry Joness Sleepers, Wake! and Alvin Tofflers Future Shock and The Third Wave . We knew there was going to be real change in lifestyle, in economies and in the viewing of work, industrial relations, social breakdown and societal relationships. What we did not know was the sort of effect it would have on peripheral areas or how it could be coped with.The 1970s and the 1980s showed much hope for Australia, but now we have to face the effects of change. As the Chicago Tribune s Bob Herbert wrote in an article on 23 January of this year:As America continues to prosper, there is less and less of a sense that everybody has a stake in what is going on. More and more Americans are being left out.Substitute `Australia for `America, and much the same is occurring. I believe that, under the Howard government, that will be the situation in Australia: more and more people being left out.The communications industry has had a major impact on the Australian scene: whether it be television aggregation, the introduction of mobile phones, fax modems, the Internet and the World Wide Web, all have combined to produce a major post&hyphen;industrial revolution in interpersonal contact. Australia has taken to the technology like a duck to water, and Australians are clamouring to be part of the action. However, we have a big problem in Tasmania, where there has been a number of major problems and setbacks because the infrastructure is not in place.The few opportunities that were fought for, particularly in Lyons, my own electorate, have been either removed or not extended. Examples are the removal of the Community Information Network from the local communities, which particularly affects Lyons; the non&hyphen;extension of the mobile digital phone coverage to the lower east coast, the Tasman Peninsular, the central highlands, and Flinders and King islands; and the difficulties experienced with UHF coverage for television, even in the most populated areas such as New Norfolk, Queenstown and much of the east and west coasts, which have caused major concerns to those communities.Other services, such as telegrams, post office fax facilities, and even an interstate service for finding addresses through Telstra, are non&hyphen;existent, the latter having been removed in November 1996 without public advice, which means that somebody who does not have a fax number and cannot phone is unable to write to a company in another state. Community obligation should ensure that a comparable communications service is available to everyone in Australia. At the moment, only those communities close to urban centres and the cities have access.In the next five years we are looking at some major changes in IT format which will include: multi&hyphen;media with video, graphics, text and Internet activities—for both educational and entertainment purposes; personnel management, systems and office programs to allow more efficiency in offices; on&hyphen;line electronic commerce which is currently being developed by IT but has yet to be introduced fully by the banks.What is the most lucrative part of this industry? It is in its future and Australias ability to gain financially as a nation from being a part of it. Yet this is the area which is being sold off for short&hyphen;term gain, losing us a secure future and our kids a future at all.Federal government policy on tariffs will be of great significance to regional manufacturing investment. There needs to be a politically bipartisan approach in considering the tariff threshold. Tasmania can be the hardest hit when tariffs are lowered or abandoned when overseas competitors are comfortably subsidised. Areas such as dairy produce, car parts manufacturing, clothing and textiles, for example, are having difficulties competing in the export game when they are up against very differently structured and protected competitors.I was pleased to see the favourable press on the oppositions automotive industry plan launched last week by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean). We have realised more quickly than government what impact the tariff reduction has had on jobs in Australia. So those companies that are still operating successfully need to be encouraged to stay in the country and maintain job levels. We can do this only by giving them incentives, help to secure a base for investment and a commitment not to leave some of the small sectors open to takeover or asset stripping by international raiders.Both state and federal governments have set out on an exercise of radically cutting the public sector. This has not been able to be filled by the private sector, which was not in a position to fill this area in a non&hyphen;profitable or in a socially oriented way. The traditional big employers in the states are no longer there. Many of the industries have been cut back because of the introduction of new technology.During the introduction of new technology there were no trade&hyphen;offs made to retain or re&hyphen;employ people in other areas, which means there is a large group of ageing employees for whom positions cannot be found, and they will continue to have difficulties in finding positions.At the other end of the spectrum there are fewer traineeships and apprenticeships being offered as smaller companies cannot afford to train, preferring to pick graduates who can be financially useful from the day of employment. This leaves a sizeable group of young people just out of school to go onto the long&hyphen;term unemployment list, without much hope of finding meaningful work.Job opportunities are being lost because this government does not have the foresight to help expand small but successful business or assist in the development of new ones that spring up through community effort. Sometimes a little risk capital worked strategically can mean success to a struggling new business. This government sees intervention in a way as a charity, not as an investment into the future. They have abandoned small business.Doctor John Marsden pointed out in the Financial Review on 3 March 1997 that although Australias economic growth is well above its 20&hyphen;year average, 80 per cent of the small business that was surveyed in Australia see the economy in recession or at a standstill. Growth has been where small business and jobs are not.Government intervention should not be seen as interference. It can complement and facilitate in areas where the private sector is unable to assist. The tax system should not be seen as merely funding the welfare sector. This leads to resentment and criticism of one sector of the community by another. Government funds should be used efficiently but there needs to be an overall investment in the community, both economically and socially. Without it, we become a nation divided and destructively competitive.The overall question of unemployment must be addressed. Throwing money at it does not assist. There has to be an ongoing strategy to train our young people, allowing people in the older age bracket to retire early if they wish, or be meaningfully employed in their later years as trainers, policy developers or senior advisers in their areas of expertise. They should not be penalised for retiring early.There has been some deep concern also at the way that the Hilmer report has been used. Hilmer stated that competition is an important and powerful force for economic efficiency and he concluded that economic efficiency generally was a great benefit to consumers. He went on to say:We recognise that competition might not always be effective in achieving consumer benefits or that it might lead to conflicts with other social goals. Competition policy thus aims to produce guidelines that determine the nature and extent of competition and the ways in which possible conflicts between results of competition, economic efficiency and other social goals are to be handled.Those who have taken on the Hilmer ideas without reading what he was actually saying have come to interpret his paper as saying that competition is de rigeur without considering the possible conflicts with other social goals. In the public sector, which includes local government and all the other levels, sometimes competition is not the most efficient way to deal with efficiencies. Tasmania is not an easy state to apply competition policy in its completely deregulated sense. There are other factors where the marketplace cannot assist.Eva Cox has been addressing this question in the Boyer lectures and wrote about a civil society in the Evatt papers 1996. She said:We need a balance between the State, the Market and the Community. We have tended to give a dominance to the market, with a secondary role to government, but often supporting the market or just countering it in minor ways and we have forgotten about the community and the involvement of people.Other commentators have also been addressing this issue and have come to the same conclusion. The local community is best placed to develop solutions to local problems. However, these people cannot achieve these sorts of solutions on their own; there needs to be infrastructure, strategies and directions developed so that each group can feed into a format to allow a state plan to be formalised.The private sector cannot undertake roles played by the state and the community. State and local government are in a good position to facilitate and advise, especially where the marketplace fails, but they also have a role to help support the infrastructure for the marketplace. So much can depend on proper government policies and strategies. This government does not appear to have anything that will really deal with the ills that have beset this country in the last few months. Nor do they expect to have anything in the near future, especially since we have just heard that Treasurer Costello has blown out the budget by a further $2.5 billion.What does he have to show for it? Certainly, there are no new jobs, which is what are desperately needed in Australia. It seems that these days we want to make the poor poorer, the rich richer, and make the community more suspicious of their neighbours. All this is happening and there are fewer powers to deal with getting to the truth.We cannot keep selling off Australia. We must keep the farm intact and keep incentives for people to invest in Australia and its people without us losing the basic assets. Australias regions should be nourished and not abandoned and its people should be encouraged and not forgotten, as they are by this government.I will be very interested to hear how the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), who is to follow me in this debate, addresses these questions. I have heard him talk elaborately about free trade but I have yet to hear him address the issues of loss in regional Australia, of loss in the public sector, and the economic decline in many of our regions. I have yet to hear him address how we deal with that. Maybe we need incentives in place to try to encourage the replacement of infrastructure and replace the private sector pullout such as the closing of banks. I would like to hear how economic problems in the regions can be dealt with.Overall, I have seen very little come from the government side in the debate about regions. I have seen the government withdraw many services such as CES offices, Medicare offices, legal aid offices, the reduction in legal aid now, and the Family Court in regions in my own state. I have seen those things withdrawn with nothing done to replace them. I have seen the private sector withdraw bank branches. We have seen these losses in many regional areas.Many people in regional cities have told me that the towns around them are dying and that the people in those towns are moving into the cities. Within a few years those cities too will start to have pressure on them as their infrastructure starts to decline and so the economic needs of regions will need to be looked at in some positive ways. I look forward to hearing some positive ways of how we can achieve goals and work towards looking after some of our regional cities and regional areas in Australia. I look forward to hearing something other than rhetoric.I am also conscious, of course, that the minister for transport and so&hyphen;called regional affairs in this government at the time of the budget last year said that the Commonwealth really had no constitutional responsibility for regional Australia. Of course, since then they have reduced the regional affairs department to five or six people who are employed to answer the ministers correspondence, basically. That has been the outcome of this governments response to the calls from regional Australia.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1996&hyphen;97 Cognate bills: APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 4) 1996&hyphen;97 APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1996&hyphen;97","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
552,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Mr ANDREW","HE4","(Wakefield)","LP","N/A",2119,"—I welcome the opportunity to participate in the appropriation bills debate. I welcome the opportunity, as clearly the member for Lyons (Mr Adams) and before him the member for Greenway (Mr Mossfield) and other members on this side of the House have done, because the appropriation bills allow us to participate in a wide ranging debate. The member for Lyons rightly illustrated that point with the large number of issues that he dealt with and I am more than happy to pick up his challenge and deal with a number of the issues that he feels particularly sensitive about.One of the things that I wanted to discuss in the appropriation debate was the question of tariffs and protection, and I will come to that in just a moment. However, I must first pick up the challenge issued by the member for Lyons who accused the government of having done nothing for small business.Now that astonished me, and I am sure it astonished the member for Stirling (Mr Cameron) since we were both here in this very chamber this very morning when the question of capital gains rollover was put to the House—there was an indication of one of the things the government had done for small business. As someone who is involved in business, and someone directly disadvantaged by the governments decision to move to a capital gains tax, I welcome the opportunity for this rollover provision, which allows small business to expand without being penalised but which was not recognised by the member for Lyons at all.The member for Lyons has also challenged us to participate in this debate without rhetoric. That would mean that probably all of us would find ourselves pruned to about three minutes, with great respect. I will try to meet the challenge and not be any more disappointing than he was in that manner. I am well aware of the agony faced by rural communities as banks leave, as schools are closed and as hospitals are phased out. I am well aware of that because I represent a rural electorate. But I cannot stand in this chamber—I do not believe that state colleagues can stand in state chambers—and pretend that in the present atmosphere of supplying the health needs of rural communities the sorts of first&hyphen;rate health facilities, particularly in terms of the most modern forms of laser surgery and all the rest, can be available in every country town.One of the dilemmas that those of us who represent rural communities face is determining how it is that we keep a health facility that is adequate and meets the needs of the community and at the same time offer cost&hyphen;efficient modern surgical and laser techniques that have to be centrally based because they have to be used up to 20 hours a day in order to be cost efficient. I am conscious of that problem. So was the former government for 13 years, frankly. The member for Lyons suggests that the changes that have occurred have been characteristic of the last nine months—hardly a fair portrayal of what has been a run down of rural populations over some decades, and something that both sides of the House have endeavoured sincerely to address.One of the issues that I want to pick up—I apologise for not being here for the earlier remarks of the member for Lyons—was mentioned by the member for Greenway in his address in the debate on the appropriation bills. He was concerned about the fact that tariff reductions were causing job losses. The question of unemployment is a question addressed by the member for Lyons. It is a question that frustrates everybody in the federal parliament, and I suspect our state colleagues as well. It is a question that has very little to do with trade and trade policy and a great deal to do with technological change. The reality is that unemployment is a problem that all modern economies face simply because we have machines to do what people once used to do.I can address the question of unemployment for the member for Lyons; I could solve it for him tomorrow. I can solve it by saying to all my wine grape growers, of whom the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) would also be proud, `You will no longer pick your grapes with a machine; you will now go and pick them by hand. I could say to the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin), `You can cease harvesting your massive wheat crops with a self&hyphen;propelled harvester. You will now go back to bagging them. I would in the process create jobs all round Australia, and send those industries and the nation into bankruptcy, as you know. It is technological change that is in fact—","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1996&hyphen;97 Cognate bills: APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 4) 1996&hyphen;97 APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1996&hyphen;97","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1/speech[5]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

Australian primary industries will survive principally because they are efficient by world standards. Every one of my wheat growers, every one of my wool growers and all of my major producers know that, effectively, tariffs raise their cost of production.That is the problem with tariffs. Every time you oblige an Australian to pay more for their utility, their boots, their shirts or anything else, you increase the cost of production in Australia. It is grossly unfair for us to say to farmers across Australia, `You can pay more for your utility; you can pay more for your header or whatever else, because we dont have a tariff on it. You can pay more for your boots and shirts and so can your shearers and transport operators, but then you will sell your product offshore into markets that do not have that sort of production. Every time you put a tariff in place, you increase the cost of production.Let me illustrate it this way, and I am actually indebted to the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) for this illustration. He said that he was challenged—not surprisingly, given the recent debate—in Geelong by a friend who said, `Mr McArthur, explain to me very simply what a tariff does. Mr McArthur said what he said to him was, `A tariff is just like me saying to the plasterer in a country town We wont allow anybody else to come into the town and do any plastering unless their costs are raised by 20 per cent. If you are the local plasterer that is good news. But, over time, if every one else in the town wants a plastering job done the local plasterer does not have to be as efficient and the costs go up. That is the reason that tariffs always force up the cost of production.I am here representing the citrus industry, an industry which is directly threatened by the reality of Brazilian frozen orange juice concentrate floating into Australia at costs that Australian citrus growers cannot compete with. So what am I saying? Am I saying to the citrus industry, `You have no future. Sorry, pack up and go home. We will buy all our oranges from Brazil? Of course not. And let me remind the member for Port Adelaide that I am not saying that to the car industry either.

It is too easy to misrepresent it simply because the superficial view must always be that to have a tariff in place makes life easier in Australia. The tragedy is that every tariff means that the cost of production goes up in Australia and Australia becomes less competitive on the world scene.The member for Lyons made so much of regional unemployment. The only way in which we can really solve the problem of unemployment in the regions, or in the urban areas, is obviously to have people employed in world competitive industries. We do that not by increasing tariffs but by ensuring that we are doing what we do better than the rest of the world. Do you want an illustration? Take a look at my state of South Australia where the wine industry is currently an export leader without any tariff protection at all. Why is it an export leader? It may not be the best illustration of a labour intensive industry, but it certainly is relatively labour intensive and it is a value added industry. Effectively, here we have a business in which the value&hyphen;adding is occurring in Australia and yet exports are opening up every day. It is an illustration of the fact that industries can be cultivated in Australia without specifically having tariff walls in place.I do not want to delay the chamber, but I do want to make the point that the World Trade Organisation obligations that the previous government entered into—obligations endorsed by this government—should not be questioned by members of the previous government now that they are in opposition. Those obligations, while they have brought with them a good deal of discomfort for some industries, have also given Australia enormous market access that would otherwise have been denied it. It is too easy to paint a picture of Australia as being the only country that adheres to the WTO guidelines. The facts are that every signatory to the WTO agreement is obliged to lower their tariffs and increase their market access.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1996&hyphen;97 Cognate bills: APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 4) 1996&hyphen;97 APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1996&hyphen;97","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1/speech[5]/break/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

He asks whether they are doing it. The facts remain that, for the first time in his life and mine, we sit around a common table with a common objective. I am not so gullible as to suggest that there will ever be such a thing as a level playing field. I know that world trade will always be a dirty game, but for the first time in our lifetimes everyone has a similar objective. Sure, the others have not adhered to the objective as closely as we have but I wish then that the member for Port Adelaide had been more outspoken in government about the adherence we presumed they were applying to the world trade objectives.Right now in 1997, with all that is wrong with world trade, what is distinctly and quantifiably true is this: the level playing field, myth though it is, is leveller—and I realise that as a school teacher you may question whether that is an appropriate term to be using—but it is leveller than it was in 1987 and leveller than it was in 1977. So some of the right things are happening. They are not happening fast enough, I agree, but to reverse what we have achieved would be a tragedy.Lest my remarks be misunderstood, Mr Deputy Speaker, let me add this, speaking as a South Australian: I am not saying that the car industry should be at 25 per cent, 15 per cent or five per cent. Frankly, I do not have all the information I need to make an informed decision about that. What I do know is that the Ford Falcon I drive in 1997 is a lot better car, in every sense of the word, than the Ford Falcon I might have driven in 1987 or in 1977.As those tariffs have come down, the standard of the Australian car industry has gone up and, astonishingly, to the great credit of the industry, it has an export focus that it never had before. That is not me saying, `The more you cut tariffs, the better the industry will be. But it is me saying, `It is in the national interest, and it is in the interests of every Australian, if we are to be export competitive, for us to be prepared to prune our tariff walls and to do all that we can to encourage industry efficiency.

I would like to place on the public record a plea for clemency on behalf of my de facto constituents, Mr Charles and Mrs Doris Gibson. Recently, Mr and Mrs Gibson, who are aged 81 and 80 respectively, came to see me and told me an amazing story. Some 16 years ago they came to Australia on a visitors visa. Originally from the UK, they fell in love with this country and its people and decided to extend their stay. One thing led to another and, to cut a long story short, they are still here. In the meantime, they established a small business called `The Pet Shop in Caringbah, which has been quite successful, and recently they entered into a further three&hyphen;year lease on the premises.Mr and Mrs Gibson are the most unlikely pair of fugitives you could ever imagine. These illegal aliens have, indeed, become part of the furniture of Caringbah. I have been inundated with letters from friends and business associates who can vouch for their character, their consideration for others and their willingness to work at a senior age to support themselves. In every respect, under other circumstances they would be applauded as wonderful immigrants. The laws of Australia with respect to illegal immigrants are strict. I have been advised that the Gibsons are in a catch&hyphen;22 situation. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) has power to intervene only after a current application for residency or citizenship has been refused and reviewed. Unfortunately, because the Gibsons let their visas expire for longer than 12 months, it is difficult for us to find a way for them to be eligible to apply for consideration. However, I have written to the minister in an attempt to explore every option.In 1983&hyphen;84 there was an amnesty. The Gibsons might have applied at this time, but they did not. The Gibsons adviser is exploring avenues under the Migration Act 1958 and, for the moment, I am advised that their bridging visa is to be extended for another month. It is my hope that a way can be found to extend clemency to these old battlers. Surely we are big enough, generous enough and forgiving enough to find a way. They have been at home with us for too long to throw them out now.I now turn to the appropriation bills and, in particular, to appropriations under the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and Airservices Australia. In speaking to these appropriations, I think it very appropriate that I lament the lack of appropriations given to the people of Kurnell as recompense for the amount of aircraft noise they have been expected to endure since the opening of the third runway. I have written to my colleague the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) in his capacity as Chairman of the Sydney Airport Community Forum, and also to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp), following the release of the long&hyphen;term operating plan for Sydney airport, in order to raise with them the compelling case for recognising the unique exposure of Kurnell residents to aircraft noise, and to ask for special consideration for the Kurnell village.It should be noted that the Airservices Australia report contains recommendations only. However, it seems that all possibilities raised or canvassed for flight path modes of operation see the residents of Kurnell affected. Indeed, in the preferred mode of operation advanced by Airservices Australia, the residents of Kurnell will experience a minimum of 55 per cent of all non&hyphen;curfew flights. Kurnell residents already experience curfew flights and will be expected to continue to bear this burden. In this respect, Kurnell residents are in the unique position of being potentially exposed to aircraft noise at any time in a 24&hyphen;hour period.I refer to the Airservices report and, in particular, to recommendation 4. That states quite categorically that they advise that we should give preference to over the water operations—that is, mode 4—to minimise residential overflights. It is also stated that we should interchange use of the other modes to ensure a fair sharing of unavoidable aircraft noise subject to weather and traffic demands—a fair sharing. However, they say that at any time that weather conditions permit—thank heaven for the weather—and traffic levels can be sustained, mode 4 or runway 16L departures/runway 34L arrivals will be the nominated runway.It seems that the Kurnell residents will be subject to noise. They will be the preferred people to be subject to this noise if this report is adopted. Therefore I think that they do deserve special consideration. Despite the fact that Kurnell residents have been expected to bear this noise since the opening of the third runway, it seems that they have endured this very much with stoicism. However, enough is enough and it is time that the legitimate claims of the Kurnell community for special consideration are met.The unique and special claims of the village of Kurnell are only too apparent. The acceptance of its unique position is evidenced by the establishment of a committee purely to examine in detail the plight of Kurnell residents. In the past Kurnell has received no compensation apart from the insulation of Kurnell public school. This injustice has occurred because the official Australian noise exposure forecast contour maps preclude Kurnell from the compensation regime. Indeed, in the Airservices report it is noted that the Sutherland Shire Council said the Kurnell peninsula had been particularly heavily impacted by the third runway, which placed the centre line directly over the village.The council submitted that residents who lived west of Dampier Street, Kurnell, have borne the brunt of night time aircraft noise for many years, particularly from small aircraft, and that the provision of insulation should be considered for their sleeping areas to alleviate the disturbance created. The Kurnell situation clearly sets it apart from other claims for consideration. Apart from the unique impact of aircraft noise, Kurnell is an isolated community with one road access, sharing the peninsula with a major refinery. The re&hyphen;installation of the public wharf at Kurnell with an embarkation point at La Perouse is essential to provide alternative egress and access. In view of the looming Sydney Olympics and Kurnells status as the meeting place between Captain Cook and indigenous Australians, the potential for a ferry route across the heads is enormous.The special circumstances of Kurnell demand access to funds established from the noise tax. As the land values of Kurnell have dropped substantially following the opening of the third runway an ongoing program of community enhancement measures should be pursued to examine ways of improving land values and quality of life in Kurnell. There are a number of other things that could be done to enhance the community of Kurnell and I think that access should be provided to the noise fund to look at ways of improving this amenity to improve the quality of life of these people who have borne the brunt of this noise. We need to carefully consider the option of funding low interest relocation loans from the noise fund for those who cannot cope. I would like it to be properly examined.Finally, it is imperative that we conduct a study into the effects of airport associated pollution on this community, which is adjacent to the airport but for water. It is said that water acts more as a conduit than a barrier in those circumstances and I believe that such a study is warranted. Another matter that has been of considerable interest to me is the proposal for aircraft departing to the south to turn east out to sea over Bait Bay after passing to the west of the Kurnell village. I have been pushing for the consideration of this out to sea proposal ever since I was elected on 2 March last year. It has been the subject of numerous letters to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Indeed, at times I think the ministers staff see me more in the line of a vexatious letter writer.I have also raised this matter with the Sydney Airport Community Forum, Airservices Australia and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. At the public meeting held at the Cronulla Sutherland Leagues Club, I demanded and received an assurance that this matter would be included in the report to the minister, and this has happened. On page 54 of the report, Airservices Australia states:Consideration is being given to amending the flight path which is aligned, over water, just to the east of Cronulla.The Airservices Australia report then makes a proposal relating to this, and states:This proposal requires testing in aircraft simulators to assess the additional cockpit workload generated by requiring jet aircraft to execute a series of turns in quick succession, shortly after take&hyphen;off.The report goes on:Further assessment of these options is required to confirm the noise benefits perceived.Some time earlier—A division having been called in the House of Representatives—Sitting suspended from 4.41 to 4.55 p.m.N/A","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1996&hyphen;97 Cognate bills: APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 4) 1996&hyphen;97 APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1996&hyphen;97","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1/speech[7]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"
572,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Mr MUTCH","NK6","(Cook)","LP","N/A",2123,"—Before the suspension, I was referring to the out to sea proposal, which I have been fighting for assiduously for the people of Cronulla. On 4 July, the minister wrote to me in response to one of many representations I have made on behalf of constituents. He wrote:You will recall that the original proposal which was rejected involved aircraft making a 3 degree turn away from the coast, from the 163 degree to the 160 degree radial. CASA has now suggested a new option which increases the turn away from the coast from 3 degrees to 13 degrees (ie a turn from the 163 degree to the 150 degree radial).This turn would take aircraft approximately 3 kilometres further off the coast at Bundeena than is currently the case on the 163 degree radial. I am advised that this new proposal would lead to noticeable reductions in noise levels at both Cronulla and Bundeena.I would appreciate receiving your views on this new proposal.N/AOf course, my considered response to that was: Yes! Yes! Yes! We are still waiting for the out to sea proposal to be implemented. Although I would have liked earlier progress on this issue it was not, I was advised, possible to pre&hyphen;empt the deliberations of the task force.If the recommendations of the task force are accepted by the minister and, in particular, the rejection—touch wood—of mode 2, then there is no reason why the simulated testings required cannot proceed post haste. Although this is not soon enough for some, including myself, the progress made thus far is in the right direction.One of the positive aspects of the task force report is the rejection of mode 2. That mode would have seen jet and non&hyphen;jet departures cutting through the heart of my electorate and all landings on 34R directly over the Kurnell village. In the words of Airservices Australia:This would place aircraft very close to or over Cronulla and would negate any initiatives discussed above to move aircraft further to sea off Cronulla.They also say:It is not proposed that this mode be included in the plan due to the unique airspace arrangements that would need to be employed and to limit the number of runway modes to limit complexity of the airways system to maintain a safe operating regime.On an ominous note, they go on to say:However, this Mode could be the subject of further consideration if the noise sharing objectives of the plan cannot be achieved with the proposed modes. The need for this mode would be obviated if Mode 4 can be optimised to achieve similar traffic capacity.I read that very much as a rejection of that mode—and I hope and pray that is adhered to—because it would be a total disaster for the people of my electorate.A further matter that concerns me is the comment on page 46 of the Airservices Australia report. That says:The proposed operational modes for Sydney Airport will at least be valid until the second airport is ready, which will not be before the early years of the next century. When the second airport is ready it will be necessary to review the airspace management arrangements for the Sydney region and this may lead to changes to the flight paths for Sydney airport.Preliminary work on the airspace management arrangements for the second airport is being undertaken for the EIS by the Department of Transport and Regional Development, in conjunction with Airservices Australia.It seems to me that we need a second major airport to service the Sydney basin. Not least among my concerns is the increased use of Sydney airport and the additional pressure that this will place on surrounding suburbs. This does not mean that the hourly cap will not be able to be maintained, because additional aircraft may be accommodated by a pre&hyphen;arranged slot system.Nevertheless, without a second airport there will be greater pressure on KSA. I am concerned, however, that the Holsworthy options, particularly the northern Holsworthy option, are just too close to KSA. We have gone through considerable anguish already in trying to come to grips with modes of operation for KSA. When these are finally determined, I think it would be a shame to have to go through the process all over again, if that is indeed what the Holsworthy option would necessitate.I wanted to raise these matters today in speaking to this bill because they are of considerable interest to many of my constituents. Of course, the people of Kurnell, who have borne the brunt of aircraft noise and under this report would be expected to continue to bear the brunt of aircraft noise, need and deserve some consideration. It is interesting that if you look at runway movements in the past, also reported in the report, the modes that are nominated as being the actuals very much include the Kurnell Village. Mode 10, for instance, accounted for 65 per cent of actuals in 1995. That involves departure jet tracks around Kurnell Village. If you look at mode 9, that involves arrivals over the Kurnell Village.There has been a lot of criticism of Airservices Australia. I have not been indiscriminate in my criticism. I think that it has been a very difficult task to come up with the report they have come up with. In some instances I can see that they have tried to consider the individual case of Kurnell residents. For instance, if you look at mode 9 arrivals on 34 left and 34 right, you will note that the jets, instead of coming in on the third runway, are tracked to come in on the second runway. I think this has been done as a deliberate attempt to show some consideration for the sensitivities of the people of Kurnell. I know that the representative of the Kurnell community, the Kurnell Flight Path Action Committee, Kevin Hill, who is also my nominee on the community consultative forum, is working very closely with Airservices Australia to try to achieve the best result for the people of Kurnell.But that is around the edges. What we need is particular consideration for those people, and I think they deserve access to the noise fund that has been established for the very purpose of looking after people who are expected to bear more than their fair share of aircraft noise, and that certainly applies to the people of Kurnell. So I put it to the parliament and to the minister: it is about time the people of Kurnell received the consideration that they deserve, and I commend that to the House.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1996&hyphen;97 Cognate bills: APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 4) 1996&hyphen;97 APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1996&hyphen;97","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1/speech[7]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
573,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Mr WAKELIN","HV5","(Grey)","LP","N/A",2127,"—Speaking on Appropriation Bill (No. 3), it is a pleasure to rise and make a few general comments. I guess over the last 12 months it has been a very active parliamentary year. The government inherited some well documented facts of life when it first came to office. I will mention basics: $100 billion of Commonwealth debt, with just under $10 billion of interest. Faced with that dilemma, as well as the $8 billion deficit, the efforts that have been made by the government are highly commendable. The budget of August last year focused on a whole range of issues. If I were to name three things, they would be a better balance in our overall economy, a stronger investment climate and a focus on stronger wealth creation, leading to attacking the whole issue of unemployment.The other subsidiary issues, if you like, are those issues like native title, tariffs, the funding of the ABC, and smaller issues like the earning credit scheme, education in regional areas, investment, telecommunications and the general direction of the government. These are some of the things that I will address in the time allocated today.The issue of native title, particularly with the Wik judgment is, I think, much underrated by too many Australians. It impacts on an electorate like Grey in a way that most urban Australians could not contemplate. For example, I have had a number of representations from people wanting to explore a small gems field and who can no longer do it. Things that people have been taking for granted for 100 years or more are now restricted, or just stopped. People are at a total loss to understand why.There are bigger implications. We have a hope of some expansion at Woomera with the use of the rocket range there. Yet, there is that doubt arising from native title. I hope that can be resolved before a decision has to be made within the next few weeks. In my electorate of Grey, which is 92 per cent of the area of South Australia and about 900,000 square kilometres, more of it is actually under native title claim than actually exists. People are bewildered about what it means. It is an issue that the Prime Minister and the parliamentary secretary Senator Minchin and many others have been attempting to wrestle with in these recent months.I believe that if native claims were put over the central business districts of Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Hobart, and Perth, there would be a stronger national will to come to an arrangement which would recognise prior occupation in a much more expeditious manner. The fact that terra nullius has been pushed out into the regions and that the majority of Australians are able to escape the impact of native title—remembering that the tribunal has not yet had one successful resolution on mainland Australia—I think highlights the fact that there is subtle constant pressure on regional people which urban people do not appreciate.The next issue that I would like to touch on is the issue of tariffs. There is a very good little document called One shoe per person , which takes its name from the fact that we could, apparently, up until recent decades, import only one shoe per year per person. From the introduction of this very well written piece by David Pearce and Andrew Stoeckel I will quote the first paragraph which I think sums up the Australian context over a longer period of some decades. It says:Australias policy on protection for the manufacturing industry has had a long history of debate. It is undergoing another debate right now as a result of two things. One is the uncertain legality of some subsidies Australia uses to protect industry, which has been `solved by negotiation—the so&hyphen;called Howe Leather case. The other is the change of government in March this year. While the stated policy of the new government has been supportive of free trade, the media headlines have carried stories of finding alternative ways to compensate industry for the removal of subsidies and the need for `reciprocity—that we should not liberalise further unless our trade partners do. The charge has also been put that the benefits of free trade have not been fully explained to the wider community.The car and textiles, clothing and footwear industries are the most highly protected manufacturing industries in Australia and the current protection arrangements apply to the year 2000. What happens beyond that is up for review by the government.We go now to the 1981 issue of one shoe per person. At the same time we were limited to one imported car for every 190 people. Clearly, these limits were put there to offer protection to the manufacturer, although even in those days there were people questioning that policy.If we look at the export subsidy debate, and that includes Australias export facilitation, we have imports of something like $12 billion. Consumers then pay about $13.8 billion. The government tariff revenue is about $1.5 billion. The producer, that is, the exporter, has exports of $2.8 billion, which means an export subsidy of about $0.3 billion. Those old arguments on agriculture back in the 1970s are well gone and there is negligible subsidy for agriculture now. However, those debates of the 1970s are still very much there for our manufacturing industry in the 1990s.The real tragedy of this whole tariff debate is summed up in the epilogue by Pearce and Stoeckel where they say:Sadly, the benefits that the protected industries receive do not translate into more employment in those industries. The experiment of lifting protection in order to save jobs in those industries has been tried and the facts show that it has failed.That is the debate that we still have decades on.I do not pretend that it is ever easy to reduce tariffs or even to hold the line with tariffs when you have a very competitive world market. But those fundamental truths that are in this document prepared by the Centre for International Economics are still as true today as they were 30 years ago when people like Bert Kelly were advising us of the wrong-headedness of excess protection. I think that the government and the parliament will need to show great consideration in the interests of the overall community because we know at the end of the day that a tariff, by any other name, is a subsidy and a tax.I want to move on to another issue, the issue of local government and the financial assistance grants. In the budget there was a four per cent increase that brought the amount to about $1.2 billion. About 77 per cent of that went to regional and rural Australia, which meant about a $35 million increase in financial assistance grants to rural and regional councils.The point I want to highlight here is that there has been some criticism of the Commonwealth government for the withdrawal of REDOs, the Regional Economic Development Organisations. These organisations were funded by the previous government for only four years and then they were expected to go on their own way and be funded from within their own resources. There was a sum of $150 million over four years of which about 50 per cent was to go in administration and 50 per cent to projects.If you do your sums, you will find that the increase in the financial assistance grants to regional and rural councils is at least as much as what was being received in REDOs, which many councils felt were simply duplicating the role of organisations like local government and state based regional development organisations. So, in one stroke, the new government has been able to reduce duplication and offer more money to local government for specific purposes in their own local government areas.I have a university in the electorate at Whyalla. There has been some speculation which appears to be somewhat politically based. The percentages used in the debate on universities are somewhat specious when you realise there has been a five per cent cut over three years. The percentages being quoted are usually in excess of 10, 15 and 20 per cent. It might make good headlines but it does not actually fit the argument.The one comment that I would make on the universities is that there is about a 75 per cent taxpayer subsidy to university education. If you look at training, apprenticeships et cetera across the nation I doubt whether there is that sort of support and subsidy to the balance of those people seeking to get training to get into employment. I would say to the university that it is always regrettable that budgets need to be cut but I would also ask them to consider their fellow countrymen and their access to training and well paid employment. It is accepted that if you have a university degree you will go on and expect to do somewhat better in life than those of us who do not have that same privilege.I will touch on the ABC and the funding cuts. I would simply say to those in the ABC that they are part of a $700 million organisation of which $500 million is provided by the taxpayer. The one fundamental difference—although they may not agree with it—between them as paid employees of the ABC, not all of them but many of them, and me as an elected member is that I have a constitutional responsibility based on our democratic system. They are simply accountable to their employer. I would say to any person in the media—I have said it about our main chamber—that if there was a design fault it is that the media sit above us and not on the same terms as us and at the same level. I do say quite sincerely that we are constitutionally elected, we have the responsibility of government under a democracy and I would ask them always to remember that.One small issue that has been troubling some of my constituents is the earning credits scheme. In our great thrust for efficiency, this earning credits scheme was abolished in the August budget and perhaps for good reason. If you are on casual work regularly for 48 or whatever weeks of the year then that might be okay, but in my electorate where the only work available will be casual seasonal work it would appear to me that these people are unnecessarily disadvantaged.Finally, the good news in the electorate of Grey has been undoubtedly the remarkable investment by Western Mining in the Olympic Dam project. They announced it last June, $1¼ billion, and said `We will get going about June 1997. In actual fact, they are already going and they have put another $250 million on the table, so the investment is up to $1.5 billion and it is talking about 1,600 people being on site in future months.It is a great opportunity for my electorate, which has had too much bad news over many years. The opportunities that it presents to the region at large are very much to the forefront of peoples mind in a very positive sense. I understand that we might even have some better news towards the end of the week on other investment matters.Another good news story is the governments telecommunications infrastructure fund—$250 million throughout Australia and $26.5 million to South Australia. The electorate of Grey can expect to pick up a lot of that. The issue of mobile phones has always been contentious. Telstra has sadly fled to the cities to compete with Optus and others for the digital market and has overlooked many of my constituents. We hope that the new regime starting in July will give greater opportunities. We know that the $5 million per year over the next five years will provide opportunities for investment which will provide fairer access to telecommunications in the electorate of Grey.About a fortnight or three weeks ago a number of my constituents were badly affected by floods. They were 100&hyphen;year type floods. I am sure we all feel for them. They are still recovering. Something like 1,000 kilometres of fences went down and 500 kilometres of that was totally destroyed. Houses were inundated. In one instance, a helicopter crashed, but fortunately there was no loss of life. There is a lot of pressure on those people in this recovery period, and we offer our sympathy to them.I wish to acknowledge the state governments role in the Premiers announcement in the last week of the bringing forward of the natural disaster fund. Those people are very stoical and quite self&hyphen;reliant; nevertheless I am sure they will appreciate any support that the government is able to offer.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1996&hyphen;97 Cognate bills: APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 4) 1996&hyphen;97 APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1996&hyphen;97","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1/speech[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
574,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Mr TONY SMITH","SK6","(Dickson)","LP","N/A",2131,"—I want to touch on five matters in my speech on the appropriation bills. The matters are: first, the Americanisation of Australian culture; second, the legal aid system; third, the divide between the rich and the poor and the haves and the have&hyphen;nots; fourth, foreign policy; and, fifth, Aboriginal matters. I may not have the time, but I will attempt to touch on all of them.I raised the issue of Americanisation in my maiden speech. I am afraid that after a year the situation is not getting any better—if anything, it is getting worse. I believe the government has a role to play in reversing this trend.This problem starts in the schools. In my electorate there is very strong nationalism in primary schools. There are flag raising ceremonies and we will soon be celebrating Anzac Day and in the schools at the primary level children have a great commitment to the enduring symbols of our country.Unfortunately, as they move into the high schools they move further away from those concepts and they stray further away from what I believe are unique and essential elements in our culture. I fear that we are losing them. I direct my attention particularly to sport and, in particular, to cricket and rugby league.I have been involved in cricket as a player and spectator for 36 years. An ugliness began creeping into cricket with the Packer circus in 1977. Unfortunately, that ugliness has reached a stage where the Australian captain is saying that sledging is part of the game. I totally and utterly reject that notion.During the course of observing cricket matches in my electorate—and I am quite keen on such teams as the Pine Rivers cricket sides and the Lawnton Taverners—I have stressed wherever I have gone that sledging is not part of the game. In fact, I would use the old phrase, `It is simply not cricket. We must get back to that. The phrase seems to have slipped out of our culture because of the influx of commercialism.We have seen in people who have played sports such as tennis—John McEnroe, for example—the quintessential ugly sportsman who is there abusing and criticising every decision of the umpire. That is simply not on. As I said, I think it is deplorable to have that as part of our Australian macho style. It is not part of being Australian. I fear it is being combined with the commercialism that we are seeing in both cricket and rugby league and that, generally speaking, this show biz, this yankee style, is seen as the best way of looking at things.For example, I was at the Gabba late last year watching a day&hyphen;night game and I wondered what all these black boxes were around the ground. To my horror, I soon found that the cacophony of noise that was booming out of them, assaulting my ears, was little bits of theme music being played in between overs—extolling the theme songs of various players and so forth. To me, it was ruining the game as a spectacle. In other words, I felt I had to leave because I was being assaulted with these Americanisation symbols: that we have to have this show biz, this razzamatazz and this sort of cacophony being a part of our culture. Well, it simply is not, but it has crept into it. It is a very unfortunate part of cricket, along with the inane comments of the commentator. Once upon a time you could watch cricket; you could discuss it; and you could talk about the various scientific aspects of it. But now you cannot even hear yourself in between overs with the noise coming out of these black boxes, which I initially thought might have been some sort of black picket fence but, to my horror, they were not.As far as rugby league is concerned, probably one of the greatest commentators in rugby league was George Lovejoy and he coined the phrase `the greatest game of all. Likewise, having seen a little bit of the ugly super league spectacle, we are now seeing everything other than rugby league. What is wrong? Why do we have this cultural cringing towards America? Why do we say `broncos instead of `brumbies? The term `brumbies is Australian. Why do we say `cowboys instead of `farmers? There is something wrong with our view of ourselves if we have to pull in these American symbols. It is a great pity.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1996&hyphen;97 Cognate bills: APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 4) 1996&hyphen;97 APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1996&hyphen;97","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1/speech[9]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

576,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Mr TONY SMITH","SK6","(Dickson)","LP","N/A",2131,"—They might be in the Northern Territory, and I wish they were in Brisbane. Anyway, I think the government does play a role in this. The government should take the lead in holding up our symbols and in supporting the traditional way of looking at the game.I now turn to the issue of legal aid. In my electorate of Dickson, over the years a great number of people have needed to access the legal system. Unfortunately, the fact is that legal aid has, over a number of years, particularly in the last decade, turned into almost a crisis. You see, as I did in my legal practice, numerous cases that cry out for attention but do not get it. There was an old saying that justice delayed was justice denied. What then is the concomitant of justice denied? That is what is happening now.The Law Council of Australia has estimated that the restoration of legal aid funding to the 1988 level would take an annual commitment of $55 million. The August budget announcement that legal aid funding would be reduced by $33.2 million a year for the next three years, in effect, signals the death knell of the current system, which had become unviable in any event.Under the current legal aid agreements, the states and territories are subsidised by the Commonwealth which provides 55 per cent of overall government funding. The 45 per cent provided by the states and territories includes the statutory interest on client funds held in solicitors trust accounts so that, in real terms, only 36 per cent comes from the funds of the states and territories. Further, a disproportionate amount of funds has been used on state and territory matters at the expense of Commonwealth matters. The Attorney&hyphen;General recently stated:The impact of this diversion of Commonwealth funds is severe. For example, data provided by legal aid commissions shows a drop of over 25 per cent in the number of grants for assistance and expenditure on family law matters by commissions over the five&hyphen;year period from 1991 to 1996.States and territories have traditionally shown a reluctance to pull their weight, so the erosion of legal aid facilities is set to continue. In Queensland, the legal aid office has been distributing letters to participating solicitors to the effect that funding from 1 July 1997 cannot be guaranteed, notwithstanding that a matter may still be current at that time.While the present system favours matters within the jurisdiction of the states and territories, the discrimination does not end there. There is also a definite bias against matters which, though meritorious, are considered by the various legal aid offices to be difficult. The classic example is the medical negligence claim. As a result, many deserving applicants fall through the safety net and thus are unable to pursue their claims unless their legal representatives are prepared to act for them on a speculative basis. In effect, the way the legal aid system is going, only criminals will get legal aid.A lawyers decision to conduct an action on a speculative basis raises two very important questions. Firstly, is it champertous? Champerty describes a proceeding which is conducted by a person who has no legitimate concern in the suit and who bargains to carry on its prosecution in consideration of receiving, in the event of success, a share in the matter of the suit. It is prohibited at common law. This is an issue which has largely been ignored by practitioners at their peril.Secondly, during the conduct of the action, will a situation arise where the duty of a lawyer to the client conflicts with the lawyers personal interest in receiving payment for the professional fees that have been generated to date? Many settlements are reached at the door of the court after years of delay. Legal representatives by that stage have made enormous investments in terms of fees and out&hyphen;of&hyphen;pocket expenses. An ordinary offer of settlement may suddenly appear very attractive—the chance of getting paid for years of work, as opposed to the uncertainty of trial followed by months of waiting for the judgment, taxation of costs and, finally, payment.It is manifestly unreasonable to expect lawyers to assume responsibility for conducting speculative actions on behalf of those people who are unable to access legal aid facilities, particularly when one considers the ethical dilemmas involved. There is an alternative. An organisation independent of the legal aid system could be established with the primary objective of providing assistance, subject to the satisfaction of merit and means tests, to two categories of applicants, namely: those who have been unable to secure legal aid through the normal channels and those who have been unable to secure legal representation on a speculative basis. For ease of reference, I will refer to this organisation as Equity.Equity would be established by a one&hyphen;off injection of funds from federal, state and territory governments. A modest filing fee on all process filed throughout all jurisdictions could assist to replenish Equity. To provide an ongoing source of funding, a percentage of the fruits of all successful actions would be deducted and reinvested in Equity. Legal fees would be paid upon settlement or finalisation of an action, regardless of the outcome. Fees would be assessed on a solicitor and client basis. Normal taxation of costs provisions would apply. Professional access to Equity would be limited to solicitors and barristers who had been appointed to a panel of approved lawyers, the criteria for which would involve a consideration of such factors as years of practice and areas of expertise.The management and administrative structure of Equity would be minimised in keeping with a general policy of cost&hyphen;effectiveness. An applicant for assistance from Equity would be required to pass a merit test involving satisfaction of either of the following criteria: is the issue one of importance—for example, in the public interest—or of particular precedent value; or are there reasonable prospects of success? Decisions with respect to merit would, in the first instance, be made by case officers, with avenues for appeal to an honorary committee of suitably qualified individuals.In addition to satisfactory passage through the merit test, an applicant would also be required to pass a means test. Hardship would be the basic criterion. Neither of the ethical problems which currently confront legal representatives undertaking speculative work, that is, champerty and potential conflicts of duty and interest, would arise—and, believe me, I am aware of those conflicts; I have encountered them many times. Because legal representatives would be guaranteed payment regardless of the outcome of the proceedings, potential conflicts of duty and interest would be eliminated.A dispute resolution procedure could be established to cope with disputes which may arise from time to time between litigant and legal representative. At the outset, applicants would be advised that, upon acceptance of Equitys assistance, they would have a concomitant obligation to accept the reasonable advice of their legal representatives. This would be a particularly important issue in the context of settlement offers because of Equitys financial interest in the fruits of the action. In the event of a dispute between a litigant and his or her legal representative, the matter would be referred to an independent arbiter for resolution and determination.There are so many cases that are slipping through the net; there are so many people who do not bother to contest matters because they cannot get legal aid that justice is being totally denied. That is an untenable situation in the Australian community. This program that I have suggested is one means of addressing it. It will not solve it but it will assist to address it and take the weight off applications for legal aid generally.In relation to foreign policy, I stress part of what I said earlier about promoting the Australian image. In my view this falls very much to the Australian government. It is important in my view to advocate a much more proactive foreign policy as part of that process. Australia must be seen to be a significant power in the region. For years, previous Labor governments presided over an innocuous foreign policy—indeed, one that became almost fossilised. Would, for example, Papua New Guinea have sought assistance from mercenaries had Australia been a much more proactive country? Would not Papua New Guinea have come to seek Australias assistance in relation to this particular matter if we had promoted ourselves as the significant power in the region? This is what I am saying.Why do our troops travel to far-flung outposts of conflict, yet we tolerate an eight&hyphen;year war, just 15 flying minutes from our shores, in Bougainville? There is an incongruity there in our policy. I also think there is a terrible incongruity in relation to the China&hyphen;Taiwan situation. Why do we think big is best? Since the December 1972 communique, much has happened in the Republic of China on Taiwan. There are 21.5 million people living there; it has been a democracy since 1996. Why do we not practise a similar philosophy to Taiwan that we do in other countries? Why do we say that because Taiwan is small we are intimidated by big brother on the mainland? I cannot accept it as a person with my political philosophy and I think it is about time we moved ahead with the changes.But again, it goes back to our responsibility for promoting ourselves in our region, to be more dynamic and to indicate to all parties in our region where there are problems, including in Sri Lanka, that this country has something to say, has direction to give and assistance to provide.Turning to Aboriginal matters, I have always regarded the comment by my jurisprudence lecturer that metaphysics does not boil cabbages as a very significant statement in relation to life generally. I have always had a concern about the notion of reconciliation. I have always questioned it. The notion implies a division; so you start with a division between people. You manufacture a concept that we need to reconcile because there is a division. There are many Australians who do not think there is a division and who are offended by the concept. I think since the concept has been floated, in 1991, I have never seen more division in this country between black and white. That is a tragedy because—getting back to the point that metaphysics does not boil cabbages—we are not helping the people at the coal face by floating these concepts, in my respectful view.There is going to be a reconciliation conference in a couple of months. I have seen some enormously expensive and glossy material about this. Why on earth are we doing this when we will not achieve anything in terms of helping people on the ground, which is what we should be doing? Rather, it will be a feelgood talkfest where a lot of money will be spent flying people from all over the countryside. What will it achieve? I suspect little, if anything. When you ask yourself what is reconciliation—what do they define it as—you start seeing the holes in this particular proposal.For example, it is said that it provides five so&hyphen;called steps for reconciliation and, worryingly, it speaks of arriving at some sort of settlement. What form this might take is part of the charter of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. It proposes such things as national agreements or a series of agreements, whatever this really means. I am afraid it is the language of division which will promote even more division.For example, I do not think anybody really considered the words `indigenous and `non&hyphen;indigenous. Now we have indigenous Australians and non&hyphen;indigenous Australians. We are all Australians, yet we have this division since the reconciliation concept. I think it is absurd, and it promotes division. I have people saying to me, `Im indigenous. I was born here. Look up the dictionary meaning of the word: it means people who are born here. It is causing friction in the community, when we should be identifying the real needs of Aboriginal people. My work in the Aboriginal area, particularly at Cherbourg, identifies those needs, but these sorts of glossy concepts do not help.For example, one of the five elements says this about reconciliation: `Identifying what more needs to be done and making changes within Australian society. How will that promote a settlement of things? That could go on forever. So forever we have got this notion of reconciliation, forever we have got people looking sideways at each other over a non&hyphen;achievable goal. It is not going to help the people on the ground, or at the coalface. That is what it is all about—helping those people in health, housing, education and employment. Get those basic things right and we can do all the feel good things we like; but if we do the feel good things and do not solve the basic things, we are going to have problems. We see that all the time.Lastly, I am going to talk very briefly about the notion of haves and have&hyphen;nots. I think it is something that we have to be very careful of in this society, that we are developing a society where a large number of people are unemployed and on the other side of the coin we have people who are doing very well from the system. I had a very interesting letter sent to me by Bishop Wicks recently about this concept, how we are promoting this situation where there are a large group of unemployed who are very much at the margins, but on the other side of the coin people who are very well off. I do not think that that situation can continue without our suffering as a nation, and suffering very much in the eyes of the international community.We have to try and devise programs of capital works that will get people into jobs. We have to ensure that we bear in mind that people who are unemployed and have been for some time are not forgotten.

577,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Mr DONDAS","5M6","(Northern Territory)","CLP","N/A",2136,"—I rise to support Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4). These bills are to appropriate funds to increase spending on defence, medical and pharmaceutical services for veterans, residential facilities for older people, higher costs associated with child&hyphen;care rebates and debt repayments to the Australian National Railway Commission. There are minor variations included in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) for variations across a range of programs in various government departments.In terms of the budget itself, it was described as a strong but fair budget, in view of the fact that it was at this time last year, after the coalition was successful at the 2 March election, that it became known that, instead of having a surplus of funds, we were looking at a deficit; in fact, an $8 billion black hole deficit.In the last 12 months I believe the coalition has been able to drive our economy in the right direction. When one looks at interest rates, the average home mortgage payer is now $246 per month better off under the coalition governments direction. In terms of a small business variable loan, the small business person would be $4,000 a year better off. In fact, the Treasurer said the other day in the parliament that the variable loan rates were the lowest since 1974 and, when one considers the no frill rates, at their lowest since the 1960s. Also, there has been a billion dollar a year family tax cut, and something like 70 per cent of the Australian families should benefit from that tax cut.In talking about defence, I am very pleased to see that the coalition government continues to support defence infrastructure and facilities within my electorate in the Northern Territory. When one does an analysis, so far the indications are that some $97 million is going to be spent on capital works in the Northern Territory and an additional $100 million on administration. That is almost $2 million a week on administration, which obviously would pick up payrolls, salaries and incidental expenses. That $2 million going into the Darwin economy is very important. Part of the $97 million is the upgrade of RAAF Base Darwin, and I understand that some $59.5 million will be spent on RAAF Base Darwin over the next couple of years.

578,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Mr DONDAS","5M6","(Northern Territory)","CLP","N/A",2136,"—Before the suspension, I was saying that I was very pleased that the parliamentary public works committee recommended the $59.5 million upgrade to RAAF Base Darwin. Also for further consideration is another $31.4 million for capital works for RAAF Base Tindal. The Larrakeyah Coonawarra facility is earmarked to have further extensions done into the harbour and they are estimated at anywhere between $25 million and $30 million, with work commencing later this year.Another very interesting facet to the Defence portfolio is Pine Gap. We do not hear very much about Pine Gap in a general sense in the portfolio because it is an American installation. But additional housing is being provided for the Pine Gap facility in Alice Springs and that work is under way. About 160 extra homes are being built in Alice Springs to cater for families. When that infrastructure is complete and people are living in those homes, that is going to be a boon to the economy of the Alice Springs region.Bradshaw Station is another property that is earmarked for development by the Defence Department for a training centre. Bradshaw Station is in the northern part of the Northern Territory, not very far from the Western Australian border and near a place called Timber Creek. Once that facility has been completed, at a cost of about $50 million, it will provide full tropical training facilities for our armed forces. There has been quite a lot of money spent on Robertson Barracks in the last few years. That is certainly looking good and I understand that there will be some minor capital works available in the 1997&hyphen;98 budget for Robertson Barracks.On another topic, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) has announced that he is providing additional funds to the Australian community for funding for literacy and numeracy programs. I am very pleased that, in that allocation, he has given the Northern Territory an additional $12 million for the years 1997 to 2000. That is very important, because levels of funding should be maintained and increased if we are going to be true in our nature in trying to provide a higher level of education for our indigenous community.The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, provided in the 1996&hyphen;97 budget additional funds for indigenous education. In fact, there was an indigenous education supplementary bill which provided financial resources to those communities in remote areas of Australia. The Northern Territory, in some instances, was able to receive additional funding from that earlier budget.We must take into consideration the high cost of education in remote areas. It is a fact of life. Darwin, obviously, is not considered to be a remote area but, nevertheless, Alice Springs is, and so are the other territory centres where there are education facilities. The provision of educational services throughout the whole of the Northern Territory is very expensive and, obviously, will require higher levels of funding to maintain reasonable education outcomes and results.Industrial relations is another very important part of the process of the year. I pick up one particular point, the unfair dismissal clause that was in the earlier legislation. That has now been abolished. It is interesting to note that between January 1996 and January 1997 the unfair dismissal claims have been reduced by over 60 per cent. It will be very interesting to see what the percentage will be in January 1998.That is good news for employers because prior to the abolition of that particular unfair dismissal clause territory employers were very reluctant to take on staff. They are a little different from their southern counterparts because the territory has a floating population and sometimes the people will tell an employer that they are going to stay for five years and they are really going to be there for only five months or even less. There were some problems posed when some of the employees were not doing the right thing and it made it very difficult for employers to take them on. But now that we have the new legislation in place it is certainly going to be a boon for small business in the Northern Territory. We have always said that the small business community in Australia is really the engine room for creating employment. I support that particular comment.Road funding is another very interesting topic that I would like to speak about today. Just recently, I was appointed chairman of the Black Spots Road Funding Committee by the Parliamentary Secretary for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Ronaldson). I am pleased to advise the committee that over the next four years some $2.24 million is going to be made available for black spot funding. That, obviously, will be very good in terms of identifying road safety elements and dangerous roads. The committee has met already and has put a proposition to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp). We are hoping to get an answer from him in the next couple of weeks because the funds we have put a bid in for this year must be expended this financial year—that is, additional funding for roads that have particular problems in terms of the safety component.One part of the budget that I was disappointed in was a reduction of about $10 million in the budget for rural roads in isolated communities. I made a representation to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development and other ministers because, whilst $10 million might not seem a very large amount in the overall scheme of things, in some of those communities it is a large amount. Over the years those people have accumulated equipment for repairing and maintaining roads. If those funds are not available through the local government association or through direct funding for roads, the equipment that they have invested quite a bit of money in is going to become useless.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1996&hyphen;97 Cognate bills: APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 4) 1996&hyphen;97 APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1996&hyphen;97","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1/speech[10]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

580,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Mr DONDAS","5M6","(Northern Territory)","CLP","N/A",2136,"—I have not mentioned the railways yet, but I will later. On roads, I understand that representation has been made by the local government association and also by the Minister for Transport and Works in the Northern Territory to the relevant ministers here. I mentioned that we inherited a black hole of some $8 billion and that communities have to tighten their belts. However, while this $10 million reduction is not a large amount of money in the overall scheme of things, it is certainly a great deal of money for the small communities who rely on it.The diesel fuel rebate has been maintained. That is very important for rural communities. The coalition has put in place policies for major reform to reduce the gap between rural and city pricing of fuel. It is of great concern to me that I must stand here today and talk about the price of unleaded fuel. Unleaded fuel in Port Augusta and South Australia is 77.9c per litre. In Kimba, which is 171 kilometres up the road, it is 89.2c per litre. In Alice Springs it is 88.4c per litre. Super is 90c per litre and diesel is 89.5c per litre in Alice Springs. The price varies between Alice Springs and Darwin.Last year I tabled a petition with over 15,000 signatures. It said:The petition of the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia draws to the attention of the House of Representatives the extremely high Road Funding and Petrol Products Excise Tax imposed by the Commonwealth Government which rose from 6.1 cents per litre in 1982 to 35.6 cents per litre, for leaded fuel, in 1995. In addition, the attention of the House of Representatives is drawn to the current tax of 34.18 cents per litre on diesel and that the percentage of excise tax utilised for road funding is now less than 10% of that collected as compared to a maximum of 70% in 1981&hyphen;82.Your petitioners therefore request the House to urge the Government to reduce the tax on fuel in order that:1. The cost of living of ordinary Australians is improved; and2. Australias overall international competitiveness is enhanced.Federal excise on unleaded fuel is 36c a litre. Bush people are certainly disadvantaged. We cannot blame the coalition government, because these taxes were imposed by the former Labor Party government. I believe it is time for the coalition to look at the excise tax. People might say, `The retailer is putting a very high profit margin on fuel. For most of the retailers that I have talked to around the country, especially in the Northern Territory, their profit margin is about 10 per cent. I do not believe that 10 per cent is excessive in terms of their operations.The coalition is framing the 1997&hyphen;98 budget now. I understand that we are looking at various regimes to accommodate budgetary savings. We know that there are going to be savings in various departments, especially in the areas of social security now that we have put in place the work for the dole scheme. I am told that that will save many millions of dollars throughout the year.I urge the coalition, if it is really going to look after rural Australia, which comprises 88 per cent of the continent, to evaluate where we are going with the excise on fuel. I would hate to see any increase in this next budget as I do not believe it is necessary. I do not believe that I could vote for an increase in the fuel excise in the next budget, especially in rural areas. I would have to consider it.If they were to offer some kind of—","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1996&hyphen;97 Cognate bills: APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 4) 1996&hyphen;97 APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1996&hyphen;97","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1/speech[10]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

582,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Mr DONDAS","5M6","(Northern Territory)","CLP","N/A",2136,"—I said I would have to consider it. If they were going to offer some kind of tax rebate on the cost of freight for fuel into regional Australia then I may consider it. But the fuel excise at the moment is far too high.In terms of telecommunications, it is important to know that $250 million has been provided to improve regional telecommunications. I was pleased to see that in making these funds available from the Telstra sale that $16 million is going to the Northern Territory. That will help upgrade the telephone exchanges. We will see something like 85 per cent of regional exchanges converted to digital by the end of 1997. This will mean faster faxes, better mobile phone reception, call waiting and call diversion in more areas, faster EFTPOS services, and faster access to the Internet.On 1 July this year the telecommunications industry is certainly going to be open to more competition leading to better services and, obviously, to lower costs. I understand that price caps will be put in place and that Australians living in rural areas will benefit from cross&hyphen;subsidies.The other item that I wanted to speak about this afternoon concerns Aboriginals in the Northern Territory. Of course, I am very pleased that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Herron) has in the last 12 months placed his portfolio to the forefront in this parliament. Most members of parliament are now aware of the problems that exist in the remote parts of Australia in terms of the living conditions, the health services, and education facilities for our indigenous community.The government has focused on providing health and housing services. As you would be aware, in the 1996-97 budget the funds to ATSIC for these particular programs—health and housing—were quarantined by the Commonwealth government. Also, as you heard me say earlier today, Senator Vanstone did provide additional funds for indigenous education by presenting this parliament with a supplementary education bill.The important thing to note is that there are many communities that are in desperate need of services. In fact, I had occasion to bring to the ministers attention something that concerns me greatly. Given that ATSIC makes funds available to regional communities and that there are also housing authorities—both Northern Territory and Commonwealth housing authorities—handling funds for communities, I find it quite difficult to understand how we can go into a community and construct 15 new homes and yet not provide power. There are these beautiful houses constructed. They have got all the light fittings, the light switches, electric terminals, and yet there is no power within the community.As I said to the minister and to other members who were there, it would be better if the housing authorities built one fewer house. They could build 14 houses and give them the funds to put in a 38 kVA, wind&hyphen;driven generator which could provide some electrification to that community. It is not just one community, it is in a lot of communities. Funds have been made available for housing but there are no back&hyphen;up services.In fact, there is one particular community that I am going to be visiting next week, a place called Aileron, and that is exactly the problem that they have got. There are 12 houses there. The funny part about it is that they have additional funding in the 1997&hyphen;98 budget for another six houses. They are also going to get a mobile health clinic. What is the good of having a mobile health clinic and what is the good of giving them additional funds for another six houses if there is no electricity there to give them power, to keep their food in the refrigerators and, obviously, to give them a better standard of living?The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has said that he would take on board my comments about housing and that he would speak to the relevant department and ATSIC to make sure that where funds were going into communities they should make sure the provision of services is there before any other infrastructure is put in, otherwise the infrastructure is not going to be used and will certainly be a waste as far as the Australian taxpayer is concerned.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1996&hyphen;97 Cognate bills: APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 4) 1996&hyphen;97 APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1996&hyphen;97","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1/speech[10]/talk.start[4]/para","N/A","N/A"

584,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Mr HAWKER","8H4","(Wannon)","LP","N/A",2140,"—In speaking to the appropriation bill, I think that it is timely to look at the achievements of the Howard government in its first 12 months. There has been universal approval throughout the community for the way the government has tackled some of the difficult jobs that it has had in the first 12 months and for the fact that it has kept the confidence of people in Australia at the same time. While you can look at the opinion columns in certain newspapers, most of those are fairly predictable and come from people who have great difficulty in covering up their personal prejudices rather than looking objectively at what the government has done.There is no doubt that many building blocks have been put in place for a sustained recovery. We are building on the opportunities that the government has given us to repair some of the problems that were handed on from the Labor Party, particularly some of the budgetary problems in the black hole that has been referred to on many occasions. It is worth reminding all honourable members that it was a massive problem of at least $8 billion. The galling thing about it all was the way that even today the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) cannot stand up and say, `Yes, I did not tell the whole truth prior to the election. I did not admit what I really knew, that in fact it was there. Instead, he and the former Prime Minister continued to pretend right throughout the election campaign that it was not so. Yet it was pretty obvious there was something amiss, and certainly, when the change of government came, it became blindingly obvious.Today I would like to talk a little about some of the situations that we now confront in regional and rural Australia, particularly as we look, one year on, at some of the changes that have occurred and that will be occurring under this government. I want to put this up against the backdrop of a report that I was involved with. Striking a balance was put together by the Liberal Partys regional and rural committee, and it highlighted in many different areas just how much the Labor Party had neglected regional and rural Australia when it was in office—and, as my colleague reminds me, yes, it was very much so. I think it was a shameful situation that we inherited from Labor. After 13 years, the neglect of the country had really got to the stage that it was nothing short of a national scandal.What this report, Striking a balance , showed was that Labor had effectively left out of the policy process many parts of the services to regional and rural Australia. I guess this shows why, in the last election, there was such an enormous swing in the country areas. There was a significantly bigger swing there than in the city areas because the Labor Party had neglected them so much.I will just quickly touch on a number of those areas. Unemployment was certainly number one on the list. People in the country were very much more aware than those in the city of just how much it was affecting their local communities, particularly amongst the young. We saw that while national youth unemployment exceeded one in four in some parts it was as high as one in three. But in parts of country Victoria, for example, it was even higher. In Western Victoria, youth unemployment hit 36 per cent and at one stage in the Mallee it hit a staggering 66 per cent. While these are the official figures, I think we all know that probably behind them the story is even more grim than those official figures show.One of the first things that the Howard government has set about to do is to put in place the building blocks for not only jobs but sustained growth in jobs. So we have seen a number of very positive moves. We have got the work for the dole scheme that has been announced and has been so well received right throughout the community. It has been so well received by everyone but the Labor Party. The Labor Party just does not like it because it shows them up for their inadequacies while they were in government.The second thing was the change to industrial relations. The changes to the unfair dismissal laws have certainly started to give small business in particular, but other businesses as well, a bit of confidence in starting to employ more people. That, as much as anything, will start the change for some new growth. Small business has also been given a number of incentives. In country areas we can identify more than 100,000 small businesses and they are starting to see some of the benefits not only from the industrial relations changes, but also from the rollover relief from capital gains tax, which has just gone through the House, from the cuts to the provisional tax uplift factor and—as we are going to hear later this month—from the way we are going to reduce the burden of red tape and paperwork on small business. Talk to anyone in small business and they will tell you what a problem that is.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1996&hyphen;97 Cognate bills: APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 4) 1996&hyphen;97 APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1996&hyphen;97","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1/speech[12]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

587,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Mr HAWKER","8H4","(Wannon)","LP","N/A",2140,"—Before the interruption, I was talking about some of the moves the government was making to increase employment opportunities, as well as the training aspects of the Green Corps. I would also like to mention the upgrading of the apprenticeship system, something that had sadly been run down under Labor to a 30&hyphen;year low. Not only are we going to make it quicker and less complex for all those involved, we are going to be establishing one&hyphen;stop apprenticeship shops which we believe will certainly make a positive contribution to assisting young people to get into trades. All of us recognise the value of that.Another aspect I would like to touch on quickly is the provision of health services in country areas. Unfortunately, contrary to what many think, while the country may have many attractions, the statistics show that in many cases the health of people in the country is not as great we would like it to be. Without going into too much detail on that, I think part of the problem, as we all recognise, is the difficulty of providing services in the country and, in many cases, just attracting doctors to some of the country centres.Again, this is an area where the previous Labor government certainly neglected the country. While one could not say that they actually did nothing, we did see during the last four years of the Labor government the most amazing thing: every time there was a problem, we would have a conference. Or we would set up the National Rural Health Alliance, or we would have the National Rural Health Strategy, and then we had the Australian Rural Health Institution. It made everyone feel good but, unfortunately, it did not really tackle the major problem. As the Department of Human Services and Health told the previous government, the problem was quite simply that we needed at least another 300 GPs in country areas.Contrast this with what the coalition government is doing. The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has been quick to act, setting up a number of private health initiatives. Firstly, he is researching and monitoring the profile of the rural medical work force to find ways and means of trying to get young doctors to take up some of these places in the country. Secondly, there are scholarships for medical students to work in country areas. Thirdly, there is the creation of university departments of rural health—there will be one in each state. I am looking forward to the announcement of what is going to be occurring in my state of Victoria, particularly some of the positive aspects for my electorate of Wannon. And the new Medicare agencies will make access to Medicare much easier.Looking at education, it is most disturbing to see the difference between the participation rate and the retention rate for year 12 students in the country and the city. We find that year 12 country students have fallen behind their city cousins, 52 per cent compared with 66 per cent. In tertiary education, the really disturbing thing is to find that, between 1989 and 1995, the number of country students fell from 25 per cent to 16 per cent. Sadly, country students are 60 per cent less likely than city students to take up tertiary education. Despite all this, Labor refused to face the major cause of this problem. Basically, it boils down to one simple thing: that it costs more to get education for country students than it does for city students. That is one of the major problems we are facing. Already, we are seeing that the coalition has increased access to tertiary and vocational education for thousands of country students. We have seen $2.3 billion in extra funding for government schools—many of them are small schools in country areas.We are also seeing $187 million allocated to strengthen the ties between schools and business. We have seen an increase in the basic boarding allowance for isolated children. We have another 4,000 undergraduate scholarships to be provided for disadvantaged students. There are also some changes that have occurred to the actual means test. I believe that will see a better targeting of that assistance.I will touch quickly on a couple of other transport issues. Roads in the country have been sadly neglected. This is being addressed by the government to some extent through the black spots program. It will take some time to turn around the neglect that occurred under the previous government, but there is an increase in funding. A number of projects in my electorate, as well in other parts of Australia, are attacking the problem.We have also tackled some of the difficulties facing people who have been affected by severe droughts. I would like to talk more about what is happening in rural Australia, but I will just touch on the issue of the speeding up of the modernisation of country telephone exchanges—something that was long overdue. We are very pleased that, by the end of this year, 97 per cent of telephone exchanges will have been modernised, which is bringing forward the previous governments program. That recognises that people in the country deserve access to services similar to those in the city.In conclusion, this government has tackled some of the major problems facing country areas in terms of massive budgetary problems and the neglect of regional and rural Australia. There are also a number of very exciting programs coming on, such as the Natural Heritage Trust, the national landcare program and the Prime Ministers initiative on the supermarket to Asia.This is something that my colleague the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) has a very direct involvement in. We are delighted to see this occurring. This initiative of the government is going to bring tremendous benefits to regional Australia and bring some lasting benefits to agriculture.I am pleased to have been able to speak in this debate. It was great to have the opportunity to talk about the benefits of the first year of the Howard&hyphen;Fischer government and to highlight the achievements made and the achievements that will come from the measures that have been put in train.

I want to talk about what is happening in my electorate of Ballarat. I want to talk about how we are creating jobs and creating the confidence that underpins the recovery that this government is now driving so hard.Last Friday we had great news in Ballarat. I am sure the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) shared my enthusiasm for the announcement about the Department of Social Security telecentres. We were in our electorates for that announcement last Friday, and I was at home on the weekend between the sitting weeks. That initiative was about confidence, about a government getting in and making positive announcements.It was about 100 new jobs in Ballarat. It was great news. I have not heard anything from the member for Batman regarding this. I am sure he will find some problems with it somewhere, like Senator Carr found problems with the one&hyphen;stop apprenticeship shop. He had the gall, as I quoted from the AAP wire, to allege that Ballarat was not an area of high unemployment. I can assure him that it is and, as I quoted from the AAP wire the other day, that is what was said and that is what I quoted, and that is what I believe he said.Let us have a look at this DSS telecentre. It is about providing opportunities for local people to make the contribution that they want. I get a bit concerned when I see quotes such as that from the member from Batman when he was talking about the work for the dole scheme. I was very disappointed, and I believe people around Australia will be too, to hear the opposition spokesman talking in these terms. When he was talking about opposing work for the dole, he said:They—in other words, unemployed people—go home and go back to bed or watch TV for the rest of the week.That is a very clear message from the member for Batman as to what the Australian people can expect of him from now on.I think it is pretty disappointing that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) also seems to have been trying to score a political point. I hope that is not the reason for his saying this, but you have to suspect that maybe it is. He said that Labors billion dollar training programs were successful not because they led to jobs but because the unemployed `werent around the streets bothering everybody else. I cannot for one minute believe that my honourable colleague opposite would condone those sorts of comments, because I think that denigrates the very people that we should all be working to support. The member for Lyons (Mr Adams) and myself know that the 100 jobs that will be created in places like Ballarat and in his electorate are absolutely critical to the ongoing success of those regions.I spoke about the pilot program one&hyphen;stop apprenticeship shop for Ballarat.

I have been talking about where Ballarat is and where it is going. Again, I would like to tell the chamber that the Minister for Veterans Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) announced two weeks ago that ISSC, which is very actively involved in information technology in Ballarat, won a contract for the Department of Veterans Affairs.This is great news for regional Australia because it shows that the government is committed to putting those government services into regional centres. It is great news indeed. And we won it on our merits. We won it because we have taken the hard steps: we have gone out and sold Ballarat as a centre for information technology; we have sold our advantages; and we have sold that stable, skilled work force, people wanting to get in and have a go, that are prepared to train. We have been able to sell the fact that we have two universities in Ballarat; good, proactive universities with strong private sector links.The simple fact is we have heard a lot of talk recently, and we heard a bit downstairs today from the member for Hotham and the member for Batman, who have suddenly had this huge wave, I suspect, of guilt. I think they know that they did everything wrong, ripped the heart out of this country but did absolutely nothing at all about putting in place some mechanisms to support people that were going to be affected.I find it absolutely incredible to hear this talk about tariff reductions.

He just rang them and told them, `This is what youre going to do. TCF footwear, 45 to 27 per cent; motor cars, 40 to 25 per cent. Where was the member for Hotham, this new&hyphen;found tariff man? He was actually the great tariff slasher in government, but all of a sudden he thinks there might be a few brownie points made out of this and he has done a complete reversal.The problem is that they went ahead and did it and did absolutely nothing about addressing the fundamentals, the budget, micro&hyphen;economic reform, IR, you name it. These are the sorts of benefits that the people of Ballarat will get from this government.Ballarat is a community of decent, hard&hyphen;working people, or people who are desperately trying to get a job, who are doing their bit for the community. The effect of low interest rates alone has been of enormous benefit to the people of Ballarat, the people of Avoca, the people of Ballan, the people of Stawell and towns and cities right throughout my electorate. The small business people, farmers, you name it, have directly benefited from a low interest rate regime. They are reaping the rewards and the rewards are that they have actually got some money in their pockets now to help pay their mortgage or pay it off a bit quicker. Small business people can start investing and employing and that is what it is about. That is what this budget was all about. It was about giving people the opportunity to do what they do best and the Australian people and the people of Ballarat are no different—they simply want to have a chance. They have got some very basic needs that every member of parliament has. They are about raising a family, about having a decent, honest society, about being able to raise their children, about having a set of values that they can adhere to. Part of that is to have the finances to support the family, to create employment and small business. That is what it is all about.Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not think the Australian people want to be millionaires. I just think they want to get on and do those very basic things that I am sure you and everyone in the chamber today is about—putting a roof over your head, providing for your family, making sure your kids get a good education to get a chance to make their contribution.Time is running out and I know that my colleague would like to say a few words before this debate is closed.

593,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Mr ENTSCH","7K6","(Leichhardt)","LP","N/A",2145,"—I rise here this evening to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and to bring to the attention of the House a recent event that in my view again throws into question the integrity, competence and even&hyphen;handedness of our federal Civil Aviation Safety Authority.At 4.12 p.m. on Wednesday, 19 February a small aviation company by the name of Wingz North Aviation was thrown into total turmoil when it was advised, via the fax, that its charter licence had been suspended immediately for alleged breaches of safety regulations.Wingz North is a small family company with an excellent reputation and this has been confirmed by the overwhelming community support that I have received in the past two weeks. I have received petitions containing over 500 signatures of citizens of the Torres Strait. Add to this numerous letters of support from other small businesses and you can see clearly that Wingz North enjoys unprecedented support from the community it serves.Wingz North was established in February 1991 and is still operated and owned by its original founders, Gary and Tamara Maile. From what started as a three aircraft operation, it has grown to 12 aircraft based in both Cairns and Horn Island in the Torres Strait. The company employs 12 full&hyphen;time pilots, between them totalling 22,000 flying hours, and eight full&hyphen;time support staff. They have a wage bill of some $500,000 a year, a maintenance bill of over $900,000 a year and their annual turnover is in excess of $4 million.Mr Deputy Speaker, this is not a little backyard operation, but an efficient, successful family business. In the past six months they have carried approximately 2,000 passengers per month and made over 2,000 take&hyphen;offs and landings per month without any serious incident.Of the 33 non&hyphen;compliance notices served on Wingz North, some dating back to October 1995, 22 were of a minor administrative nature. They included, for example, incomplete signatures on the rear of forms, all of which were rectified immediately on advice; three minor maintenance breaches when 50&hyphen;hour visual inspections were less than two hours late; a further maintenance breach when a 100&hyphen;hour service was overdue by approximately one hour—it should be noted that the service fell due during a four&hyphen;hour flight to Cairns for that maintenance—an overload problem in October 1995, for which the pilot was suspended and CASA expressed satisfaction with the outcome; and one case of unrestrained luggage involving two pillows and a bag of disposable nappies.All the breaches that I have mentioned here are over an 18&hyphen;month period and all were rectified immediately when they were brought to the attention of the company. Of the other five breaches, there were three overload allegations of which two are being strenuously denied by Wingz North. The other two, a dangerous goods breach and a roster discrepancy, were based on allegations by a disgruntled ex&hyphen;pilot and were made months after the termination of his employment. I might add that this pilot is currently pursuing an unfair dismissal claim against the company while defending legal action by Wingz North for fraud allegations. Based on these breaches, CASA has embarked on a heavy&hyphen;fisted and bloody&hyphen;minded campaign to totally destroy this business, and I have been advised late this evening that an appeal by Wingz North against the decision has been overturned. There is every possibility that this business will close down permanently on Friday because of CASAs actions.We can never compromise on air safety, but it is important that air safety authorities remain ever diligent. What I cannot accept is a bureaucratic, authoritarian regime that, from evidence I have received, is prepared at worst to overlook and at best to offer wrist slaps to very serious breaches of safety by other operators, while at the same time targeting an individual in what would appear to be an over&hyphen;reaction in a very heavy&hyphen;handed attempt to make a statement. I do not make these allegations lightly, but I have been made aware of serious and dangerous breaches to air safety by other operators which have been brought to the attention of CASA, but which, for whatever reason, they have decided to either ignore or wrist slap.Just to make you aware of the seriousness of the issue: as recently as 18 February this year, an aircraft taxiing at Badu Island for take&hyphen;off hit some fibre board markers which were thrown through the propeller and smashed to pieces. The pilot did not stop to check the damage but continued to take off. This airline is still flying. Another charter operator, on 30 January 1997, ran off the end of the airstrip at Kubin Village on Moa Island causing damage to the propeller. This aircraft was then flown back to Horn Island before any maintenance was attempted.I have what is called a SNAG in the industry, a defect report on a particular aircraft showing some 25 defects, some of which are quite serious. Yet that aircraft from another airline was still allowed to continue to fly. I have many more examples of serious inconsistencies with regard to CASAs operation in Far North Queensland, many of them equally as serious as those that I have already mentioned. But I guess one of the classics was an aircraft bound for Horn Island broadcasting through a radio on the wrong frequency, creating a potential near&hyphen;miss situation. This aircraft, I have been reliably informed, was flown by none other than CASA flight operations inspectors. It certainly raises the question of competence.Light aircraft travel in the Torres Strait region is a lifeline for the Torres Strait people. It is an essential service, not unlike the buses and taxi services of our metropolitan cities. It is a very difficult area to fly in and a hazardous one, given that some of the airstrips are the shortest in Australia and there is very little room for pilot error. On the island of Mer, the airstrip length is only 525 metres; on Darnley, it is 440 metres, and on Mabuiag, it is 420 metres. You can see that there is real skill required to negotiate these strips. I guess what is most important is that the local residents need to have total confidence in their airline and the pilots, and it is patently obvious from the petitions and signatures that I have received to date that Wingz North enjoys that support.Torres Strait, and for that matter, most remote air charter services, are very different from the metropolitan commuter services, as are the people with their special needs that access this service. And those needs should be taken into consideration by any safety authority.Many of the breaches I mentioned before, while not of a serious technical nature likely to cause disaster, certainly need to be brought to the attention of the operator. Given the nature of the work that the operators do and the areas in which they operate, I have no doubt that they were genuine oversights, or in some cases, misjudgments by pilots working under difficult circumstances and certainly not deliberate attempts to flout regulations. I think that it is certainly evident by the fast and positive response by Wingz North in dealing with and rectifying these problems.I see nothing in the evidence presented to me that could in any way be interpreted as a hanging offence and, make no bones about it, this is exactly what CASA is trying to do with Wingz North. The final word should go to Martin Keating, the operations manager for Wingz North, who said in a recent letter to me:At Wingz North I have discovered an operator/owner, Mr Gary Maile, who was strictly by the book. The difference at Wingz North is that Gary owns or is paying off all the aircraft. Any defect reported on any aircraft is attended to immediately. No mean feat when you consider half the fleet is based 800 kilometres from any spare parts department in Cairns.Gary is the fairest businessman I have ever come across, to his staff and his customers. Gary has a great empathy and understanding of the Torres Strait people. It is a difficult place to live and work in by virtue of its remoteness. It is unlike the mainland as far as the services are concerned and the service that Gary provides is a vital link to the population.By their actions, it is little wonder that CASA and many of its representatives are currently held in contempt by a large section of the aviation industry. I can certainly see why there is such a strong call for CASA to be purged of all its incompetent representation and to have them replaced by capable professionals with working knowledge of an industry that they are engaged to administer. I call on CASA to let common sense prevail, get Wingz North into operation and not destroy it in an effort to try to justify their own existence.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1996&hyphen;97 Cognate bills: APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 4) 1996&hyphen;97 APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1996&hyphen;97","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1/speech[14]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
594,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Mr ANDREW THOMSON","FB6","(Wentworth—","LP","Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs)",2148,"—It is my task, in the absence of the Minister for Finance, Mr Fahey, to make a few remarks to sum up what has obviously been a very long and wide&hyphen;ranging debate. I am sure it has given many members traditionally the opportunity to make remarks and air their views on the general state of the economy, the prospects for our future, the administration of a large number of government programs, as well as on specific appropriations for various organs of the government. One of these is for the Civil Aviation Safety Authority about which my friend and colleague the member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch) has just made some very pertinent remarks.That said, we have before us Appropriation Bills Nos. 2, 3 and 4 and these together comprise the additional estimates for this financial year, 1996&hyphen;97. These additional appropriations total some $1,402 million. However, they are partly offset by savings made in Appropriation Acts Nos. 1 and 2 last year reflecting the governments determination to improve the efficiency of continuing programs. These savings amount to $343 million and, after allowing for these, the total appropriations sought represent a net increase of $1,059 million for appropriations in this financial year, an increase of about three per cent on the amounts that were made available through the annual appropriations at the time of the budget last year.Obviously, the debate has given many new members a second chance to comment on the governments management of the economy since the election in March last year. I am sure it has given members of the opposition the chance to reflect on the enormous folly of some of the things that were done under the previous government. Indeed, it has perhaps given them the chance to bathe in the crystal clear waters of honesty and forthrightness which they were not allowed to do when members of a government. I hope this has given them a refreshing opportunity, such as the one experienced by members of the government.Question resolved in the affirmative.Bill read a second time.Bill—by leave—reported to the House without amendment.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1996&hyphen;97 Cognate bills: APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 4) 1996&hyphen;97 APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1996&hyphen;97","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1/speech[15]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
