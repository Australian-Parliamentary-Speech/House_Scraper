In the circumstances, the Government has prohibited the export of wire and wire netting. About twelve months ago my department took over the control of the manufacture and distribution of wire used in making wire netting with the result that the production has practically doubled. The Government is encouraging the manufacture of wire for essential purposes and has received assurances that additional factories for the manufacture of this commodity will be established. One new factory is expected to commence production by the end of this year, and it is hoped that Australia will soon again enter the export market for this commodity.","WIRE NETTING","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[1]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

All industrial tribunals have that power. So far as I know, practically all shire and municipal councils in New South Wales are working under State awards. Commonwealth Public Service employees are in precisely the same position; the Commonwealth Public Service Arbitrator can, on application by the unions covering such employees, increase within the limits of the formula, the marginal payments to such employees. The unions covering Commonwealth Government employees number 22, and they have presented a claim to the Public Service Commissioner, but not to the Public Service Arbitrator. It was realized that that number of unions could not be heard separately, and so the High Council of the Public Service unions - a body representing 22 unions of Commonwealth Government employees - requested that five representatives of the High Council should meet the Public Service Commissioner, and myself if necessary, to discuss their claim. It was pointed out that postal employees were not affiliated with the High Council, and . it was decided to ask their representative, Mr. Dwyer, the federal secretary, to join with the representatives of the High Council in discussing the matter with the Public Service Board, and with me, as the Minister administering the Public Service. The discussions began on the 14th February, and  have continued. The representatives of the unions again met the Public Service Commissioner last week. Certain offers were made regarding adjustments, and I understand that they have referred the matter to their unions. So far, no claim has been submitted to the Public Service Arbitrator, who is the person to determine the matter, but I understand that a move will be made very shortly. I cannot give the honorable member any further information at this stage.","WAGE-PEGGING","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/answer/continue/talk.start","N/A","N/A"

I do not think it did. As I remember it, the president of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions asked me for information about any proposed tax reductions, and it is true that I made some remarks on the subject, but I did not submit any figures. I may have mentioned some amount in what was a very short talk, lasting five minutes perhaps. The Minister for Health >(Senator McKenna) addressed a union conference in Melbourne, and I think he discussed taxation, and submitted some figures, but no proposals regarding taxation were made by Senator McKenna or by me.

Declarations of cars is infinitesimal compared with other types of motor transport vehicles. Twenty-one cars only have been declared to the Commission by the Departments of the Navy, Army and Air in South Australia, and declarations of purely nominal quantities in other States would not entitle South Australia to participate.Of the 21 cars in South Australia, Commonwealth departments have absorbed nine and State departments four. Of the balance, six were marketed to the Ford Company, and two to General Motors-Holdens Limited.Priority to purchase for all cars is controlled by the Directorate of Emergency Road Transport, which gives full consideration to each application, allocating vehicles according to the urgency of the need. Preference within- priorities is given to ex-servicemen.For the honorable gentlemans information, the cars declared would not exceed 2 per cent, of total motor transport vehicles made available to the Commission. A check is being made of total declarations in all States. The releases in Victoria are 14,870 trucks and 288 cars. Many of the cars declared are wrecks which can be used only for recovery of components.","COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS COMMISSION","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[5]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Ultimately, three men were selected and their names announced, and nearly every part of the act has been proclaimed. There has been a little delay in the gazettal of the names of the members of the Joint Coal Board due to some legal difficulty in regard to the terms of the agreement with these particular individuals, but the chairman actually commenced his preparatory work on the 1st January, and, I understand, the other members, although their names have not yet been gazetted, are engaged in surveying the position. I am hopeful that these names will be gazetted within the next week. Some difficulty has been experienced also in connexion with the appointment of a Coal Industry Tribunal.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","DEDMAN, John","KCF","N/A","N/A","N/A","8","- The point raised by the honorable member arises in regard to the training of all classes of ex-servicemen. I have previously explained to the House that it is the intention and the objective of those who are in charge of the training scheme to have a flow of trainees coming out into the community at a rate at which they can be absorbed. It is not always possible to ensure that the number of trainees being released for any particular industry will coincide exactly with the number that can be absorbed in that industry. Perhaps the trouble is more acute in respect of agriculture than it is in respect of other industries. One reason why it is impossible to ensure that all the trainees will be placed in industry or, in connexion with agriculture, will be placed on farms, is that the necessary accommodation, and the training staffs needed for their training, are not available except in so far as they can be obtained from State governments. Consequently, we have to ensure that the existing training facilities in the States shall be used continuously. This means that ex-servicemen must enter those training institutions in batches. Sometimes, when a number of men have completed their training it is not possible to absorb all of them immediately or, in respect of men proposing to go on the land, it is not possible to place them on farms immediately. The Government has considered that those individuals who cannot be placed in appropriate industries immediately their training has been completed ought to take every opportunity to find employment for themselves. They are encouraged to do so. At the present time, of course, more jobs are available in the community than there are men to fill them. Perhaps it is rather hard to expect individuals who have been trained for settlement on the land to take a job of some other kind. I shall examine that point, with a view to determining whether special consideration can be given to trainees in that class. I point out, however, that in the last resort, since there are plenty of jobs available in the community, no absolute hardship is caused, because those men can obtain employment of some kind to bridge the gap between the completion of their training and the availability of their farms for settlement by them.","RE-ESTABLISHMENT","QUESTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[2]/answer[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The honorable member asked whether the Government had taken any steps to get the maintenance engineers back to work. The answer is that the Government has taken action. The matter has been referred to the court, as the honorable member probably knows, and Judge Sugerman - an appropriate name in this dispute - has referred it to Commissioner Mooney. The Commissioner called the parties together on Monday and told them that he had been requested to hear their claims and make a decision. He said that he would do so and commenced the hearing. Then - and this answers the honorable gentlemans question - Commissioner Mooney suggested that the hearing be suspended temporarily to ascertain whether an arrangement could be made for the men to resume work at the sugar refinery immediately. He suggested that the parties work out a formula which would enable the 30 men concerned - not 21 as stated by the honorable member - to go back to the refinery so as to relieve the situation, which is as urgent as the honorable member has said. The parties then met in an attempt to evolve a means of getting the men back to work on a  blank cheque  basis before the commissioner came to a decision. The parties had three difficulties to overcome. The first was whether the men would be paid, according to the final decision made by the commissioner, retrospectively to the day when they returned to the refinery. The second related to annual leave payments for the men, who wished to ensure that the break would not interfere with their rights. The third related to payments from the provident fund to which all employees at the refinery contribute. The men wished to have their rights in that regard safeguarded also. They have not been able to secure a satisfactory settlement on these three points, on which agreement ought to be reached. In nine out of ten instances in disputes of this nature, such difficulties are ironed out, usually without any trouble. Until 1.30 p.m. to-day, the parties had not found a solution of the problems raised, but they will be called together again by the commissioner to-morrow and I believe and hope that he will help to work out a formula which will enable the men to go back to work.","FRUIT CANNING","QUESTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[4]/answer/continue[2]/talk.start","N/A","N/A"

It was recognized that if such an arrangement were made it would have to be at a price much lower than the rate being obtained for export wheat at the time - 9s. 6d. a bushel f.o.b. - but, on the other hand, it would be much higher than that to which, based on past records, prices might be expected to fall during the period of the agreement. The New Zealand Minister also pointed out that very high import prices would be followed by high prices for the New Zealand crop, and that even though very low prices followed, uneconomic production in New Zealand would be stimulated, and imports reduced in consequence.The Commonwealth Government ultimately decided, however, that it could not sell from the then current crop - 1945- 46 - under the ruling export price and a contract was completed for 4,500,000 bushels to be supplied out of that crop at 9s. 6d. a bushel f.o.b. bulk. The contract contained other details such as the extra price for bagged wheat and shipping arrangements. When this contract was under discussion the question of supplies for the following four years arose, and it was agreed that in due course a further agreement be negotiated. In discussing the price that might be included in a further agreement, we agreed that a fall in export prices was possible and that if prices did fall away in the following twelve months from the then current price, the price for four years would be a matter for discussion. It was agreed, however, that the price would be no higher than 5s. 9d. a bushel. It might be less but it would not be more. No other details were decided upon and no contract was made as in the case of the 1945-46 crop, the understanding being that it would be negotiated later and if it were made the price would be no greater than 5s. 9d.When Mr. Nash, the New Zealand Minister for Finance, was recently in Australia he had with him the New Zealand Wheat Controller and a contract was then negotiated and approved. Its main clauses are as follows: -Australia to supply all New Zealands requirements over the four years 1946-47 to 1949-50.A maximum of 4,500,000 bushels would be supplied out of each seasons crop at 5s. 9d. a bushel f.o.b. bulk.Any quantity supplied above 4,500,000 from any one seasons crop would be at a price to be negotiated.New Zealand would not take less than 3,500,000 bushels from any one of the four seasons crops.In reviewing the whole of the circumstances, the Commonwealth Government decided that over the four seasons, it would return current prices to the grower, the outcome of the contract with the New Zealand Government being on account of the Commonwealth Government. The Wheat Board will therefore be paid by the Commonwealth Government for each cargo at the export price ruling at the date arrangements are concluded by the Wheat Board for the shipment of the wheat and the Commonwealth Government will be paid by the New Zealand Government at 5s 9d.","WHEAT","QUESTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[11]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This matter raises the whole question of the propriety of any government in this country arbitrarily taking possession of the products of persons and arbitrarily disposing of them, by virtue of its constitutional power, at prices substantially less than those which could have been realized had ordinary trading been permitted.

We are accustomed to interjections of that kind from the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. I repeat that this matter would never have come to the knowledge of the Australian wheat-growers had not the New Zealand Minister for Supply fortuitously revealed, to the embarrassment of his Labour colleague in the Australian Government, that an  undertaking  - to use his own words - had been given by the Australian Government to supply wheat to New Zealand, for a period of years, at a price less than half the prevailing world parity price. Over a period of months, I asked repeatedly in this Parliament for information about this matter, and the wheatgrowers representatives outside Parliament also sought information. We asked whether any negotiations had taken place with a view to disposing of wheat to the Government of New Zealand at the price mentioned. However, we were met by a stone wall of silence, and only now has it been possible for me, and the representatives of the growers associated with me, to force the Government to recant its original intention, and conclude an arrangement which honours the undertaking to sell wheat to New Zealand at a bargain price by placing on the Australian taxpayers the burden of making good to the wheat-growers the money of which they would have been deprived had we not been attentive to their inter ests, and directed public attention in such a way as to compel the granting of this measure of delayed justice to the Australian wheat-grower.","WHEAT","QUESTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[11]/question[2]/continue[2]/talk.start","N/A","N/A"
