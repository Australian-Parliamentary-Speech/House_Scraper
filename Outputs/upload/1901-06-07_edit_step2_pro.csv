26,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"KNOX, William","KYT","Kooyong","N/A","N/A",815,"- I move -That the standing orders should provide that, upon Mr. Speaker taking the chair, he shall read a prayer.I would like to explain why I have ventured to assume the responsibility of asking the House to consider this motion. Immediately after the Commonwealth elections I wrote to the head of the denomination with which I am associated, the Presbyterian Church of Victoria, asking that body if any steps were being taken unitedly by the churches to secure consideration by Parliament of the need of opening its proceedings by the reading of prayers. I found that the Council of the Churches was taking the necessary action, and subsequently I was invited by the churches to move a motion. That I felt an honour and a privilege, to which I readily assented, and accordingly I gave notice of this motion. I felt that this action might have been properly provided for in the standing orders, but I found that the Government preferred that it should receive a distinct instruction from the House, and I am hopeful thatI shall receive the individual support of Ministers. I then interviewed the various churches to get. a personal knowledge of what their views were on the subject. The result was that a circular was issued under which the opinions of the heads of the various religious bodies were placed, I believe, in the hands of honorable members. The circular was as follows : -The Council of Churches in Victoria, deeply impressed with the propriety and necessity of a national recognition of our dependence upon the blessing of Almighty God in our prosperity, desires respectfully to urge upon the members of both Houses of the Federal Parliament that the sittings should be regularly opened with a suitable form of prayer. To show the practical unanimity with which this desire is expressed, we subjoin communications on the subject from representatives of the different churches, and indulge the hope that you will give the matter your most favorable consideration. In making this request, we would deprecate any thought of dictation, our motive being entirely to afford information to our legislators as to the feeling and desire of the Christian public on this question.The Archbishop of Sydney and Primate of Australia and Tasmania wrote to  this effect -I desire, on behalf of the Church of England in Australia and Tasmania, to express a very earnest hope that the sessions of the Federal Parliament may be always opened with prayer to Almighty God for His direction and divine blessing. Such a recognition of our dependence upon, and faith in, the Supreme Ruler of the universe is surely a public duty which it is befitting for the Houses of Legislature in a Christian Commonwealth to perform ; a duty the discharge of which will tend to promote a high standard of political responsibility, and to help forward the growth of national righteousness.Archbishop Carr, of Melbourne, wrote as follows : -As legislators derive their authority ultimately from the Supreme Lawgiver, and are dependent on Him for the knowledge and counsel and fortitude which are required to  decree justice, it is fitting and highly advantageous that their deliberations should open with a recognition of the dominion of the Almighty and a humble petition for His guidance. I, therefore, earnestly desire that a suitable form of prayer should be prepared and used at the opening of each session of the Commonwealth Parliament.I shall be prepared to give assistance in drafting or revising such form of prayer as would be acceptable to all who desire the light of Divine wisdom on the deliberations of the peoples representatives.TheRightRev. George Tait, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of Victoria, wrote in these terms -I was glad to see on Monday night, as part of the splendid illumination of our ParliamentHouse, the prayer, God bless our Commonwealth. To this prayer, all the people say Amen. But one of the channels through which Gods blessing comes to a nation is righteous and beneficent laws. It seems fitting, therefore, that when our legislators assemble to frame our laws, they should acknowledge their dependence on Almighty God, and seek His guidance and help. I hope that steps will be taken to insert among the standing orders framed for the guidance of the House, one providing that every sitting should be opened with prayer.The Rev. A.R. Edgar, President of the Wesleyan Conference, sent the following letter : -I beg, on behalf of the Wesleyan Methodist Churches of Victoria and Tasmania, to suggest that the ordinary sittings of the Federal Parliament, like those of the Legislative Council of the State of Victoria, be opened with prayer.The Constitution Act declares that the Commonwealth is undertaken humbly relying upon the blessing of Almighty God. There was prayer at the opening of the Parliament last Thursday, and prayer at the beginning of each days session would undoubtedly delight Christian sentiment.From the Rev. Dr. Bevan, Congregational Church, Collins-street, Melbourne, this letter was received : -I sincerely hope that the Houses of Parliament of Australia will see their way to making arrangement for the opening of their sessions by prayer. We are certainty a Christian State, and the recognition of our dependence upon God, and our need of His guidance and blessing that our national life should be strong and lasting, will be in accordance with the desire and sentiment of the vast majority of our people. Democratic communities as - for example, America - have shown that this can be done without infringing the religious liberty of any citizens ; and surely the wisdom and moderation of southern legislators and people will not be incapable of doing that which in a striking and simple, fashion shall make plain our relations to the Lord of Nations by whose strength alone they can be established.I received the following letter from Mr. C. W. Walrond, honorary secretary of the Baptist Union of Victoria : - -By direction of the Baptist Union I beg respectfully to forward to you the following resolution, unanimously adopted at the session held at Bendigo this week : -  That the Assembly of the Baptist Union, in session assembled, views with much satisfaction the motion tabled in the Senate, and in the House of Representatives, to have the sittings in both Houses daily opened with prayer, and earnestly hopes and believes that the members will agree thereto.Other letters representative of the Christian feeling of the people throughout the Commonwealth have been received, and I understand that honorable members have received communications from other organizations and religious bodies to that effect. The practice in the State Parliaments has not been uniform. In New South Wales, South Australia, and Tasmania no prayer has been read ; but prayers are read in Queensland and Western Australia, and were read in the Legislative Council of Victoria.","N/A","PRAYERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

28,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"KNOX, William","KYT","N/A","N/A","N/A",817,"- Although the practice is not uniform in the States, I would venture to claim that we ought to look to a wider area of national interest in other great Federations of the world. We might look to the mother of Parliaments, where, honorable members are aware, prayers are read in the House of Commons and in the House of Lords. Prayers are also read in each House of the Parliament of the Dominion of Canada. I may refer to a parallel case with ours. In the United States of America, a prayer is read in the House of Representatives and in the Senate. In those cases the chaplain reads the prayer; but I am one of those who believe that it will be better that the prayer, if honorable members approve of the motion, should be read by the Speaker, not by any denominational or sectarian representative. I wish to mention that an offer came from the Rev. Mr. Hughes, incumbent of St. Peters Episcopal Church, undertaking to read the prayer daily; but I replied expressing my own individual opinion as I have expressed it to-day. The form of prayer should be entirely unsectarian in character, and refer only to the fundamental truths acknowledged and professed by all Christian people. I believe that no prayer will have more universal acceptance than the Lords Prayer. What I am anxious to secure is a day by day acknowledgment of our dependence on Almighty God. In our Commonwealth Constitution Act that recognition is recited in noble and memorable words, and at the opening of the Parliament hopeful prayers for Divine assistance were read. I am sure that those prayers found a ready echo through the length and breadth of this Commonwealth, and through the other civilized countries who watched the birth of our nation. I am persuaded that the sense of the vast majority of the people of Australia will be in favour of the step which the motion proposes, and its acceptance by honorable members will be hailed with general satisfaction. This is a subject upon which every honorable member, will have already made up his mind, and I am disposed to believe, from the conversations which I have had with several honorable members on the subject, that it -will be sanctioned by the majority of the House. I earnestly hope that it will have the unanimous approval of honorable members. As delivered by yourself, sir, I am sure that every honorable member is satisfied that the prayer will be read with reverence and propriety. Speaking from my experience of the Legislative Council of Victoria, I can say that the prayer read there at the opening of every sitting was always joined in by all honorable members with fitting decorum and with full attendance. I sincerely confess that I possess no appropriate fitness for the responsible position of submitting this motion to the House. On the contrary, I have a profound sense of my own inefficiency, and the need for Divine guidance in this and the other responsible work which is before me. But in the fullest sense I express the earnest hope that the resolution may find unanimous acceptance, in order that we may, with due reverence, acknowledge the sovereignty of the Almighty, and our dependence upon Him for guidance in our legislation to the end that it may be wise and liberal legislation, for the good of the whole people, for the advancement and prosperity of humanity, and for the cementing together of the brotherhood of the. people of this Commonwealth in fullest loyalty to our King and in fullest loyalty to our God.","N/A","PRAYERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[1]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
29,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"GLYNN, Patrick","KCO","South Australia","N/A","N/A",817,"- I have very much pleasure in seconding the motion which has been so eloquently and effectively proposed by the honorable member for Kooyong. At the same time, I can quite appreciate the motives of the opponents as well as the supporters df a proposal like this. It seems to me that the supporters of the motion think that the manifestation upon a suitable occasion, of the faith which most of us profess in one form or another, at least once a week, should, as coming from a great representative body, not only have a salutary influence upon - the daily relations of the members themselves, but be an example to the rising generation whose destinies to an extent we are engaged in moulding. They think that, as on some minor occasions of life, we should solicit the descent of  prevenient grace, and seek regeneration by prayer, a submission to the will of Providence, and an appeal for guidance to His omniscience, should be regarded as an appropriate preface to our daily gropings for light. On the other hand, there are some who, taking a less ideal view of the occasion, think it should be regarded as a purely business one; that the silent prayer of the heart, which is open to all who wish to offer it, might, as the more voluntary, probably prove the more efficacious, and that custom too often tends to lower what should be a fervent aspiration into a cold formality. But, Mr. Speaker, we must take human nature as it is, with its many imperfections; we must deal with ourselves as men, liable, if left alone, to be remiss or to forget - men who require the reminder of some recurring occasion, or the stimulating sense of community of purpose, to keep them to the regular discharge of their higher obligations. As to the possibility of a prayer becoming a mere lifeless formality, the remedy is with ourselves. We can scarcely refuse to do good because we may possibly be tempted to do evil, or make the possibility of a subsequent fall an obstacle to an attempt to rise. A form of prayer such as the Lords Prayer in the revised version, as published by the University of Oxford, would be one in which all worshippers, whatever may be our differences in the non-essentials of form and method, could readily join, and we may possibly take from its spirit, and the feeling of unity of ultimate aim induced by its repetition in common, a larger measure of charity and of mutual toleration. It may possibly be that many a man, whose faith may be somewhat delicate, may remember, that even the ignorant pagan,  who was unable to give form to the object of his hopes, still worshipped where he could not fathom; for on the statue of the Egyptian Isis were inscribed the words -  I am whatever is, whatever was, whatever shall be, and mortal never yet has raised the veil that covers me.","N/A","PRAYERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This is a question that is going to affect our future standing as a House. If we are prepared to have this House opened with prayer we certainly ought to be prepared to have a chaplain, and pay him like honest men, and not do it on the cheap. That is the position I take. In the United States they open the House with prayer, but there is a paid chaplain connected with Parliament, and known as the Chaplain of the House. In England, there is a paid chaplain, but there is a recognised State church in England, while there is no recognised State church here, and there is nothing in the Constitution which says that we should have a chaplain, or that we should open the proceedings with prayer I would like to ask the legal members of the House whether it would be really constitutional to have a chaplain and open the House with prayer. If we encroach on the Constitution, may it not be the first breach of which advantage may be taken in future to destroy the liberties of the people? I am thoroughly willing to have the House opened with prayer. I do not give second place to any man in the House in my reverence for prayer and for religion ; but I do hope the House will not lend itself to becoming a part of the whole system of veiled hypocrisy which prevails throughout the world.","N/A","PRAYERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[4]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The amendment which has been put from the Chair precludes me from doing so if I wished, and I had grave doubts whether I should do so at any time. I am not about to oppose the motion, and, so far as the members of the Government are concerned, I am quite sure - and honorable members will agree with me - this ought not to be made a Cabinet question. Therefore, if there are any differences of opinion in the Cabinet on the subject - as to which I have not consulted my colleagues - there will be none the less friendship between its  members. Although 1 do not oppose the motion, I have my doubts whether ordinances of this kind do really tend to the improvement of morality and the inculcation of piety. I have my doubts whether, apart from those prayers we say in church, we should not adopt the advice which is given by a very high teacher, who told us to pray in our closet. I recognise, however, that there are very large differences of opinion on the subject. I know that a large number of those who have their doubts as to the propriety of these ordinances are not so offended in their religious susceptibilities if they are carried out, as those would be who demand that ordinances of this kind should be observed if their wishes were not complied with. That being so, I am inclined to give way to the course which is least offensive to the religious susceptibilities of the public, and, therefore, to assent to a proposition of this kind.

That course was taken in order that there might be no religious quarrel on the subject. To appoint a chaplain of any denomination, unless we are so eminently successful as to find a religious chaplain of no denomination, would only go to feed those religious quarrels of which we have had more than enough in the country which ought to have the least of them - Australia. I therefore hope, quite irrespective of the question of salary which the honorable member for Kennedy has raised, that there will be no thought of appointing a chaplain, and that the prayer read will be purely unsectarian, and one acceptable to the feelings and wishes of members of every denomination in the community as well as to honorable members in this House. I believe in the suggestion contained in the amendment, that the prayer should be the Lords prayer - nothing more and nothing less - a prayer which can be accepted by the Unitarian, and which contains no request of the Almighty which a member of the Hebrew faith could not readily accept. A prayer which is of the broadest, which for that reason appeals in the strongest degree to our common feeling of humanity and our common reverence for our Maker, is the kind of prayer which should be adopted ; and I hope no other prayer will be thought of by the Standing Orders Committee.

Coming from Queensland, I may say that in the first session of Parliament, which was held there in 1860, a motion was moved by the late Mr. Henry Jordan, a Nonconformist, that the proceedings of Parliament should be opened by prayer. The prayer suggested then was a prayer for the High Court of Parliament, adapted to the position of the State Parliament of Queensland. That prayer has been read by the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly and by the President of the Legislative Council from that time up to the present, and has met with universal concurrence. Of course we are .aware that no two minds are constituted alike, and that every man has his own opinions with regard to religious matters. In the Parliament of Queensland there are some honorable members with peculiar ideas on the subject, and if they have any objection to the course taken by Parliament, they generally walk outside the Bar of the House whilst the prayer is being read, so that the religious susceptibilities of honorable members are not in any way offended. I agree with what has been suggested by the honorable member for Tasmania, Mr. OMalley, that the Lords prayer would be an appropriate one with which to open the proceedings of the House. It embraces no religious dogma. It is, as the Prime Minister has observed, one which appeals to the common humanity of all of us.An Honorable Member. -It is socialistic.","N/A","PRAYERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I am aware that the Speaker of the House of Commons appoints his own chaplain, and that the chaplain continues in office during the Speakers term. But in England there is a recognised State Church, and a State clergyman is therefore appointed. But the honorable member for Tasmania, Mr. OMalley, must also know that the very fact that a chaplain is so appointed has given very great offence to other denominations, and seeing that we have no recognised -State religion we ought not to follow in the footsteps of the mother country.

A great deal of these statistics, as a matter of comparison, depend for their value upon their method of compilation, and it would be of great advantage if there were some agreement among the statisticians of the different States as to the basis of these compilations, so that when we made use of them for the sake of argument we would know exactly that they were all compiled on the same basis.

I think that it would be better to ask for the information by making the motion read -The rate of customs or excise duty on the articles in use by such industry in each of the States.I think that that would carry out the intention of the mover, and, in asking for the information in that way, we do not go into the question of protection at all.

GROOM (Darling Downs).To my mind the amendment of the honorable member for Tasmania, Sir Philip Fysh, is more valuable than the suggestion of the honorable member for North Sydney. From the discussion to which we have listened it would appear that only the States of Victoria and New South Wales are concerned in this matter ; we have not heard a word about the other States. Now, in Queensland we have adopted a policy of our own, which is quite distinct from that of any of the other States; a policy which we think is beneficial to our interests, and which, by establishing our industries, has given employment to. hundreds and thousands of our population. Under this policy we remitted, in 1896, £50,000 worth of duties, chiefly duties on raw material. If the motion is not amended as the honorable member for Tasmania, Sir Philip Fysh, has proposed, there will not be a word about this exemption in the return which is being moved for. I have some knowledge of the difficulty of collecting these returns, and I know that in the State of Queensland alone a great many supernumerary clerks will have to be appointed to undertake the, work of obtaining this information, because they are now preparing for the meeting of the State Parliament, and if the honorable member thinks that the return will be ready in time to enable this House to use the information in connexion with the discussion on the proposed Tariffs, he will be very much disappointed. If the House had been sitting in January last, and the honorable member had moved for the information then, the return would probably be nearing completion now, and we might have hoped to obtain the information by the end of June or the beginning of J lily ; but, under present circumstances, I think that a great deal of the information which is being asked for will not reach us before the end of November, by which time I hope the Tariff question will be pretty well settled. In my opinion the amendment of the honorable member for Tasmania (Sir Philip Fysh) meets the difficulty which the honorable member for North Sydney has suggested, far better than his own proposition does, and I hope that the honorable member for Kooyong will accept it.","N/A","STATISTICS RE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[10]/interjection[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I think that if the honorable member for Kooyong agrees to the omission of the words to which I refer, it will end the debate. I do not intend to press for their omission ; I make the suggestion for the honorable members consideration.Sir EDWARDBRADDON (Tasmania).If I understand the reason which has actuated the honorable member for Tasmania, Sir Philip Fysh, in moving the amendment, it seems to me that it will not do what he wishes to do, but will to a great extent make the return abortive. If he seeks to show the extent to which the various industries of the States are protected by the exemption of the raw products imported for use in their manufacture, that information should be asked for by adding another paragraph to the motion - The extent to which the exemptions of duty protect the several industries in the State. The object of the amendment is, I assume, to show the extent to which our manufactures are protected by the admission of raw products duty free.

For many years it was the practice of politicians to refer to the number of manufactories in the various States. We used to hear from the Victorian protectionists that the New South Wales freetraders were including every blacksmiths shop under the head of a manufactory. Statisticians got over that difficulty by ascertaining what the horse-power of the different manufactories was. I propose to insert a sixth heading giving the horse-power of the manufactories in existence in the respective States. That will give us some idea of the difference between a blacksmiths shop and a manufactory, which probably gives occupation to 100 or 500 persons.

Their definition of factories is as follows : -All establishments employing four hands or upwards in the manufacture of articles either for the trade, or for stock, or for individual orders must be returned ; also all establishments with less than four hands, where machinery worked by steam, gas, electric, water, wind, or horse power is used ; as well as all industries of an unusual or interesting character.Mr. MAUGER(Melbourne Ports).- I am not going to offer any objection to the motion, but I would suggest that it might be possible to get complete data from the information derived from the census.

There is so much to be done under the various heads, so much information to be collected, especially by a Commonwealth which has not yet had time to turn round or look about for a statistician even, which has so many Acts of Parliament to pass before it can take up the Tariff, notwithstanding its eagerness to deal with that question, and it means to deal with it this session - that the position is a difficult one. If with all the work we have on hand we have to make researches of the most laborious character, with the help only of the statistical departments of the various States, which differ in the basis on which they collect their statistics, he would be a fortunate man indeed who could get the information which has already been asked for, before the Tariff is brought in.

I think we should affirm the principle, at the outset, that at least one days rest in seven shall be given to every employe of the Commonwealth. A practice has grown up in Victoria, at any rate - and here I speak of a State about which I know something- of employing men continuously on Sunday labour. They arc not paid extra wages for this work, but they are occasionally given time off. This is a practice which should be deprecated. If Sunday labour is necessary - and I would have as little of it as possible - the men who do it should receive extra pay; and under all circumstances every man should have one clay off in seven. That means that in place of working some men at high pressure, a greater number of men will be employed. For these reasons, I am strongly in favour of the motion, and I hope it will commend itself to the judgment of the Ministry and the House.","N/A","SUNDAY LABOUR","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Federal Government have taken over three large departments, and may before long have to take over another, viz., Quarantine and Light-houess.There is a vast number ofemployes in the Customs and Postal departments. The financial operations of these departments are considerable. Especially is this the case with the Postal department.
