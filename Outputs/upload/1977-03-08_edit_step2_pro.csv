8,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"SPEAKER, Mr",10000,"N/A","N/A","N/A",1,"- I have to report that the House this day attended Her Majesty the Queen in the Senate chamber, where Her Majesty was graciously pleased to make a speech to both Houses of the Parliament. I received a copy of the Speech, which I now table. The Speech will be included in Hansard for record purposes.The Speech read as follows-Mr President,member of the Senate.Mr Speaker,members of the House of Representatives.It is with great pleasure that I have returned to Australia in this the silver jubilee year of my reign and once again address this Parliament as Queen of Australia.As I look back over Australias development since my first visit in 1954, I am impressed, as you must be, by this nation s many social, economic and cultural achievements.Today the qualities of the Australian people, the character of Australian society and the resources of the Australian continent hold out a great promise and a great challenge.My Government is determined to establish the conditions in which this challenge can be met, this promise realised.At the heart of my Governments policies lie a commitment and a concern; commitment to increasing the freedom, opportunity and equality of the Australian people; and concern with enhancing peoples ability to make their own choices and live their own lives in their own way.The commitment of my Government to these goals stems from the conviction that the progress of Australia as a nation depends on creating the conditions which foster the strength, independence and creativity of its people.Australia has experienced economic difficulties in recent years; my Government has given first priority to restoring the economy and will use all the resources at its disposal to achieve this goal.The prosperity of the Australian people depends on the strength of its productive private sector, on its manufacturing, mining and rural industries.My Government is providing incentives and encouragement to the private sector, and is reducing its own relative demands on national resources so that private industry may have room to grow, provide employment and increase the well-being of all Australians.My Government is not only taking action to restore the economy, it is also making social reforms which are of fundamental importance to the freedom and well-being of the Australian people.My Government is committed to assisting people overcome poverty and disadvantage, and is giving priority to assisting those most in need in a manner increasing their choice, dignity and self-respect.The new family allowance scheme places in every mothers hands an allowance to spend as she thinks is best for the welfare of her family.A housing voucher pilot scheme enabling low income earners to choose for themselves the accommodation most suited to their needs is being examined.The Income Security Review will report progressively to my Government on the rationalisation of income security programmes and on how assistance can first of all be directed to those most in need.My Government is improving the existing arrangements in education in pursuit of equality of opportunity for all Australian students.My Governments economic program is designed to overcome unemployment. However, at the same time, a number of special programs to assist the young unemployed and provide them with opportunities to acquire job skills has been initiated.With the growth over the years of the power of public and private bureaucracies, particular care needs to be taken to protect individual liberties and human rights against unwarranted intrusions.My Government is acting to secure individual rights. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal is now operating, legislation to appoint a Commonwealth Ombudsman has been passed, the Human Rights Commission will be established and a Bill relating to freedom of information will be placed before the Parliament.In the area of industrial relations, one of vital importance to the economic and social well-being of the Australian community, my Government will bring down legislation to protect the rights of individuals and the community, and establish an Industrial Relations Bureau.My Government is acting also to protect and expand political rights and strenghten the responsibility and responsiveness of governments to their citizens.Measures are being taken to secure the rights of those living in Commonwealth territories and a referendum will be held to seek approval for territorial voters to vote in future referenda.Other referenda will be held at the same time to make necessary amendments to the Constitution.Steps have been taken to reverse the trend towards the concentration of power in the hands of the Commonwealth Government.Income tax indexation has been introduced, halting automatic increases in the tax burden arising from inflation. This measure will also make it even more necessary for governments to explain and justify their expenditure priorities to the Australian people.Historic reforms are being made to the nations federal financial relations which will return power and responsibility to the State and local levels of government.My Government recognises the importance of sustaining the diversity and multi-cultural nature of Australian society.New arrangements have been made for more extensive consultation with migrant communities and imaginative experiments with migrant resource centres are under way.The implementation of Aboriginal land rights legislation is proceeding and my Government will continue to review the effectiveness of government programs for Aboriginals.My Government is pursuing constructive foreign and defence policies.Through its foreign policy my Government seeks to contribute to the establishment of a stable international environment in which all people can live in peace, co-operation and self-respect.It will be clear from the White Paper on Defence tabled in the Parliament last year that my Government will pursue practical measures to secure the nations defence.The program for the new session of the thirtieth Parliament reflects my Governments determination to stabilise the economy and pursue the goal of social reform.Mr President,members of the Senate.Mr Speaker,members of the House of Representatives.With confidence that you will fulfil to the utmost of your abilities the great responsibilities placed upon you, I leave you to carry on your high and important duties.","N/A","SPEECH OF HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
