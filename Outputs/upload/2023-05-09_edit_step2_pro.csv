3,0,0,0,1,1,"Albanese, Anthony MP","R36","Grayndler","ALP","N/A",2807," I move:That an Address of Congratulation be presented to His Majesty The King, as follows:YOUR MAJESTYWe, the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives, express to Your Majesty our warm congratulations at this time of your Coronation.We express our respect and regard for the dedication you have displayed in your commitment to public service and to the people of Australia.On behalf of the parliament and the people of Australia, I send our sincere congratulations to His Majesty King Charles III and to Her Majesty Queen Camilla on their coronations. Along with other Commonwealth realms, Australia welcomes the new King and Queen and the beginning of a new era. The coronation of a new monarch has occurred only four times since Australia became a nation. At Federation on 1 January 1901, Queen Victoria was coming to the end of her long and remarkable reign. Her sons and grandsons followed her through the first tumultuous half of the 20th century; then her great-great-granddaughter, crowned 70 years ago, went on to eclipse her record to become Britains longest-serving monarch. Until her passing last year, Queen Elizabeth II was the only reigning monarch most Australians had ever known, and the only one to visit our shores. Australians personal respect and affection and admiration for her remarkable service will never fade.As King Charles takes up the duties his mother so faithfully fulfilled, he makes the same promise of lifelong service and the same commitment to the institutions of democracy that she vowed to uphold. The new King and Queen clearly intend to serve with energy, integrity and empathy. In his first speech as King, His Majesty paid tribute to the fine example his mother had set and promised to serve with loyalty, respect and love for people, irrespective of their backgrounds or beliefs. He spoke of the way that society had changed over his lifetime, transforming into one of many cultures and many faiths, even as the bedrock values of freedom and responsibility remain constant.The coronation itself is, in a profound sense, a part of this conversation between tradition and change, continuity and renewal. Even as he performs a role that has endured for almost a thousand years, the King makes his pledge in a modern world with a promise to the future. For more than 50 years, His Majesty King Charles has been a passionate champion of the environment, espousing the belief that we must think seven generations ahead to have any chance of leaving a better world behind us. He has a long record of interest in climate change, the urban environment and sustainability. As his reign begins, Australians know that we have a friend who celebrates our successes and stands with us in our times of disaster and distress, and a friend with a deep and abiding interest in issues relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.His Majesty is no stranger to our shores. As a 17-year-old in 1966, he spent six months at Geelong Grammar Schools Timbertop campus in the Victorian High Country. Recounting the story years later, he told an Australia Day crowd in London, If you want to develop character, go to Australia. He has also professed his enduring love for the experience and described how it left him with a huge affection for our country—and I can assure the parliament that, when I have had the privilege of having an audience with King Charles, that affection has shone through. We look forward to welcoming him once again to Australia. This time, as one of 15 countries, it will be as our head of state.When the Kings mother, Elizabeth II, acceded to the throne on 6 February 1952, Australias parliament expressed its faith in her as she took on the great responsibilities of the Crown and wished her a rich and kind reign. The world has changed radically since then, and Australia has grown into a mature and diverse nation, confident about who we are and our place in the world. As a mature nation, we will continue to examine our own constitutional arrangements and determine what they should be. King Charles has made it clear that these are matters that are rightly determined by nations of the Commonwealth and that those decisions are to be respected.It was an honour to attend the coronation and have private audiences with King Charles and the Prince of Wales, Prince William, and meetings with other members of the royal family, including the Princess of Wales. Along with the Governor-General and Mrs Hurley, High Commissioner Stephen Smith and the governors of all of our states, Australias representatives reflected our nations diversity at the request of the palace.Our flagbearer was Sam Kerr OAM, the Matildas captain, forward for Chelsea Football Club—who I note scored another goal overnight—Olympian, Australias leading goalscorer and the worlds best footballer.There were three Victoria Cross recipients: Corporal Mark Donaldson VC, Corporal Daniel Keighran VC and the absolutely legendary and delightful Keith Payne VC. For those whove had the privilege of meeting Keith, they will know exactly what Im saying here. He is a larger-than-life character who honours Australia every time he represents us.Leanne Benjamin AM OBE performed as a principal ballet dancer for the Royal Ballet for 21 years. She is a patron of the Tait Memorial Trust, an annual award given in her name to support young Australian and New Zealand dancers to train in the UK.Nick Cave AO is a singer, songwriter, actor, novelist and screenwriter, and a major contributor to Australian music, culture and heritage.Jasmine Coe is a Wiradjuri British artist and the creator and curator of Coe Gallery, the first and only Aboriginal owned art gallery in the United Kingdom.Adam Hills MBE is a comedian, presenter, writer and disability rights advocate.Dr Daniel Nour is the founder of Street Side Medics, a not-for-profit GP-led mobile medical service for people experiencing homelessness. It has been my privilege to recently be with Dr Nour in Parramatta, seeing firsthand the work that his remarkable charity does. In 2002 Dr Nour was awarded Young Australian of the Year.Yasmin Poole is a public speaker, board director and youth advocate. She is currently a Rhodes scholar at Oxford university and a non-executive board director of OzHarvest and YWCA Australia.Emily Regan is a London based nurse who worked for the UKs National Health Service in the emergency department of a major hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic.Minette Salmon is studying a PhD in genomic medicine and statistics at Oxford under the prestigious Wellcome Trust studentship. She was also the 2019 Charles Perkins scholar.Claire Spencer AM is an arts leader and the inaugural CEO of the Barbican Centre. She is also an advocate for wellbeing and equity and a member of Chief Executive Women.Professor Merryn Voysey is Associate Professor of Statistics in Vaccinology at the Oxford Vaccine Group. She helped to develop the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine.Richard Joyes CV was awarded the Cross of Valour in 2003 for his courageous efforts following the Bali bombing. He helped to rescue the wounded and carried them to safety.Yvonne Kenny AM is one of the most distinguished sopranos of her generation. She debuted at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden in 1975, where she performed as a member of the company until 1994. She is currently the chair of the Australian Music Foundation UK and, as a professor of voice, shes now dedicated to mentoring young singers.They are a remarkable group of Australians. I thank the high commissioner for hosting us at Stoke Lodge in the lead-up to the coronation. These Australians were all proud to represent their nation. They did us proud in their representation. Together we had the privilege of witnessing history. We wish their majesties a prosperous reign, and may this new Carolean age see the triumph of progress and peace.","Coronation of His Majesty King Charles III","MOTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ALBANESE (Grayndler—Prime Minister) ","(12:01):"
4,0,0,0,1,1,"Dutton, Peter Craig MP","00AKI","Dickson","LNP","N/A",2808," Australians were glued to their televisions on Saturday night to watch our new King and Queen crowned. It was a wonderful occasion. It was historical, heartening and happy. As we watched on, we were all proud to see the Prime Minister and the Governor-General there on behalf of our nation. I want to acknowledge you, Prime Minister; His Excellency General the Hon. David Hurley; and the entire Australian delegation. Each of you represented Australia with grace and dignity. It was a great credit to each of you.Most of us have only ever lived under one monarch, such was the extraordinary 70-year reign of Queen Elizabeth II. Thus the crowning of King Charles III, our new sovereign, and Queen Camilla, who was at his side, was a truly momentous occasion. It was a momentous occasion for the British people, for Australians and for all citizens of the Commonwealth. It was a moment when an age-old tradition brought with it both a sense of reconnection to history and regeneration in our times. It was a moment of celebration that resonated around the world.Charles was the longest-serving heir apparent in British history. He was the boy who waited, the prince of patience and a king seven decades in the making. No other royal has journeyed longer to sit on the British throne and no other royal has been so prepared to wear the crown. Succeeding her father on the throne at age 25, Elizabeth was the Queen that we came to know and, succeeding his mother on the throne at age 73, Charles is the King that we already know. We know that he will be a decent, dedicated and well-disposed King.In his biography of Charles, Christopher Andersen recounted Elizabeths coronation day. The newly crowned Queen emerged onto the balcony at Buckingham Palace cheered by a crowd of one million Britons. Next to her of course was her four-year-old son, Charles. In that moment the boy first understood how much his mother was loved by her people. In that moment young Charles first grasped the importance of the bond between the people and their monarch, a bond which held that country together and a bond that kept the Commonwealth united and strong.In his first speech as King on 9 September last year, which the Prime Minister referenced earlier, Charles said that his beloved mother was an inspiration and example to him. In that address Charless renewed promise of lifelong service echoed the promise his mother made on her 21st birthday. The King went on to say:Wherever you may live in the United Kingdom, or in the realms and territories across the world, and whatever may be your background or beliefs, I shall endeavour to serve you with loyalty, respect and love, as I have throughout my life.In his Commonwealth Day address on 13 March, the King described the Commonwealth as a constant in his life, as an association of shared values, common purpose, joint action and extraordinary potential. He said:The myriad connections between our nations have sustained and enriched us for more than seven decades. Our commitment to peace, progress and opportunity will sustain us for many more.Our sovereign has a great affinity, as we know, for Australia. In many ways it was Charless first trip to Australia which transformed the boy into the man. The Queen and Prince Philip arranged for young Charles to attend Geelong Grammar School on an exchange program in 1966, particularly to attend the remote Timbertop campus in the foothills of the Victorian alps. There, students received traditional classroom lessons combined with activities in the bush to develop resilience, self-reliance and strength. If Prince Philip had hoped the experience would test the young Charles mettle and put some steel in him, he was right, for soon the 17-year-old prince was hiking, cross-country running, fishing, chopping wood and supervising younger students. He learned about natural history, and he encountered every Englishmans worst nightmare: huntsman spiders, tiger snakes, dragon lizards, leeches, fruit bats and bull ants. Meanwhile, under the guidance of history head Michael Collins Persse, with whom he would develop a lifelong friendship, Charles worked away at his A-levels, and in his public appearances, like meeting lifesavers at Bondi Beach, the prince would learn to conquer his paralysing fear of crowds. Collins Persse later reflected:Everybody sooner or later discovered that … they had in their midst not only an inevitable celebrity, but a human being of extraordinary warmth and worth …… … …… the resulting affection and understanding between him and Australians at large is a bond much appreciated by many.The Charles who left our country was transformed. He was a very different figure from the shy boy who only six months earlier had skipped down the air stairs of a Qantas Boeing 707 in Sydney to nervously meet Governor-General Casey, Prime Minister Holt and their wives. In 1988, when Charles was in Australia for the bicentenary celebrations, he would reflect on that first trip down under. He described it as by far the best part of his entire education and something he would always cherish. Charles has visited our nation on 16 occasions spanning 10 different prime ministers. Notably, he attended the funerals of prime ministers Holt and Menzies on behalf of the Queen. He celebrated the 200th anniversaries of both James Cooks and the First Fleets arrivals in Australia. He inaugurated the Anglo-Australian Telescope at Siding Spring in New South Wales, and he visited towns and cities across the country. He opened the Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast.Unexpected moments have stayed with us too—the prince being interviewed on Countdown by Molly Meldrum, his emerging from the surf at Cottesloe Beach to be kissed by an audacious Jane Priest, and his cool-headed return to the lectern on Australia Day after being shot at by a student with a starting pistol. Our sovereign appreciates all too well our harsh and unforgiving climate. Never has Charles been remiss in sending wishes to Australians besieged by bushfires, floods and other natural disasters. At an Australian bushfire appeal in London in 2020 he said:Amidst the horror and the sorrow, I have … felt the greatest possible sense of admiration for the extraordinary determination and resilience of the Australian people.Over many years King Charles III has got to know Australians, and Australians have got to know him. We have come to know the philanthropist who has established more than 20 charities and is a patron of hundreds more, the aviator who flew planes for the RAF and helicopters for the Royal Navy, the conservationist who has passionately campaigned for environmental protection and sustainability since his first public speech aged 21 and the enthusiastic spectator and sportsman who has dabbled in many sports and is a very keen and fierce advocate for the arts in all their forms. At the 1988 bicentennial celebrations, Charles said:There is no point now in trying to gloss over the circumstances in which the country, of which you are rightly proud, began.He spoke of our nations harsh beginnings and the hardship for all—for Indigenous Australians, the original people of this land; for the convicts sent against this will to an unknown country, which would have felt like another prison. But Charles also spoke of the Australian achievement, of the intelligence and courage of brave men and women who, in an astonishingly brief time, in a heartbeat of history, created a whole new free country. He spoke proudly of Australia being its own creation, a democracy which has become a model for the world, and of how that creation became the British gift of the rule of law. Profoundly, he said:The true celebration of this nation is in its constitution. In those dry-sounding but hard fought for rules and regulations, every family in this remarkable country has its rights protected and cherished.With our sovereign and his queen crowned, we celebrate change, but we also celebrate our historical connections with Britain and the British inheritance: representative democracy, parliamentary sovereignty, the rule of law, the separation of powers, the English language, and freedom of speech, of association, the press and much more besides. May we never take this British inheritance for granted. May we continue to be custodians and defenders in the spirit of our own unique Australian creation, and may we always be proud of our British origins, along with our Indigenous heritage and our migration and multicultural success—three strands of our national story. King Charles is our head of state. In the crowning of a new king and all that the monarch symbolises, we remind ourselves of those British institutions and values which our forebears drew upon to forge a modern nation.Just like his mother, King Charles does not yearn for a return to empire. He understands that this is a vestige of the past, that the empire has receded into history. Importantly, our sovereign respects the right of the peoples of the Commonwealth to define their own destinies. In a speech on Australia Day in 1994, the Prince said:… there are those who would wish to see such a rapidly changing world reflected by a change in Australias institutions … it is also not surprising that there are differing views: some people will doubtless prefer the stability of a system that has been reasonably well-tried and tested over the years …The point I want to make here … is that this is something which only you—the Australian people—can decide.The Prince went on to say that he will always have an enormous affection for our country, whatever course Australians ultimately decide upon, and in the meantime all his family will continue to take a close, personal interest in the welfare and fortunes of this country. Those words, I think, show the humility, grace, generosity and understanding befitting a modern monarch. Our new Kings virtues and values echo what we saw in our dearly departed Queen. Today, on behalf of the coalition and joining with this House, I congratulate Their Majesties.Question agreed to, honourable members standing in their places.","Coronation of His Majesty King Charles III","MOTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr DUTTON (Dickson—Leader of the Opposition) ","(12:12):"
5,0,0,0,1,1,"Albanese, Anthony MP","R36","Grayndler","ALP","N/A",2810," I move:That the House record its deep regret at the death, on 28 March 2023, of the Honourable John Charles Kerin AO, a former Minister and Member of this House for the Division of Macarthur from 1972 to 1975 and for the Division of Werriwa from 1978 to 1993, place on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.In 1972, when John Kerin was on the cusp of being elected to parliament for the first time, he headed home to Canberra from Labors campaign launch, only for his Volkswagen to break down in the dark. The culprit was a broken accelerator cable. John not only diagnosed the problem; he fixed it with a paper clip and then drove home. That was John Kerin to a T—resourceful, practical, effective and with humour to spare.Born in Bowral, in the New South Wales Southern Highlands, John grew up farming, gaining experience as an orchardist, forestry worker and brick setter—and, of course, as a poultry farmer, one who could not only design a chook shed but hypnotise the inhabitants as well. Then as an economist with the Bureau of Agricultural Economics and eventually as the member for Macarthur and subsequently Werriwa, he knew how to make a difference. While he cut his teeth in the Whitlam government, it was in the Hawke government that he truly bloomed. He held a number of portfolios, including a brief stint as Treasurer. But he made his main mark as one of our longest-serving ministers for primary industries, arguably our greatest so far. He took to his work with experience, pragmatism, courage and an endless willingness to consult, a scientific dedication to facts and an insatiable curiosity. His record is fitting for a minister in the reforming powerhouse that was the Hawke government, his impact captured by the headline in the Australian Financial Review when he moved on: Farmers sorry to see their popular minister go. In 2008 he was made a distinguished life member of the Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society—a fitting recognition.Amid the sweep of his responsibilities, John didnt neglect his inner life. As he recorded in his memoir:I once told John Button that listening to classical music kept me sane. He sagely advised me I should play a lot more music.That was typical of the lens through which he viewed himself—a mixture of clear-eyed perception and self-deprecation, all underpinned by a sense of humour that Bob Hawke described as quirky and described by John himself as the despair of my family and friends.John, of course, remained an active ACT branch member until the end. We will always be proud, so very proud, of all that he did. As he once wrote:Politics is like farming; no-one is forced to do it, but someone has to.John did both, and it is to Australias lasting benefit that he did. We miss him greatly but no-one misses him so much as his family, some members of whom are with us today. I say to them: you are very much in our thoughts and you are in our hearts. May John Kerin rest in peace.","Kerin, Hon. John Charles, AM, AO, FTSE","CONDOLENCES","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ALBANESE (Grayndler—Prime Minister) ","(12:23):"
6,0,0,0,1,1,"Dutton, Peter Craig MP","00AKI","Dickson","LNP","N/A",2811," I join with the Prime Minister in honouring the life of the Hon. John Charles Kerin AO, born in Bowral, New South Wales. He joined the Labor Party as a student, motivated primarily by the controversies of the Vietnam War. From his late teens to his early 30s, he was a forestry worker, brick setter and farmer. Indeed, he worked some 80 to 90 hours a week on the land. It was Johns love of the land that saw him take up a job as an economist at the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics in 1971.Part of Gough Whitlams Its Time campaign, John was first elected as a member of the House of Reps after winning the seat of Macarthur in 1972. His passion for his electorate and the country was clear for all to hear in his maiden speech. He described his electorate as one:… of incredible beauty, where the grass is green, the soil is rich and the cows are contented.The economist John also expressed his concerns about the excessive rate of inflation at the time. He said it was the major economic problem facing Australia and the worst distributor of income.John served as a solid and sage backbencher for Prime Minister Gough Whitlam. Alas, his longer-term ambitions were cut short when he lost his seat in Labors 1975 landslide defeat. But he returned to ABARE. Evidently his time in government had not quenched his political thirst, for, in 1978, after his former prime minister retired as the member for Werriwa he successfully won that seat in a by-election. Joining the opposition led by Bob Hawke, John was catapulted into the position of shadow spokesperson for primary industries in 1980—a role very much befitting his background and experience. After Hawkes election victory in 1983 he took on that ministry, and by 1987 the energy portfolio was added to his responsibilities. He was an unwavering champion for Australian farmers. Under Prime Minister Hawkes leadership, John helped to eliminate many tariffs on agricultural imports. He introduced policies to increase farm productivity, and he championed research and development programs.After Paul Keating unsuccessfully challenged Bob Hawke for the prime ministership in 1991 and resigned as Treasurer, John was appointed to the role. John would later admit he was not so lucky to have been Treasurer. The laser-like gaze of the media was on John immediately. From the get-go, comparisons were being made between him and the long-serving Keating. It was an unenviable position to be in. That pressure culminated in an infamous press conference, where John forgot a particular economic term. It was an honest but fatal mistake which saw him ousted from the role of Treasurer—yet another cruel reminder of the unforgiving nature of being part of the game of politics. John would later lament the change in character of the media in Australia, a media which he said, increasingly concentrated on question time and issues of conflict and personality to the exclusion of dreary policy. After losing the Treasury portfolio, John was appointed as the Minister for Transport and Communications by Bob Hawke. But after Keating challenged Hawke again, this time successfully, the new Prime Minister appointed John as the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development.Following Labors 1993 election victory, John decided to be the master of his fate. He chose to exit politics on his own terms and not repeat the events of 1975. In his valedictory address, John said he would write a book, The formation of agricultural policy in Australia, but joked it would have a readership of about three people. Yet write a memoir he commendably did, entitled The Way I Saw It; The Way It Was. Johns political memoir was also an insightful commentary on agricultural and natural resource policy. His observations remain salient for all of us today, that policy-making requires patience and perseverance, that emotional involvement has to be well managed if long-term policy solutions are to be achieved and that the best decisions were and are the ones where the most thought-through analysis and preparation are involved.John saw the bad side of politics, describing it as, a combination of theory, egomania, megalomania, mediamania and the rules of Gaelic football in a derived environment. But he also treasured its good side. John said:The real buzz for me in politics has been that no two days are quite the same, you can grow and you get enormous opportunities.Post-political life saw John chair many notable national and state based boards and councils responsible for coal, soil, land, grains, forestry, fisheries and water management. His cumulative lifes work saw him rightly appointed as an Officer of the Order of Australia. On behalf of the coalition, I offer my heartfelt condolences to Johns colleagues, to his community and friends and, most importantly today, to his family, represented in the gallery and more widely. May he rest in peace.","Kerin, Hon.

Picture a kitchen table in a council house in the suburb of Berkeley just below the splendour of the Illawarra escarpment. Hard at work at that table is Stewart West, a former branch president of the Waterside Workers Union turned member for Cunningham and shadow environment minister. Maybe hes working in silence, as he often preferred. Maybe the radio is tuned in to a horse race. Spread before him is the environmental policy that Labor will take to its national conference. At its heart is saving Tasmanias Franklin River. Forty years later, as a direct result of that policy taken by Stewart West, the Franklin still flows wild and free. What a profound mark to make as a shadow minister.When the 1983 election lifted him out of the shadow and into power, Stewart West went on to serve with distinction as a cabinet minister in the Hawke government, holding the immigration, housing and administrative affairs portfolios. It was by any measure an extraordinary time in an extraordinary government, and Stewart was an important part of it. His passion for the environment, spanning the continent from Tasmania to Kakadu, was as powerful as his commitment to serve the people of Cunningham. In his beloved Wollongong he was central in saving the steel industry and in expanding the university. He was instrumental in reforming Australias immigration policy and remained vocal about the plight of refugees long after his political career came to a close.He was willing to put his money where his mouth was. Stewart was a politician of unbending principle, one who cherished the privilege of being in cabinet but nonetheless prioritised principle over career. It was a choice that he had to make along the way, resigning from cabinet over a matter of principle. No-one joins the Labor Party for a smooth ride or a quiet life. Its not our nature. People are passionate about doing whats best for our country, but, while we generally agree on the destination, there are sometimes powerful differences of opinion on how to get there. So it was when Stewart quit cabinet over uranium policy. As our great mutual friend Tom Uren would later record, Ive never seen anyone so broken-hearted for so long as Stewart over that decision. But such was the calibre of the man that the Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, soon brought him back into the fold and restored his position in the cabinet.Over many years, I was proud to sit beside Stewart West at ALP national conferences. I was proud to stand alongside him to improve the lives of working Australians, and I am grateful for the advice that he gave me as a young man and for the lessons that he taught me. Im honoured to speak now of his achievements. Stewart died just two days short of his 89th birthday, but his legacy and all that he was remain with us. Our hearts go out to his loving wife, Mary, and to all of his family, to all who loved his company and his laughter, and to all who held a special place in his heart, particularly the great people of the great city of Wollongong. May Stewart West rest in peace.","West, Hon.

13,0,0,0,1,1,"Dutton, Peter Craig MP","00AKI","Dickson","LNP","N/A",2812," I join the Prime Minister in honouring the life of the Hon. Stewart John West. Stewart was a Labor man through and through. He lived and breathed Labor ideals. Prior to entering parliament, he was a lifelong trade unionist. He was the president of the Port Kembla branch of the Waterside Workers Federation, he served as the secretary of the ALPs Cunningham federal electorate council and he was the successful campaign manager for the formidable Rex Connor for five elections.As the recipient of Rexs mentorship, Stewart was, of course, his inevitable successor. After Rexs sudden passing in 1977, Stewart was swept into office with 56 per cent of the vote at the Cunningham by-election. In his maiden speech, Stewart spoke proudly about the electorate he knew so well—an electorate which was now his to represent. He described it as the greatest industrial and steel-producing centre in this nation and he spoke passionately about the concerning issue of unemployment, describing it as a cancer bedevilling Cunningham. Indeed, unemployment there was more than three per cent above the national average. Under Bill Haydens opposition, Stewart was appointed the shadow spokesperson for Aboriginal affairs, then for environment and conservation, and then for finance and trade. In the spirit of social movements, he lent his support to those who campaigned to prevent the building of Tasmanias Franklin River dam and to protect Kakadu.Stewarts environmental concerns, coupled with the shadow of cold war, saw him become an energetic exponent of nuclear non-proliferation. At an ALP national conference in mid-1982, the party was split on the stance a future Labor government should adopt on uranium mining. The famous Hogg amendment sought to change the party position from an immediate ban on uranium mining to one supporting its phasing out over time. Stewart spoke fiercely against the motion, which narrowly passed. He emerged from the conference despondent and near to tears, as one reporter wrote. Indeed, it was Stewarts convictions on this issue which saw him later resign from a cabinet position in 1983 after Bob Hawkes Labor government decided to sell uranium to France. Whether one agrees with Stewarts position or not, no-one can deny that he was a man of great courage and that he put his convictions ahead of his own career.No doubt there was something Bob Hawke admired in Stewarts character and integrity—not just that but his upbringing, the way that hed been styled, the way that he contributed to debates. From 1984 the Prime Minister reappointed Stewie, as he called him, to the cabinet. Under Hawkes leadership, Stewart served as the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and then the Minister for Housing and Construction, and finally the Minister for Administrative Services. As immigration minister he championed family reunion and the resettlement of refugees while being an advocate for antidiscrimination.As the leader of the Left faction of the Labor Party, Stewart found it difficult to manoeuvre in Bob Hawkes cabinet, dominated by the Right faction. Stewart John West was certainly that calibre of politician who never saw popularity or promotion as worthy of selling out ones principles. In many ways, its the politicians of principle which history tends to remember. On behalf of the coalition, I offer my heartfelt condolences to Stewarts colleagues, to his community and his friends, and to his family. May he rest in peace.","West, Hon.

Without their enormous professionalism, diligence, experience and unfailing goodwill and good humour, this inquiry would not have been achievable.The report itself was comprehensive, and it will set a framework for the governments ability to now deal with long COVID, which is a serious issue not just for our health system but economically, in terms of its effect on our productivity. There has been much media regarding this report since it was first published. Im very pleased to thank the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Mark Butler, who was the initiator of the inquiry, for the $50 million package for research regarding long COVID, which will be very important in planning how we deal with the many twists and turns of this pandemic in the future—in terms of long COVID in particular.I am happy with all the work done by the committee members and the secretariat. We have achieved much already in terms of knowledge and understanding of long COVID, but there is much to be done. We dont know what we dont know, and much will be discovered, Im sure, over the ensuing years. What I do know is that long COVID is having an effect on our population. It is in particular affecting women more than men. It is affecting people in the most productive years of their lives—often those who have employment, have families and have commitments in our society in general.I commend the report to the House. Id like to give whatever further time I have to the deputy chair and others who may want to speak on the report.","Health, Aged Care and Sport Committee","COMMITTEES","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[3]","N/A","N/A"
28,0,0,0,1,1,"McIntosh, Melissa MP",281513,"Lindsay","LP","N/A",2815," by leave—Id like to acknowledge the chair, Dr Mike Freelander, the member for Macarthur, for his outstanding leadership of this inquiry—the first inquiry of its kind in this country into long COVID. When we started this inquiry I had been having my own experience with persistent symptoms after contracting COVID in April 2022. I wasnt able to find in the public sphere adequate information about what I was experiencing—and I wasnt alone in this. I believe the health committee inquiry could be useful, at least in terms of filling an information gap. There had yet to be an official inquiry, as I said. What we didnt know at the start of the inquiry was that its not so much an information gap as a data, diagnosis and treatment gulf. We dont yet have a definition of what long COVID is in Australia, let alone have consistency in how people are diagnosed and then looked after.The committee recommends that the World Health Organization definition of long COVID be used at this time. But the definition has its failings, including not being quite clear enough for clinical purposes. Despite this, without an official definition people just cant get the care they need, whether it be through their GP, who may not have received adequate education on long COVID, or via a long-COVID clinic, which we heard have some extraordinary waiting times, leaving people without proper treatment for up to a year.Ive also come to realise that the relatively short symptoms of breathlessness and fatigue that I had were very mild compared to how much some people around the country are suffering with long COVID. Theyre so sick they can barely get out of bed many months after the onset of their symptoms. Long COVID is having a major impact on lives and livelihoods. The committee received almost 570 submissions during the inquiry, and it is clear the committee has uncovered a very significant condition that could affect between two and 20 per cent of people infected with COVID. The lack of a precise number reflects the whole problem we have with understanding long COVID in this country: we just dont have the data. The No. 1 recommendation of the inquiry is the establishment of a COVID-19 database, including the recording of long-COVID diagnoses and complications. Data linkages with the states and territories are essential for its effectiveness as, ultimately, it needs to be about consistency in diagnosis and treatment of people with long COVID, no matter where they live in Australia.Not too long after we started the inquiry, my very athletic and healthy 19-year-old son Byron was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. It is well known that certain viruses can trigger type 1, which is an autoimmune disease, and the only known virus that Byron had before diagnosis was COVID. When Byron was diagnosed in October 2022 there was very little data on whether it was plausible that COVID caused it, but reports were starting to surface that there had been a surge in type 1 diabetes globally amongst children and adolescents. Six months later, research is showing a correlation between COVID and type 1 diabetes, and the committee was provided evidence of this during the inquiry. The Victorian Department of Health noted that long COVID may be associated with more serious issues, such as increased risk of developing diabetes. Diabetes Australia told the committee that research funding should be made available to further investigate COVID related new-onset diabetes.The increased prevalence of disease is not just reflected in all cases of type 1. The evidence heard by the committee about what COVID can do to your body makes for less than light bedtime reading. The Australian Society for Medical Research advised that future research needs to include how a COVID infection can initiate the development of conditions that evolve over time to cause organ dysfunction or increase the risk of developing other disorders. The committee made a recommendation to the Australian government that funding is required for coordinated and thorough research into long COVID. As deputy chair of the committee, I would highly encourage that this include research into the serious diseases that are developing in people that have contracted COVID. Its a public-health imperative.Before I finish, I just want to touch on COVID and mental health. This is another area that is suffering from a lack of evidence for whether the mental health impacts of long COVID are a biological or a psychological response to having long COVID—or possibly both. It is clear from the inquiry that, for many people, long COVID is having a significant mental health impact, which can be debilitating and life-changing. As the shadow assistant minister for mental health and suicide prevention, it concerns me greatly to hear from individuals about their declining mental health, including feelings of uselessness, anxiety and depression. The committee has recommended that mental health support for those with long COVID must be provided in an affordable, timely and equitable manner. I would like to see the government prioritise this recommendation. Were experiencing a mental health crisis in this country, and the seriousness of this should not be underestimated.This first-of-its-kind inquiry into long COVID has given thousands of people across Australia hope that politicians as policymakers are listening. It is clear there are unacceptable gaps in data and research and inconsistencies in diagnosis and treatment, particularly when it comes to where people live and their socio-economic status. The inquiry has provided the evidence that it doesnt have to be this way. There are ready-to-go solutions in the committees recommendations, and Id like to commend the chair again for his wonderful leadership and work. Those recommendations just needed to be actioned. As deputy chair of the health committee, I endorse them and hope that we see some strong commitments in the governments budget.","Health, Aged Care and Sport Committee","COMMITTEES","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs McINTOSH (Lindsay) ","(12:49):"

The first proposal, from the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts, is for a seawater reverse osmosis plant for the Cocos (Keeling) Islandss West Island, which we visited. The second proposal, from the Australian Taxation Office, is for a fit-out of existing leased premises at 200 Collins Street, Hobart, Tasmania. The third proposal, from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, is for the proposed construction and decommissioning of the Australian Pavilion at the World Expo 2025 in Osaka, Kansai, Japan.The department of infrastructures reverse osmosis plant will bring water security to the important community of West Island. The only current water supply for the community is considered extremely vulnerable to contamination, a threat that is compounded by the risk of further contamination during the upcoming airfield upgrades. The total cost of the proposed project is $19.6 million. The committee considers that this project is of the utmost importance to ensure that the community of West Island has permanent access to safe drinking water. The committee is aware that the islands community is looking forward to a secure and reliable water source. This plant will also support future economic and tourism development on Cocos (Keeling) Islands.The second proposal in this report is the ATOs fit-out of existing leased premises at 200 Collins Street, Hobart. The total cost of the proposed project is just under $24½ million. At our public hearing, the committee heard about staff concerns that there had been a lack of consultation in relation to the project. The CPSU believed that there had been missed opportunities in the design process for workers to participate and share their views. The committee was somewhat reassured by the ATO, who discussed that design changes have been made based on feedback and that there would be more opportunities for feedback on the final design. The committee still has concerns and has recommended that the ATO should be conducting broader staff consultation during the design phase of future fit-outs, which should be reflected in any future submissions to the committee.The third project in this report is the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trades proposed construction and decommissioning of the Australian Pavilion for the World Expo in Osaka. The total cost of the public works is $59.8 million. Australias participation in the 2025 World Expo came at the request of the Japanese government and will offer an important opportunity for Australia to further strengthen its relationship with a key strategic and economic partner. Although the expo pavilion will be built and then removed after six months, the committee is satisfied that DFAT is considering environmental impact and options for waste reduction. The committee supports this project.The committee would like to extend its thanks to all those who provided written and oral evidence in support of these inquiries. Wed also like to thank personnel from the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts, the ATO and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for their presentations on these projects and for facilitating site inspections in Hobart and on Cocos (Keeling) Islands.For each project, the committee recommends that its expedient that the proposed works be carried out.

35,0,0,0,1,1,"Pitt, Keith MP",148150,"Hinkler","LNP","N/A",2817," by leave—I will make a very brief contribution. I acknowledge the work of the chairman of the committee on these very important matters—particularly on Cocos (Keeling) Islands, which we know are critical in terms of Australias forward-facing infrastructure, particularly for Defence and others. I also acknowledge the forbearance of those that live on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. They will have a competitive edge and competitive costs when it comes to the matter of the seawater reverse osmosis plant project, which is relatively unique: saltwater bores enter reverse osmosis to provide fresh water for the residents that live there, along with a number of others who live on the defence base, and for the airport et cetera.Unfortunately, I couldnt make it to the tax office facility in Tasmania, so Ill leave that alone. But I will come to recommendation 4, in regard to the proposed work by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade at the World Expo 2025 Osaka facility. We did have long discussions—as acknowledged by the chair and others—and I thank DFAT and others for putting forward their propositions. Whilst it is supported, I do still have concerns about the cost of the proposal, at $60 million, but it is up to the government to demonstrate value for money. Japan is a critical partner in trade, along with a number of other matters on which we deal with them on an international level.I also had some concerns about DFATs priorities, in terms of what was being put forward on the forward-facing part of the facility and the pavilion, given that our major exports to Japan are coal and gas, and our major reasons for trading with them are around coal and gas exports and of course the opportunities for tourism and education on a two-way-trade basis. It didnt seem that that lined up with DFATs priorities for the expo. I do look forward to seeing them have a successful expo, and I congratulate them on the work they do, but I am concerned about the cost, given what has been expended on previous expos around the world, and as to whether its value for money.I thank the committee. I thank all of those who showed up as witnesses. And I thank you for your forbearance, Mr Deputy Speaker.","Public Works Joint Committee","COMMITTEES","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr PITT (Hinkler) ","(13:00):"
36,0,0,0,1,1,"Littleproud, David MP",265585,"Maranoa","LNP","N/A",2818," I rise today to speak on the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2023. The federal coalition wholeheartedly supports this bill because what this legislation delivers is the policy that we, on this side of the House, announced while we were in government and enshrines it in law. The federal coalition has always supported northern Australia, and we are extremely proud of our achievements and the legacy that we secured for this part of the nation during our time in office. It was the federal coalition who first set up the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, the NAIF, in 2016, which was a landmark investment platform designed to drive economic infrastructure across the north. It was the federal coalition who developed the northern Australia white paper to outline the challenges and opportunities that exist in an area which covers more than half of our land mass, and it is the federal coalition that continues to fight for those regional communities to ensure that those who grow our food, mine our resources and build our nation get the recognition they rightfully deserve.Under our government, the NAIF made over 31 investment decisions, totalling $3.4 billion, supporting projects with an estimated total capital value of $6.5 billion across northern Australia. These projects range from airports and higher education facilities to clean energy infrastructure, resources and agricultural ventures. The projects that the NAIF supported are forecast to generate around $25 billion in economic benefits and create more than 13,000 jobs. Importantly, the coalition extended the NAIFs lifetime by an additional five years, to 30 June 2026, so that it could continue delivering critical investments to the northern regions.Under the legislation before the House today, there are two substantive amendments within the bill and one technical clarification. The first substantive amendment expands the NAIFs area of operation. In December 2021, the federal coalition announced that the Indian Ocean territories of Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands would be included in the NAIFs jurisdiction and able to receive support. This extension will allow the NAIF to continue delivering vital investments in more parts of northern Australia. The Indian Ocean territories have so much potential to capitalise on, including sustainable tourism, with their incredible biodiversity and unique landscapes. The inclusion of the Indian Ocean territories in the NAIF will help incentivise private sector investment in these regions and support businesses in the Indian Ocean territories to diversify and grow. This expansion opens up a variety of opportunities for the region, especially in the tourism sector, and enables local businesses to tap into their natural competitive advantage and provide jobs for the future.The second substantive amendment in the bill is to increase the NAIFs funding from $5 billion to $7 billion. This is an important measure that we fully support. In fact, it was the federal coalition that further committed to strengthening the development of northern Australia by announcing, back in January last year, a $2 billion funding increase for the NAIF from $5 billion to $7 billion. This increase will support additional projects throughout northern Australia, and its good to see the government honour this commitment. Ultimately, the governments backing of these two coalition announcements is a true affirmation and recognition of the great policy that we developed for northern Australia.It should be noted that, following the statutory review of the NAIF in December 2020, the federal coalition moved amendments to the act in 2021. As part of the extended scope, amendments were made to allow the NAIF to provide financial assistance to entities other than states and territories and to provide loans in addition to grants. This expanded availability for support includes regional Indigenous Australians and provides an avenue for economic growth and investment in local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in this part of the nation. Overall, the bill before us today is simply a technical clarification and its a continuation of the federal coalitions policy to build the north.While its welcome to see Labor continue to fund the NAIF, its a huge concern to see the government slash other regional funding that is critical to northern Australia and our regional communities all over the country. This governments cuts and delays to infrastructure in regional Australia amount to billions of dollars, and northern Australia will feel the impacts of this. Giving with one hand and taking away with the other is not a formula for success.In the north it was the coalition government who delivered $1.9 billion for the Roads of Strategic Importance initiative, committed an extra $678 million for the Outback Way and secured $300 million under the Northern Australia Beef Roads Program. The coalition government fought hard to deliver tremendous amounts of federal funding to build critical infrastructure in the north. Rest assured that the coalition will continue to fight for northern Australia. Im pleased to confirm that we will support this bill, which puts the coalition policy into law.Debate adjourned.","Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr LITTLEPROUD (Maranoa—Leader of the Nationals) ","(13:02):"
37,0,0,0,1,1,"Chester, Darren MP","IPZ","Gippsland","NATS","N/A",2819," On behalf of the coalition I rise to speak on the Infrastructure Australia Amendment (Independent Review) Bill 2023, which is before the House. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Infrastructure Australia Act 2008 to give partial effect to the governments response to the Independent Review of Infrastructure Australia, which was released on 7 December last year. Reviewing Infrastructure Australia was a pre-election commitment of the government, and the independent review of this body was announced on 22 July 2022. It was undertaken by two respected Australians: Nicole Lockwood, Chairperson of Infrastructure Western Australia, and my good friend Mike Mrdak AO, a former secretary of the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development and a former secretary of the Department of Communications and the Arts.Infrastructure Australia is a corporate Commonwealth entity that was established by the Rudd government in 2008. Its also worth noting that this body is in fact a creation of our current Prime Minister when he served as the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government in that era. Its quite telling that this government has assessed the performance of Infrastructure Australia over its nearly 15-year life and found the organisation wanting. This bill represents, at the very least, a partial repudiation of the organisations functions and governance structures as they were fundamentally established by the now Prime Minister himself.The bill provides a new object of the act—for Infrastructure Australia to be the governments independent adviser on nationally significant infrastructure investment planning and project prioritisation. This gives partial effect to recommendation 1 of the independent review. The coalition notes the independent reviews first recommendation to the government includes the advice that Infrastructure Australia s mandate should be expanded beyond advising on nationally significant transport, energy, communication and water infrastructure to also be the governments independent adviser on nationally significant social and economic infrastructure. Recommendation 6 of the independent review also suggested Infrastructure Australias remit be expanded to include social infrastructure. These recommendations have been rejected by the government and are therefore not featured in this bill.The bill also repeals almost all of the current functions of Infrastructure Australia as provided in paragraphs 5(a) to (gb) and sections 5A to 5C of the current act. In place of Infrastructure Australias current functions the bill proposes a series of new functions and products to conduct audits or assessments of nationally significant infrastructure to determine adequacy and needs, to conduct or endorse evaluation of infrastructure projects, to develop targeted infrastructure lists and plans and to provide advice on nationally significant infrastructure matters.The bill also amends the Infrastructure Australia Act 2008 to replace the current 12-member Infrastructure Australia board with three commissioners appointed by the minister, comprising a chief commissioner and two commissioners. Additionally, transitional arrangements are included in the bill, to recognise the existing work of Infrastructure Australia. What we have here in this bill is the government admitting that the legislative structure put in place originally by the now Prime Minister needs to be fixed, and as a result they have decided to give Infrastructure Australia a new object, new functions and a completely new governance structure.While this bill is framed as giving effect to the recommendations of the independent review, its important to place on the public record that a critical assessment of the response to the review shows the government has not in fact accepted some of its key recommendations. The review received 59 submissions and held 40 meetings with approximately 140 participants across government and industry. In October 2022 the independent review provided its report to the government, outlining 16 recommendations and a further matter for government consideration. As mentioned, the governments response to the independent review did not support a number of the reports recommendations. In fact, eight of the 16 were not supported.The government did not support key recommendations to provide enhanced transparency. An example of this was the proposal that Infrastructure Australia provide two new annual statements to the government, which would be publicly tabled to inform budget processes and to report on the performance outcomes being achieved by the infrastructure investment program. Also, a proposal that the Australian government must formally and publicly respond to Infrastructure Australias advice, findings and recommendations within six months was not supported by this government. Despite what the government says, the Australian people can clearly see this administration has an aversion to being transparent.The government also did not support the recommendation to form an infrastructure bodies council to enable better collaboration and coordination between Infrastructure Australia and the states and territories. Several other recommendations of the independent review will be implemented via non-legislative processes, including by a ministerial statement of expectations and an infrastructure policy statement on land transport. The independent review proposed three alternative models for the future governance of Infrastructure Australia: option 1 was to maintain the status quo; option 2 was to establish a commission model, which was their preferred model; and option 3 was for a streamlined board model.The proposal in this bill represents an altered version of option 2. By proposing to replace the 12-member Infrastructure Australia board with three commissioners, the government is reducing the diversity of expertise at the head of this body and reducing its independence from government. The views of the minister will hold significant influence with the three commissioners, who are themselves appointed by the minister. This compares with the current governance model, whereby nine Infrastructure Australia board members are appointed by the government and three are appointed from nominations agreed by the governments of the states, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory.When added to the redefined functions of Infrastructure Australia in this bill, which require the commissioners to have regard for the governments policies and require them to evaluate infrastructure proposals submitted by the government, its clear Infrastructure Australia will enjoy less independence in the future. In addition, the government has confirmed via briefings that an advisory council will be established by Infrastructure Australia to provide advice to the commissioners. Unfortunately, the advisory council is not referenced in the bill, and therefore the parliament is not being invited to set guidelines about the composition or role of that proposed advisory council.The coalition reserves the right to have more to say on this during the debate in the other place. However, briefings have confirmed the governments intention, as outlined in their response to the review, that senior officials from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts will sit on the advisory council, supported by three to four experts from the infrastructure and labour sectors. This is the heavy hand of the Commonwealth government stepping in to influence the decisions and the direction of Infrastructure Australia. There is a concern here that, in making these changes of the governments to Infrastructure Australia, industry expertise may be lost, as well as expertise and experience in delivering infrastructure in regional Australia in particular. The government has made no provision in the bill for commissioners to be appointed who have expertise and experience in the issues impacting regional Australia. The coalition will therefore propose amendments during consideration in detail to address this concern, and I encourage the government and all members of this place to give close consideration to supporting these.In addition to making Infrastructure Australia less independent, the governments reforms will make Infrastructure Australia a less authoritative body when it comes to the evaluation of infrastructure projects. Firstly, the minister has made it clear the government wants to shrink the number of projects on the infrastructure priority list; this is mentioned in the explanatory memorandum. Interestingly, while the relevant clause in the bill, being 5C(1), refers to the development of a targeted infrastructure priority list, nowhere in the bill does it require the list to be any smaller—or larger, for that matter—than currently exists. Indeed, the briefing provided to the coalition by the government on this bill has confirmed there is nothing in the bill which will prevent a future government from working with Infrastructure Australia to expand the infrastructure priority list if the government chooses to reduce its investments in infrastructure projects. However, by proposing to streamline Infrastructure Australias focus on a smaller number of nationally significant projects, the government is reducing its utility.Further, and perhaps more significantly, the government is proposing Infrastructure Australia merely endorse project assessments submitted by the state and territory governments. This is a government walking away from providing independent oversight and assessment of the priorities of the state governments. While there is reference to the agency developing a national planning and assessment framework to promote national consistency in infrastructure evaluations, as a Commonwealth body Infrastructure Australia lacks the power to enforce assessment standards on state and territory departments and agencies. The Commonwealth government makes a substantial investment into public infrastructure which is delivered and ultimately owned by the states and territories. Often the Commonwealth is investing 50 per cent—or, in regional areas, 80 per cent—of the funding to deliver major road projects. Australian taxpayers expect the Commonwealth parliament to exercise suitable oversight so that infrastructure projects deliver material benefit and that maximum value for investment is secured. This should be an important role for Infrastructure Australia. But will the organisations ability to provide advice on this be diminished by the requirement in this bill, so that they endorse the state assessments instead of running an independent ruler over project submissions themselves?The coalition recognises that, since the election, there have been questions over the future mandate and operations of Infrastructure Australia. As a result of this governments approach to the body and its leadership, in September 2022 there were five resignations from the board. This has resulted in several months where the board has lacked a quorum of members. The government has subsequently appointed interim board members until such time as its proposed reforms can be enacted.The coalition firmly believes Infrastructure Australia is an important body, and its important that parliament provides the organisation with a clear mandate for its future activities. In this regard, the federal coalition does not seek to frustrate passage of the governments legislation—albeit there are concerns that this bill will result in Infrastructure Australia being less independent and less authoritative. The coalition proposes to support the legislation with amendments which will be designed to ensure that the commissioners have experience on the issues of regional communities and provide transparency where, contrary to its pre-election commitments, the government makes nationally significant infrastructure and investment decisions without obtaining advice from this body.I conclude my remarks by moving a second reading amendment to this bill:That all words after That be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House:(1) notes this Governments record of cancellations, cuts and delays to infrastructure projects across Australia;(2) criticises the Governments failure to adhere to processes of assessing infrastructure investment projects they set themselves before the 2022 election by agreeing to invest $2.2 billion in the Melbourne Suburban Rail Loop and $2.5 billion in the Brisbane Arena without first obtaining advice from Infrastructure Australia; and(3) notes the nation-building and economy strengthening $120 billion 10-year pipeline of infrastructure investments inherited by the Government upon its election in May 2022.","Infrastructure Australia Amendment (Independent Review) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr CHESTER (Gippsland) ","(13:07):"

42,0,0,0,1,1,"Wood, Jason MP","E0F","La Trobe","LP","N/A",2821," I rise to speak on the Family Law Amendment Bill 2023. There are few things in the Commonwealth Attorney-Generals portfolio that have more direct impact on Australians than family law. Every year, tens of thousands of Australians will find themselves going through the pain and sadness of separation, and, in a small proportion of these cases, disputes will be decided by a judge in Australias family law courts. As a nation, we should aim for a system that resolves those disputes as quickly and cleanly as possible and, where children are involved, we should at all times prioritise their best interests.Many parts of this bill are moved by good intentions, and we join with the government in recognising that many of the issues in this bill seek to address problems in need of a solution. And yet in too many places the proposals put forward by the government in this bill do not align with those problems. They go beyond recommendations made by previous reviews, are not supported by professionals, have unintended consequences or have not been road tested in communities on the ground. The coalitions very deep concern is that, although we join with the government in recognising the problems, the solutions in this bill are untested and may actually make things worse for Australian families. That is something that we, as legislators, should be very cautious about, particularly when were dealing with a system that is meant to guide them through some of the most important and difficult parts of their lives.Schedule 1 of this bill deals with the parenting framework in the Family Law Act. The most significant part of this schedule would repeal the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility that applies when courts make parenting orders. The changes which introduced that presumption were one of the achievements of the Howard era. Prior to 2003 there were widespread concerns across the Australian community about contact and residency issues for children following marriage and relationship breakdowns. There was a widespread sense that many separated parents felt excluded from their childrens lives following separation. Often, this turned the debate away from the benefits for children of a positive and caring relationship with both parents to all the arguments about why equal time will or will not work. This was against the backdrop of the inquiry commissioned by former prime minister Howard into the family law system, chaired by Kay Hull AO, which resulted in the landmark Every picture tells a story report. That report was remarkable in that its recommendations were unanimous and bipartisan. A rollcall of past Labor luminaries—Julia Irwin, the Hon. Graham Edwards, Jennie George AO, Hon. Roger Price and Harry Quick—joined with the coalition in recommending a rebuttable presumption of equal shared parental responsibility.Those recommendations were given effect by the Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Act 2006. Among other things, those reforms said that courts must apply the presumption that its in the best interests of a child for there to be equal shared parental responsibility. Importantly, the presumption does not apply in circumstances where there is abuse or family violence. And it is not a presumption that parenting orders should allocate time to parents on a 50 per cent basis. Rather, its about the shared responsibility that parents have in decision-making for their children after separation.The 2006 reforms established important guardrails for courts making parental orders, but many of those guardrails would now be removed by Labors reforms in a way that goes beyond what the evidence supports. We recognise that the law needs to keep pace with changes in society and that, where there is room for improvement, we should improve it. That is why the former coalition government initiated an ALRC inquiry into the family law system, the report of which was handed down in March 2019. The report said:The ALRC supports the idea that a presumption of shared parental responsibility serves as a good starting point for negotiations between parents and recommends that the concept be retained.The ALRC agreed in principle with the existing exceptions to that presumption; however, it noted that, in practice, equal shared parental responsibility had often been conflated with equal time with the children, and it recommended the provision be co-located with the provision creating the presumption. Labors amendments go much further than has been recommended. Labor proposes repealing the presumption entirely.Many across the legal profession have raised concerns. It is worth noting that the Attorney-Generals consultation on the exposure draft of this bill did not ask whether the presumption should be retained. It missed the fundamental question. Instead, it asked whether its changes would make it easier to explain the law and whether, with the removal of the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility, certain other provisions should be retained. It treated the removal of the presumption as a given. Yet, despite this skewed and one-sided approach, despite this never being asked, parts of the profession have been ringing alarm bells.The Family Law Practitioners Association of Western Australian supported a change in labelling for the reasons identified by the ALRC. The Hunter Valley Family Law Practitioners Association submitted that legislation should contain a presumption of the kind recommended by the ALRC. The Family Law Practitioners Association of Queensland said that the legislation removed a presently known pathway and questioned whether more cases would be initiated on the question of parental responsibility alone. The Law Council of Australia acknowledged the divergence of views among the profession. Among its constituent body, some said the removal of the presumption would make it more difficult to explain the law, could increase litigation and costs incurred by parties, would discourage parents from attempting to consult with each other on decisions relating to the welfare of the child, and put Australia out of step with international peers. Such a significant divergence of views should give any sensible legislator pause for thought.There is much more to be said about schedule 1 and particularly about how courts determine what is in the best interests of the child, but, in the interests of time, I will turn to other schedules. Schedule 2 is about the enforcement of child-related orders. The underlying purpose is to simplify a complex scheme. We agree it should be simplified. We think changes to the scheme should reduce costs and enhance compliance. But it remains to be seen whether schedule 2 will do this. The ACT Bar Association said:While it is agreed that the current provisions in Division 13A are a complex mess and should be simplified, the ACT BA does not consider that the proposed changes would make the division easier to understand. They are, instead, a different complex mess … ACT BA submits that the provisions should be reconsidered and consultation with the profession should occur before that reconsideration.Again, this feedback should give legislators pause for thought.Schedule 3 of the bill extends the definition of a relative for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children to include anyone whos considered a relative in that childs culture. We support this in principle, but the practical implications have not been fully considered. For example, it means that family violence includes violence amongst anyone who falls within the extended definition. It may be that the obligation to notify the court about family violence now applies to a much wider group. It is possible that people who are not involved in the court case at all could have their medical and police records subpoenaed. It may be that none of these are bad outcomes, but we just dont know how it would play out for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and communities. How will this provision affect parenting orders in Palm Island and Alice Springs? Is there any interplay with the child protection system? These issues need to be tested with communities on the grounds.Schedule 4 of the bill deals with independent childrens lawyers and would establish a requirement to meet with children over the age of five, unless there are exceptional circumstances. However, as with other parts of this bill, it must be road tested. How will it affect the work of independent childrens lawyers in remote and rural areas? How does a child communicate that they do not want to meet—","Family Law Amendment Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr WOOD (La Trobe) ","(13:20):"

The impact of these cuts will affect small, rural and remote pharmacies, significantly resulting in the reduction of services and opening hours and, in some cases, in closures. The Albanese government must provide a strong guarantee that this change will not harm the viability of community pharmacies and, therefore, will not be another broken promise. Community pharmacies play an integral role in the provision of primary health care in Australia, particularly in rural and regional Australia, and we do not want to see any community pharmacies close as a result of these government actions.

This petition has been considered by the Petitions Committee and found to be an order. It calls attention to the fact that the Australian Bureau of Statistics does not currently collect data on LGBTQIA+ people. I thank the petitioner, Evalyn Venture, who is in the gallery today, for all her work on gathering 4,946 signatures and bringing light to this issue.The data collection omission by the ABS means that governments and support services are unable to understand the health and wellbeing needs of queer people. Therefore, they cannot sufficiently plan for both the development of policy and allocation of resources for LGBTQIA+ communities. In the 2021 census, the ABS failed to adequately collect data on transgender, non-binary and gender diverse people, conflating gender identity and sex. While it counted same-sex marriages and some LGBTQIA+ people who live with their partner, it failed to identify queer people who were not living with or married to their partner at the time. These omissions amount to our communitys erasure by the government and the ABS, and it must change. They have the opportunity to change this policy in the lead-up to the 2026 census. They must take it; it is time to count us in.The petition read as follows—In 2021, despite a campaign with the support of over 100 peak bodies, health experts, and community organisations; data collection about LGBTIQA+ Australians were dropped due to the conservative position of the Chief Statistician within the Australian Bureau of Statistics. This essentially means that neither the federal or state governments within Australia have any definitive data about lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and gender diverse, intersex, queer and other sexuality and bodily diverse Australians within their communities; or the intersectionality of this data with other factors such as health, income, culture, location, etc. The lack of current population-level data limits understanding of health and wellbeing needs of LGBTIQA+ people, and both the development of policy and allocation of resources for LGBTIQA+ communitiesWe therefore ask the House to makes changes to the Census and Statistics Act 1905 to legally mandate the inclusion of LGBTIQA+ data within the census. The Chief Statisticians current authority to include this data per the Act as he or she considers appropriate subjects marginalised people such as LGBTIQA+ Australians to the personal bias of a singular individual. No one person has the right to say that a group of people are invalid and do not deserve to be counted, and this authority needs to be stripped away and replaced with statutory directives mandating the collection of this data.from 4,946 citizens (Petition No. EN4848)Petition received.","Petition: Gender and Sexual Orientation","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1[5]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BATES (Brisbane) ","(13:36):"

Even Channel 7 ran a story last night with the headline COVID nightmare: the crippling side-effects. If I were a doctor, in light of current litigation overseas, Id be checking right now whether the governments 2021 assurance that doctors would not be liable was a hollow gesture because, unlike the vaccine manufacturers who are indemnified by our government, the letter to Elizabeth Hart states that no such indemnity scheme was established for medical professionals administering the COVID vaccines.I note the TGA is no longer interfering with doctors rights to prescribe ivermectin off label, and that the AstraZeneca vaccine, which caused blood clots and was associated with unprecedented notifications to the TGA, has been quietly discontinued.

And yet, in amongst the colourful, interlaced fibres of our communities, there are forces that try to marginalise and divide us along gender identity lines. As a doctor I looked after people from all walks of life. People were treated without judgement within those hospital wards, which is why I find it perplexing to encounter anti-gender-diverse sentiment in our community. It is alien to me, but sadly far too common outside those hospital wards. Transgender people, including gender-diverse and non-binary people, are a marginalised group who are far more susceptible to mental health impacts and health disparities. Gender dysphoria is a complex health issue, requiring expert multidisciplinary care.With the introduction of our 10-year national action plan for the health and wellbeing of LGBTQI+ people, I want to assure the community that inclusion is core business for the Albanese government. We do this to ensure that everyone is able to live a healthy, productive life where they can be their true selves.

Now we have Minister Catherine King threatening, in a review that she announced last week, to withdraw money from projects that havent started, so in essence we have communities which are at risk of being punished by the federal Labor government because the state Labor government has failed to do its job and deliver the road safety projects that weve funded.

They were dealing with grief and then dealing with the prospect of how they would pay the bills now that they had lost their two income earners. What this measure does is actually give single parents the choice. In households where you have two parents, you do have choice. You decide whether two parents go to work, whether a parent stays home, and whos going to have the caring responsibilities.

In 1954 he was selected to ride as a buckjumper on the previously completely unridden feature horse at the Royal Easter Show for Queen Elizabeth II, where he was offered 25 pounds by the show committee if he managed to stay on the horse. He conceded that he was probably selected because they didnt think theyd have to pay the money.

I recently toured this facility and saw students at work learning how to make wine and the research labs where scientists isolate the compounds that produce specific flavours and analyse the impact of smoke taint. But the most interesting part of their work is the development of the NOLO industry: no-alcohol and low-alcohol wines. They are working to make these products taste and texture indistinguishable from good quality wine—not like water plus additives.

It is the first time a government candidate has won a seat from the opposition in over 100 years. She is already the best member for Aston in over 30 years! And she is the newest member of a government working today, and every day, to deliver the positive plan that Australians voted for in 2022.When I rang Mary and asked her to be the candidate in the by-election, she had, of course, already contested an election back in 2022 and achieved an outstanding result, standing for an electorate that had received 54.7 per cent of the primary vote for the former member for Aston, Alan Tudge, and a two-party preferred vote of over 60 per cent for the coalition. Mary achieved an outstanding result in 2022, and we were hopeful that we could maintain that result. She went much better than expectations could possibly have planned for, and she did that because of who she is. Mary is someone who grew up in public housing, a mum and carer to three beautiful children, a mortgage holder who knows the pressure thats there on family budgets, a working parent who has seen the punishing cost of child care, a cancer survivor who knows the true meaning of Medicare, and a proud citizen of the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne who cares about her community and cares about the local environment. And Mary Doyle is a person driven by the oldest and deepest Australian aspiration—the aspiration for a better life and a greater opportunity for the next generation.I say to the member for Aston: I am very confident that you will continue to be a strong voice for your local community. And I am delighted that you are joining us here on budget day, with the great privilege of serving the people of Australia that all of us have from our different perspectives. Ive got to know you personally and seen you grow, particularly in that period under the pressure that comes with being a by-election candidate, where the focus of the media on Aston was far greater, its fair to say, than it probably was in the 2022 election.

For those people who were watching on election night, when you were introduced by the Deputy Prime Minister as the successful candidate, I think your humility showed, your character showed and your passionate commitment for that local community showed.

This is the first question Ive ever got from a member for Aston; the previous member was mute for the entire term! Tonights budget will be a responsible budget. Stronger foundations for a better future—that is what we will be providing tonight, cleaning up the mess that we inherited. Gross debt was predicted in the previous governments budget, and I remind them that weve been in office for less than one year. In 2022, their budget predicted that, this year, gross debt would be $977 billion, almost $1 trillion. They projected a deficit of 3.4 per cent of GDP, or $77.9 billion, for this year. Ill make a bold prediction—without stealing the Treasurers thunder tonight—that itll be a bit better than that. Ill make that bold prediction.They had $7½ billion of unfunded and terminating measures over the forward estimates. That is what we were left with—a booby trapped budget that didnt plan for the future. This time last year, those opposite handed down a budget without a single dollar in savings—not one. But they had a whole lot of expenditure out there, most of which just disappeared as soon as people cast their votes. Their focus was just on the election. Our focus is on the needs of the Australian people: making sure that we look after the vulnerable and those doing it tough, making sure that we strengthen Medicare, and making sure that we deal with the skills crisis that we inherited.Tonights budget will be about helping people who are struggling to make ends meet, while not adding to inflation. It will be about dealing with the immediate challenges but investing in the medium and long term as well. It will be about providing affordable, effective and targeted cost-of-living relief, delivering historic investments in Medicare and health, supporting vulnerable Australians, growing the economy and strengthening the budget to make our finances more secure for the future.","Budget","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/subdebate.1[2]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ALBANESE (Grayndler—Prime Minister) ","(14:13):"

I use it to know that, indeed, inflation had taken off well before Labor took office. Indeed, the largest quarterly rise this century was—guess when? March 2022. The largest rise in inflation of any quarter this century was on their watch—the last quarter in which they were in office. That is the starting point that my government inherited: a 2.1 per cent jump in one quarter. If you do a bit of maths—you dont need an economics degree—2.1 over a quarter times four equals a pretty high inflation rate. That is what they were dealing with, and that is what we have had to deal with.After the election, it emerged that the Morrison government had ignored Treasury warnings, and it used its final budget to unleash a desperate vote-buying spending spree. They added fuel to the inflation fire. A former government source described it as ordering the entree, the main and the dessert. It was all there. All the one-off payments and the cash payments were there—not worrying about the impact.Indeed, Australians always pay more under the coalition. We know that the highest-taxing government was the Howard government and the second-highest-taxing government was that of Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison. The budget papers accompanying their final budget last year showed no surpluses over the forwards; instead, the coalition were on track to rack up $224 billion in additional borrowings over just four years. The Intergenerational report showed the budget would not be in surplus in any year between now and 2060.

On 31 March 2021, a day after the Leader of the Opposition had just become Australias defence minister, he announced that the former government was to establish an industrial base in this country for the manufacture of guided weapons. This was done in the finest traditions and with all the hoopla of a Morrison government announcement. Indeed, the member for Cook was on the press release, where he said:As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, having the ability for self-reliance, be it vaccine development or the defence of Australia, is vital to meeting our own requirements in a changing global environment.We all know what they didnt do with vaccines, and they werent much better when it came to the defence of Australia. The press release also said:The Australian Strategic Policy Institute has estimated that Australia will spend $100 billion in the next 20 years on missile and guided weapons purchases.It promised the creation of 2,000 high-tech jobs in Australia—although, under the scrutiny of Senate estimates, it turns out that that number was not based on any advice from the Department of Defence; in fact, it was completely made up. The reality of that announcement was very different. Only $1 billion was committed, not nearly enough to see this get going, and the time frame for the beginning of manufacturing guided weapons in this country was not to happen until 2027, a full six years after this announcement was made—promises on the never-never, all fanfare, no follow-up, all announcement, no delivery. On his first full day in the job as Australias defence minister he sold this country a fantasy.The Albanese government is very different. Announcements are one matter, but we ask to be judged on our outcomes. Over the last couple of weeks weve committed $2.5 billion to the establishment of a guided weapons enterprise in this country. Weve already appointed a three-star officer, Air Vice-Marshal Leon Phillips, to oversee that enterprise, and this is all part of the Defence Strategic Review, which was released on 24 April, the first retasking of our Defence Force in more than 35 years. At the heart of that retasking is giving our Defence Force the capacity for impactful protection, which is why establishing a guided weapons enterprise forms one of our six initial priorities to the Defence Strategic Review, because this is exactly the capability our nation needs to keep Australians safe.","Defence","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/subdebate.1[4]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr MARLES (Corio—Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence) ","(14:20):"

I know she cares very deeply about this and is very deeply engaged in lifting the standard of aged care in this country, and I thank her for continuing to work shoulder to shoulder with me on that. The Albanese government is proud to be delivering the largest ever pay rise for aged-care workers in history. After nine years of workforce neglect from those opposite, Labor has made a record investment in our workforce.Our commitment helps more than 250,000 workers across this country, and it means that nurses can earn an extra $10,000 a year. It means that personal-care workers can earn an extra $7,000 a year. That is what valuing workers looks like. That is what care looks like. That is what doing something meaningful to address workforce shortages actually looks like. I have visited 30 aged-care homes in the 11 months that I have been the minister, and the no. 1 issue raised with me is staff shortages. We said that we would address the mess left behind by those opposite, and now our budget commits $11.3 billion to addressing their workforce crisis.But this wage rise impacts more than just our tireless and skilled workers. It improves the lives of those who receive aged care as well. They are just as thrilled for their workers as we are. On the weekend I met home-care recipient Rachel, 91 years young, while doorknocking in my electorate of Lilley. Rachel uses a home-care package, and she had her nurse, Elle, from Burnie Brae over when they watched the Treasurer and I make the announcement on TV last Thursday morning. Rachel said Elle actually shouted out loud, and you could hear her from Bribie Island, because Elle has three kids, and this announcement, that she was getting an extra $200 a week, meant she could buy her kids new shoes for sport. That is what this announcement does. Workers like Elle and care recipients like Rachel are why we committed to this record spend. This spend is more than 10 times what those opposite committed to in their workforce pillar to address the workforce crisis—a pillar that could not even improve or commit to improving pay-packet structure. In fact, those opposite still refuse to back this funding of a wage rise, even now.","Aged Care","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/subdebate.1[6]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms WELLS (Lilley—Minister for Aged Care and Minister for Sport) ","(14:25):"

136,0,1,0,0,1,"Shorten, Bill MP","00ATG","Maribyrnong","ALP","N/A",2834," On 24 November last year, the Age and the Sydney Morning Herald disturbingly reported that de facto Canberra lobbying firm Synergy 360 received secret advice from the member for Fadden. I ordered a review into the contracts which may have been tainted. As has been made clear by agency task force representatives and the reviewer, Dr Watt, the review was limited to only looking into the conduct of public servants and not that of vendors, former ministers, MPs and their officers.On 14 April this year, the JCPAA, chaired by the member for Bruce, held public hearings into the findings of the Watt review. The member for Faddens former business partner, political fundraiser and part-owner of Synergy 360, Mr John Margerison, gave evidence. The chairs first question to Mr Margerison was: Whats APUT? Mr Margerison was asked by the chair what APUT was. He replied—and I quote from the transcript:Its the Australian Property Trust. Its a unit trust.The chair then read aloud an email Mr Margerison sent to his Gold Coast accountant, Mr Sean Beasley, about directing who was to receive the profits from Synergy 360. The transcript reads:On 13 September 2017, you emailed your accountant, Mr Beasley, and advised him: FYI, anything that comes in from this in the future, I will end up sending to APUT—the Property Trust—the same amount that comes in.Mr Margerison went on to say that the trust that he controlled was, according to his instruction to his accountant, to direct profits from the consulting company derived from Commonwealth contracts. This property trust had as one of its beneficiaries the member for Fadden. I quote the transcript where Mr Margerison explains the member for Faddens pecuniary interest in the Property Trust receiving profits from Commonwealth contracts. It reads:I had a business relationship with Mr Robert at one point in time. That finished around about, give or take, the end of 2018. He would have been a unit holder through whatever mechanism, whether it be his family trust or personally … up until … that time, give or take.Money derived from Commonwealth contracts was being funnelled through to a member of parliament. The evidence presented to the committee is crystal clear. We know that in a few weeks the member for Fadden is leaving the Australian parliament. The evidence is crystal clear. The question for the member for Fadden and the Leader of the Opposition is: did the member ever, directly or indirectly, seek to or receive a financial benefit from Synergy 360 and is there still a potential benefit owed to him? A further question for the Leader of the Opposition is: do you endorse the conduct of the member for Fadden in light of the evidence that weve heard?","Commonwealth Procurement","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/subdebate.1[8]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr SHORTEN (Maribyrnong—Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme and Minister for Government Services) ","(14:33):"

149,0,1,0,0,1,"Rishworth, Amanda Louise MP","HWA","Kingston","ALP","N/A",2835," Id like to thank the member for Fraser for that question and for his fierce advocacy for families in his electorate. Id like to thank many of my Labor colleagues and, indeed, many on the crossbench as well, for their advocacy on boosting support for single parents.Yesterday the Prime Minister announced that this government will expand the eligibility for the single-parent payment by increasing the age cut-off from when the youngest child turns eight to when the youngest child turns 14. This will provide 57,000 low-income single parents with an additional $176.90 per fortnight. This measure will strengthen Australias safety net and, as the Prime Minister yesterday, is an investment in families. It recognises that many single parents—overwhelmingly women—have a lot to juggle. The juggle doesnt change when the child turns eight. Our change means that parents will continue to receive a higher payment during the later primary school years and through the critical transition to high school. As children get older the demands on parenting dont go away but they do evolve. Single parents are in a much stronger position to take on more paid work as their children get older, but they do need support to get there.Id like to acknowledge the work by Terese Edwards of the Council of Single Mothers and Sam Mostyn AO of the Womens Economic Equality Taskforce, who put significant work into their report and who also welcomed yesterdays announcement. They said the reform will allow those who qualify for the payment to be better parents and to unlock their untapped economic potential. Both of these women have been consistent and constructive in their advocacy on particular challenges facing single parents, most of whom are women.Im pleased that our changes have been warmly welcomed by many advocates and stakeholders, including The Parenthood and the Australian Council of Social Service, who have both called this measure life-changing. The Australian Council of Social Service said that restoration of the parenting payment was a key recommendation of the Womens Economic Equality Taskforce and that the governments changes were incredibly welcome. The Parenthood also said that this change, along with the abolition of the ParentsNext program, will greatly help thousands of vulnerable children and parents, most mothers, and allow them to have greater financial freedom and flexibility.Our change will ensure single parents have the safety net they need. Our government is focused on families dealing with the day-to-day financial pressures, while creating more economic security for them over the long-term.

Indeed, in the United Kingdom, along with Prime Minister Sunak, last week I announced that the free trade agreement would come into force on 31 May. That follows the final parliamentary processes being completed in the UK just last week and our processes being completed before parliament rose at the end of last year.This FTA opens up new opportunities and delivers significant benefits for Australian businesses and consumers, for Australian farmers and for Australian workers and travellers. It will lift our entire economy. It will eliminate tariffs on nearly all exports to the United Kingdom, making an enormous difference. I was at the Bondi Green cafe there in London, one of 14 as part of a business thats been established over the last decade, providing the best food, produce and wine that Australia can produce to UK customers. That is a good thing. What it will do is enable the price of those to be decreased substantially, but it will also make it easier for Australians to work in the UK, raising the working holiday visa age from 30 to 35 and increasing the maximum stay from two years to three years. It will eliminate tariffs on imports from the UK. This will reduce costs to households and businesses and will, therefore, have a deflationary impact on our economy.Together with the historic AUKUS partnership, were strengthening our relationship with a longstanding partner and friend. I had the privilege of going with the Defence secretary of state up to Barrow to look at their manufacturing of submarines that occurs there, and that is where I met Australian workers who are already being trained there. The relationships we are building with countries around the world are vital to Australias strategic interests and to a thriving economy at home. In addition, I met with leaders of the European Union, on the sidelines of the coronation, to see in what way we could advance the Australia-EU free trade agreement.

Weve made sure, as will be reflected tonight as well, that we have indicated to the Public Service, by every single one of my ministers not just talking to the secretary of their departments but talking to their whole departments, encouraging ideas to come up, encouraging that frank and fearless advice to come to government so that, as we go forward, we maximise the respect and the capacity of the Public Service.I do that personally as well. On any occasion when I visited the UK, we had a meeting with the High Commissioner for all of the staff at the High Commission—the staff who work in Defence, the staff who work in Home Affairs, the staff who work in Immigration, the staff who work in Trade and the staff who work in Foreign Affairs and diplomatic advice as well. It is, to me, common courtesy; if you treat people with respect, you will get better outcomes. We also have the same approach towards their income and treating them with respect when it comes to proper negotiations between the government and public servants, through their union, to make sure that respect is shown.The former government did receive some advice about the issue that has come to light when it comes to the Tax Practitioners Board. Indeed, the measures that were there from a review into the Tax Practitioners Board were given to the government of the day in 2019. But, like so much else, nothing happened. My government is committed to implementing the recommendations of that review.","Consulting Firms","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/subdebate.1[13]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ALBANESE (Grayndler—Prime Minister) ","(14:51):"

Maybe wed all be better off if that had happened, because he thinks that lower coal and gas prices lead to higher energy prices. But weve done that and its had an impact. Weve seen that impact in the draft Default Market Offer released earlier this year: 29 percentage points lower than it otherwise would have been. As Clare Savage, the Energy Regulator, has made clear, that is in large part due to the impact of the intervention by the Albanese government.

Im pleased to confirm that 5½ million households and a million businesses will benefit from that action. The Treasurer will, of course, outline more action this evening.But theres a third element as well. We understand, on this side of the House, that reducing emissions and reducing bills are the same thing. We understand that if you make a house or a business more efficient, you reduce bills as well as emissions, and we happen to think thats a good thing. Call us old fashioned but on this side of the House we think that reducing bills and reducing emissions is a good thing. We know that Australia ranks 58th out of 63 on energy efficiency of households. We can do better. In particular, lower- and middle-income household need that support. So, again, we will see tonight strong action to help households reduce their bills and emissions, particularly for those who need assistance and particularly for small business. Weve already announced our tax treatment of energy efficient investments by small business which will benefit hundreds of thousands of small businesses across the country who want to reduce their emissions and reduce their bills, and were going to help them do it.","Cost of Living","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/subdebate.1[14]/answer/talk.text/body/p[7]","N/A","N/A"

204,0,1,0,0,1,"Butler, Mark Christopher MP","HWK","Hindmarsh","ALP","N/A",2838," I thank the member for Chisholm for her question. I know how hard she campaigned in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne on our promise to make medicines cheaper, and our government are delivering on that promise. Just last July we slashed the maximum amount that pensioners and concession card holders would pay for their medicines across a given year by 25 per cent, and in September we cut the price of 2,000 brands of medicine, putting $130 million back into the pockets of hardworking Australians. As everyone in this House knows, on 1 January we delivered the biggest cut to the price of medicines in the 75-year history of the PBS, putting more than $200 million every single year back into the pockets of hardworking Australian patients.But there is more that the government can and the government should be doing here. Over summer the peak medicines experts, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, advised our government that more than 300 common medicines for chronic disease should be able to be supplied for 60 days rather than the current maximum of 30 days. This would bring us into line with pretty much every country to which we usually compare ourselves: the UK, New Zealand, Canada, France, Germany and so many others besides. It would halve the number of times those patients would have to visit the GP to get a routine repeat script, freeing up millions of GP consults, which everyone in this House knows is desperately needed. It would halve the cost of those common medicines for six million Australian patients living with chronic disease—medicines for blood pressure, heart disease, cholesterol, Crohns disease and so much more. Overseas evidence tells us that this extra dispensing arrangement will increase medication compliance by up to 20 per cent. The AMA said this is a win for patients, ultimately delivering better health outcomes and taking pressure off the health system.

First of all, in terms of the award review, which was something that the member for Wentworth sought during the debate and was ultimately negotiated with the Senate as well with Senator Pocock, there are further discussions happening now about the nature of that award review. The review of the awards is in particular in the context of the new objectives in the act, and those objectives go both to secure employment and to gender equality, which obviously is particularly significant for the rates of pay for people who are working as early childhood educators.In terms of multi-employer bargaining, the different parts of the act commence on different dates. The multi-employer provisions havent started yet, so the reason why no multi-employer agreements have been concluded for early childhood education is those sections of the act dont commence until June. What we have seen, though, is exactly what I predicted in the sense that, immediately, we have seen a whole lot of employers come back to the table on individual enterprise agreements with their workforce, workplace by workplace. Our preference is always that you get individual workplaces negotiating and having those agreements in place. Thats always the best option, but the problem has been, in a whole lot of feminised sectors, that hasnt worked. Thats why we needed to open up the rules for multi-employer bargaining. They commence in June, so right now were in a phase where were seeing a really serious acceleration in the number of negotiations that are happening for enterprise agreements, and I expect, the moment that the laws start to open up in June, thats when we will logically see an increase in the engagement with multi-employer bargaining.","Child Care","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/subdebate.1[17]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BURKE (Watson—Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Minister for the Arts and Leader of the House) ","(15:06):"

But, more importantly, she knows how important it is that when you promise to deliver infrastructure, it is actually delivered. That is why reforming the $120 billion infrastructure investment pipeline is so incredibly important. The previous government left this pipeline in a total mess, riddled with projects that were simply underfunded, had no funding partner, had not actually had proper cost-benefit analysis done and had not got the support of the states and territories. They were poorly scoped and were simply unable to be delivered. We saw the pipeline grow from 150 projects to 800 projects, a large number of which were under $50 million and simply could never be delivered.If the previous government somehow thought that they were going to deliver every single one of those 800 projects that were poorly funded, under scoped and not supported by the states and territories, then they had rocks in their heads.

266,0,1,0,0,1,"Rowland, Michelle MP",159771,"Greenway","ALP","N/A",2842," I thank my most excellent colleague for her question. Keeping Australians safe is the core priority of the Albanese government, and that includes online safety, which has traditionally been an area of bipartisanship. This government is now undertaking the substantive work to ensure that the Online Safety Act is successfully implemented together with our regulator, the eSafety Commissioner. ESafety provides critical support to Australians who experience online abuse. Just to give you some sense of scale, since 1 July last year eSafety has provided support to children, parents and schools in response to over 1,200 complaints under its Cyberbullying Scheme. ESafety also received over 6,000 reports of image based abuse and completed over 12,000 investigations in relation to illegal and restricted content.The eSafety Commissioner is also dealing with new and emerging online harms, including challenges posed by generative AI, which can be used to make what are called deepfakes. When generated with malice, deepfakes can be incredibly harmful. Its particularly concerning to hear about this technology being used to target women, who we know are more likely to experience online abuse that is personal, sexualised and violent. eSafety has powers to remove deepfake images that constitute image based abuse. As these technologies are adopted more widely, eSafetys work will continue to be relevant and a high priority of this government.Despite this, eSafety faces a funding cliff thanks to the decisions made by those opposite, who left the regulator with a host of non-ongoing or terminating funding measures. After 30 June, eSafetys overall funding would drop by more than half. The question asks about safety. Those opposite liked to announce how important various agencies and programs were, but they left them seriously underfunded.We discovered this in respect of not only eSafety but also the Viewer Access Satellite Television service and other areas where Australians rely on the government to keep them safe and connected. For example, those opposite announced cell broadcast national messaging to ensure Australians could receive critical emergency warnings, but they actually underfunded it, so it couldnt proceed. Last week, I announced that our upcoming budget ensures this critical project can be delivered, as well as public safety mobile broadband—yet another vital safety project that languished under the previous government. The Albanese government is left once again to clean up the mess left by those opposite, but were getting on with the job of delivering a better and safer future for all Australians.","Cybersafety","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/subdebate.1[20]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms ROWLAND (Greenway—Minister for Communications) ","(15:18):"

There were big announcements from the former Prime Minister about the Brisbane Olympic Games but, unfortunately, not a dollar of funding—not one dollar for the Brisbane Olympic and Paralympic Games. There was nothing for the Commonwealth biosecurity operating costs shortfalls, nothing for Questacon operations to be fixed up, nothing for the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust that was needed. There was underinvestment in Commonwealth national parks like Kakadu. In a building just down the road here, called the National Gallery of Australia, we have, thanks to Gough Whitlam and his vision, one painting that is worth half a billion dollars—one artwork—yet they have buckets there because of water dripping from the leaky roof due to underfunding.

I thank all of the crossbench again for their support. Of course, the Greens party didnt vote at all. When it was considered by the housing ministers last week, every single one of them, including the Liberal minister from Tasmania, signed a letter urging senators to pass this bill. I want to read some of this letter to the House today. The letter says:The Housing Australia Future Fund is an important step towards providing more Australians a safe and secure home.It provides an ongoing stream of commonwealth funds to support the delivery of social and affordable housing.It was signed by all eight housing ministers from right across the country.But of course its not just the housing ministers who are supporting this fund; critically its the people on the front line—the people who are providing homelessness services and the people who are building houses, the construction sector. National Shelter are supporting the bill and want it passed by the parliament. Homelessness Australia supports the bill and wants it passed by the parliament. The Community Housing Industry Association supports the bill and wants it passed by the parliament. Both Master Builders and the Housing Industry Association support the bill and want it passed by the parliament. Industry Super wants the bill to be supported by the parliament.All of the sector involved in supplying more social and affordable rental homes is supporting this bill, so I say to members opposite and to the Greens party: Talk to your senators. Tell your senators to support this bill. The time for political grandstanding and further games is over. There are vulnerable Australians out there today who are relying on this bill to get passed so that we can get more social and affordable homes on the ground for those Australians who need it most.

Nobody knows the state of Kakadu National Park and Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park better than the member for Lingiari, formerly the Territory MP and now the federal MP for Kakadu. She spent 10 years as the head of the Northern Land Council. She knows it like the back of her hand. She knows that it has been neglected and let down by those opposite for more than a decade.Those opposite hid the State of the environment report. You know why? Because they left the state of the Australian environment in a bad state and getting worse. In contrast, what are we doing? We are doubling funding for Commonwealth national parks—national parks like Kakadu, like Uluru-Kata Tjuta, like Booderee and like the marine parks—because we know that what has been happening is the slow decline of our national parks. In Kakadu, youve got crocodile signs missing. Youve got campgrounds and tracks that are shut to tourists because they are not safe. We want to make sure that these properties are protected for the future.We have invested $45.2 million in the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust, because what we were left by those opposite was these properties in a state of disrepair. I visited with a number of local members to see the cracked seawalls and the convict-built architecture falling into the harbour. We cant afford to let our national estate decline in this way.What youll see from us tonight in the budget is a doubling of funding for those Commonwealth national parks. Youll see an extra $163 million for the Australian Institute of Marine Science. In Townsville, they had a whole wing of laboratories closed because the machinery is out of date, theres mould in the roof and the offices arent safe for our scientists to use. So were doubling funding for the Australian Institute of Marine Science as well, left unfunded by those opposite. This will create 100 extra jobs in Townsville. It will create 110 extra jobs in our national parks. Many of them, of course, will be held by First Nations Australians, and Im very proud of that. That means a better tourism experience for people visiting our national estate, and, most importantly, it means that the places that are special for Australians and the plants and animals that are at risk will be better protected, for us, for our kids, for our grandkids.","Environment","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/subdebate.1[24]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney—Minister for the Environment and Water) ","(15:33):"

But for the National Library, it wasnt just the roof that was leaking; it was the windows that were leaking as well. But, to go one better, at the National Maritime Museum the pontoons were sinking. So it wasnt enough for them to have the water coming down from above; at the National Maritime Museum they were trying to get the museum itself to fall right down to sea level. Thats the way they left it. Why was it left this way? Because each of these organisations—already underfunded—was facing a funding cliff.When the Prime Minister went out to announce the new funding, with the Minister for Finance, out at the National Gallery, the member of staff who took us through the National Gallery was their director of First Nations. You would think this was an essential position at the National Gallery. But, under their funding, that position had to be funded through donations. This was not an add-on position at the National Gallery. This was the director of First Nations. Thats what the person was in charge of, and even that position was not funded.As of this year, the funding cliff has gone. These organisations now will be funded, for the workers to now know they still have a job and for the organisations to know that they now can plan for the future for the first time. Finally, these organisations will know that we will no longer have a situation where the items in the museum are in a place with silica dust flying into it—that now our national institutions will be protected as they always should have been.","National Collecting Institutions","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/subdebate.1[26]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BURKE (Watson—Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Minister for the Arts and Leader of the House) ","(15:41):"

358,0,0,0,1,1,"Fletcher, Paul MP","L6B","Bradfield","LP","N/A",2848," Around Australia, this Prime Ministers cost-of-living crisis is affecting millions of Australians. The Prime Minister was pretty clear in the promises he made before the last election. He promised to reduce energy bills by $275 not once, not twice but 97 times. Of course he promised there would be cheaper mortgages, and he promised that Australians would be better off under a Labor government. It was all very clear and very simple. It did not admit of any doubt. So Australians would naturally be very troubled to find that the reality today is extraordinarily different from what this Prime Minister promised. Inflation is at its highest level in over 30 years, core inflation is higher than in the US, Britain, Canada and indeed every G7 nation, and electricity prices have gone up and up and up.It is in the experiences of Australian families and households where we see the true toll of this governments escalating cost-of-living crisis. Australian families are experiencing the largest fall in their spending power in this century as more and more families struggle with the crippling effects of inflation. Australian families are even resorting to changing their diets, with one report showing that two-thirds of Australians are finding it less affordable to eat healthily. Banks are reporting more Australian families are falling behind on their repayments, and higher-risk customers cant even get a loan or get refinancing. Business collapses are surging, with warnings of an insolvency Armageddon as Labors first year in office has seen almost a doubling in the rate at which businesses are becoming insolvent.More Australians with mental health concerns are being forced to cancel appointments with psychologists because they simply cant afford them. Growing numbers of Australians cannot afford to maintain their cars, and they are skipping vital maintenance and repairs. Mortgage risk reports are showing more and more Australian towns and suburbs are entering mortgage shock, with repayments eating up to 60 per cent of household income in some post codes. More than three-quarters of Australians report that they are either extremely or very concerned about the cost of living, with most saying electricity prices are a key concern. The gap between the cost of a typical home and the amount that an average Australian can borrow has more than doubled.More and more Australians are resorting to having meals at home and buying generic brands of food and groceries under this Labor governments cost-of-living crisis. More and more Australians are buying canned food because they cannot afford to buy fresh fruit and vegetables. Australians are turning to charities for support, with Lifeline and other crisis providers reporting huge increases in the number of families requesting their assistance, including, in many cases, families that have never before needed to turn to a crisis provider for help. Families are facing no option but to cut back on non-essential purchases.According to the national youth mental health survey, the cost of living is the single biggest concern for young Australians. According to analysis by Deloitte Access Economics, at least 300,000 Australian households may be experiencing negative cashflow—more money going out than coming in—following the 10 interest rate rises on this governments watch. The St Vincent de Paul Society in Queensland has reported that more families, particularly young women, are being forced to sleep in their cars due to this governments cost-of-living crisis. The CEO of Foodbank in Queensland recently said:As cost of living continues to rise, families are being forced to choose between keeping a roof over their heads and putting food on the table.This is a very grim picture, and there is very little reason to be confident that this government has a plan to deal with it.It is absolutely critical that there be a focus on inflation—getting inflation down, attacking those cost-of-living increases. That will be the test of this budget—whether it puts downward pressure on inflation. When inflation is high it erodes purchasing power, it eats away at savings and it lowers the standard of living. This is the central economic issue facing Australians—the need to get inflation down.Fighting inflation with handouts is not the solution to this problem. We need a government which is addressing the problem of inflation at its source, not the symptoms. If Labor were serious about tackling inflation, it would build on the strong economic management that it inherited from the previous coalition government. It would restore the fiscal guardrails to the budget, including the goal of budget balance and including the tax to GDP cap. Is it any surprise that under this Labor government there is now no formal rule as to the maximum percentage of tax it says it will collect as a percentage of GDP?Labor is seeking to distract from its spending plans by dropping to the media that the budget will be in surplus for 2022-23, but the real story is what happens in 2023-24, the actual year the Treasurer is preparing a budget for, and in the out years beyond that. A short-term surplus thanks to a one-off jump in commodity export prices and strong employment numbers inherited from the Morrison government is one thing, but a structural deficit over the next few years as Labor fails to get spending under control is very bad news for the Australians who are concerned that inflation will become entrenched and that their cost of living will go up and up.The simple fact is: if this government does not get spending under control, this budget will drive more inflation. Unless this government limits spending, it will be adding to the cost of your mortgage, your rent, your groceries and just about everything else Australians need to spend their hard-earned money on. We need to see from this government and this budget a long-term approach to controlling spending. It is critical that the economy is growing faster than spending. Thats how the coalition operated between 2013 and 2019, prior to a once-in-a-century pandemic, and it was that budget rule, that fiscal discipline, which produced the outcome of a steadily reducing budget deficit until we achieved budget balance. But that is very different to the psychology and the instinctive nature of Labor governments. There is nothing a Labor government likes to do more than spend and tax. Weve seen the pattern with every previous Labor government, and already we are seeing the same pattern materialise when it comes to the Albanese Labor government.In the October budget, we saw the Albanese Labor government add $115 billion of spending over the four years of the forward estimates compared to the budget brought down by the Morrison government in March 2022. Theres another $45 billion of spending that we have opposed because that is not what our budget needs. Its not what our fiscal policy needs. Its not what we need as a nation if we are going to attack the core problem which is challenging the lives and lifestyles of every Australian—that is, the problem of inflation and ever-rising cost of living. As this government adds more spending, it also adds additional interest costs over many years into the future.We saw a very traditional Labor approach in its first budget in October last year. We saw Labor increase spending, making the structural deficit worse, and we saw Labor abandon any formal goal of achieving budget balance. Thats not a responsible approach. Its not good budget management, and we see now that, around Australia, Australian households and Australian families are paying a price for this governments poor management of the budget.The other very important reason to keep spending under control is: if youre controlling spending, you dont need to go around raising taxes. Higher taxes are a huge problem. They kill aspiration. They hurt families. They delay the investment that provides jobs and helps small businesses to grow.Australian families, every day, every week, are making very tough decisions about their household budgets. It is imperative that we have, as a nation, a budget that also involves decisions that address the fundamental problem of cost of living and inflation.","Cost of Living","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr FLETCHER (Bradfield—Manager of Opposition Business) ","(15:52):"
359,0,0,0,1,1,"Kearney, Ged MP","LTU","Cooper","ALP","N/A",2849," I am really beginning to worry about those on the opposite side of the House. Maybe theyre deaf, maybe theyre a bit dim—I dont know! They seem to be throwing this question at us time after time, and we tell them time after time that we understand that the cost of living is hitting a lot of Australians hard. We understand that inflation is the defining economic challenge of 2023. It was in 2022—and, as the Prime Minister mentioned today, those opposite, when they were in government, had an inflation measure the highest this century has seen.Australians understand that we did not create these challenges, but they elected us to take responsibility for addressing them—and we are. The Albanese Labor government is delivering the positive change that Australians voted for—and, can I remind them, that is including the good people of Aston. They recently voted for a Labor government, overwhelmingly—we had a wonderful Labor candidate in Mary Doyle—but they turned their back on the opposition. I am beginning to wonder if those opposite are not reading the tea leaves. Yes, we know there is a lot of work to do, but we are staying focused on easing the pressure on families and helping Australians manage their budgets. That is why the centrepiece of tonights budget will be a $14.6 billion cost-of-living relief package.The first phase of this, for example, is our cheaper medicines policy. That came into effect on 1 January this year. The cheaper medicines policy is an incredibly important policy for so many Australians who are having to choose between taking their medicines or paying the rent or putting food on the table. As a former health professional, I have had, from time to time, people telling me that they just take medicines every other day because they think that is cheaper. We know that it is important they take them every single day. Or they might miss a month or a week. Now, they no longer have to do that.Tonights budget will go further, delivering cheaper medicines for over six million Australians. We will halve unnecessary visits to the GP and the pharmacist just to fill a repeat script. This will save Australians up to $180 a year for every eligible medicine they buy. Thanks to my wonderful colleague here the Minister for Aged Care, Ms Wells, we are delivering a massive increase for our aged-care workers by giving them a wage rise, an $11.3 billion investment. Thats a wage rise to some of the lowest-paid but most-valued workers in our economy, a wage rise which will actually help with the cost of living. Self-funded retirees will access a seniors card under this government, which will give them access to the concession rate of PBS medicines and bulk-billed GP visits. That is a massive saving for many, many retirees. These are just some of the measures that have been announced in my own portfolio of health and aged care.Outside health and aged care, we have already announced electricity bill relief, which those opposite voted against. We have increased support for single parents. The Treasurer will have much more to say about that tonight, but we know that this single measure alone will have a massive impact on single parents struggling to meet the rising cost of living. We have successfully argued for a Fair Work Commission wage rise in line with inflation. We have introduced legislation that will drive investment in cleaner and cheaper energy, putting downward pressure on power prices. We are delivering cheaper child care, with one of the biggest investments in history in the cost of child care, which means that women can go back to work if they want to and will pay less for their child care. That, of course, will ease the cost-of-living pressures. We are delivering fee-free TAFE. You cant cut a cost of living measure any more than by making it free. This means that more people will get the skills they need to get good jobs—well paid jobs in our economy.We are expanding paid parental leave. When I had my babies, there was no paid parental leave—none at all—and we had to struggle along on one income. It was a great innovation by the Gillard government to introduce paid parental leave, and now we will be expanding that even more. This will, of course, ease the cost of living for parents. We are building more affordable homes, including through the new National Housing Accord. If those opposite could just see their way through to supporting the National Housing Future Fund, we would be able to build a lot more. We know that increasing supply will bring the cost of housing down, which will, of course, help people with the cost of living. Pensions, allowances and rent assistance have all increased in line with inflation. We are going to improve the bargaining system, which will make it easier for workers to get wage rises and create gender equality in the workplace, making sure that women get equal and better pay.Lets go back over some of these things I have said. What is it that those opposite dont get? We are easing pressure on families. We are introducing a relief package. There will be cheaper medicines and cheaper visits to the GP. We will have wage rises for aged-care workers and other low-paid workers. There will be downward pressure on power prices, cheaper child care, fee-free TAFE, expanded paid parental leave, more affordable homes and increased cost-of-living measures that will give more money to pensioners and people who need rent assistance. We will improve the wages of every worker in this country. They are all things that will actually help with the cost of living.Lets have a look at the Liberal legacy. They suppressed wage growth—suppressed wage growth—as a deliberate design feature of their governments economic policy. The now Leader of the Opposition, the then health minister, ripped out, or tried to rip out, $50 billion from hospitals; he tried to increase the cost of scripts by $5 and charge every Australian a tax on their visits to their GP. When Labor was able to block this attack on our health system and Australians right to access it, he hit them with a Medicare rebate freeze. He was voted, by Australian doctors, the worst health minister in living memory, and we know that wasnt for nothing. So what a legacy! Compare what I said before with its opposite—with what the opposition did when they were in government. The opposition charged a bigger tax; they raised the price of scripts; they froze the Medicare rebate. Such a stellar record from the Leader of the Opposition and those opposite when it comes to cost-of-living relief! I cant help but sit here and think, when I listen to them go on and on and on about caring about people struggling with the cost of living, that theyre pouring crocodile tears all the way down their face. They deliberately designed a decade of wage stagnation, froze the Medicare rebate and oversaw a decade of shameful neglect of our aged-care system; they refused to vote for energy bill relief; they said no to every single proposal that we have put forward to help Australian households. And yet they stand there and ask the same question over and over.Only Labors government will do absolutely everything in its power to support Australians and Australian workers. We have given pay rises. We have given true cost-of-living relief. And this budget tonight will go even further than I have been able to outline tonight. It will be a sensible budget. It will give cost-of-living relief. It will manage inflation. It will repair the budget. It will clean up the mess that that government left from nine years of absolute neglect of this economy, of workers, of everyday Australians, because only Labor governments deliver real, tangible relief to Australian households.

I acknowledge the work that shes doing in the ministry of sport. But when you go and you talk to people in aged-care centres, to those running those country aged-care centres—and I appreciate theyre saying that theres going to be a wage jump for those workers tonight, and thats good—some of those workers wont have an aged-care centre to go to, because of the 24/7 nursing edict that has been placed on them by those opposite.You get a good aged-care centre, such as the one I visited recently at Junee, and they are desperately worried that they wont be able to provide for their residents with 24/7 nursing. They cant find cleaners. They cant find cooks. They cant find people to change the beds, let alone 24/7 nursing. What are those aged-care centres supposed to do? And that is the case right over regional and, particularly, remote Australia, where aged-care centres are desperately worried.We know that the price of groceries is going up. We know that Scotts Refrigerated Transport is going backwards; theyve been placed in liquidation. I heard the member for Cooper, the assistant minister, talking about building more houses. Jolly good! But who are they going to get to build those houses—let alone the materials to build those houses? That industry is absolutely going backwards, unfortunately. It was going alright under the home ownership schemes that we put in place. But that industry, the building industry, is doing it tough at the moment, and not helped by those opposite. I listened to the Minister for Housing going on not that long ago about a million houses. Good luck building them! Good luck finding the people to actually be able to build those houses!And then we come to students. You would think that those opposite would have placed students at the top of their expectations—at the top of their aspirations and the top of the care that they supposedly give. And yet the HECS debt is going to reach a 32-year high under those opposite. How do struggling students, such as those like Wagga Waggas Maddison Dickinson—who still has, she says, about $6,000 to pay off on a HECS debt for partially completing a Bachelor of Paramedicine and a Bachelor of Arts—a 24-year-old, pay off her HECS debt when its at a 32-year high? I dont know. Maybe those opposite could answer that question. Students are going to be hit with a seven-per-cent indexation rate at the beginning of June. Students are doing it tough, and all those opposite can do is to come in and say, Oh, well, were bringing the budget back into surplus. They havent produced a surplus since 1989; Senator Claire Chandler wasnt even born the last time that Labor produced a surplus!But the fact remains that they demonise the coal industry, they demonise the gas industry and they demonise the resources sector, which is providing the iron ore, the resources and the export cheques. Then they gloat about producing a budget surplus on the back of that resources sector—which kept us going during COVID!—and on the back of the agriculture sector, which kept us going during COVID. And theyre hitting the pharmacists hard—Ill get onto that in the next speech I make in this place. But the pharmacists are doing it tough.We have the assistant minister for regional health, a former pharmacist, belonging to a government which should know better. In some places, particularly in remote country Australia, the pharmacist is the only health professional in town. Why would you hit them so hard, to the point of closure? Why would you do that? Its all about the cost of living and they dont care!

364,0,0,0,1,1,"Murphy, Peta MP",133646,"Dunkley","ALP","N/A",2851," Member for Riverina, you asked about those nursing homes in your electorate who are concerned about 24/7 nurses being put on and whether they can do it. You asked the parliament, What are they supposed to do? How about they speak to the excellent Minister for Aged Care, who is sitting right there, about the supports and exemptions that are in place? If you are not referring them to do that, then youre not doing your job! Youre not doing your job, because she has said so many times that she is there to help any facility that has trouble meeting the 24/7 nurse legislation. There are exemptions and there are supports. So instead of coming in here and having a crack at the minister, do your job and speak to your nursing facilities that have concerns. Tell them to get in contact with the minister, her office and her department, and they will help them.Thats because we are a government which brings in policies that make life better for people, and we do everything we can to implement them. Thats as opposed to the last government, which did wonderful announcements and pretty good press releases, at times, but didnt implement anything. They didnt implement anything. I tell you what, if you want to find a minister who cares more about people than about herself and who works her fingers to the bone, then its the Minister for Aged Care. Anyone who says differently—whose name might have an extra S in it—might look in the mirror and wonder what jealousy looks like, because then she will see it. The Albanese Labor government are doing what we can to address the cost-of-living issues that we inherited from nine years of wasted time, wasted spending and a lack of action.In my electorate, my community saved $259,743.57 on PBS medicines in January and February of this year alone. Thats $260,000 saved in my electorate, where there are pockets of some of the most disadvantaged people in Victoria, where chronic health problems are way above the state average and where we know how important it is to be able to access medicines. Since the Albanese government reduced the co-payment on 1 January of this year, more than 22,800 scripts in Dunkley have been cheaper. This makes medicines more affordable and accessible, it takes the sting out of the rising cost of living and it delivers better outcomes for people who are often in the most vulnerable position of their lives.I put up a post on my Facebook page about cheaper medicines. Heres just one comment from Shaz:soooo good… Im on a lot of meds so it just makes life easier that it is so cheap to buy.Elise wrote:At a time when things are more expensive and cost of living is really tough, this is such a huge benefit.Of course it is. And we are doing so much more to make medicines cheaper and more accessible.I know how hard it is to remember to go and fill your script every 3½ weeks, when you can only get it once a month. I know what the Minister for Health and Aged Care says about medicine compliance being lowest at the time when you have to fill your scripts. I cant tell you the number of times I might have not been able to take my medicine for a day or two because I forgot to fill my script. I know the difference 60-day dispensing is going to make to vulnerable people who have chronic health conditions—not to mention the vulnerable people with chronic health conditions who are also struggling because they dont earn much money or theyre on a pension. It is going to make the world of difference to those people. Those on the other side can come here with their rhetoric and their ranting and their made-up situations, but we on this side know that the measures were putting in place are making life better for Australians.

365,0,0,0,1,1,"Bell, Angie MP",282981,"Moncrieff","LNP","N/A",2852," Tonight, the Treasurer will stand at the dispatch box and deliver what he claims is a cost-of-living budget—a budget that he says will deliver cost-of-living relief for Australians who need it most. The thing is weve heard that before from this government. We heard it when they promised a $275 reduction to your power bill, when they promised cheaper mortgages and when they promised no changes to super, lower inflation, no higher taxes, no changes to franking credits—the list goes on and on. Every single one of those promises has been broken, and it hasnt even been 12 months. And the cost of living for Australian families continues to rise. Groceries and petrol prices are soaring. Fruits and vegetables have increased in cost by 4.9 per cent and dairy products by a whopping 14.9 per cent. Families simply cant afford it.Its not the only thing that has gone up under this government. The last time Labor was in government, early childhood education fees skyrocketed by 53 per cent in just six years. In the last six months, already, out-of-pocket costs have gone up by 6.5 per cent. In only six months, theyve gone up 6.5 per cent, and lets watch them go up further. Centres are struggling to cover the increasing costs of rent, of food and of wages, which means providers will continue to put their fees up. This leads to higher out-of-pocket costs, leaving families with less money to put food on their tables and to pay those bills.And yet this government continues to promise families they will be better off after 1 July. Its just another broken promise waiting to happen. This government likes to bang on about how they know how hard it is to struggle, that Labor cares about you and that the Prime Minister cares about you. Families are resorting to buying canned food, eating out less, falling behind in their repayments, skipping vital car repairs and even mental health appointments to make ends meet. Its not good enough for Australian families. Charities are inundated with requests for support and assistance, and they simply cant keep up. Families are literally choosing between keeping a roof over their heads and putting food on the table. And while youve been trying to figure out how youre going to pay your bills, the Prime Minister has the gall to say, Its been a good 10 months.Well, maybe it has been a good 10 months for him. He has been gallivanting around the world, taking helicopters to barbecues and partying at lavish weddings, while you are suffering and cant pay your bills. When it comes to the Prime Minister, it doesnt matter what he says; its about what he does, and his actions show time and again that he doesnt care about you or your family. Almost every day of the election campaign, the Prime Minister promised that he would show up and that he would take responsibility. Well, its about time he did that.Unfortunately for many Australian families, this cost-of-living crisis will continue to get worse under Labor. Australian families are making tough decisions about their own budgets. Inflation is eating into Australians pay packets and real wages are going backwards, causing the price of essential household goods and services to skyrocket. This government must show that they are prepared to do the same: to drive down the rate of inflation through budget measures, not a one-off sugar hit. Inflation comes from Canberra; its not coming from Vladimir Putin and its not coming from the war in Ukraine. I know that those opposite like to pretend it comes from somewhere else, but it comes directly from them and their decisions. Unless the government limits spending, Labor will continue to add to the cost of your mortgage, your rent, your groceries and just about everything else Australians are spending their hard-earned money on.Im not holding my breath tonight about the budget for Australians and the cost-of-living crisis. The last time this lot were in government they spent billions on programs like school halls and the pink batts disaster, and cut essential funding for mental health and the PBS. They stopped listing medicines because they ran out of money. It sounds like theyre reading more from their playbook; they have already cut mental health funding at the first opportunity. Its clear: you cant trust Labor to keep their promises. You cant trust Labor to run the economy, and Australians always pay more under Labor.","Cost of Living","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms BELL (Moncrieff) ","(16:23):"
366,0,0,0,1,1,"Sitou, Sally MP",298121,"Reid","ALP","N/A",2853," Two things magically happened on 21 May last year: the Albanese Labor government was elected—very exciting!—and the coalition suddenly realised there was an issue with the cost of living. It was a sudden realisation, because they didnt act on it during the nine years they were in government. Lets examine why their sudden interest in helping with the cost of living is such a charade now.Act No. 1: under the coalition, the cost of child care went up by 41 per cent. Seventy-three thousand families were locked out of child care because they couldnt afford it. What did that mean? It meant kids couldnt get the early education we know is so critical and it meant there were fewer parents heading back into the workforce and contributing to our economy. And, critically, when it comes to the cost of living, it was a hit to household budgets. What is the Albanese Labor government doing to address this? We have reduced the cost of child care for 96 per cent of families across Australia. Approximately 7,800 families in my electorate are going to benefit from this. Over nine years, those opposite allowed the cost of child care to rise and rise. Under the Albanese Labor government, from 1 July we are making child care more affordable.Act No. 2: power prices. This is probably where those opposite really excelled at acting. They acted like they were a government trying to come up with an energy policy. There were 22 attempts, but they couldnt deliver a single one, and, even when they had the chance to provide households with energy relief, they voted against it. Instead of siding with the Australian people, they sided with gas companies. They act like they care about reducing energy prices, but they voted for higher power prices. Contrast that with the Albanese Labor government. We have an energy policy that, first of all, isnt here after 22 attempts, and we are working our way through implementing it. We are upgrading our energy grid to enable more renewable energy to come online. Last year we capped gas and coal prices to shield Australians from the unprecedented international pressures on energy markets. We are acting on climate change and providing households with energy price relief.In tonights budget we are helping five million households and one million businesses with a reduction in energy bills. Those opposite couldnt deliver an energy policy, couldnt give energy certainty and couldnt help with power bills for households. What could they do? And here we come to the final act. Heres one of the few policies they had when they were in government—nine long years, and they had one policy: robodebt. It is extraordinary that those opposite can come into this place and pretend to care about the cost of living when they were the architects of robodebt. It was an illegal and immoral policy that had devastating consequences for the most financially vulnerable in our community—and they knew it. It was those opposite who hounded the most vulnerable with unlawful debt notices, chasing them for debts they did not owe. It was those opposite who decided to play the role of debt collector, scaring Australians who were already right on the edge.Contrast that with the Labor government. In tonights budget we are making it easier for those receiving the single parenting payment and JobSeeker. While those opposite put on the performance of a lifetime and pretend to care about the cost of living, we are actually taking action. For nine years under those opposite the cost of child care skyrocketed. They failed to deliver an energy plan and voted against providing energy price relief, and one of the few policies they had was robodebt. Today is performative. For nine years they did nothing on the cost of living. They may deserve a Gold Logie for their acting job today, but they dont deserve to be in government. That is why they were voted out on 21 May, and thats why they lost the seat of Aston, which is why we have the wonderful new member for Aston, Mary Doyle, amongst our ranks.","Cost of Living","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms SITOU (Reid) ","(16:28):"
367,0,0,0,1,1,"Ware, Jenny MP",300123,"Hughes","LP","N/A",2854," I thank the member for Reid for many of her remarks. I note that she has spoken about acting and Logie awards. I would just draw the Houses attention and the member for Reids attention to the Prime Ministers pledges that were made: household and business energy bills will be cut by $275—thats act 1; a real lasting plan for cheaper electricity and cheaper mortgages—thats act 2; Australians will be better off under a Labor government—thats act 3. When the current Prime Minister was opposition leader, he personally promised $275 power bill cuts no fewer than 97 times during the election campaign. Not only has the Prime Minister broken that promise; he refuses in question time to even answer any questions about power bills, and we saw that again today.The energy crisis affects Australians. It affects Australian families. It affects Australian businesses. Under the Albanese Labor government life has become progressively harder for many Australians.This is despite the Prime Ministers claim only a few months ago that its been a pretty good 10 months for most Australians. Pretty good? Rather than Australians being better off, Australians are paying more in the economy that exists under this Albanese Labor government. Australian families are experiencing the largest fall in their spending power this century, as more and more families struggle with the crippling effects of inflation. Families are even resorting to changing their diets, with one recent report showing two-thirds of people have found it less affordable to eat healthily. This includes Australians buying canned food because they cant afford fresh fruit and vegetables. This is a great shame. More and more Australians are resorting to having meals at home and buying generic brands of food and groceries. Our banks are reporting more Australian families are falling behind on their repayments, and higher-risk customers cant get loans or refinance.Recently, I spoke in this place about Carusos Italian Restaurant, in the Sutherland shire. It was forced to close its doors permanently. They had been in the Sutherland shire for 17 years. Owners Rocky and Kerrin Pitarelli cited rising electricity costs, labour costs and staff shortages as reasons for their closure. More recently, in my electorate, Howling Forest cafes at Kirrawee and Kareela have closed, with proprietors Ange and Chad citing the current economic climate as the reason behind the closure.Last week I visited local businesses in the suburb of Sutherland with the shadow Treasurer. Cafe 2232 owner George explained theyve had to increase their prices by 30 per cent over the past six to eight months. Scotts Florist owner Trudy reported a doubling and tripling of the price of fresh flowers. At Left Bower Cafe, Luke cited rising energy costs and the cost of dairy as issues facing their trade. Mandy from The Beauty Loft stated she had suffered $1,000 in cancellations the last time an interest rate rise was reported. We are seeing more Australians with mental health concerns being forced to cancel appointments with psychologists because they simply cant afford them. Mortgage risk reports are showing more and more Australian towns and suburbs are entering mortgage shock. In my electorate of Hughes, over 22,000 households are mortgage holders. With an average increase of more than $1,400 per month, this is impacting Australian families directly.The key test for tonights budget is whether it will put downward pressure on inflation. The Albanese Labor government should deliver a budget with less spending to tackle its inflation crisis. Inflation comes from Canberra. After almost a year of inaction, Labors budget must make bringing down inflation its No. 1 priority.","Cost of Living","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms WARE (Hughes) ","(16:33):"
368,0,0,0,1,1,"Mascarenhas, Zaneta MP",298800,"Swan","ALP","N/A",2854," Ill start by saying that I know that families and households are doing it really tough at the moment, and its a really challenging time. All households recognise that the cost of living has gone up, and it is an issue that my electorate talks to me about when I go doorknocking. However, I will remind the member for Hughes that, unfortunately, weve wasted a decade, with the coalition asleep at the wheel. A government needs to not only deal with the issues of the day but also plan for the future, and frankly, the coalition government had no plan for the future. The Albanese Labor government is cleaning up this mess.Following the member for Hughess political theatre metaphor, lets reflect on that: act 1, failure of the coalition to balance the budget; act 2, failure to create a single energy policy despite there being over 30 attempts to create a plan and not one effective policy to show for it. Act three: a failure to get wages moving again, and, instead, suggesting that low wage growth is a deliberate design feature of our economic architecture. Youd think the acts would end at the election of the Albanese Labor government, but theres an act four: the failure of the coalition opposition to even hold the seat of Aston. You have to credit their optimism, though. Before racking up $894 billion of debt, they bought themselves these mugs saying, back in black. Theyre the masters of theatrics but not of substance—as Paul Keating would say, All tip, no iceberg, or as Kathleen Studdert from Professionals Australia said, All mug and no coffee.Its no surprise that when we look around the mainland of this country that its wall-to-wall Labor governments, because when it comes to action on the cost of living, Australians cannot trust Liberals. Debt and financial mismanagement is part of the Liberals DNA. In WA, the powerhouse of our economy, we saw a boom squandered and our AAA credit rating lost by the Barnett Liberal government. But, of course, weve seen these characteristics in the previous coalition government. We saw not one or two billion but $13 billion worth of JobKeeper payments go to companies that increased their sales between April and September 2021. This happened without a single thought on whether they should pay this back, and, meanwhile, instead, we had debt collectors relentlessly pursuing individuals for $32 million in JobKeeper for overpayments.Meanwhile, Labor is wanting to have targeted cost-of-living relief, and were being careful to make sure that we dont feed the inflation dragon. Ill talk to what the Albanese Labor government is doing to help the people of Australia. In my electorate of Swan, we saw $442,439 put back into the pocket of those with prescriptions, thanks to our cheaper medicine policy. Tonight in the budget we will deliver further savings to households when it comes to hundreds of medicines. The Albanese Labor Government is easing the cost-of-living pressures for millions of Australians by allowing them to buy two months of eligible medicines for the price of a single prescription. Concession cardholders could save up to $43.80 a year per medicine, while others could save up to $180.Our cheaper child care will benefit 1.2 million families from 1 July. We know that this will help ease the financial stress for families across the country, and 96 per cent of families will be better off financially through our increases to the childcare rebate. Were getting wages moving again. Australians on minimum wage received a 5.1 per cent pay rise at the outset of the Albanese Labor government. I know that some werent prepared to support our lowest paid workers pay increase of $1 an hour. Those on minimum wage have played important roles during the pandemic.The Albanese Labor government supports aged-care workers. Last week the Minister for Aged Care announced an $11.3 billion package to deliver a 15 per cent pay increase to the award wage for aged-care workers. Were doing this because our aged-care workers deserved reward and recognition, for the important, invaluable role that they play in our community. Were working on the job of helping Australia.","Cost of Living","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1/speech[9]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms MASCARENHAS (Swan) ","(16:38):"
369,0,0,0,1,1,"Wolahan, Keith MP",235654,"Menzies","LP","N/A",2855," Before I begin, can I congratulate those opposite, and the new member for Aston, Mary Doyle, on getting elected. That is a significant achievement for her, her campaign team and the Labor Party. But, all of that said, I have been in this parliament for not even a year, but I have been an observer of politics long enough to remember when commentators were talking about wall-to-wall Liberal governments and what that meant. I remember how fleeting that can be, because to be in power, at a state or a federal level, is the gift of the Australian people, and you have to earn that, not only on the day of the election but also on every day after.There is no doubt, for those who will compare notes on the Aston by-election, cost of living was one of top issues. There will be an analysis of what happened—my party will do one and your party will do one, Im sure—but its clear that the people of Melbourne and, probably, the people of Australia, are giving you a chance. Theyre giving you a chance to solve their problems. When they give you a chance, for them, its really giving you a second chance, because when you look at the promises that were made before the last election, those promises have been broken. Youve heard those promises many times over: the several references to $275; the claims of real, lasting plans for cheaper electricity and cheaper mortgages and that Australia would be better off under a Labor government.So youre being given a second chance, and, when youre given a second chance, I say, Dont waste it, because I dont think Australians will give you a third chance. This is it—this is your second chance.Tonight the Treasurer has one job and its to reduce inflation. The reason that thats his most important job is that, at the moment, all that work is being done by the Reserve Bank of Australia—all of it. We can have a tit-for-tat about who is to blame: the previous government, or the last 12 months? And the truth is: its a bit of both. It has to be a bit of both—it would be unreasonable to say otherwise. But what you do is on you, and what you do cant be to leave it all to the Reserve Bank.There has to be a role for fiscal policy, because, when we think back to the latest, or the last, increase by the RBA, that was devastating for Australian families because it caught them off guard. They werent expecting it. The professionals werent expecting it. We saw it in how the market reacted. We saw it in how all of the commentators and all of the media, who are professionals at this, didnt expect it. One of the reasons it happened was that the RBA was addressing something that the government should have been assisting with, and that is core inflation. You can brag about where Australia ranks in inflation around the world, but core inflation—which excludes some of the variable items, of food and resources, which go up and down on a more variable rate—is the inflation that is sticky, that lasts longer and that affects people more. When the RBA saw core inflation being higher here than in any G7 country, then what you were doing, as to fiscal policy, wasnt working, and the RBA had to do it.You may call it a cliche to say its having one foot on the accelerator and one foot on the brake, but it is the most simple metaphor for whats happening. We need fiscal policy. We need the government to be working in tandem with our monetary policy, not counter to it.Today in question time we saw a lot of hubris. We saw a lot of chanting. The responses of Why? were repeated with great enthusiasm today. And we heard the same cliches again, of having inherited a trillion dollars of debt—said to be Liberal debt, even though half of that was inherited from the previous Labor government. And lets just forget that we had a pandemic! Lets forget about that, and lets forget that there were actual responses to that, which included your support of the pandemic debt. Thats just conveniently forgotten. So, yes, debt is a massive problem. And guess what? There is a bipartisan element to that debt. But it is dishonest to ignore the pandemic and the important decisions that were made by the previous government and your support of those. In fact, you didnt just support them; you asked for them to be extended. Debt would be even higher if you actually had been sitting over there during the pandemic.So you have been given a second chance. I say: the Treasurer, tonight, shouldnt waste it, because you wont get a third.","Cost of Living","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1/speech[10]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr WOLAHAN (Menzies) ","(16:43):"
370,0,0,0,1,1,"Khalil, Peter MP",101351,"Wills","ALP","N/A",2856," Tonight, the Albanese Labor government is going to deliver the first budget surplus of an Australian government in 15 years. I hope I havent given anything away, but I think everyone knows! That is remarkable. This is the first surplus since the global financial crisis. It is such an achievement—a significant achievement for the Albanese government in its first year. But, more than that, we are doing this while still delivering targeted relief to assist Australians with the pressures of the cost of living, because we know that the cost of living is front of mind for so many Australians right now.Unlike that mob over there, we are focused on relieving the pressure on Australians doing it tough, because responsible economic management is about investing in our economy and our people. Its about providing sensible, targeted relief whilst making investments that set Australia up for the future. So thats a bit of a contrast to those on the opposition benches. Ive seen the shadow Treasurer, Angus Taylor, doing the rounds this morning with a number of pithy, albeit pathetic, one-liners. He said, A drovers dog could deliver a surplus. That was his line! Well, what does that say for the opposition? Nine years of the previous Liberal government and they were unable to deliver a single one, but he says a drovers dog could deliver it. The poor drovers dog. He gives it a bad name. We should probably replace the Dog on the Tuckerbox on the road to Gundagai with a statue of Angus Taylor. In all his regal, imperious attire, he could be up there on the tuckerbox. It is remarkable that they are making that argument. Its a pathetic argument. In nine years they couldnt deliver one surplus, and weve done it in the first year.They are led now by a leader of the opposition who, as health minister—lets not forget—tried to tax Australians $7 every time they visited a GP, tried to raise the price of every script by $5 and froze the Medicare rebate. Thats the reverse of relief on the cost of living; its the exact reverse of what you should be doing. Is it any surprise he was voted the worst health minister in living memory by Australian doctors?Lets not just criticise. The government is helping so many Australians doing it tough. Its doing a lot, so lets talk about the positives. Weve already delivered cheaper medicines, cutting the maximum co-payment for general patients from $42.50 to $30. This is going to save someone taking a single medicine up to $150 a year. Weve reduced the cost for pensioners and concession cardholders so they will pay no more than $5 a week for all their medicine needs, no matter how many medicines they take. In September we cut the price of more than 2,000 brands of medicine, delivering $130 million back into the pockets of hardworking Australians. And tonight in the budget we will deliver—and youll hear all about it—further savings to households when it comes to hundreds of medicines. For six million Australians well halve their medicine costs, reducing their need to visit the GP and the pharmacist, with $1.6 billion going back into their pockets over the next four years. These are sensible, targeted, measured relief measures that will make a real difference to Australians.Also, when it comes to wages, the government is supporting wage rises for underpaid Australians. We know the best support for Australians struggling with the cost of living is a wage increase. These are wage increases they certainly missed out on under the previous government, who said, in their own words, that wage suppression was a deliberate feature of their economic policy. The Albanese government and the budget will deliver a 15 per cent increase in the minimum wage for many aged-care workers across Australia. The Minister for Aged Care is here, and I note all the work she has done on behalf of the government to make this happen. This is the biggest pay rise for the sector ever. Its never been this big. That is so significant for so many people. A registered nurse could earn up to $196 a week extra or up to $10,000 a year more. It will help address the injustice of underpayment for our nurses and for our aged-care workers, and it will help them with the cost of living. Its practical and its real.Weve also addressed housing. Unfortunately, those on the opposite side and some on the crossbenches are opposing the Housing Australia Future Fund. It is crazy that they are doing that. This is about providing what is most important to Australians: a roof over their heads. And well hear about support for rental housing in the budget tonight.In conclusion, Ive just got to say we are committed to delivering real relief which will ease the cost of living for so many Australians—millions around this country.","Cost of Living","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1/speech[11]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr KHALIL (Wills) ","(16:48):"

374,0,0,0,1,1,"MemberContinuation",278522,"N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Mr BURNS: by leave—Im pleased to present the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights fifth scrutiny report of 2023. In this report, the committee has considered 29 new bills and 172 new legislative instruments and has commented on six of these bills and one legislative instrument.Two of the bills the committee has commented on do not raise human rights concerns. Rather, the committee has chosen to comment on these bills to explain why they appear to be compatible with human rights. This is important, especially on the first bill that I am going to talk about.As part of the Voice debate, there have been a lot of reasons and debating points put forward as to why the no campaign should prevail, and one of those false points has been around the rights of those being activated by an institution such as the Voice. The committee has inquired, and, as per the excellent advice that we have received from human rights experts and lawyers, any claim that one group would be disadvantaged or discriminated against by the Voice is unfounded; it has no substance, and Im going to talk about that right now.The committee has commented on the Constitution Alteration (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice) Bill 2023. The committee considers this bill promotes the right to take part in public affairs by facilitating the holding of a referendum. The committee also considers that if a voice to parliament were established, this would promote the right of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to participate in public affairs, the right to self-determination and the right to equality and nondiscrimination and is therefore compatible with human rights.In relation to the right to equality and nondiscrimination of non-Indigenous Australians, the committee notes that the bill is aimed at achieving the legitimate objective of realising the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and would not negatively affect the ability of other people to enjoy or exercise their rights and freedoms. Let me say that again: the bill is aimed at achieving the legitimate objective of realising the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and would not negatively affect the ability of other people to enjoy or exercise their rights and freedoms. The committee therefore considers the bill to be compatible with the right to equality and nondiscrimination.The committee has also commented on the Family Law Amendment Bill, which seeks to make numerous amendments to the family law system. The committee notes that several measures contained in the bill would promote human rights, particularly the rights of the child, culture, and equality and nondiscrimination. There are, however, also some measures that would limit certain rights. The committee considers these limitations would be permissible as a matter of international human rights law.In this report, the committee has also conducted its consideration of three matters raised previously. In particular, the committee has considered the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Income Management Reform) Bill 2023 and two related legislative instruments, which seek to extend all measures relating to income management and to the enhanced income management regime. The committee considers that providing participants with access to a bank account and associated debit card that offers superior technology and improved banking functions would be a positive measure. However, for many years the committee has raised human rights concerns regarding mandatory income management. Noting the inadequate safeguards and insufficient flexibility to consider individual circumstances, the committee considers this legislation does risk limiting the rights to social security, privacy, equality and nondiscrimination, and the rights of the child. The committee also thanks the minister for her engagement with the committee on this matter.Finally, the committee has concluded its consideration of the Social Security (Tables for the Assessment of Work-related Impairment for Disability Support Pension) Determination 2023. This instrument sets out the rules for assessing whether a person meets work-related impairment levels for assessing eligibility for the disability support pension. The committee has raised concerns about the compatibility of this tool with the rights to equality and nondiscrimination, social security and adequate standard of living for those who are not eligible for the DSP and draws these concerns to the attention of the parliament.With these comments, I once again, on behalf of the committee members, thank the hardworking staff of our committee; they are first-class public servants. I commend the committees human rights scrutiny report 5 of 2023 to the House.","Human Rights Joint Committee","COMMITTEES","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2/speech/talk.text/body/p[3]","N/A","N/A"

In fact, after the acknowledgement of country and prayers, the presentation of petitions is the very first item of business in the sitting week—emphasising the importance of petitions as a way for Australian citizens and residents to directly make a request of the House of Representatives. When the House doesnt meet on a Monday of a sitting week, petitions are not usually presented by the Petitions Committee. I note that individual members may also present petitions on behalf of their constituents.But given that the House has not met for several weeks, the Petitions Committee agreed to seek leave to present petitions and ministers responses at a different time than usual. Today Ive presented 55 petitions and 31 ministerial responses to petitions previously presented. Importantly, this presentation allows for the petitions to be referred to the relevant minister for a response without undue delay, and for the ministerial responses to be provided to the petitioners and published on the parliamentary website.

379,0,0,0,1,1,"Wood, Jason MP","E0F","La Trobe","LP","N/A",2888," I am in continuation. I was speaking about schedule 4, headed Independent childrens lawyers. Schedule 4 of the Family Law Amendment Bill 2023 deals with independent childrens lawyers and would establish a requirement to meet with children over the age of five unless there are exceptional circumstances. However, as with other parts of this bill, it must be road tested. How will it affect the work of independent childrens lawyers in remote and rural areas? How does a child communicate that they do not want to meet? Does that need to come through a parent? These are significant practical real-world issues.Schedule 5 of the bill is headed Case management and procedure. Among other things, schedule 5 introduces new harmful proceedings orders to prevent a vexatious litigant from filling and serving new applications without first obtaining leave from the court. It also includes a new overarching purpose for the family practice and procedure provisions. As with other parts of the bill, while the intent is sound as a matter of principle, the measures warrant examination. For example, while we welcome clarifying that family law procedures should promote safety, the Law Council rightly argues that family law should aim to minimise acrimony.Schedule 6 of the bill is headed Communications of details of family law proceedings. Schedule 6 of the bill redrafts section 121 of the Family Law Act to clarify restrictions around public communication of family law proceedings. This is a redrafting of provisions that prevent people from publishing the details of family law proceedings. As with other parts of the bill, there are questions worth exploring: for example, is it appropriate for the bill to protect professional expert witnesses?Schedule 7 of the bill is headed Family report writers. Schedule 7 deals with family report writers. The most notable part of the schedule is the suggestion that the government could set mandatory standards and requirements in regulations. The importance of consistency in standards of practice is rightly acknowledged, but, as the Law Council and others have pointed out, it is unclear what the practical implications will be.Schedule 8 of the bill is headed Review of operation of the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Act 2021. Schedule 8 is a surprise last-minute amendment on which the government chose not to consult. It brings forward the date for the review of the merger of the Federal Circuit Court of Australia and the Family Court of Australia by two years. Instead of giving the Federal Circuit and Family Court a reasonable period to bed down the merger, the Attorney has, unannounced, chosen to bring the review date forward by two years, to the end of this parliamentary term. One would be forgiven for thinking this is a cynical attempt by the Attorney-General to leave open the doorway to relitigate the merger of the courts as an election issue in 2025. We reject that type of optimism. Changes to family law systems should aim to reduce the pain, costs and time associated with separation. It should not be a place of political pride.Schedule 9 of the bill is headed Dual appointments. Schedule 9 deals with dual appointments to the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia and the Family Court of Western Australia.In conclusion, the coalition agrees with the intent behind many of the measures in this bill, but the bill is not yet in a position where the coalition can support it. The problems are well recognised, but we are concerned that the solutions have not adequately been tested or will go further than is needed. These are not the sorts of changes that warrant simply being waved through. We will support the bill going to a committee for careful scrutiny. Ideally, the committee hearing would have already happened before the second reading debate. We should already have heard, for example, from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities about how the measures in this bill will affect them on the ground before the bill is debated in this place. Its a shame that the government has chosen to progress the bill in this way. This bill warrants a very careful and public examination through a parliamentary inquiry so Australians can develop an informed view on whether the changes in this bill do what they are intended to do. The coalition will settle its final position on the bill in light of those public hearings and committee evidence.Debate adjourned.","Family Law Amendment Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr WOOD (La Trobe) ","(17:00):"
380,0,0,0,1,1,"Fletcher, Paul MP","L6B","Bradfield","LP","N/A",2888," I rise to speak on the Family Law Amendment (Information Sharing) Bill 2023. The coalition welcomes this bill. It is the culmination of work started under the former coalition government to ensure that family courts have the information they need when making orders in parenting matters.The coalition has a strong record when it comes to improving interaction between the child protection and family law systems. In the 2019-20 budget, funding was provided to co-locate state and territory family safety officials in family law courts to improve information sharing between the family law, family violence and child protection systems. After the Australian Law Reform Commission handed down its report Family law for the future, the coalition agreed with the recommendation that there should be a national information-sharing framework implemented. The framework that came out of the Australian Law Reform Commission report was intended to guide the sharing of information about the safety, welfare and wellbeing of families and children between the family law, family violence and child protection systems.That work progressed in partnership with all jurisdictions through the Council of Attorneys-General and its successor bodies. In November 2021, it resulted in the endorsement by Commonwealth, state and territory governments of the National Strategic Framework for Information Sharing between the Family Law and Family Violence and Child Protection Systems. The objective of the national framework was very clear:The objective of the National Framework is to promote the safety and wellbeing of adults and children affected by family violence, child abuse and neglect, and support informed and appropriate decision-making in circumstances where there is, or may be, a risk of family violence, child abuse or neglect.One of the features of the national framework was a shift away from subpoenas issued by the parties to a family law dispute. Instead, the framework moved towards targeted requests for information and court initiated orders. Rather than relying on parties to issue subpoenas, the framework was intended to empower courts to access family safety information. To facilitate early and streamlined information sharing, it proposed a new form of order, referred to as a short-form order, to ascertain whether a state or territory agency holds information that would inform decision-making and to give an indication of the nature and extent of the risk or records held as well as the involvement of the respondent agency.Importantly, the national framework, which was endorsed in November 2021, envisaged a broad range of state and territory agencies would be information-sharing agencies. It expressly included state and territory child protection or child welfare departments and state and territory policing agencies and firearms registries, but it also envisaged flexibility to include other bodies in the future. This could see the inclusion of state and territory corrections or youth justice bodies and even non-government organisations, such as specialist family violence services, participating in the scheme. This was intended to give effect to the principle that if an individuals safety is a concern in a matter before a court all relevant information should be before that court to ensure decision-making is fully informed. The coalition is pleased to see that those factors are reflected in this bill.This bill achieves four main things. First, it introduces two different types of information-sharing orders: both a short-form order, which is called an order for particulars, and an order to produce those documents or information. These provisions replace the existing, more limited information-sharing provision in the Family Law Act.Second, the bill allows the family law courts to obtain a broader range of information than is possible under existing information-sharing arrangements. This recognises that family violence and child abuse and neglect are complex, can take a number of different forms and can impact children even if not directed at them. Family courts should not be unduly limited in the information they take into account when making parenting orders.Third, it expressly outlines legal exclusions to information sharing, such as documents that are privileged or information that would endanger a person if disclosed. Fourth, it restricts the issue of subpoenas without leave of the court. In circumstances where an information-sharing order requiring the production of documents has already been made, the bill says that a party can only issue a subpoena with leave. This is intended to reduce duplication of information requests and avoid the cost and time associated with subpoena processes.The bill will rely heavily on regulations firstly to prescribe state and territory bodies as information-sharing agencies that can be directed to produce information and secondly to create rules around the production, storage, disclosure and disposal of information. This is in line with the approach envisaged by the national framework. The bill also establishes a requirement to conduct a statutory review within 12 months after the commencement of the scheme.We know that far too many family law disputes involve family violence, and this, of course, can have a devastating and long-term impact. We also know that situations can change quickly while a family law matter is progressing through the courts. The information that was put before the court six months ago might not be the information the court needs to make the best possible orders today. A joined-up approach between the family law, family violence and child protection systems is one way to combat this situation, and this bill is a welcome development. I commend the bill to the House.Debate adjourned.","Family Law Amendment (Information Sharing) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr FLETCHER (Bradfield—Manager of Opposition Business) ","(17:04):"
381,0,0,0,1,1,"Fletcher, Paul MP","L6B","Bradfield","LP","N/A",2890," I rise to speak on the Crimes and Other Legislation Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 2023. The coalition is supportive of the intent of this bill. It is, however, ironic, given that this bill makes changes to a range of Commonwealth statutes that relate to law enforcement, oversight and related judicial processes, that the scrutiny processes around the bill itself have been less than satisfactory.This bill should have been referred in its entirety to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, the PJCIS, for scrutiny. It remains unclear why this did not happen. Instead, only a single technical provision of the bill relating to a change in the name of the South Australian Independent Commission Against Corruption was referred to the PJCIS. Understandably, the PJCIS declined to conduct an inquiry into an inconsequential amendment. It now seems that at the eleventh hour the government has realised its error and, at the urging of the coalition, will subject this bill to further scrutiny.It is important that such a process of scrutiny is conducted because, while much of the bill is procedural, we are dealing with important and complicated matters relating to national security and criminal law, and there are some substantive changes. Any time that proposed legislation touches on such pieces of legislation as the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act or the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act, as this bill does, it should be subject to careful scrutiny from a parliamentary committee such as the PJCIS to examine how the proposed changes will work in practice. Changes to legislation in these areas are too important not to put them through an appropriate process of scrutiny to understand any issues which may arise. The only way to do this is to hear from the agencies likely to be affected by the legislation. None of us, Im sure, would want to see any unintended consequences baked into these acts.The Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act allows eligible judges or nominated members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to issue warrants, orders and approvals to use certain covert or coercive investigative powers. To provide oversight to this process, the governments of Victoria and Queensland have established public interest monitors, who can appear at hearings of applications for warrants and essentially act as a contradictor. The current legislation, however, prevents those public interest monitors from making submissions in relation to what are called part 5.3 supervisory orders—these are control orders, extended supervision orders and interim supervision orders—issued under part 5.3 of the Criminal Code, including orders being issued in relation to matters concerning terrorist offenders. The provisions in schedule 8 of this bill before the House will allow the public interest monitors in Victoria and Queensland to make submissions relating to part 5.3 supervisory orders. On the information available to the coalition it is unclear what impact, if any, this would have on those regimes. Of course, that would be an appropriate matter for a parliamentary committee to consider.The bill before the House will also amend the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act to close a loophole relating to the obligation imposed on reporting entities to register with AUSTRAC. Currently that obligation can only be enforced if AUSTRAC becomes aware of the failure to register within 12 months of the contravention. In addition, the amendments in schedule 1 will clarify that sensitive AUSTRAC information that is shared with partner agencies cannot then be produced to courts and tribunals by those agencies.Finally, the amendments in schedule 1 will authorise the AUSTRAC chief executive officer to use computer programs, including automated programs, to take non-adverse administrative actions, such as registration renewals. Explanatory materials note the need for sophisticated internal business rules and quality assurance and refer to high-risk decisions. It is again unclear what new risks, if any, would result from these changes, noting that the stated intention is to create efficiencies for AUSTRAC and for regulated entities. Again these provisions would benefit from the scrutiny that a parliamentary committee could provide.Amendments to the Foreign Evidence Act in schedule 5 of the bill will mean that foreign evidence is no longer required to be certified by a judge, magistrate or officer of the relevant country. Instead, the new provisions will provide that testimony can also be signed or certified by a person authorised to administer an oath or affirmation or put a person under an obligation to tell the truth in or of the foreign country to which the request was made. The effect of this change will be that foreign evidence will be admissible in a wider range of circumstances.Amendments proposed in schedule 6 of the bill will provide the Attorney-General with a discretionary power to refuse consent to a request or an application for transfer to or from Australia at an earlier stage in the process. This is intended to reduce procedural overheads associated with the international prisoner transfer process. Once again it would be appropriate for a parliamentary committee, such as the PJCIS, to scrutinise this proposed change.Changes in schedule 9 of the bill before the House will allow the commissioner to suspend a persons participation in the National Witness Protection Program in circumstances where the participant requests it or where the commissioner forms the view that the participant has done or intends to do something that would limit their ability to protect and assist the participant. As is the case with the other changes of which I have spoken, scrutiny of this proposed change by a parliamentary committee would be desirable.I repeat my earlier statement that the coalition are in agreement with the intent of the bill which is before the House. We will not oppose this bill, subject only to the evidence that comes out of a committee inquiry. I do state the principle that senators and members should not be asked to make changes to Australias national security legislation or important parts of the Crimes Act without a full understanding of the impact of those changes. It is necessary and appropriate that members of this place and of the Senate are in a position to be fully informed about the effect of changes that would be made by legislation that we are asked to vote upon. It is for that reason that the coalition believes it is appropriate that the bill, in its totality, should be subject to review by a parliamentary committee, such as the PJCIS. I repeat that while the coalition is supportive of the intent of this bill, naturally we would consider the evidence that comes out of the appropriate parliamentary inquiry in finalising that position.Debate adjourned.","Crimes and Other Legislation Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr FLETCHER (Bradfield—Manager of Opposition Business) ","(17:12):"
382,0,0,0,1,1,"Sukkar, Michael MP",242515,"Deakin","LP","N/A",2891," The coalition will be supporting the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Child Support Measures) Bill 2023. This bill works to improve debt recovery and help prevent future debts for low-income parents. It therefore will have the coalitions support. In fact, two of the measures in the bill are measures that were previously announced by the former coalition government as part of the 2021-22 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook that were not legislated prior to the last federal election. These coalition measures strengthen Australias child support framework, and it is pleasing to see the current government recognise the hard work of the former minister in this area by legislating these very important reforms.The former coalition government committed $7.8 million to strengthening child support compliance activities, enabling child support debts to be recovered in a wider range of circumstances. This included allowing Services Australia to dock parents pay to repay child support in more circumstances, including after a child turns 18, which overturns the existing loophole where it is effectively case closed once a child turns 18. At that point, there are limited ways to recover a debt.The former coalition government also worked to strengthen the departure prohibition order system, which prevents parents who fail to pay child support from leaving Australia. This is another measure within the bill before us today. The coalition government again worked to give Services Australia discretion in those circumstances to refuse an exemption if they have reason to believe the parent is likely to shirk their responsibilities and fail to pay back the remainder of the debt when they return to Australia. Under the coalition, since July 2017 5,394 parents were issued with a travel ban, enabling the recovery of nearly $100 million and ensuring to a greater extent the wellbeing and economic security of those children who were affected by the relevant family breakdown. Its expected that these changes will recover up to $164 million in debt owed to parents and their children.We understand that family breakdowns are incredibly difficult, so child support is in place to ensure that, no matter where or with whom they live, children that are affected by family breakdown remain to the greatest extent financially secure. We make no apologies for employing and indeed putting on the table these tough measures to ensure that child support is paid, because, again, parents who shirk their responsibilities are just depriving their own children of the financial support that will ultimately give them a better life. We recognise that most parents do the right thing and fulfil their child support obligations. Since its introduction in 1988, the government has transferred a remarkable $33 billion in child support payments. When parents dont pay their child support on time, we all know in this place that it has a real and material impact on the financial security of single parents and their children. These measures will therefore go some way to closing loopholes and providing Services Australia with additional capabilities to stop those seeking to shirk their responsibility and ultimately to provide for their children—to provide the support that they deserve and need. The coalition remains committed, just as we were when in government, to seeing parents and children receive the financial support theyre entitled to. For that reason, well commend the government and commend and support this bill in this chamber and in the other place.","Social Services Legislation Amendment (Child Support Measures) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr SUKKAR (Deakin) ","(17:20):"
383,0,0,0,1,1,"Thwaites, Kate MP",282212,"Jagajaga","ALP","N/A",2891," This bill, the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Child Support Measures) Bill 2023, has the potential to make a really significant difference in the lives of children and families in all of our communities. It is positive to hear that those opposite support the bill, because Im sure that many in this chamber have constituents who have come to them over the years frustrated and upset with the child support system, asking for our support for a way through. The truth is that we havent seen a lot of reform in this area, so this reform is a positive step and a step in the right direction, and our government has signalled that there is more to come. We do know that every child support case is different. Everyone has a different set of circumstances. Of course, some people who pay or receive child support do so without encountering any issues. It is a really important system, set up to ensure the best interests of and the best futures for children.But its those occasions when we know that the system hasnt worked or isnt working that tell us that we need to look at how we can make things better. When we heard the stories of parents whove suffered financial abuse, including through missing or misrepresented levels of child support payments, our government knew we had to make changes. Those of us in this place who have the opportunity to make these changes to improve the way these systems, which are so important in peoples lives, work owe it to the people in our community, to their kids and in fact also to the people who administer these systems—all those people working at Services Australia—to help make the child support system in this country work as well as it can. Im well aware that often there are not easy fixes for some of the issues encountered in this space, but it is really heartening to know that we have a minister and a government that arent shying away from changes to the child support system that will help deliver fairer outcomes for separated families. This is important work.This bill will help improve the timely collection of child support owed to parents and help prevent future debt for low-income parents. We know child support is a big system. In the last financial year alone, $3.7 billion in child support payments was transferred between 1.3 million parents for 1.1 million children in Australia. In this bill, our government are proposing three key changes. We are expanding employer withholding, tightening the arrangements around departure prohibition orders and improving income accuracy for low-income parents. These represent the start of reforms of child support in this country that our government will deliver. As Ive said, child support is a complex system; it has a lot of variability in it and, of course, people have variability in their circumstances. No one model is ever going to fit every family and their circumstances. So we cant promise that the changes being introduced will sort every issue or will make the change that every single family is looking for, but we do know this will make an important difference for many families.I, like many in this chamber, Im sure, have had people in my community contact my office with a range of issues relating to child support. There are certainly some consistent themes that I can draw out from the contact. They include confusion about the way the system works, the structure of child support and the assistance that can be provided under that system. People have also pointed out to me the difficulty they find in getting the help they need when payments arent coming through as expected. Consistency of payments is another concern, and Im really pleased to see that one of the features of the bill were debating today will help see child support paid on time, providing that certainty that we all know is so important in our lives and affects what budget a parent has to work with in any given week.We know theres more to be done beyond the changes being introduced in this bill. Our government is very much aware of the scale of the task to make the child support system work better. We know that many people who pay or receive child support do the right thing. As I said, in many cases the system works as it should. But, for the people it unfortunately doesnt work for, we need to make sure there are strict measures in place so that, wherever possible, parents and kids are getting the child support theyre owed.We know for a fact that some parents deliberately avoid paying child support or deliberately misrepresent their earnings to avoid paying as much child support as they should. In many cases this kind of behaviour can be a form of financial control and abuse. It can be used against former partners and ultimately, of course, leaves children and the parents caring for them worse off, sometimes with some quite significant repercussions. From conversations Ive had with some parents—and again Im sure others have also had these conversations—I know it is particularly difficult for those who have left abusive partners and now find theyre experiencing continued trauma as a result of child support being withheld. I do note the important work of the family law inquiry that was conducted in the 46th Parliament and brought renewed focus to these kinds of issues, as well as other relevant parliamentary inquiries that have highlighted how interwoven some of these issues are, including the family, domestic and sexual violence inquiry I was a member of in the previous parliament. We do know financial security is a serious problem in these areas and it disproportionally affects women.At the beginning of this year our government outlined in its response to the family law inquiry the work well be doing this year and beyond to improve the operations of the child support system in our country. We are strongly committed to seeing single parents and the children they are raising receive the financial support they are entitled to. Thats what this system should do. We are mindful of making sure that Services Australia and other government services dont inadvertently make financial abuse or other forms of abuse worse, and were reviewing compliance, collection and enforcement. That is in no way a reflection on the people who do this work. It is difficult work, and they do it well. What were looking at are the structures and rules that support them to do this work.This year the government will establish a child support consultation group, a group providing important input on issues being faced by parents and families, as well as a child support expert panel, which will consider the child support formula and whether it can more accurately represent the costs parents face today in raising kids. We will also support an evaluation of separated families to see what more should be done to support parents in situations where private collection arrangements have broken down, and well commission research looking at the costs facing separated parents. All of this will help us continue to reform this very important system.In this bill there are, as I said, a number of significant changes. The first change in this bill is extending employer withholding, which is the default method of paying child support and is an effective way to collect support. Last financial year, employer withholding enabled the collection of $743 million in child support from 91,000 parents. The changes were introducing in this bill will improve the active collection of child support debt in cases which have ended by extending the circumstances where Services Australia can deduct child support from a parents wages. It will help to ensure that child support is paid on time, giving parents the financial resources they need to meet the week-to-week costs that come with raising their kids. Currently, employer withholding can only be initiated in active child support cases, cases where there is an ongoing obligation for child support. The bill before us fixes that. It enables Services Australia to use employer withholding to collect child support debts in any case, including those where the case has ended.An example of this might be where a case has been active and then, of course, a child turns 18 and the case ends. That scenario sounds reasonable, but, in fact, it means that in some cases the receiving parent is still owed a debt by the other parent, but they cant take any action, because there isnt an active child support case. What we have here is a sensible proposition that, even if the case has ended, theres still the debt and it should be paid. We estimate this will recover up to $154 million owed in unpaid child support from a pool of around 18,000 parents. With an average debt of nearly $11,000 owing to the receiving parent we can see how this will make a big difference to families lives.The second change is tightening departure prohibition orders targeted at parents who deliberately and repeatedly avoid their child support obligations. Parents with a departure prohibition order will no longer be able to offer a refundable financial security like a bond to qualify for exemption, unless Services Australia is satisfied that they will make satisfactory arrangements to repay their child support debt within an appropriate period. This makes these rules clearer across families. It means if a parent returns to Australia they get that bond back, regardless of whether they repay the child support debt theyre meant to. Under the current system, if the parent owing child support is someone of reasonably good financial means and can provide a bond, they can travel overseas while continuing to actively avoid their legal obligations to pay that child support, meaning that those children miss out. In this case, we are closing down a loophole that should be shut down. Parents who owe child support shouldnt be able to exploit a pathway like this to avoid paying up. The changes will enable Services Australia to refuse an exemption to allow overseas travel even if someone has a bond or other form of financial security to offer. On this measure, the data tells us there is a smaller number of families involved—about 110 parents are in this situation—but its worth highlighting this small group of parents each have quite a substantial debt pool, averaging $43,500 each.The third change is on improving income accuracy for around 150,000 low-income parents. This will help prevent debts in circumstances where low-income parents on income support are not required to lodge a tax return. The change will allow Services Australia to deem the parents adjustable taxable income to be equal to the self-support amount. We sometimes see at the moment inaccurate income estimates putting parents on lower incomes into a tough position financially—and these are people who are already in a tough position. It can result in a parent receiving less child support than they should or in fact being liable to pay more child support than they are able to. From 1 July this year, subject to the passage of this legislation, a parent who lodges a return not necessary form and does not provide income information to Services Australia will have a provisional income created for them by Services Australia that is equal to their self-support amount, and thats the amount of money the parent receiving the child support needs to ensure they can get by with their own living expenses. This will be an important improvement on the current situation, where Services Australia may be applying a provisional income figure to the parent being assessed that is significantly higher than the actual figure. Again, we know this will make a real difference to families who rely on this system and who want it to be as accurate as possible. It will bolster our existing efforts to ensure that child support information is accurate, and it reflects the up-to-date earnings data of families.Child support is too important a system to leave as it is at the moment. As Ive said, it is a system that, for many families, works in a reasonable way, and many families are satisfied with the measures and the way the system currently works for them. But there are certainly many families who have difficulties with this system, and we know that in many cases it is women who are suffering as a result of some of the problems that remain in the system. We know that there are opportunities for the system to be used to further financial abuse in relationships where there has been abuse. We know that sometimes the system is not operating as it should to give children the support they should have through life. For all those reasons, this is an important bill. It is an important first step in the commitments our government has made to make this a better system for Australian families, to understand how the system should work in their interest. We recognise the need to reform the system for the sake of parents and children. Parents and children deserve a system that is fit for purpose and effective. We know there is much more work to do, and I look forward to working with the minister, colleagues and other members of the parliament—to doing that work and to continuing to talk with members of my community, who, I know, have a personal interest in this and an understanding of some of the difficulties it can place people in.To all those people in my community—I have seen quite a few of them recently—I say: this bill is a statement of our faith as a government. We are intending to make this a system that works better for Australian families. This is the first step, and there is more to come.","Social Services Legislation Amendment (Child Support Measures) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms THWAITES (Jagajaga) ","(17:24):"
384,0,0,0,1,1,"Coker, Libby MP",263547,"Corangamite","ALP","N/A",2894," Labor has a proud history of improving the lives of Australian children and their families. It was a Labor government that introduced paid parental leave. It was a Labor government that launched the first National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children. And it was a Labor government that legislated child support in 1988. Today we introduce the next stage of child support measures, to ensure that all children are given the financial support they deserve. Under the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Child Support Measures) Bill 2023, loopholes will be closed and more than $160 million of unpaid child support will be recovered and returned to single parents and their children who need it. What we know is that right now there are 18,000 parents who are not paying child support. This means, on average, that 18,000 children are missing out on $11,000 which they are each entitled to receive. This $11,000 could be for schoolbooks, new school shoes, the school excursion or to help put food on the table and pay the bills.As a former teacher in outer Melbourne and Geelong, I know just how challenging it can be for single parents and their children. Child support matters. I saw firsthand how teachers go above and beyond for their students by making sure they have eaten breakfast, have extra help with their homework and return home safely at the end of the day. I continue to hear the stories across my electorate of Corangamite. Breakfast clubs in schools like Leopold Primary School play such an important role in making sure children are looked after. But help like this can only go so far. Its time to fix a system that has not effectively enforced the payment of much-needed child support. This will be non-negotiable under this bill. The Albanese government is determined to help single parents raise their children to the best of their ability, without the anxiety that comes with financial stress. No parent should be forced to choose between paying for petrol for the school pick-up and paying the heating bill.Im proud that our government has always been at the forefront of this reform. Just yesterday, our government announced $1.9 billion over five years to extend parenting payments to those with children up to 14 years of age. Around 110,000 children will benefit from this scheme, with parents to take home more than $176 extra per fortnight through this Albanese government initiative. Its another milestone in Labors history, which at its core is all about improving the lives of family and children. Such reforms remind me of the time when the Hawke government stepped in and introduced the groundbreaking child support scheme to ensure that children affected by family breakdown received adequate and fair financial security. The Albanese government is committed to continuing this work.Quite simply, the median income of parents who receive child support is not enough. It sits at around $33,000 annually, which is less than half of national average earnings. Our government recognises the financial stress facing many single-parent families, and thats why, in conjunction with this bill, were introducing cheaper child care and a number of other measures in tonights budget to help parents get back to work, earn more and pay their bills.This bill supports reform and ensures that other parents contribute to child support cases. I know that most of these other parents try to do the right thing under the scheme. The data shows that over $33 billion in support payments have been made since the schemes introduction in 1988. Despite this, child support debt is way too high. From 1 July, the bill will make it easier for Services Australia to collect child support debts, and it will help prevent further debts for low-income families by delivering three key changes.Firstly, it will strengthen Services Australias powers to collect debts from parents who have not paid their child support. To do this, the bill will expand the circumstances where debts can be deducted directly from a parents wage. For example, when a child turns 18 and the case for child support has ended, Services Australia can retrieve any outstanding child support debt. At a time where financial stress is incredibly high for many young people, this reform will make sure they have the financial security to, say, move out of home or pursue a career.Secondly, it will stop those parents—who are in the minority—who owe child support and exploit the loopholes of the scheme. One such loophole relates to travel bonds. Currently, by providing a bond, parents can get an exemption from payments if they go overseas. The problem is that, once they return, Services Australia cant keep that bond to contribute towards any unpaid support debts. This is not what the scheme is for, and its not what we want for our nations children and single-parent families. This bill will make sure that Services Australia can keep that bond and refuse an exemption for parents who have the means to pay support but choose not to. Not many parents cheat the system in this way, but those who do owe on average more than $43,000 each in child support.Finally, we are addressing the limitations of parental income assessments. Many parents who receive payments make less than $28,000 each year, which means they dont have to lodge a tax return. Without that critical information, Services Australia have to apply a default income assessment for the parent, which in many cases is a wild overestimation of their earnings. This means the guardian parent ends up in a position where they dont receive enough child support. On the flip side, it can also mean the other parent must pay more than they are able to afford. This bill addresses this problem for more than 150,000 parents. This reform will make sure children are better supported by ensuring that parental income assessments better reflect accurate earnings information: parents can advise Services Australia of their actual income at any time, and Services Australia can access information from the Australian Taxation Office.All in all, with this bill, we take the next step towards a better and fairer child support system. We know it will make a substantial difference to the lives of so many families in my electorate, who come to me and talk about this issue. We have listened and we, the Albanese government, are acting. We also recognise that there is more work to do when it comes to improving child support. Thats why our government has committed to this bill and to implementing the recommendations of the report from the Joint Select Committee on Australias Family Law System.Like the Hawke government before us, our government wants to see child support paid in full and on time to make sure that parents have the financial resources they need to meet the costs of supporting a child on an everyday basis. We want to secure a better future for our nations children; we want to take pressure off parents; we want to make sure we take the burden off teachers, friends and family; and, most importantly, we want this generation of children to look back on these years and know that they were looked after and given every opportunity to reach their potential.Debate adjourned.","Social Services Legislation Amendment (Child Support Measures) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms COKER (Corangamite) ","(17:39):"
385,0,0,0,1,1,"Hill, Julian MP",86256,"Bruce","ALP","N/A",2895," I wish to make a statement on behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit concerning the draft budget estimates for the Australian National Audit Office and the Parliamentary Budget Office for 2023-24. Another year, another JCPAA budget statement. It was a big year last year; we got two budgets in. Of course, this statement has a cult following on budget eve, not least amongst the loyal, dedicated staff in the parliamentary liaison office, who are watching avidly. On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present this statement on the draft budget estimates of the Australian National Audit Office, the ANAO, and the Parliamentary Budget Office, the PBO.The committee is required under the Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act 1951 and the Parliamentary Service Act 1999 to consider the draft budget estimates of the ANAO and the PBO and to make recommendations to both houses of parliament regarding these estimates. For context, the requirement to make a statement to the parliament in advance of the budget being handed down by a government is an important transparency measure. It assists the parliament and the public in making a judgement on the adequacy of the budget provided to the ANAO and the PBO through comparison with the requested funding—what those independent entities asked for—and the committees recommendations.For this years budget, both the ANAO and the PBO have sought additional funding. The committee has carefully scrutinised the ANAOs and PBOs draft budget estimates and has resolved to endorse them, subject to further review of the costings and final estimates which may be agreed with the Department of Finance. The committee considers both offices vital in supporting the work of this parliament and in strengthening integrity and transparency in public administration.The ANAO are seeking an additional appropriation. In presenting its draft budget estimates to the committee, the ANAO noted that machinery-of-government changes following the 2022 federal election—in particular the creation of two new departments of state—will mean that additional costs have been incurred for mandatory financial statements and performance statement audits. Those audits have to be done to a particular standard, and theres little to no discretion, therefore, about the need to do them and to fund them. Further cost pressures have also arisen from the additional audit effort required to maintain compliance with audit standard ASA 315 to maintain adequate cybersecurity and data storage, as well as to meet the increased cost of external financial statement auditing capability where it is required to be purchased from the private sector, usually for highly specialist commercial stuff or in surge periods like the end of the financial year. The total funding request—subject to further refinement with the Department of Finance, as I said—is in the order of $14 million over the forward estimates.The committee acknowledges that the government faces difficult fiscal circumstances in determining this years budget and also acknowledges that the ANAO received supplementation in the 2021-22 budget, although that was predominantly for performance statement auditing, a new function, not to deal with these cost pressures. However, the committee considers that additional funding for the ANAO is critical to maintain mandatory standards in financial statement auditing, and without this additional funding the ANAO would be required—forced—to reduce its performance auditing budget. In the committees view the government stands to save much more than it spends by meeting the ANAOs request, because a robust audit function is of critical value to any government, driving, as it does, efficiency and effectiveness throughout the public sector. In that context, the JCPAA endorses the ANAOs budget submission, subject to the ordinary parameter changes and any minor adjustments that may be agreed with the Department of Finance. In essence, the committee recommends that sufficient funding be provided to enable the ANAO to discharge its responsibilities, including rebuilding the performance audit program. Thats the outcome were trying to seek. The numbers always move around a bit, and well make judgements when we see whats in the budget.Finally, the PBOs estimated expenses for 2023-24 amount to $9.613 million, and it expects to meet the majority of its fiscal requirements from this appropriation. However, since its creation just over 10 years ago, the PBO has had a special appropriation fund designed to help it meet unexpected cost pressures. That fund, when established, was initially $6 million—its its cash reserves, if you like—but has run down now to about $1.8 million over the last decade. The PBO is seeking to have the fund replenished to its original level in this years budget. The committee regards the fund as an important element of the PBOs operational independence. It aligns with international standards, and these are really catchy. If you have a sleeping disorder, you could read the international standards for independent fiscal organisations or independent fiscal institutes, and you will find that fiscal independence through having sufficient cash reserves is a good thing to do. The committee regards this fund as an important element, as I said, of their operational independence and joins with the Presiding Officers to endorse the proposed appropriation.I thank the Auditor-General and the Parliamentary Budget Officer for their work in support of the parliament—they work for the parliament on behalf of the parliament—and for their cooperation in our detailed interrogation of their budget estimates. I also thank the JCPAA and committee members for their thoughtful and detailed consideration of these budget requests.I seek leave to present a copy of my statement.Leave granted.","Public Accounts and Audit Joint Committee","COMMITTEES","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr HILL (Bruce) ","(17:48):"

making sure that vital services like Medicare and the National Disability Insurance Scheme are secure, reliable and sustainable; and dealing with immediate, near-term challenges while investing in our long-term national success—seeing our people through the hard times and setting our country up for a better future.Economic o utlookThe global economy is slowing due to persistent inflation, higher interest rates and financial sector strains.Outside of the pandemic and the global financial crisis, the next two years are expected to be the weakest for global growth in over two decades.This will affect us here in Australia.Our economic growth is expected to slow from 3¼ per cent this year to 1½ per cent next year, before recovering to 2¼ per cent in the one after.Despite this, our economy will continue to create jobs, and unemployment is expected to remain low by historical standards—4¼ per cent in 2023-24, 4½ per cent the year after.In this environment, inflation remains our primary economic challenge—it drives rate rises and it erodes real wages—which is why this budget is carefully calibrated to alleviate inflationary pressures, not add to them.Our policies to ease the pressure on households will take three-quarters of a percentage point off inflation in 2023-24, which is expected to fall from six per cent this year to 3¼ per cent next year, returning to the RBAs target band in 2024-25—still higher than wed like for longer than wed like but tracking in the right direction.So, while Australia may have a lot coming at us, we have a lot going for us as well: high prices for the things we sell overseas; a strong, well-regulated, secure banking system; low unemployment; and welcome signs that after a decade of being kept deliberately low, wages are moving again.Wages growth for 2023-24 is now forecast to be four per cent—up a quarter of a percentage point from what was expected in October.This combination of lower than expected inflation and higher wages means that an earlier and stronger return to real wages growth is forecast for 2023-24.D ELIVERING COST-OF-LIVING RELIEFAt the same time, we understand that Australians are under the pump right now.Thats why providing responsible, targeted relief is the No. 1 priority in this budget.Our $14.6 billion cost-of-living plan will:Provide help with power bills.Bring down out-of-pocket health costs.Support vulnerable Australians.Create more affordable housing.And boost wages.Power bill reliefBack in November, gas bills were set to go up by 20 per cent in 2023-24—and electricity bills were set to rise by 36 per cent.This was the high price Australians were slated to pay for the Russian invasion of Ukraine—and a decade of energy policy failure here at home.Our government refused to stand by and let this happen.We took urgent and targeted action, to place a cap on coal and gas prices.And, tonight, we are delivering up to $3 billion in direct energy bill relief for eligible households and small businesses, co-funded with the states and territories.More than five million households will have up to $500 deducted from their power bills in the next financial year—real relief, right off your power bill, right when you need it.Because of our policies, electricity price increases are expected to be around 25 percentage points less than what was projected—and 16 percentage points less for gas.A big part of making sure that energy bills are more affordable into the future is improving the energy efficiency of Australian homes—and not just new builds.Through this budget, we are investing a billion dollars to help provide low-cost loans for double glazing and solar panels and other improvements that will make homes easier—and cheaper—to keep cool in summer and warm in winter.Its a commonsense program that will help family budgets—and reduce emissions.Lower out-of-pocket health costsOur first budget capped the price of medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for around 3.6 million Australians, so that most now pay no more than $30 for the medicines that they need.In our second budget, we are investing $2.2 billion to increase access to life-changing medicines through the PBS.And from September this year, patients will be able to get more of the medicine they need for less money and less hassle.Instead of having to go back to their pharmacist every month, many people with common, chronic illnesses will be able to get two months worth of treatment for over 300 different medicines.This change will save people up to $180 a year.For millions of Australians, the cost of medicines will be cut in half.Supporting Australians doing it toughOur government is proud that in our first year in office 339,000 new jobs have been created.But, even with unemployment at historic lows, we know there are still people struggling to find work and struggling to get by.The pressures on the budget are acute—but as a Labor government we will always strive to help those who need it the most.Thats why, tonight, we announce a $40 per fortnight increase for JobSeeker recipients, plus those on youth allowance, Austudy and other income support payments—helping to deliver a much-needed $4.9 billion boost in support to around 1.1 million Australians looking for work, studying or doing apprenticeships.And we are going further to help the single-biggest group of Australians on JobSeeker—those aged 55 and over.Until now, people aged 60 and over and on payments for a long time have received a higher rate, in recognition of the additional barriers they face finding work.But the truth is, it gets more difficult earlier than that.The majority of people aged 55 and over on JobSeeker are women, many with little to no savings or superannuation, and who are at risk of homelessness.So tonight, were extending the extra support for those aged 60 and over to include Australians aged 55 and over.More help for some of the most vulnerable in our community.In the same spirit, we are expanding parenting payment single, so it will now be available to single parents until their youngest child turns 14, rather than eight.This will provide 57,000 families with an extra $176.90 per fortnight.Over 90 per cent of these parents are single mums; they deserve our respect and support for the incredible job they do.More affordable housingFor too long, secure, affordable housing has been out of reach for too many Australians.Tonight, to help ease the pressure on people feeling the pain of rising rents, we are increasing the maximum rates of Commonwealth rent assistance by 15 per cent.This will provide up to $31 extra a fortnight for people renting in the private market and community housing—the largest increase in more than 30 years.But we know an essential part of the solution to pressures in the housing market is more homes for Australians.Our Housing Accord aims to build one million, new, well-located homes over five years from 2024.Were going to help drive this with a new tax break for build-to-rent projects, cutting the managed investment trust withholding tax from 30 to 15 per cent and by increasing the liability cap of the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation by $2 billion, to support more lending to community housing providers.We want more Australians to know the security of a roof over their head—which is why were also working with the states and territories to improve planning, build more houses and deliver a better deal for renters.For this same reason, implementation of the $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund is critical—to build more of the social and affordable houses that our people need.Action to keep wages movingOur government came to office promising to get wages moving again.Theyre now growing at their fastest rate since 2012.And lets be clear: when it comes to the cost-of-living, fair wages for workers are not the problem—theyre part of the solution.Meaningful and sustainable wages growth is a fundamental feature of an economy that rewards people for their hard work.Thats why weve consistently advocated for low-paid Australians—so they dont go backwards.The Prime Minister has said it many times—the heroes of the pandemic deserve more than our thanks; they deserve fair pay for their vital work.I am proud our budget provides $11.3 billion to fund a 15 per cent increase in award wages, for more than 250,000 aged-care workers.This pay rise will help retain, reward and recruit the hardworking people who care for our loved ones as they grow old.And the message from our government to the aged-care workers of Australia is simple: you deserve every cent.S TRENGTHENING MEDICAREOne of the things that makes this the best country in the world is our shared belief that every Australian should be able to access affordable, reliable health care.But right now, too many people are finding it more and more difficult to see a doctor.The costs are too high.The wait times are too long.And the consultation is too short.Families are being forced into a lose-lose choice between getting the help they need or paying their bills.This robs parents of peace of mind; it puts families under strain.It means more problems go undiagnosed or untreated.And it means our workforce is not as healthy or productive as it could be—and should be.We want to change that with new funding to build eight more of our urgent care clinics so people in regional communities and growing suburbs can see a GP and a further $445 million to enable doctors, nurses and allied health professionals to cooperate for better care, changes that will make it easier for Australians to get essential services at their pharmacy, like vaccinations.And, tonight, I am proud to announce, as a centrepiece of this budget: our Labor government will triple the bulk-billing incentive.This is the biggest increase to the incentive, ever, delivering a $3½ billion boost that will help GPs provide free consultations to around 11.6 million eligible Australians, including children, pensioners and other concession card holders.All of this will help take pressure off our public hospitals and emergency departments, still feeling the strain of a once-in-a-century pandemic.And it will ensure that for millions of people, the quality of your health care is guaranteed not by your credit card but by your Medicare card.LAYING THE FOUNDATIONS FOR GROWTHInvesting in Medicare, helping with the costs of energy and housing, and supporting people most in need are all essential measures to assist Australians under pressure.But we know the best long-term guarantee of rising living standards, stronger wages and a better quality of life is a growing and productive economy.Thats why our budget is underpinned by a plan to modernise our economy and maximise our strengths by:Making Australia a renewable energy superpower, with strong strategic industries in global supply chains.Investing in our people and their skills.And supporting small businesses to innovate and grow.Making Australia a renewable energy superpowerAustralias biggest opportunity for growth and prosperity is the global shift to clean energy.By acting now, our resources, our researchers and our regions can help power the world.Thats why—in tonights budget—we are investing $2 billion in a new Hydrogen Headstart program, so Australia can be a world leader in producing and exporting hydrogen power while reducing our emissions in heavy industry here at home.Hydrogen power means Wollongong, Gladstone and Whyalla can make and export everything from renewable energy to green steel.Seizing these kinds of industrial and economic opportunities will be the biggest driver and determinant of our future prosperity.The government is making the biggest ever investment in Australias energy transformation.This budget allocates $4 billion to realising our future as a renewable energy superpower, bringing the governments total investment to more than $40 billion.This includes part of our $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund, to support the development of green industries, manufacturing and more, and a new capacity investment scheme that will unlock over $10 billion of investment in firmed-up renewable energy projects up and down our east coast.These strategic investments will work in partnership: abundant, affordable renewable energy powering new jobs and new industry in our regions and suburbs, while our safeguard mechanism will encourage business to invest in the path to net zero.Investing in strategic industriesTo realise this vision, were making targeted investments in green industries as well as in technology and other value-adding areas, including:A new Powering Australia industry growth centre to help Australian businesses manufacture renewable technologies.Funding to support the growth of quantum and AI.Plus $286 million of investment in our creative sector.This will create new opportunities across our economy—and so will our historic and vital investment in defence and national security.The AUKUS agreement will directly support 20,000 high-skill, high-wage jobs over the next 30 years in advanced manufacturing, and broaden and deepen our industrial base.Investing in people and their skillsTo make sure all of these jobs and opportunities extend to every part of our country, were investing $3.7 billion for a revamped five-year national skills agreement with the states and territories.And were creating 300,000 fee-free TAFE places to train Australians in critical and emerging sectors.Were expanding access to foundational skills so that all Australians aged over 15 can develop their language, numeracy, and digital skills that they need.And were encouraging more women into apprenticeships through a new Australian Skills Guarantee. Supporting small businessIn this budget we also back Australian small business with:A $20,000 instant asset write-off.A new Small Business Energy Incentive to support investments in power-saving assets.And new help for small businesses to adopt and adapt to digital technology.BROADENING OPPORTUNITYWomens economic equalityWere the first government in Australias history with a majority of women in our ranks.And as the Minister for Finance and Minister for Women often says, we know equality for women is not an add-on, is not a nice-to-have.Its absolutely crucial for our prosperity.Thats why:Weve taken action to close the gender pay gap.Introduced 10 days of paid family and domestic violence leave.Made gender equity an objective of the Fair Work Act—and put a new focus on workers in the care economy.And on 1 July, Australians will begin to benefit from cheaper early childhood education and enhanced paid parental leave.Tonight, we build on this work, by dedicating almost $590 million to the National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children.Investing $72.4 million to retain and recruit more early childhood educators.And by abolishing the punitive ParentsNext program, while getting on with designing a voluntary system that genuinely supports mothers preparing for work.Addressing disadvantage in communitiesAlongside financial support for Australians in need, were also investing in new programs to tackle entrenched disadvantage.Putting our trust in the knowledge and passion of locals to break the chains of intergenerational poverty.I see it in my own community: library programs unlocking the world of learning, sporting clubs building pride, community groups mentoring young people into apprenticeships.Breakthroughs and progress, driven by locals and leaders.Tonight, we back their hard work with a $200 million plan, which includes:Funding place based partnerships.Encouraging evidence based policy, directed at a local level.Investment in projects that are delivering measurable success.A new partnership that will help government and philanthropy to co-ordinate their efforts.In addition, more funding for community organisations so that they can pay their bills, pay their workers—and keep delivering for people in need.This will sit alongside $1.9 billion for First Nations health, housing, education, employment and other essential services.And $250 million for a new Central Australia package to improve safety and provide more opportunities for more people in their communities.STRENGTHENING THE BUDGETFiscal strategyFrom energy bill relief to national defence, manufacturing to Medicare, investments in this budget aim to make Australia more resilient and more secure in uncertain times.Fundamental to this is our responsible economic management and our efforts to put the budget on a much stronger foundation.This budget, weve returned 82 per cent of the extra revenue windfall thats come largely from lower unemployment, stronger jobs and wages growth, and higher prices for key exports.Weve now returned 87 per cent over this budget and the last.Weve also found $17.8 billion in savings and redirected spending—$40 billion over two budgets.And weve limited annual real spending growth to just 0.6 per cent over five years.Because our first two budgets made such a firm commitment to responsibility and restraint, we are now forecasting a small surplus in 2022-23—which would be the first in 15 years.We expect that to be followed by a deficit of $13.9 billion in 2023-24.And, lower deficits across the forward years compared to recent budgets.Leading to a $125.9 billion improvement over five years.And a much lower public debt burden.Gross debt to GDP is now expected to peak lower and earlier at 36.5 per cent of GDP in 2025-26, where it will be $154 billion less than was expected in March 2022.And because we are returning most of the welcome improvement in revenue to the budget, debt will be almost $300 billion lower by the end of the medium term, saving $83 billion in interest costs over the next 12 years.Sustainably funding government servicesWe are expecting one of the biggest turnarounds on record while dealing with a whole host of programs and services that were left without ongoing funding.In October, this meant an additional $4.1 billion in spending.In May, weve had to find another $7½ billion, including:$1½ billion for legacy health funding, and to make sure that Australians retain access to their My Health Record.And more than $800 million to sustainably fund our biosecurity system to keep our farmers and producers secure.Our government is building a strong, sustainable care economy that works for carers and the people they care for, which is why were extending disability support programs and investing in additional home care packages.Were upholding the security of our nation, and the stability of our region, which is why were implementing the recommendations of the Defence Strategic Review and allocating $1.9 billion to strengthening our relationships in the Pacific.And were supporting those who have served and sacrificed, which is why were spending $64.1 million to continue eliminating the claims backlog, so that veterans get faster access to the support they need and deserve.Structural pressuresBeyond the immediate pressures on our budget, there are genuine structural challenges facing us into the future: defence, health, aged care, the NDIS and interest payments on debt.Tonight, were putting in place some modest, but meaningful revenue measures to help address this, like:Tightening superannuation tax concessions for those with balances exceeding $3 million.A 15 per cent global and domestic minimum tax for large multinational companies.Changes to the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax, so that Australians receive a fairer return on the sale of our natural resources sooner.Raising the tax on tobacco by five per cent for three years.And extending tax compliance programs.But the inescapable truth is that the federal government cannot put all the services that Australians expect and deserve on a more sustainable footing by ourselves.Thats why the Prime Minister has brought together the states and territories to agree on a new, cooperative approach—so we can secure the future of essential services and programs that both levels of government support and so we can make sure that the NDIS continues to provide life-changing outcomes for future generations of Australians with a disability.Under Labor, the NDIS is here to stay.We are determined to make sure every dollar counts and every dollar goes to improving the lives of the participants the scheme was established for.Our changes are designed to put the interests of participants first, as we co-operate to moderate growth in costs.It took a Labor Government to create the NDIS and this Labor Government will secure its future.CONCLUSIONA hundred and twenty-two years ago today, the federal parliament first met, called to serve a new nation on an ancient continent, created by a vote of the people.Today Australia is bigger, fairer, more diverse, more open to the world and more engaged with our region than anyone alive at Federation could possibly have imagined.And yet what brought this country together was a belief that the future could belong to Australia and that we would be stronger, safer and more prosperous if we worked together to seize its opportunities and share its rewards—a Commonwealth of common purpose.That optimism and resilience has sustained us and carried us through downturns and disaster, through recession and pandemic.And the belief in opportunity fairly shared has underpinned our greatest achievements, from Medicare to superannuation.The same spirit underpins constitutional recognition through a Voice; it drives our government, and it shapes this budget.A determination to tackle the big challenges and seize the big chances.A deep faith in our people, their skills, their smarts, their innovation and aspiration.This tonight is a plan for security, for prosperity, for growth.Its an economic strategy to help with cost-of-living pressures now and to maximise and extend the opportunities of the future to more of our people in more parts of our country in the defining, decisive decade ahead.For all these reasons, I commend this bill and this budget to the House.Debate adjourned.","Appropriation Bill (No. 1)

I now outline the most significant items provided for in this bill. The Department of Defence will receive nearly $12 billion, which will support the implementation of the governments response to the Defence Strategic Review, including major investments in military capabilities, as well as enabling ICT capabilities and infrastructure. The Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water will receive close to $9 billion, primarily for Rewiring the Nation to continue expanding and modernising Australias electricity grids at lowest cost, unlocking new renewables and storage capacity and driving down power prices.The Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts will receive approximately $4 billion, including funding for government business enterprises to continue to deliver projects, including the ARTC for the Inland Rail program, WSA Co for the Western Sydney international airport and NBN Co for the election commitment to boost fibre and fast-track the NBN repair job.Appropriation Bill (No. 2) also contains an Advance to the Finance Minister provision of $600 million to provide the government with the capacity to allocate additional appropriations for urgent and unforeseen expenditure. Since March 2020, the AFM provisions in annual appropriations acts have been set at an extraordinary level, primarily due to the unique and evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2023-24 bills return the AFM provisions to conventional levels, as the Australian governments have agreed to a strategic framework to support the transition of measures and policies to a sustainable COVID-19 steady state. These measures should reduce the potential call on AFM provisions in the future, and a specific AFM provision for COVID-19 or other national emergency response is no longer required.This bill also sets the debit limits for payments under the Federal Financial Relations Act 2009 that apply in 2023-24. They are as follows: $5 billion for general purpose financial assistance and $35 billion for national partnership payments.Full details of the proposed expenditure are set out in the schedules to the bill, the explanatory memorandum and the portfolio budget statements tabled in the parliament today.

These bills are the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2022-23, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2022-23 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2022-23. These bills underpin the governments expenditure decisions made since the October 2022 budget that relate to the 2022-23 financial year.Appropriation Bill (No. 3) seeks approval for appropriations from the Consolidated Revenue Fund of $5.5 billion. This would ensure that there is sufficient appropriation to cover estimate variations related to existing programs—for instance, changes to costs for demand driven programs. These bills also pave for the first-year costs for measures announced since the October 2022 budget.The bill provides funding to support the following significant items. The Department of Defence will receive $1.8 billion. This primarily reflects the reclassification of $1.3 billion from capital to operating funding, reflecting updated expenditure requirements and supplementation of $172.3 million for foreign exchange losses incurred during 2021-22. The Social Services portfolio will receive over $1 billion, with the majority of funding provided for the National Disability Insurance Agency to provide reasonable and necessary supports for National Disability Insurance Scheme participants. The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations will receive just under $1 billion, primarily to support apprentices and employers through the boosting apprenticeship commencements wage subsidy. The Department of Health and Aged Care will receive close to $900 million, including $207 million for vaccines and logistics, $182 million to reimburse aged-care providers, a direct cost relating to managing the COVID-19 outbreaks, and $166 million for administration of the COVID-19 vaccine.
