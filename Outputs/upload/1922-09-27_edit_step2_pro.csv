5,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"RODGERS, Arthur","KZT","N/A","LP; NAT from 1917","N/A",2724,"- Parliament definitely expressed an opinion in favour of a duty of3s. per cental on South African maize, and the Minister for Defence (Mr. Greene), who was then Minister for Trade and Customs, communicated with the Government of the Union of South Africa advising it of our intention to impose this duty. The South African Government replied immediately that if the duty were imposed it would put an end to the trade agreement between South Africa and the Commonwealth. The balance of the trade between the two Dominions is overwhelmingly in favour of the Commonwealth, the trade from Australia to South Africa in one year being valued at £3,900,000, as against a value of £400,000 for the trade from South Africa to Australia; and it was, therefore, felt that we could not take a step which would mean the ending of the trade agreement between the two countries. The present duty on maize is insufficient to protect the Australian growers of that cereal, and, in my judgment, action should be taken to put them in a proper position. We are now negotiating with the South African Government to bring about reciprocal trade relations between the two countries, and it would be an act of bad faith, at this juncture, to reimpose the duty. But the Government, in making a new arrangement with South Africa, will take into consideration the protection of our maize-growers, and I ask them to accept that assurance. There may be a short interval in which they may not be sufficiently protected, but we shall, as quickly as we can, come to an effective arrangement with South Africa.","IMPORTATION OF MAIZE","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[2]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Honorable members are often under the impression that the administration of measures passed in this Chamber will involve but limited expenditure, and it is discovered later that it has involved the establishment of what in a short time becomes a large Department employing a considerable number of clerical and other hands. I see nothing to prevent that result following the passing of this Bill, and it is a thing that should be guarded against. The clause provides for a secretary and actuary, or an officer who is both secretary and actuary, and I trust that one officer will be appointed to fill both these positions. I hope the Minister will not take it for granted that, because we have agreed to the creation of a small Department for the administration of this Bill, that will justify him, or the Board, in appointing a large number of officials. It may be that, in the initial stages, it will be necessary to appoint a number of temporary hands, and I suggest that they should be taken from some of the other public Departments. After the office for the administration of the Bill is organized, there should be a considerable falling off in the work to be done, and it should be possible to carry it on at very small expense. I hope that the Minister will keep that in mind.","N/A","SUPERANNUATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The staff created for the administration of this Bill will become a big Department unless the Government take action at the outset to make that impossible.

In that way we might minimize the expenditure involved in the appointment of the staff. I hope the Government will not set up a new Department entirely for the purpose of administering the Superannuation Act. It is bound to grow and to become more and more expensive.

At the inception of any such scheme, however, there is inevitably an accumulation of work which must be promptly put in hand.

Before an employee can reach that stage, he must have been retired from the Public Service. This is now done on medical evidence after sick leave has been exhausted. Section 65 of the Public Service Act provides for a Board when necessary. It enacts -If an officer appears to the Commissioner, after a report from the Permanent Head or an Inspector, to be unfit to discharge or incapable of discharging the duties of his office efficiently, the Commissioner, or any Inspector, may refer the question to a Board of Inquiry, and if such Board finds that such officer .is unfit to discharge or incapable of discharging the duties of his office, the Governor-General may, on the recommendation of the Commissioner, deal with such officer, either by calling upon such officer to retire from the PublicService, or by transferring him to some other position; and every such officer, if called upon to retire, shall retire accordingly.When an application comes before the Board for an invalid pension, the matter will have been thoroughly investigated and reported on by a medical officer or by the special Board appointed under the Public Service Act, and the Superannuation Board will have to satisfy itself further, by appointing a medical officer, that the man concerned comes under the provisions of the Superannuation Fund. I do not think that any injustice is likely to arise. There is no necessity to have a medical examination or a Board for retirement, a Board to consider his fitness for service, and a further Board of appeal. It is such a serious thing to deprive a man of his pension that I cannot imagine any Board, with a sense of its duty, acting in an arbitrary way or excluding reasonable evidence.","N/A","SUPERANNUATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[14]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If honorable members had had my experience of the administration of the Old-age and Invalid Pensions Act, they would not hesitate to request the Minister to insert this saving clause. It is possible that, otherwise, some injustice may be done to a member of the Public Service through, perhaps, the inability of a medical officer to properly diagnose his case. As the Bill stands, there is no recourse for the public servants concerned. Let me remind honorable . members of my experience in the Gunner Perry case. It was proved that Gunner Perry was brutally tortured in the military hospital by Dr. Mead, but, fortunately, he was saved when the matter was brought before the military court martial by the testimony of one of the most highly qualified physicians in Melbourne, Dr. Springthorpe, who gave him a letter from Egypt. Much to his disgust, Dr. Mead lost his case, for it was proved on sworn evidence that he had actually tortured this man. Sir Joseph Cook, who was then in opposition in this House, wanted to know why one of the Ministers did not make a personal inquiry into the allegations. I under stand that one did do so privately, and Senator Pearce, who was then Minister for Defence, desired an inquiry, which was held at great expense. Gunner Perry was really under observation for six months in the Lunacy Department, and even then he did not get justice. Subsequently he went to Queensland when there was a great desire for more volunteers, and I understand he was actually employed by the military authorities in that State. Where he is now I do not know. I believe he committed suicide. Neither he, nor the unfortunate girl whom he persuaded to marry him, has been heard of since. If this provision is not inserted in the Bill the only appeal which members of the Public Service will have will be to members of Parliament.","N/A","SUPERANNUATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[21]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If subsequently the report of a medical officer were unfavorable in regard to pension privileges, naturally the Board would ask for further medical testimony.

I brought it under the notice of the Attorney-General at a time when he was very busy. I ask him now whether he will consent to the recommittal of that clause in order to allow this proposal to be dealt with. Sub-clause 2 of clause 12 provides that contributors retiring on and after attaining the age of sixty years, and prior to the maximum age for retirement, may contribute, in a lump sum or in smaller amounts, the actuarial equivalent of the amount necessary to complete his payments up to the maximum age,  at such periods as the Board approves, and it is suggested that these words should be added: or by contribution at an age rate five years in advance of the contributors actual age. The object of this portion of the clause is to provide for a contributor retiring earlier than the maximum age. He may retire at sixty and be entitled to a full pension under the Act provided he contributes the actuarial equivalent of the sum necessary to complete his payments to the maximum age, namely, sixty-five years. It would be impossible for the average contributor to pay this amount in a lump sum, and comparatively heavy payments by way of deduction from a small pension would not leave the pensioner adequate maintenance. The pensioner on a small pension would thus be unable to avail himself of this clause as it stands. The proposed amendment would enable the contributor to pay the additional sum required while he is earning, and would bring the section within reach of the small man at no additional cost to the fund. For instance, a contributor fifty years of age will be required to pay 12s. 5d. per additional unit. If he wished to retire at sixty, for the purpose of contributions to the fund his age would be advanced to fifty-five years, and he would then pay 19s. 6d. per additional unit.","N/A","SUPERANNUATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[22]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It aims at remedying some of the defects which have been found in the original Act, and centres on three main proposals. First, it limits the powers which the Commissioner may exercise without reference to the Minister. As was explained the other night, most of the evils that have fallen on the War Service Homes Department are traceable to the fact that the Commissioner has had practically unrestricted power with regard to administration and the acquisition of land and property. The Bill before us restricts the Commissioners powers in several directions. In the first place, he is limited to expenditures not exceeding £2,000, and is prevented from realizing on properties of the Commission without reference to the Minister. Then the Commissioner is similarly restricted from purchasing existing houses, from building otherwise than by contract, from the disposal of surplus lands, and from compounding with contractors. On these phases of the Bill I do not anticipate there will be much difference of opinion amongst honorable members.Another important feature of the Bill is that it proposes to relieve the soldiers from many of the restrictions that surround the occupancy of houses. Under the existing law, soldiers are unable to sublet, and in cases, of change of address, and so on, they have to realize the property and take their chances of getting other homes* when all other applicants have been satisfied. The Bill will relieve the soldier from all those obligations, and enable him to realize the property, if he so wishes it. In order that this may be done with safety, it is proposed ito ask that a deposit of 5 per cent, on the amount proposed to be advanced by the Commission shall bo made by the applicant before the application is proceeded with.One of the most difficult questions that confronted us in the reorganization of the Department was. that of excess costs. This has proved very difficult of adjustment, and it is inevitable that the Commonwealth will be called upon to dispose of houses at less than the fair cost, if we take into consideration the time at which they were built. Unfortunately, they were built at a time of exceedingly high values for everything that goes into a house, and. far the labour which constructs it. I wish to emphasize that, in every attempt to adjust these conditions, we have endeavoured to act justly to the soldier, without regard to what the cost might be to the Commonwealth-.","N/A","WAR SERVICE HOMES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

164,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"LAMOND, Hector","KZC","N/A","N/A","N/A",2739,"- A heroic attempt has been made to do that; but I am quite convinced that the values we shall attach to the houses will approximate much nearer to the values to-day than the values at the time at which they were erected. The latter, of course, would have been the fair thing to charge to the soldier under the circumstances. In connexion with the adjustment of these excess costs, two or three difficulties arose. In many cases, the soldier had undertaken to pay more than the. statutory amount for his house, and. had not been given a definite amount. In order to meet those cases, wo had to disregard the law to the extent of adding to the capital cost of the houses the various  amounts in excess of £.800, which is the limit laid down in the Act. It would have been impossible for some of the soldiers to. meet an obligation of £50, £75, or £100 in excess costs; and, in order that their houses might be saved to them, in some cases the amount of extra cost was capitalized. In this Bill we seek authority to capitalize the excess costa in this way where the soldier is unable to meet his obligation to pay in the amount of excess in a lump sum.. In a few cases, and very few,, the excess cost of the houses has the effect of increasing the repayments to an extent that the soldier is unable to meet. In those cases, we hope to extend the term of the repayments, although, as a general rule, that is not a wise course to follow. I wish to make it clear that the powers conferred by the Bill in this respect are only to be used in connexion with the adjustment of difficulties arising from excess costs, and are not to apply to the future work of the Commission.","N/A","WAR SERVICE HOMES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Having given careful consideration to the matter, the Board has recommended certain amendments. The Minister has put before us this proposal -Notwithstanding anything contained in the Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation) Act 1921, when the currency of the country of origin or export of any goods dutiable under section 8 of that Act depreciates to less than one-twelfth of its normal par value as compared with the pound sterling, the duty which shall be charged, collected, and paid under that section on the goods shall be such amount as represents the difference between -the landed cost in warehouse in Australia (including duty calculated in accordance with the provisions of the Customs Act 1901-1920) plus a percentage of profit to be determined by the Board, andthe Australian wholesale price of similar goods of Australian manufacture.It is contended that the adoption of that proposal will give the Board sufficient power to deal with the exchange difficulty. Possibly it may, but, as I said on a previous occasion, the effective way of dealing with the difficulty is, in my opinion, to bring the value of goods imported from a country with a depreciated currency to the par of British currency, and then to apply the Tariff to them. All imports, if that method were adopted, would be dealt with in the same way; and so long as the Tariff duties were high enough, Australian industries would be adequately protected. The Government proposal is somewhat different, though practically its effect is the same as would result from the adoption of my suggestion. I have no objection to this proposal, because I realize that it is absolutely needed. There has been a great deal of importation from countries with a depreciated currency. Before we recommenced to trade directly with Germany, a great deal of iron and steel, in the form of bars, rods, blooms, and so on, was imported from Belgium and Germany, where the currencies are depreciated, into Great Britain, given the finishing touches there, and then sent here to the detriment of the Australian iron and steel industry. This has had much to do with the condition of our industry to-day. Under the law as it stands, there is no power to prevent this importation, and now that we are trading direct with Germany, there is still more reason for amending our law, in order to give the Tariff Board power to protect our industries from unfair competition. We were told, on the last occasion when we discussed this matter, that the Customs Department has an organization throughout the world whereby it can gather information regarding costs and prices in countries of origin, and that this information could be used to prevent clumping; but the facts prove, either that that organisation does not exist or that the Tariff Board has been unable to take advantage of it. When we pass laws for the protection of our industries, we should take pains to see that they are not evaded or overridden. There may bc differences of opinion as to the wisdom of imposing certain duties, but once duties are passed they should operate until Parliament makes some change.. It has -been found in many cases that effect has not been given to the will of Parliament, because there has not been the necessary power. In the original Bill, the Minister proposed to allow, in relation to the cost of production, a margin of 20 per cent.; but, at the request of some honorable members, he reduced that margin to 5 per cent. Now he proposes to restore it to 20 per cent., his proposal being as follows : -Where the cost of production mentioned in the last preceding clause is not ascertainable, the Minister may, in lieu of substituting for the fair market value the cost of production estimated from such information as is available, plus 5 per centum of such estimated cost, substitute for the fair market value the cost of production estimated from such information as is available plus such addition, not exceeding 20 per centum of such estimated cost, as is determined by the Tariff Board.Evidently the Tariff Board has found that the original proposal was necessary, and we are now being asked, to restore it. I think that that should be done. There may be room for amending the Ministers proposal, but evidently the Tariff Board must have additional powers. Under the present legislation, all the Board can do is to inquire about the position of industries in Australia, the competition with which they have to contend, and whence it comes; it has not the power to prevent unfair competition. We should be careful not to pass legislation which will allow manufacturers or others to exploit the Australian public; but, on the other hand, we should foster Australian industries to find employment for our own people. To-day thousands of persons are unemployed in the various States, many of whom are without employment because of the importations of goods from countries with a depreciated currency. Australian workmen cannot hope to compete against- cheap foreign labour. Australian products cannot be expected to hold their own against cheaply-produced foreign products, which are often landed here and sold at a price which is lower than the selling price in the country of origin. The standard of living in Australia is so high that our industries cannot compete with the output of cheap wage industries overseas. It has been argued that the item of freight is sufficient to level up costs, but that is not so.. As a matter of fact, goods can be carried from overseas and landed in Western Australia almost as cheaply as goods manufactured on the east coast of the Commonwealth can be conveyed by steamer to the West. We must have legislation which will adequately provide against competition with black-labour products and the output of the far cheaper markets of other parts of the world. Such is the purpose of this Bill;- and, to that extent*, therefore, the Government are to be commended for introducing it. It is unfortunate, however, that the original measure did not make adequate provision. To-day. hops are being imported from America and elsewhere to the serious detriment, particularly, of Tasmanian hop-growers. . Their last years crop is still in cold store, but brewers are importing hops at a lower price than is represented by the Australian cost of production. Australian producers must either be protected or go out of business1. America has  gone dry, and the huge American hop-growing industry has been hard put to it to find outlets for its production. Australian, brewers are helping to provide a market.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF (INDUSTRIES PRESERVATION) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[1]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

That we are beginning to realize this is shown by the very attitude we are taking up in trying to checkmate the influence of our highTariff upon industries within the Commonwealth itself. We are beginning to learn that the high duties afforded to one industry are injuring other industries, and we have the spectacle of the Government, soon after the adoption of the Tariff schedule, bringing down amending resolutions for the purpose of protecting certain primary industries which, it is recognised, have been crippled by the Tariff. It is a case of the dog chasing its tail. I try to regard this matter from the national stand-point. We hear a great deal of talk about creating a standard of living by the enforcement of a high Tariff; but when we have so created a high standard of living, the task is how to maintain it. An article, to which I drew attention this morning when submitting a question without notice, should be taken into serious consideration, because it informs us that the copra trade, formerly held by Australia, has been lost to this country, and the copra does not even touch at any Australian port in passing from its place of production to markets overseas, except that which, because of the provisions of the Navigation Act, must come to us from Papua. It is the Navigation Act which has shut us out from the other and larger portion of the trade in this commodity. This is another outcome of our effort to make Australia self-contained. The Australian Natives Association, which first came into existence in the State of Victoria, where it is now liveliest, has come to realize how the Commonwealth is being injured by a high Protectionist policy, and that this policy is untenable. In fact, at the annual conference of the association held in Perth in July last, the following resolution was carried: -That this Conference recommends the revision of the Tariff with the view of abolishing high protective duties, and substituting therefor bounties to support necessary industries.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF (INDUSTRIES PRESERVATION) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Meat, wool, wheat, maize, oats, vines, dairy produce - all those things on which the Commonwealth depends for existence - are produced in the Argentine Republic in vast quantities. Argentina long since cast off the mantle of romance and donned the garb of industry.We are in the romantic stage in Australia. Contrary to all the principles of trade and industry, we are trying to set up a standard of living that time will show is absolutely untenable. We are feeling it now.

The latter produce them by reducing overhead charges. Argentine has realized her natural facilities for producing wealth, and is getting population into the country. She opened up her land, and facilitated the coming of immigrants, giving them every attention on arrival, and allowing them to bring in free of charge their furniture and implements of production. Implements and tools of trade are on the Tariff free list. The result of this policy is that Argentine is prosperous, and the Melbourne Age asks us to keep our eye on that country. The article continued -In a way, Argentina is Britains protégé and the position is somewhat anomalous, because the Republic is the most determined competitor of the Dominions within the British Empire. It cannot be suggested that Britains interest was purely philanthropic. Colonial investments attracted the financiers, and they have been amply repaid for their enterprise. The great estancias of Argentina produce ever-increasing revenue to swell Britains wealth, and it pays Britain to maintain her hold. The Governments of Argentina have not been blind to the advantages arising from association with Britain. Until the last year or so, they have given every inducement to the foreigner to invest his money there. Right at the birth of the Republic,, the authorities reversed the insane dictum of the Spaniard that foreigners were to be rigidly excluded; and companies formed for the exploitation of Argentine resources were thenceforward given equal status with purely local concerns. At periods taxation was remitted, and compensation was guaranteed for damage to property by roving bands. Land was made available on attractive terms, and everything possible was done to encourage settlement and development. Australia could indeed learn much from the methods of the Argentine.In 1872 the cultivated land consisted of 1,450,000 acres.

221,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"PROWSE, John","KYI","N/A","N/A","N/A",2746,"- Cheap labour or not, the honorable member is dragging Australia in the dust, and the Argentine is out-distancing us in industrial development -Since the total area of Argentina is approximately 1,135,850 square miles, it is apparent that that county has pushed further ahead in development than Australia, which, with an area of 3,000,000 square miles, has approximately 15,000,000 acres under crop. True, the population of Argentina is 10,000,000, as against Australias 5,500,000, but a large portion at the southern end of the Republic is fit for nothing. As in Australia, the pastoral industry has laid the basis for permanent prosperiity,but the Argentine has devoted more attention to cattle than to sheep. This is probably due to the fact that the early Spanish colonists brought cattle there, which formed the nucleus for the vast herds which now graze on the stretching pampas of the territory. The industry, however, never attained great value until the British capitalists took a hand. Britain has been amply repaid.During the war Argentina stood by her and her Allies, and helped towards victory by supplying meat and other foodstuffs for troops and civilians. Many of the greatest beef concerns in the world have vast interests in the Republic, and, in 1920, 4,165,573 quarters of frozen beef was exported, in addition to 581,286 quarters of chilled beef, 1,083,000 carcasses of mutton and 447,652 carcasses of frozen lamb, and great quantities of tinned meat and beef extract. Of the frozen beef, Britain took probably 95 per cent., while the bulk of the other lines also found their way to the British Isles.For a considerable time Argentine was importing more than she was exporting, but her people held to a policy which they knew would turn out right in the end. Their faith has been justified.Exports, therefore, have temporarily slumped. Whereas in 1920 5,029,528 tons of wheat was exported from Argentina, the sales in 1921 reached only 2,000,000 tons, whilst maize exports declined from 3,961,801 tons in 1920 to 2,622,000 tons in 1921. Other lines showed similar decreases. The setback, however, is regarded as being merely temporary, and every effort is now being made to remedy the situation. Her methods are different from those of the Commonwealth. While Australian cattle-breeders have gone on their knees to the Government for financial assistance, the Argentine have been helping themselves. They have instituted a great publicity campaign in the British Isles, and have purchased over 3,000 retail butchers shops for the sale of Argentina meat. One fact on which the Republic can pride itself is that there is a substantial margin of export receipts over expenditure on imports, due partly to increased primary production and partly to the recent move towards the building up of secondary industries. In 1911 the exports amounted to £67,785,000 as against imports totalling £80,202,000, leaving a debit of £12,417,000. But by 1920 the position had been completely reversed, and in that year goods valued at £199,460,000 were exported, whilst the imports, in spite of inflated prices, were worth£ 169,000,000. During recent years an extensive immigration system has been built up, settlers being welcomed from almost every country in the world.Argentina recognises the necessity for immigration, and by the way in which the Government applied themselves to the task of attracting population they set another example to Australia -Received at an enormous hostel at Buenos Ayres, where there is accommodation for 6,000 people, the immigrants are provided with free board and lodging for fifteen days; employment is found for them and their fares and travelling expenses up country are paid. For three years they pay no taxation whatever, and can even import their furniture, tools of trade, and clothing, and other necessaries without payment of duty.Contrast that policy with the action of the Commonwealth Government in charging several hundreds of pounds in duty on each tree tractor imported for use in the group settlements. I believe that duty has since been remitted. I agree with the Age that Australia would do well to keep an eye on Argentina. We should also take a little introspective vision. Last year this Parliament imposed a duty on sulphur, one of the component parts of superphosphates, which are at the very foundation of Australias prosperity. It was a most one-eyed policy. Of course, it is said that the imposition of a duty will stimulate local production, and lead to the supply of manures to the farmers at cheaper prices. But what do the manufacturers of superphosphates say? I quote this letter from Cuming, Smith and Company - 27th April, 1922.The Primary Producers Association of Western Australia,Sutcliffe, Esq., General Secretary,Emanuel Buildings, Perth.Dear Sir, -Price of Super for 1922-23 Season.Yours of 29th ulto. has had our attention, and a copy of same has been sent to our bead office.The question of estimating the cost of next seasons super, will shortly have attention, and we can state that the basis for computing same will, as requested by you, be upon the basis of the variation in cost of raw materials, freight, and charges.In this connexion we would like to point out that the proposed imposition of a duty of 50s. per ton on sulphur will seriously militate against any substantial reduction in the price of next seasons super., and if this duty is imposed it will represent a direct tax upon the agricultural industry.Yours faithfully,For Cuming, Smith & Co.,Perry, Local Manager.It would not be difficult to point out that this impost on sulphur is not the only direct tax on our primary industries which have to compete with our great rival, Argentine. That country has a great advantage over us, inasmuch as she is three weeks nearer the worlds markets, and the Government in imposing these burdens on our. primary industries are taking steps which they will have to retrace sooner or later. It is right enough to keep up our standard of living, but the way proposed is not the proper one. We ought to consider what is wrong with Australia that she cannot conduct secondary industries without being spoon-fed at the expense of primary industries. I have not forgotten the speech which the honorable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan) delivered when the first anti-dumping Bill was before us at the end of last year. I cannot quote the honorable members exact words, but he made an excellent speech, in which he said that we had been for many months considering the protection of industries by the imposition of a heavy Tariff ; that the departmental officials and the Minister himself had been devoting much time in order to include every product they considered ought to be protected. The effect of such a policy is to deny the Australian the opportunity of obtaining anything cheaply; and the honorable member for. Batman told us that the Government, in case they had left some little hole whereby something cheap might creep into the country, were putting this anti-dumping plaster right over the Tariff. We have now had twelve months experience of the working of the decision then arrived at. I may point out here that the Tariff Board has not a primary producer on it, although the primary producer buys the bulk of his machinery in Australia, and it is on him we rely for 75 per cent, of the revenue of the country. We are told now by the Minister that the Tariff Board requires further powers. It would appear that some little draft of cheap goods may get into the hands of Australians, and, therefore, it is proposed that the anti-dumping plaster shall be made thicker, so as to preclude any possibility of such a thing. The primary producers must, it seems, be handicapped right down to the ground, and, at the same time, we see articles appearing in the Age containing the warning,  Keep your eye on Argentina. We now find that Fiji has taken trade away from Australia. - another step, I suppose, towards making Australia a self-contained country. The honorable member for Gippsland (Mr. Wise) asks for a heavy duty on maize, and representatives of Tasmania, desire a duty on hops because America has gone  dry.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF (INDUSTRIES PRESERVATION) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[3]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I venture to predict, if such a duty were imposed, that in a few months that would be added to the general price of an imported ton of sugar. This really means that an Australian would be buying 1 ton of sugar at a price for which other people could buy 2 tons of sugar; and so we go around the vicious circle.

The hop-growers are in a position which differs from that of every other producer in Australia, because practically their only customer is the brewing interest. The brewers form, perhaps, the wealthiest Combine that exists in Australia, and a Combine which has been protected by the highest duties which Parliament could impose. This wealthy Combine sweats the growers of hops to the very limit. The price of hops does not affect in the least the selling price of beer, and their cost is infinitesimal compared with the cost of the beer of which they form a part. The brewers do not give the hop-growers a fair deal. They say to the Tasmanian growers,  You must plant out only Kentish varieties. We will not buy Californian clusters from you.

During the war hops went up to 4s. 6d. per lb. in some instances; but when the honorable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr. Foley) said to-day that the brewers of Kalgoorlie were giving 10s. per lb. for hops the Leader of the Opposition offered to get for them a contract to supply hops at 2s. 6d.

In the parent Act, and right through the Customs Tariff, responsibility is specifically placed on the shoulders of the Minister. That is a policy by which the Government stand firmly to-day. I have always been a strong advocate of Ministerial responsibility. The only occasion on which the Government have departed from that policy, in connexion with Customs laws, is with respect to the particular amendments contained in these resolutions. In ascertaining the proper percentage to be added, a maximum is fixed ; but it is undesirable to have trade held up. As honorable members know, trade and commerce cover hundreds and hundreds of items, and it is particularly desirable that decisions should be arrived at with the utmost despatch, so that the operations of traders may not be held up. In view of the fact that the Minister is not always to be reached with expedition, the Tariff Board was deliberately invested with this particular power in these matters only, the sole object being to avoid delay in releasing goods for commercial purposes. There was no desire to avoid Ministerial responsibility. However.. I am not very keen on the matter, and if it be the general desire of the Committee to restore Ministerial responsibility in these cases I am prepared to accept an amendment in that direction.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF (INDUSTRIES PRESERVATION) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Minister has intimated that if there is a consensus of opinion in the Committee that the power, proposed to be given, to the Tariff Board should rest with the Minister, he is prepared to bow to that opinion, and in the circumstances I see no reason for fixing the limit at 20 per cent.

285,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BEST, Robert","JPC","Kooyong","N/A","N/A",2754,". - Speaking generally, I agree with the motion submitted by the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Rodgers), except in regard to the point raised by the honorable member for Gippsland (Mr. Wise), upon which I am disposed to think the Minister will favorably entertain an amendment. It is obvious to those who glance at the Tariff Board Act and the Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation) Act that Parliament deliberately declared that the responsibility was not to be shifted from the Minister to the Tariff Board. Nearly every section in the latter Statute provides for decision by the Minister if he is satisfied after inquiry and report by the Tariff Board. The Board itself is regarded in the light of an advisory Board, and the responsibility is ultimately placed upon the Minister. Obviously this Parliament desired that the responsible party should be in this Chamber. Although the Minister has endeavoured to qualify the position a little, I strongly urge honorable members to adhere to the policy laid down in the Industries Preservation Act, so that we may continue the link of responsibility resting upon the Minister himself. I believe that the honorable member for Gippsland is prepared to submit an amendment to that effect, which will be favorably entertained by the Minister.I have glanced through the clauses of the motion, but they are difficult to comprehend without a careful study. . When we passed our anti-dumping legislation we were desirous that it should be effective, but experience has shown it to be completely ineffective by reason of the extraordinary depreciation that has taken place in die currency of Germany and other countries. The Industries Preservation Act when passed through this House was based on an exchange rate of 240 marks to the £1, but the mark has since depreciated to something like 7,000 to the £1, and the maximum anti-dumping duty of 75 per cent, has become completely useless. To-day the anti-dumping law is a mere sham. As I understand the motion before the Committee, it will operate in this way: I can make the meaning clear by using an example. If the German invoice price was £100, the f.o.b. charges £5, the freight £10, and the duty at 40 per cent., £44, the total landed cost in Australia would be £159. Suppose that the same class of goods manufactured in Australia cost £200, the difference in price between the imported and the local article would be £41. In order to put the imported and the Australian goods on practically the same level, with a little margin in favour of the local article, it is proposed that the Department shall be at liberty to impose a duty not merely on the £100, the cost at the port of export, but on the £100, plus the difference or dumping duty of £41, so that the duty would be charged on £141. That would give the Australian manufacturer a show, and make our Protectionist policy effective. A duty of 75 per cent, is of no use when it is practically wiped out by the depreciation of currency in the country of export. Therefore, some discretion must be allowed to the Minister, and the discretion proposed will permit him to charge as a dumping duty the difference between the landed cost and the fair market wholesale price of the locally-made article. This is one of those elastic provisions which will enable our policy of Protection to be made effective by having regard to the fluctuations which are daily or monthly taking place in other countries. That it is an extraordinary sort of legislation I admit, but it must be extraordinary in order to deal with the abnormal conditions of trade throughout the world. Anti-dumping legislation is nothing new; it exists in the United States, Canada, and in other countries, but it is useless to have a nominal anti-dumping duty; if we believe in the principle, we must make it effective. Therefore, I think every true Protectionist will realize that the extraordinary condition of the worlds trade warrants the adoption of this most unusual legislation.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF (INDUSTRIES PRESERVATION) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I have used as an illustration foreign goods landed in Australia at a cost of £159. Having regard to Australian working conditions and wages, the same article cannot be produced locally under £200. Of course, in ordinary times there would not be such a vast difference in the costs of production. The disparity is due to the abnormal depreciation of the mark from a par value of 20 to the £1 to a present value of 7,000 for the £1 sterling. We cannot permit German manufacturers with all the advantages of this depreciated currency in their favour to dump their goods into Australia, and so deal a crushing blow at our own industries. This phase is only temporary, and the scheme before the Committee is not cast iron. In that respect it differs from the original legislation submitted last year, which provided for a graduated scale of duties, increasing or decreasing according to the fluctuations of the depreciated currency.

I agree with the honorable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr. Mathews), that when the Government first accepted the principle of anti-dumping we expected, and our expectations have been realized, that an amendment would be necessary to make the legislation effective. I think it is unquestionably true that, as a result of our experience, any duty, whether it be an anti-dumping duty or of another character, if it is imposed indiscriminately in the hope of satisfying the manufacturer, will prove to that extent abortive. A manufacturer, if he is regardless of the price to be paid by the consuming public, as he will be if he gets all the Protection he seeks, is never satisfied, no matter how high the duty may be, and the public, naturally, are not satisfied if they find that the price is unduly inflated as a result of the protective duty. Protection is not everything, either to my party or to me personally. The Minister (Mr. Rodgers) says that it is not a question of Protection, but a question of legislation for the prevention of dumping. But in principle it is a question of Protection, and it is Protection superimposed on Protection. I join heartily with those who stand for the preservation of Australian industries against unfair competition from whatever source that competition comes. I must admit that I would not like entirely to be associated with the views expressed by the honorable member for Swan (Mr. Prowse), though he was good enough to applaud something I had said in the House.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF (INDUSTRIES PRESERVATION) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[11]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I am favorable to neither of these two sections. I certainly do not overlook the fact that no person can conscientiously demand a reduction in the cost of living and, at the same time, apply subsidies without discrimination to manufacturers in this or any other country. , We have to consider human nature; and so long as the people are subsidized by the State to raise prices, prices will be raised.Coming more immediately to the proposal of the Minister, which is directed to the principle of anti-dumping, I accept it, as explained by other honorable members, and particularly by the honorable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best), who, with some lucidity, went into the whole matter. Whatever the disturbing factors may be on the other side of the world, whether in Germany, or any other country, and I hope we are not at present looking at this question from the point of view that we are dealing with a so-called enemy country, or late enemy country, but merely as an economic problem. I quite accept the principle that if people are enabled to manufacture goods abroad, and dump them into this country in unjust competition with our manufacturers, they should not be permitted to take advantage of such conditions as would probably have the effect of destroying industries which could not be resuscitated in normal times, or, at any rate, not without difficulty and loss. I join with those who think that this should be a Ministerial responsibility, rather than -.a responsibility of the Tariff Board. I ask the Minister, however, and his Board, to see that this anti-dumping legislation is conscientiously applied as against dumping. I have a number of figures before me which seem to suggest that the anti-dumping duty is imposed under circumstances where there is no unjust competition in this country at all. I do not wish to go into details. The Minister has been good enough to hear my representations on the point in a perfectly proper way, and I have also made representations in this House. It seems to me from certain figures with which I have been supplied that in particular oases this duty is superimposed on goods not in unjust competition here, goods which are being sold at a price that could not unjustly compete. The figures in many of the cases, I believe, are before the Tariff Board. I certainly hope that the Act will be administered without any unfriendly feeling against any people. It has to be remembered that if we are going to apply this duty in a spirit of prejudice against other nations, that must re-act on ourselves. I am not pleading the cause of other people, but the cause of those who, believing, and I hope justly, that this legislation will be applied with meticulous justice, have entered into trade relations with other countries, and who, I am sorry to say, complain that, apparently, the duty is not fairly imposed. I do not object to the principle of the proposal, but accept it as proper, and I only hope and trust (that the Board will faithfully carry out its functions, and that the Minister will see that the duties are applied, after the closest investigation only so far as may be necessary to meet abnormal conditions and to prevent unfair competition detrimental to the industries of Australia.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF (INDUSTRIES PRESERVATION) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[11]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

There is, however, much doubt as to what prices are to be classed as dumping prices. Paragraph 5 of the motion says -Notwithstanding anything contained in the Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation) Act 1921, when the currency of the country of origin or export of any goods dutiable under section 8 of that Act depreciates to less than one-twelfth of its normal par value as compared with the pound sterling, the duty which shall be charged, collected, and paid under that section on the goods shall be such amount as represents the difference between -the landed cost in warehouse in Australia (including duty calculated in accordance with the provisions of the Customs Act 1901-1920), plus a percentage of profit to be determined by the Board, andthe Australian wholesale price of similar goods of Australian manufacture.That is a serious power to give. While we should protect our own manufacturers, we should also protect the general public. An importer, if he is a good business man, must know the cost of the goods which he is importing, so that he may be able to sell them in advance of arrival, and he needs some guarantee that the duty he will have to pay on them will be at a fixed rate, based on information which he is able to supply, otherwise he will add an amount to cover this risk, and the consumer will have to pay it. If he cannot supply correct information, he must suffer; but if he submits fair and reasonable evidence of cost, he should not be penalized. I do not wish to encourage dumping, but I think that where there is proper, honest, straightforward, business method, the importer should be able to ascertain in advance what duty he will have to pay, and thus be enabled to sell to the public at a reasonable profit. If the Minister cannot satisfy me on this point, I shall move an amendment later. I would substitute for the provision in paragraph 5 of the motion this provision -The Minister shall accept as satisfactory evidence of reasonable selling price in the country of origin or manufacture the price disclosed by the manufacturers published price- list and/or advertisements and/or generally accepted and duly declared trade quotations in the country of manufacture of the goods concerned.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF (INDUSTRIES PRESERVATION) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[12]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Their executive has been in close contact with the authorities. While, so far, nothing definite has been announced, we see that the Minister for Trade and Customs, in answer to a query in the Federal Parliament, said,  The Government are giving consideration to the question of further safeguarding the hop industry.It, therefore, behoves every brewer in Australia to take active steps to combat a move directly opposed to their interests, and which has no sound economic basis, as the existing duty, plus freight, insurance, and exchange, is quite sufficient protection to the industry. The present move is only being made with a view to obtaining Government aid to maintain a high price at the brewers expense.America has  gone dry. If all the hops now grown in that country were  dumped  into Australia, the supplies would not last us for a great number of years. Americans will not continue to produce something for which there is not a ready sale. What is the use of our passing temporary laws when American hops will not be importable in a few years? In Tasmania, at present, there is at least one firm which is building storage capacity for the hops which it has not yet sold. It intends not only to house this seasons hops, but some of last years also. SinceKalgoorlie brewers are being compelled to pay 10s. to 12s. per lb. for their hops, it is clear that somebody is getting a bit more than he is entitled to earn out of the Australian hop industry.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF (INDUSTRIES PRESERVATION) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[13]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It has made certain inquiries and presented a number of recommendations. It has been impressed with the fact that some of our industries are in danger owing to the dumping of foreign products. The hop industry is one of those which has been imperilled by the importation of foreign produce. A man who has put his money into land on which to grow hops has as much right to be protected as another who has put his money into machinery. If Tasmanian growers cannot sell last seasons hops because of the dumping into the Commonwealth of American-grown hops, it is the duty of the Government to afford the Australian industry adequate protection. If Australian brewers insist on using American hops, what right have they to look to the Australian market for the consumption of their protected products? Why do they not try to get Americans to drink their beer? I have the utmost confidence in the Tariff Board; but, although its members are practical men in full sympathy with Australian industries, they have not the power to do anything to help them. After they have investigated anomalies they make a recommendation to the Minister, and, very properly, he must accept the responsibility. I regret the fact that this motion has not been brought on earlier. Tasmanian hop-growers are almost ruined. They cannot get payment for last seasons crop, and do not know whether to put in any further crops.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF (INDUSTRIES PRESERVATION) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[15]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

When I spoke last session to the first item of the Tariff, I said that there would be many peculiar divisions : that we would find honorable members voting for duties on items manufactured in their own electorates, and asking for the removal of duties upon raw materials which were produced in other parts of Australia. We all know that this happened. Now we find the brewers, with a highly-protected industry, trying to get their hops at less than a fair value. I am informed by the honorable member for Franklin (Mr. Mcwilliams) that the brewers are importing from California the very same sort of hops that they are refusing to buy from Tasmania for some reason best known to themselves, and certainly not known to the hop growers. There are many hundreds of people engaged in picking hops during the season, and they find it a most remunerative employment, so that the hop-growing industry is fairly important. I am opposed to any Combine which is acting unfairly. One that will by means of better organization make things easier for . the consumer is a benefit to the community; but I am utterly opposed to any Combine which is out to raise prices.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF (INDUSTRIES PRESERVATION) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[16]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In fact, of these two we get goods only from Germany. Therefore, beyond the ordinary measure of protection afforded by the Customs Tariff, competition is available from practically every part of the world, subject only to our Tariff, and the added protection which is afforded by sections 4 and 5 of the Industries Preservation Act relating to dumping at reduced prices for export and to dumping below cost, and the provision, in the case of goods on consignment, contained in section 6. Competition is open and free as between Britain and the other Dominions, subject only to these restrictions, and there is nothing real in the argument advanced by the honorable member for Swan (Mr. Prowse) that we are attempting to prevent competition. The honorable member, who told a most mournful tale, expressed the view that the present proposal was but another  plaster  which was designed to stop up any  holes  through which goods could enter Australia. This country has rightly or wrongly fixed a margin of protection; that is not increased by lie motion I have submitted to-day. The purpose of the motion is simply to safeguard the protection already afforded to meet cases where there is unfair competition, particularly owing to depreciation in the exchange value of the currency of any country. Without these safeguards our national policy of Protection would be rendered of no avail, and if we permitted this, it would be criminal neglect on our part. Exchange dumping provisions will apply only to countries where there is a depreciation of currency. Dumping below costs provisions apply in the case of any country, irrespective of the value of its currency, in the worlds finance.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF (INDUSTRIES PRESERVATION) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/para[26]","N/A","N/A"

It is quite unnecessary for me to repeat the arguments I used when dealing with the previous measure. The aim is to give to the manufacturers a bounty equal, as far as is mathematically possible, to the duty which has been removed. The matter has been investigated carefully by the Tariff Board after consultation with the representatives of the industries affected. While the substitution of the bounty may not be quite what the manufacturers would like, it is generally agreed, I think, that the measure of protection afforded by the bounty - that is the actual degree of protection - will be equal to that previously enjoyed under the duty. The question as to which may be the preferable was not gone into as between the Board and manufacturers at the recent interview to which I have referred. It was no part of the Boards business, of course, to examine that phase as the policy had been determined; all that was necessary was to satisfy the manufacturers that the bounty would be at least an equivalent of the duty.","N/A","IRON AND STEEL PRODUCTS BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

However that may be, I do not wish the impression to go forth that the subsidiary industries which depend on iron and steel are satisfied with what is being done, because if I am guided by reports of the meetings of those interested, the contrary is the case. They say that a duty is preferable, because it is fixed, and, stability being thus given, there is some encouragement to enter upon the industry. A bounty is quite a different matter, for it presents no certainty, seeing that it may be removed at any moment. All that can be said in favour of the bounty - and this is why a bounty is proposed - is that it will, perhaps, relieve to a certain extent the people in the country districts and make the general taxpayers bear the burden.","N/A","IRON AND STEEL PRODUCTS BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[2]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The utilization of this land was the subject of a report by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works last year. Under that report the Committee recommended donation of a portion of the land towards the formation, in association with the State Government and the municipality of Brisbane, of a soldiers memorial square; donation of this land has accordingly been effected. In its report the Committee also referred to the necessity for erection of Government offices in Brisbane, and considered that the remainder of the land referred to would be suitable for the purpose of this office building. Similar building projects are in process of being effected in Sydney, Adelaide, and Perth, and possibly also the same will be done in the case of Melbourne. Drawings of a five story building to cover the whole area of the land having frontages to Adelaide and Ann streets and the memorial square are now submitted as required by the Act. The building obviously should be designed upon lines to conveniently provide for future expansion, and the extent to which the initial section of the work should be effected will be reported upon by the Standing Committee after evidence on the subject. The first section of the building provided by the drawings now submitted is intended to provide about 84,000 feet of effective working office space, estimated to cost about £127,000.This space is considerably in excess of initial requirements, but it may be found advisable to provide a structure of this size even if portions of it may have to be let pending expansion of Commonwealth requirements. Further details of the project will be submitted in evidence to the Standing Committee during its investigations. Although it is proposed to erect a five-storied building, the Public Works Committee may consider that it would be sufficient for the present to construct, perhaps, only two-thirds of what is proposed. It is the policy of the Government to own instead of to rent the office accommodation which it requires in the capital cities.","N/A","COMMONWEALTH BUILDINGS, BRISBANE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This Bill provides for the payment of bounties in respect of the steel products which have been placed under lower rates of duty, or in some cases made duty free, if of British origin. It further provides that the measure shall operate simultaneously with the removal of duties upon the steel products indicated, so that no advantage may be lost by Australian manufacturers. Special safeguards are included. Manufacturers will be required, for example, to provide evidence that their works have made reasonable efforts to cope with the Australian demand, and that they have complied with necessary industrial conditions. These provisions are similar to those contained in the Iron and Steel Bounty Act 1918. Consumers are safeguarded by the specific provision that, if the products are not placed on the market at reasonable prices, the bounty may be withheld. Employees are safeguarded by the provision that, if reasonable conditions with respect to wages and the like are not complied with, the bounty may be withheld. The raw material must be Australian, or the bounty will not be paid. The sole exception in that respect has to do with the possibility of an insufficiency of the supply of the Australian raw material. If the Minister is satisfied that such is the case, and that a partial supply of imported material is required to carry on manufacture, he may grant permission to use imported material for the time being. In all other respects the Bill provides that the bounty shall take the place of the duty. I emphasize that the rights and interests of all parties - manufacturers, employees, and consumers - are protected.","N/A","IRON AND STEEL PRODUCTS BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I unwillingly withdrew my opposition to the proposal, because I felt that the men associated with the industry knew their own business best. Some time afterwards, however, trouble arose between the manufacturers and their employees on this very question of wages and working conditions, and a strike resulted. This occurred during the regime of the Fisher Government, and the employees approached the then Minister for Trade and Customs with a request that the bounty should be withdrawn. The Minister refused, saying that he had been assured by the workers representatives that their wages and  working conditions would be safeguarded by their union. Since that period the Constitution has not been altered, and I fear that a somewhat similar state of affairs may develop after this Bill has been passed. A sympathetic Government might take special care to safeguard the interests of the employees but I am not sure that the present Administration will be too keen an that direction.","N/A","IRON AND STEEL PRODUCTS BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/speech[3]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The decision given quite recently in the engineers award is likely to bring about further industrial unrest, and it is quite possible that Justices drawn from the same class may give similar awards. After the next election, if the Government are returned to power, there may be a very strong desire on their part to fritter away the rights of workers in the Arbitration Court to such an extent that this Tribunal may be useless to them.

A still greater attack is being made upon the system of arbitration by the Victorian Government. A strenuous attack is being made, not only with a view to increasing the hours of labour, but also with a view to a. reduction of wages. A man would be wilfully blind if he could not see this. And now, at the tail end of the session, we are asked to pass this sop to the  bushrangers  in the corner. It is some of the loot dropped by the burglar when the gas was turned on.. It is a proposal which has been brought in specially to placate those members in the Country party who misrepresent the farmers, and when I realize that it meets with their approval I can see very readily that it must be a disadvantage to the working section of the community, which I represent. However, although we may look askance at the Bill, knowing thai the House has determined by a majority that certain Customs duties must go, -we are compelled to accept the measure as the best we can get, although the payment of a bounty cannot establish an industry as well as can duties, which serve to keep out imports. Notwithstanding the provisions of the Industries Preservation Act, certain conditions have arisen which render the measure absolutely inoperative and make it impossible to produce certain -commodities in Australia because of the cheap price at which they can be imported. I am compelled to accept this proposal with reluctance, and also with the knowledge that within the next twelve months the Federal Arbitration Court will be assailed. The Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) is probably conferring with the Premier of New South Wales a,t the present moment with this end in view. He has already been in consultation with, the Premier of South. Australia upon the same point. Perhaps we ought to accept the Bill, knowing that in time the workers will realize the objects which the Government and those in the corner are seeking to attain, and give them such a whack that they will not know where they are. I want the Government not to assist in the bringing down of wages or in the lengthening of hours, such as may be sought to be achieved under the conditions surrounding the payment of this bounty.","N/A","IRON AND STEEL PRODUCTS BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/speech[3]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The manufacture of sulphuric acid is an industry that should be stabilized in Australia, but hitherto the Government have asked 72,000 people of the Commonwealth to bear the sole expense of establishing it. To impose upon 72,000 people out of 5,500,000 the obligation of stabilizing the manufacture of a commodity which is a national necessity is not sound legislation. The only sound policy of stabilizing it would be the payment of a bounty. It is quite an easy matter for the majority of the people to call upon 72,000 to incur the liability in this regard by the payment of a duty upon sulphur, but the others would not be so ready to vote for a heavy protective duty upon this article if they had to pay it. Therefore, I am very sincere when I ask the Government to add sulphuric acid to the schedule, particularly in view of the speech made by the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes), in Sydney, yesterday, when he said that he waa desirous of meeting the Corner party half-way. The right honorable gentleman is evidently anxious at this opportune time to soften the remarks which he has been accustomed to make, and nothing would show the earnestness of his intentions better than would the adding to this schedule of the words  sulphuric acid. I am sure that the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Rodgers) knows well from the deputations that have waited upon him in regard to this matter, and from communications he has received from different States concerning it, that sulphuric acid is a component part of superphosphates which are sp essential, not only for the great wheat-fields of Australia, but also for increasing the grass-bearing capacity of land upon which stock is fattened.

489,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CHARLTON, Matthew","JXA","N/A","N/A","N/A",2771,"- That is more than can be said of the vote of the honorable member for Swan (Mr. Prowse) on timber, and many other items. A reference to the records of the Tariff debates will show that the honorable member, although a Free Trader, abandoned his principles, and voted for the imposition of duties, whenever they affected his electorate or the party to which he belongs.I indorse the attitude adopted by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr. Mathews) in regard to the necessity for issuing a regulation to safeguard the interests of those who are working in the benefited industries. If these manufacturers are to receive bounties from the Commonwealth, the Government should insure that proper conditions of labour obtain. The conditions to-day are very unsatisfactory. In regard to galvanized sheets, for instance, Lysaghts established works in the Newcastle district and imported .a number of tradesmen from the Old Country. They occupied houses which Lysaghts had built for them, and were committed to heavy obligations in connexion therewith. Recently, when on account of the closing down of the steel works the galvanized sheet works suffered, Lysaghts employees were thrown out of employment, and no other work .was obtainable. They had obligations in respect of those houses, and when they were, in a difficult corner the employer endeavoured to break down the conditions of employment and wages. The same thing has happened in regard to the steel works. In the early part of last year an effort was made to reduce wages and working conditions on account of the reduced cost of living, but since that time the cost; of living has increased, and the latest figures available from the Statistician show that in New South Wales and Victoria 32s. has only the purchasing power of £1 in 1911. Queensland, where a Labour Government is in office, is in the best position of any of the States, only 28s. being required to purchase what £1 would purchase in 1911. The employers in the iron industry have been endeavouring to break down the working conditions, and instead of approaching the Arbitration Court, they sought to put pressure upon the employees. I have stated before, and I repeat now, my belief that the steel works were closed down largely for the purpose of breaking down working conditions and wages. The employers thought that, on account of the large number of their employees, they could achieve their purpose quickly by throwing the workers out of employment, but they found their desire not so easy of accomplishment as they expected, and, in consequence, the works had to lie idle. Fancy the big iron and steel corporation, which has made many thousands of pounds out of the industry, immediately the slightest trouble occurred, endeavouring to get men to work for £3 10s. per week when the Court had declared that £4 ls. 6d., exclusive of the cost of clothing, was a living wage. Having regard to our past experience, we must be careful. Public money, in the form of bounties, is to be given, to these people, and I am glad that, in spite of the evidence outside the Chamber - including the statement of the honorable member for Corangamite (Mr. Gibson) to-day that he does not believe in arbitration - that there is a movement to destroy arbitration, the Government have recognised that principle in this measure. Clause 10 reads - 10. (1) The Minister may make application to the President of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration for a declaration as to what wages and conditions of employment are fair and reasonable for labour employed in the manufacture of fencing wire, galvanized sheets, traction engines, or wire netting.If the Minister finds that the rates of wages and conditions of employment or any of them -are below the rates and conditions declared, as in the first sub-section of this section mentioned, to be fair and reasonable; orare below the standard rates and conditions of employment prescribed by the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. the Minister may withhold the whole or any part of the bounty payable.That is all very well if the workmen are operating under awards of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, but, so far as I know, all the industries referred to in the Bill are governed by State awards. It will be necessary, therefore, if the Minister desires to protect the workers, to add some such words as  or an award of the State Arbitration Court. I know that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company has a case before a State tribunal now. That company will not come under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, but as they are to participate in the bounty, it will be necessary for the Minister to propose some amendment that will safeguard the employees. I do not wish to give bounties to these people if they are going to sweat their employees.","N/A","IRON AND STEEL PRODUCTS BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/speech[5]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
490,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FLEMING, William","KFC","Robertson","N/A","N/A",2772,".- This Bill represents a step in the right direction, inasmuch as the cost of encouraging the development of these industries will be borne in future by the whole community instead of by only one section, as in the past. I should like some information from the Minister upon one point. In the schedule galvanized sheets and fencing wire are on the same level; a bounty of £2 12s. per ton is to be paid in respect of each, whereas in the Tariff the British preferential duty on wire was 52s. and on galvanized iron 72s. One naturally wonders why the two items are on the same basis in this schedule.The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Charlton) has suggested that some provision should be made to prevent the employees in these assisted industries from being sweated, and he quoted the remark of one honorable member in regard to the Arbitration Act. It is wrong to suggest that anybody who is opposed to the Arbitration Act must be in favour of sweating the workers. A man having seen the results of arbitration may honestly be opposed to its continuance, and at the same time be just as earnest as the honorable member for Hunter (Mr. Charlton) in seeking to protect the employees. I hope that something will be done to insure that the employees shall reap an advantage out of this bounty, at least equal to that which will be derived by the employers.","N/A","IRON AND STEEL PRODUCTS BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If the Commonwealth is to do anything to encourage manufacturers, or anybody else, there should be no distinction whatsoever in the assistance given to the different parties engaged in the industry; all must be treated alike. Therefore I agree with the contention of the Leader of the Opposition that the employees in the industries to be benefited by this Bill should be assured of a fair share of the bounty. The appropriation is not to exceed £250,000. That is not a very large sum, when all is said and done, for the encouragement of industries which are producing articles absolutely necessary for the development of Australia. Fencing wire, galvanized iron, and tractors are three of the essential commodities that Australia should produce, and produce in large quantities, if we are to make the fullest use of this country, which needs development to a far greater extent and much more thoroughly than a great number of people resident in the cities realize. There is no country in the world to-day occupied by white men which is calling more loudly for development; and because this is a measure which will enable us to assist in that work, and remove those restrictions caused by the Tariff, I am personally in favour of it.","N/A","IRON AND STEEL PRODUCTS BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/speech[6]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

That clause gives the Minister power to apply to the Court for an interpretation as to wages and conditions if he so desires, but it certainly does not limit the Minister in that respect. The Minister may not move a State Wages Board or other tribunal; but he may be quite satisfied that reasonable wages and conditions are observed, and that the men have no occasion to refer to the Court.

Looking over the schedule, I can only find the products of three industries that will be governed by a Federal arbitration award; all the other items being governed by the State Courts. I believe that it is the intention of the Government and the Minister to protect the workers, and to give them an assurance that such a desire exists; but if the amendment suggested by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Charlton) is accepted, I believe it will make the measure a better one. I listened with interest to the speech by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr. Mathews) on the general question of arbitration. I may say that I have been twitted with changing my opinions on this question, hut that I have never done. I worked in an industry before arbitration was inaugurated, and I . was a member not only of the committee in Western Australia that framed the first Arbitration Act for that State, but also of the committee that framed amendments to that Act. I am as strong a believer in arbitration to-day as I have ever been. Arbitration has done a great amount of good in certain industries to which it has been applied, but my belief is that the greatest harm to employees and employers alike, so far as the settlement of industrial differences is concerned, has resulted not altogether by reason of faults in the. Court, but by reason of undue interference by both State and Federal Governments. Our idea of arbitration was that those concerned in a dispute should meet at a round-table conference and settle all the points that it was possible for such a conference to settle. We thought that it would then remain only for them to go to the Court for a settlement of the points on which they were still in disagreement, and that on the decision of the Court an award would be given. That was the arbitration we all looted for, and we know that such a system has done much, not only for the settlement, but for the prevention of disputes. There is no monopoly on any side of politics in the desire, not only to settle such troubles, but to prevent them, and, as I say, the greatest harm has been done by the mischievous intervention of Governments.","N/A","IRON AND STEEL PRODUCTS BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/speech[8]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This, apart from any other fact within my knowledge, drives me to The conclusion that while this bounty may do a little good in a certain way, it will certainly not be more beneficial than is a protective duty. I have here a quotation from the speech delivered in this House on 9th June, 1921, on the item of wire netting, when the Tariff was being discussed. On that occasion, the honorable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) said that the industry should be protected by a bounty. The present Minister for Defence (Mr. Greene), who was then Minister for Trade and Customs, gave rather an extended reply to the honorable member for Dampier, and finished his speech with these words -When an industry has been definitely established I do not think that the payment of a bounty is the right way in which to assist it. Of course, a bounty may sometimes be usefully employed to build up an industry in its earlier stages. The proposal to grant a bounty for this particular purpose would, if the duties were arranged in the manner suggested by the honorable member, entirely close up the smaller manufacturers of wire-netting. They would find it impossible to operate. I gave careful consideration during the luncheon hour to the question as to whether it would be possible to substitute, either in part or in whole, a bounty for this duty, and have come to the conclusion that it is practically impossible to do so.It is remarkable that a reply like this should have been given by the Minister for Defence, who, in effect, said to the honorable member for Dampier, No, sir; no bounty for the wire netting industry; it is better to protect it by a duty.

Let me read the resolution of the Australian Industries Protection League. It is as follows: -The Australian Industries Protection League emphatically protests against the proposals of the Commonwealth Government, as announced in the Federal Treasurers Budget speech, to substitute bounties for the protective duties recently enacted in respect of certain industries, on the ground that the league believes that a Protective Tariff is essential to the industrial development of Australia, and it considers that, if the dangerous precedent of cancelling protective duties and substituting bounties in the interests of special sections of the community be once established, manufacturers generally will lose that sense of security in the validity of Customs laws which is indispensable, not only to the extension and enlargement of existing industrial establishments, but also to the initiation of new manufacturing enterprises.Those are sentiments with which I am in accord. Knowing your fiscal faith, Mr. Chairman, I am sure that were you in my position you would as strongly denounce the attitude of the Minister as I have done. Although I cannot bring the blush of shame to the cheeks of those who are so inconsistent, I hope that what I have said will draw the attention of people outside to their inconsistency.","N/A","IRON AND STEEL PRODUCTS BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/speech[9]/continue[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I think that the honorable member was justified in much that he said. The clause is anomalous, and it is difficult to say how far it will be effective. It gives the Minister power to apply to the Arbitration Court to obtain a declaration respecting the fairness of wages and conditions, but such an application might mean months of delay, even if the Court were disposed to entertain it, and in any case it would apply only to a very limited number of cases. For the most part, the industries affected by the Bill are governed by State awards. We cannot authorize the Minister to apply to a Wages Board or other State tribunal, where he would have no standing; but I think that the difficulty could be overcome. The Bill purports to say that if the Minister finds that the rates of wages or conditions of employment, or any of them, are unsatisfactory he is not bound to pay the bounty provided for, and I would suggest an additional, subclause to the effect that, should he find that the rates of wages and conditions of employment, or any of them, were below the standard rates and conditions of employment prescribed by the determination of any State Wages Board or other industrial State tribunal, or below the rates and conditions which he himself might deem fair and reasonable, he need not pay the bounty. If the Minister cannot get any immediate guidance from the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, and if - which will be an extraordinary contingency- there is no State determination regulating wages and conditions in the industry, then, should expedition be necessary, it may be fairly left to him,, as to the best of my recollection it was left in the Act providing for a bounty on wool tops, to decline to pay the bounty. That measure left it to the Minister to satisfy himself as. to whether fair wages and conditions were being paid in the industry claiming tha bounty.","N/A","IRON AND STEEL PRODUCTS BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/speech[10]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In my view, the alternative will not have the effect of encouraging industry and placing existing activities on a firmer basis. A complete change is apparent in the attitude of certain members with respect to the payment of bounties as against the principle of the imposition of duties. I have in mind, particularly, the honorable member for Capricornia (Mr. Higgs). Upon nearly every occasion in the past, when a Tariff measure has been before Parliament, these members have strongly supported the- imposition of duties. Now they are forsaking their old principles, and they are complacently encouraging the Government to remove duties and pay bounties. The industries of Australia are sufficiently important for us to see that nothing is done here to interfere with their progress, but it has been clearly shown that the people engaged in thos© industries affected by the recent remission of duties are complaining bitterly of the Governments action in replacing protective duties by the payment of a bounty.","N/A","IRON AND STEEL PRODUCTS BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/speech[14]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is an unscientific method which has never succeeded in establishing any industry. The successful way employed in all countries is that of imposing Customs duties. In any case, before I would agree to the payment of a bounty, I would, first of all, want to know that the industry was being run properly, and that the employees engaged in it were being given reasonably decent conditions. I would also want to know that the product of the industry to which a bounty was being paid was being sold to the people at a fair and reasonable price. I regret that it is impossible for me to point out these things, but it is, indeed, strange to view the attitude of many honorable members opposite, who so recently called loudly for a high Protective Tariff to save the industries of Australia, and yet are now prepared to throw overboard that policy, and sacrifice these industries for the purpose of getting a good electioneering cry. Where is this bounty to come from? It is to be taken out of the surplus revenue, that is to say, out of the Trust Fund set on one side for the purpose of providing pensions for the old and infirm people in our midst.

Last week I protested against the payment of a bounty to one section of the community. I cannot see any justice in picking out sections for special treatment in this way. There is only one straightforward and legitimate method of building up industries in Australia, and that is by imposing a Tariff. When the question of affording protection to our industries was under consideration in this Parliament, a most excellent case was made out for the protection of the very industries with which we are now dealing, and I am not yet convinced that any alteration in that policy should be made. At any rate,I do not see why the taxpayers should be called upon to provide £250,000 for one industry while other industries are penalized, as the honorable member for Swan (Mr. Prowse) claims they are, by the necessity for paying Tariff duties. However, personally, I do not regard the payment of a duty as penalizing an industry. I consider that it is simply a matter of distributing the cost of building up an industry evenly over the whole community. I am not sure that a Bill which proposes to give a bounty to one section of the community while other sections have to seek their protection through the Customs Tariff is in the best interests of the community, and so long as I am a member of this Parliament I shall always endeavour to see that my attitude upon this question is consistent..I am totally opposed to the payment of bounties when we have in the Customs Tariff a more efficient means of encouraging local industries. If I have the opportunity I shall vote against this Bill, and all others that contain the same principle.","N/A","IRON AND STEEL PRODUCTS BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/speech[18]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I think that the clause does give the President power, at the request of the Minister, to make a declaration. If there is no Federal award the President will satisfy himself from documents at his disposal that there is a State Wages Board or State Arbitration Court award, and in that case will declare that the conditions are right and proper. I suggest, however, that words might be inserted to provide that the Minister may apply, not only to the Federal Court, but to any State Wages Board or Arbitration Court for the information required. I do not think that the chairman of a State Board or Court would ever refuse such information if it were asked for. I take it that we all desire to give this protection to the workers, and we all see the difficulty that the Minister will have in going to State tribunals to get the necessary information. On second thoughts I fancy that such an amendment as I have suggested would be valueless, seeing that it would only enable us to make a request to somebody over whom we have no control in any shape or form. The clause will, I think, be a protection to employees, because I cannot assume that any President of the Court would not satisfy himself from official documents that the wages and conditions in any particular industry were fair and reasonable.

There are certain industries to-day in which, without appeal to either Federal or State Courts, conditions are imposed on the workers, because of the limitation of employment, which amounts to a reduction of existing rates of wages. The men have been compelled to  accept those conditions, notwithstanding that they do not provide a living wage, and are below what have been prescribed by a State tribunal or an Arbitration Court award. But because they are working under them, the Minister, who knows nothing of the facts, may think it a sufficient reason for paying the bounty. However, it is not the desire of the people of this country that the bounty should be paid to those who are sweating their employees. I should like to see paragraph b made -to provide that the rates and conditions must not be below the standard rates and conditions of employment prescribed by the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, or the award of a State tribunal. The adoption of some such provision will not make it necessary for the Minister, when he wishes to inform his mind upon this subject, to apply to the Arbitration Court or to a State tribunal for a declaration; all that he will have to do will be to ascertain whether there is a State or Federal award governing the industry, and, if so, whether effect is being given to it. It will be his duty to say to applicants for the bounty,  Unless you conform to the conditions, and pay the rates set out in the award governing your industry, you cannot have the bounty.","N/A","IRON AND STEEL PRODUCTS BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/speech[25]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I was saying there is a tendency on the part of certain sections of the community to repudiate and discard the system of arbitration. The Employers Federation and Chambers of Commerce throughout Australia have declared against compulsory arbitration. I share, with ether honorable members on this side, the concern and apprehension they have expressed in regard to the future of tribunals responsible for determining wages and conditions of those employed, not only in the industries covered by this Bill, but in other industries also. In South Australia we have already had an illustration of what is likely to occur. An anti-Labour Government in that State, the leader of whom is Sir Henry Newman Barwell, the coloured labour advocate, has repudiated the promise made to the people in regard to arbitration, and has grossly betrayed the workers of that State, especially the Government employees. A similar circumstance has been proven in New South Wales since the return of a Nationalist Government, and there is every reason to believe that this Nationalist Government possessing an equal desire to serve the interests of the captains of industry, will be prepared to subordinate the interests of the workers. There are two features associated with this section that must not be overlooked - firstly, the full and free discretionary powers afforded the Minister; secondly, the insecure position of industrial arbitration legislation. A very significant factor is the recent appointment of two Deputy Presidents to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court for two years only and not for the usual term. There should be some provision in this clause making it compulsory for the Minister to accept as the minimum wages and conditions justifying the payment of the bounty those fixed by an Arbitration Court or other tribunal. I cannot countenance such an indefinite provision as clause 10, giving the Minister such wide discretionary powers, knowing that he must be a partisan and be influenced by the political colour of those who are concerned in this measure. There are supporters of the Government who desire to abolish compulsory arbitration and return to a system of direct action. These capitalistic interests are the real fomenters of industrial unrest and dissatisfaction.","N/A","IRON AND STEEL PRODUCTS BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/speech[27]/continue[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
