Every one of these petitions represents an issue which is important to a group of Australians and which deserves a considered and thoughtful response.Today I table a response from the Minister for Foreign Affairs that responds to several petitions that were signed by, in total, 55,232 petitioners. These petitions varied in their wording but were united in their request for Australia to take action against the Iranian government for its human rights abuses. The response from the minister setting out the governments actions should assure these petitioners that this matter is being taken seriously and that Australians are united in their opposition to oppression, particularly of women and girls.I look forward to updating the House further on the work of the Petitions Committee.","Statements","PETITIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms TEMPLEMAN (Macquarie) ","(10:01):"
"0","0","0","1","1","Bates, Stephen MP","300246","Brisbane","AG","N/A","33"," I move:That the bill be now read a second time.Today I rise to introduce the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Lowering the Voting Age) Bill 2023, a bill to lower the voting age in Australia to 16. Around the world, young people are making their voices heard on the issues that matter to them most. Across the globe, we are seeing the ever-increasing politicisation of young people driven by government inaction, and Australia is no stranger to this. Young people are more engaged in politics than ever before and are already taking actions outside of the political system to shape the future that they will inherit. These actions happen because young people want to drive change on the crises that are facing our society: climate change, access to health care, housing affordability and racial justice. These are issues that young people are passionate about because they are the ones who stand to lose the most from government inaction.To be growing up in a time of rising rates of inequality and poverty as well as climate change and to see the top one per cent become wealthier and wealthier at the expense of working and middle-class families is more than enough to mobilise young people to want to fight for a fairer future. I commend the efforts of young people across the country and their engagement in grassroots action to ensure that their voices are heard. But there is still so far to go. Demonstrations are ongoing, because we arent seeing action on the climate crisis. Australian students are being saddled with ever-increasing debt, and the leaders they are looking to do not seem to have the political will to take the actions we so desperately need.Lowering the voting age to 16 would give young people the opportunity to have a real say over the politics and policies that will impact them for the rest of their lives. It would force elected representatives to be accountable to the young people they represent and would give young people a say in our democracy—a say they have clearly demonstrated that they deserve. Lowering the voting age isnt just important to ensure that young peoples voices are heard, though; its important for the future of our democracy. The last federal election had a historically low rate of voter participation, with voter turnout falling to below 90 per cent for the first time since the introduction of compulsory voting. The Australian compulsory voting system is one that we should be proud of. We give every citizen not just the right but also the responsibility to have a say in who represents them in parliament.But as engagement with our voting system continues trending downward, it is important that we take proactive steps to increase participation. Examples from around the world have shown that lowering the voting age to 16 has resulted in increased participation, not just in those first two years of voting but throughout the voters lifetime. The Scottish independence referendum, for example, saw 16- and 17-year-olds turn out to vote in higher numbers than their older counterparts. Germany has now decided to lower the voting age to 16 at the federal level after seeing positive outcomes at various state levels. States that had a voting age of 16 saw higher participation rates in democracy as these cohorts aged, versus states that had a voting age of 18. Increasing participation would mean that we could address the scale of the crises our country faces today. It would give those who will inherit the future that we in this place decide a say in who represents them.I want to say thank you to the grassroots organisers who have been campaigning on this for many, many years, some of whom are in the building today. I look forward to seeing some of you sitting down here in the future.Young people are desperate to make their voices heard. Expanding voting rights to 16- and 17-year-olds to give them true representation in this place is not only the least we can do for them; its a political inevitability.","Electoral Legislation Amendment (Lowering the Voting Age) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BATES (Brisbane) ","(10:04):"

"0","0","0","1","1","Gillespie, David MP","72184","Lyne","NATS","N/A","33"," I move:That this House:(1) notes that:(a) Australia has been at the forefront of nuclear science and technology since 1953 when the Australian Atomic Energy Commission was established and operated two research reactors at Lucas Heights in Sydney;(b) since the Australian Atomic Energy Commission became the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation in 1987, it has operated the HIFAR Research Reactor, and subsequently the OPAL Research Reactor, which has delivered significant benefits for nuclear medicine in Australia and around the world;(c) Australia has developed one of the worlds leading regulatory and safety authorities to oversee the operation of its nuclear industries with the establishment of the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency; and(d) Australia is a signatory to international non-proliferation treaties which is overseen by the Australian Safeguards and Non-proliferation Office;(2) considers the deployment of nuclear energy to deliver energy security for the nation, as part of Australias transition to a decarbonised electricity grid, utilising emerging nuclear technologies such as Generation III+, Generation IV Small Modular Reactors and Micro Modular Reactors; and(3) further considers the following legislative actions:(a) removing the blanket prohibition on:(i) the Minister for Environment and Water declaring, approving, or considering actions relating to the construction or operation of certain nuclear facilities as described in sections 37J, 140A and 146M, and paragraph 305(2)(d) of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, by repealing those provisions; and(ii) the construction or operation of certain nuclear facilities as described in section 10 of the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act 1998, by repealing that section; and(b) leaving unaffected:(i) the other elements of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, pursuant to which the Minister would assess any application to establish a facility previously named in the repealed provisions;(ii) state and territory powers to protect their citizens and the environment from potential adverse radiation impacts; and(iii) the power vested in the Minister for Foreign Affairs to determine whether or not to issue a permit under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987 for such a proposed facility.During the 33 years I practised as a hospital doctor, from a junior intern through to a general internal medicine specialist, and for the last 22 years as a gastroenterologist, I and all the medical staff around me often used the miracle of modern medicine which utilises nuclear technology, including radionucleotide isotopes for iodine, technetium, molybdenum, X-rays or CAT scans, to diagnose and treat many conditions and, in many instances, cure cancers: breast, prostate, bowel, lung, brain or bone cancer and lymphoma; even overactive thyroid conditions use radioactive isotopes to calm the thyroid down. Yet, even though Australians and people around the world beg for, and wish that they had access to, that sort of technology and are happy to receive it, in Australia we have a schizoid response. When we apply to use the wonder that nature gave us of fission—of partially enriched uranium isotope 235—to boil water to very high temperatures and pressures, just like a coal-fired power plant does, and when we use that to run turbines which run electrical generators, like we have in all our coal plants or in hydro stations, people react, and we have legacy legislation prohibiting its exact use.Why is it that people baulk? I think, having studied the psychology of this for many years, its because people have had a trained emotional response because of the legacy fears about nuclear Armageddon as a result of the nuclear arms race. Theyve been misinformed or misled about what a powerplant is. A simple explanation is that it uses the wonders of fission with electrical rods that, when they get to a critical mass, heat up. The phenomenon of fission makes a lot of heat, just like the element of an old-fashioned kettle—you see those things around the ceramic base heating the water. Well, thats what happens in a nuclear power reactor, and that is enriched uranium—up to 4.9 per cent.Mr Speaker, I want to reassure you that it is quite different from a nuclear bomb. A nuclear bomb needs 95 per cent enriched uranium—about 12 kilos of it—clustered in a little space, surrounded by huge amounts of physical explosive. There is no way a nuclear power reactor will ever become a nuclear bomb. Fukushima wasnt a nuclear bomb; it was a hydrogen gas explosion resulting from the intense heat because the cooling water stopped circulating. It wasnt a nuclear bomb. The Fukushima earthquake and tsunami killed 35,000 people. No people died from radiation exposure in Japan—not one, zippo, none.But I will continue. Australia is already a nuclear-ready nation. We have operated three nuclear reactors for many years—since the 1950s in fact. We still operate the OPAL reactor in Lucas Heights, which is surrounded by suburbia where houses sell for $3 million, and no-one bats an eyelid. We have 1,300 people employed in nuclear and scientific activities within ANSTO. We have the Australian Safeguards and Non-Proliferation Office, which monitors our compliance with all the nonproliferation treaties around the world. We have ARPANSA, the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, which is a world-class institution. Australia is a part of the International Atomic Energy Agency. We are a part of the fourth-generation nuclear power plants forum, called the Generation IV International Forum, which is researching and designing fourth-generation reactors. These are the newer and latest models, which will come into being in the next 10 or 15 years.Ive visited Canada and America and Ive looked at some of these new, small modular reactors that everyones talking about. They are ready to roll. They are going through final licensing. Theyre not some far-off, distant development. They are a mini version—refined. Just like a Volvo car, the latest models are incredibly safe. They have lots of passive and safety features. Like the current mobile phones, theyre quite different from the big bricks that you used to have to carry around as the first mobile phones. Theyre smaller and more powerful and they are safe. They have passive safety, and they wont be analysed until we remove the prohibitions in the ARPANS Act— (Time expired)","Nuclear Energy","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr GILLESPIE (Lyne) ","(10:08):"

"0","0","0","1","1","Phillips, Fiona MP","147140","Gilmore","ALP","N/A","35"," I will always rise to set the record straight when it comes to the Liberals and Nationals obsession with nuclear power. All I can say is that Im so glad to stand here today as the member for Gilmore and as part of the Albanese Labor government, because this is the best assurance our community on the New South Wales South Coast can have against a nuclear reactor endangering our community and putting our pristine Jervis Bay at risk of harm.That is what the Liberals and Nationals would do if they had the chance and if our community—with me standing with them, I am proud to say—didnt tell them each and every time they bring it up, No, we will not accept it. Thats what we do every time this obsession of theirs is raised. We point out, as I will again now for the member for Lyne and anyone else in the coalition ranks who needs to hear it, that nuclear is not an option. I know that the Liberals and Nationals dont seem to care about the inherent risk this would place our community in. They dont seem to care about the inherent risk to our farmers and farming land, or the risk to our health or our tourism industry. They dont seem to care about the risk it will place on our beautiful Jervis Bay Marine Park, our environment and our native wildlife. That much is clear, or we wouldnt still be having this conversation.So lets talk in a language the Liberals might understand. The coalition are constantly banging on about bringing down the cost of energy. They say nuclear is the way to do that, but it has been proven that the costs of nuclear power do not stack up. The CSIRO continues to state that nuclear energy would far and away be the most expensive form of energy in this country. Nuclear energy produces less power now than 10 years ago, while wind and solar continue to grow. The capital cost of nuclear energy per kilowatt hour has increased, not decreased. A report from 2020 states:… the costs of renewables continue to fall due to incremental manufacturing and installation improvements, while nuclear, despite over half a century of industrial experience, continue to see costs rising.What report is that from? I hear you ask. Its from the World nuclear industry status report. Even the nuclear industry admits that it doesnt stack up.In the last parliament, the Standing Committee on the Environment and Energy held an inquiry into nuclear energy. I sat on that inquiry, and we heard from expert after expert who said the same thing: there is no evidence for nuclear energy in Australia. Dr Ziggy Switkowski, a nuclear physicist and Chancellor of RMIT, told the committee that there is no coherent business case to finance an Australian nuclear industry. There is simply no evidence that nuclear energy could or would bring cheaper power to Australia. What do all the experts agree can bring cheaper power to Australia? Renewable energy. Wind and solar. Cleaner, cheaper power is in renewables. But the Liberals and Nationals must have had their fingers in their ears during that inquiry, because the message still has not sunk in. So here I am, once again standing up for our community.I was highly amused recently when the Liberals on the South Coast whipped themselves into a frenzy about fantasy wind project proposals. We have no wind industry on the South Coast, so there is no conversation yet to be had on these or any other projects. That didnt stop them trying to drum up hysteria, though. They said they are worried about the potential look and about the potential noise. What did I hear were whispers of the solution? Nuclear power instead. Apparently, if tourists were to come to Kiama to see our famous majestic blowhole, they would rather see a nuclear reactor blocking their view than some wind turbines off in the distance. It beggars belief.Once again, I will promise this to the people of the South Coast: I will always stand in the way of anyone who thinks our beautiful coastline can be muddied with a nuclear reactor. I will stand with each and every person, farmer, business owner and conservationist who knows that nuclear power can only do more damage than good in our community. I say to the Liberals and Nationals, both here and on the South Coast, who continue to tout this as a solution to our countrys energy needs: we will oppose you at each and every opportunity. We will not have nuclear power on the South Coast—not now, not ever.","Nuclear Energy","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs PHILLIPS (Gilmore) ","(10:14):"
"0","0","0","1","1","Pitt, Keith MP","148150","Hinkler","LNP","N/A","36"," The blackout specialists are at it again over there. The problem with their proposal is it doesnt work. That is clear to anyone that was in Queensland and saw the loss of power to entire suburbs with blackouts over the weekend. We have seen load shedding across industry because what they are proposing doesnt work.Mr Speaker, I refer you to an incredibly good article by Claire Lehmann in the Australian on 3 February: The clean energy revolution hides a very dirty secret. Its based on facts. The proposal from those opposite is some two million hectares of solar across this country—a product which lasts maybe, on average, 20 years, so every 20 years it has to be replaced. Ive had reports of a new solar farm at Gympie, which still isnt connected, that lost 20 per cent of its panels—100,000 panels—in a hailstorm over Christmas. In Ms Lehmanns article, she says that in China alone waste from solar panels would add up to 20 million tonnes of waste, 2,000 times the weight of the Eiffel Tower, by 2050, and Australia will accumulate one million tonnes of solar panel waste by 2047.We hear all of the scare campaigns and the scare tactics from those opposite. Its all about the half-life. I can tell you: heavy metals dont have a half-life. They dont expire. Theyre there forever. They are in these parts and they have to be dealt with. These are the points that we continue to make. It is about facts. Ms Lehmanns article also identifies:… nuclear reactors have produced 390,000 tonnes of spent fuel since the 1950s, solar panels are estimated to create 78 million tonnes of hazardous waste by 2050, 200 times the amount …A technology that has been in place for decades.Those opposite say that there is no place for nuclear in Australia, its a terrible solution and its awful, but thats not what they say in the United States, France, the UK, South Korea, the UAE or anywhere else that is using this technology, because it works. It is consistent. If you want something which is zero emissions and will last for decades, this is an opportunity for Australia to look at it.In the United States—once again back to facts—they produce about 2,000 metric tonnes of spent fuel every year. That sounds like a significant amount, but it is incredibly dense, which means it is very heavy by volume. That is the equivalent of less than half an Olympic swimming pool to power more than 70 million homes, and it avoids more than 400 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions. That sounds like a pretty good solution to me. In fact, the fuel can be recycled. It has more than 90 per cent of its potential energy still remaining in fuel after five years of operation in a reactor. That is straight from the United States Department of Energy. So if were going to have a debate about this, lets make it about facts. Another example: in South Korea, nuclear energy will account for 34.6 per cent of South Koreas electricity generation by 2036. It can be done.If you wish to have zero emissions in this country from energy generation, youve got until 2050, yet those opposite propose to destroy industry in this country by driving up the cost of power. We saw interventions from them before Christmas, which are now reportedly going to cost some $1 billion dollars in subsidies for the coal sector, let alone for gas. And guess what? Theres no gas to offer, because no gas company actually knows what their costs are. How do you offer a long-term contract on a product when you dont know what the government of the day are going to do in their mandatory code of practice and other changes?We hear about wind as well. Heres some information from the Parliamentary Library on wind and waste: each blade can be between 25 and 100 metres long. It is expected that by 2050 a total of 43 million tonnes of wind turbine blade waste alone will be produced and accumulated around the globe—43 million tonnes!—93 per cent of which is a composite material which simply cannot be easily recycled. In fact, no-one has found a solution for that at all.The proposal from those opposite is to have our energy systems rely on the unreliable; to rely on the weather; to accumulate literally millions of tonnes of waste right around the country, but particularly in Australia; and to level, clear and cover over two million hectares of this country with what is the equivalent of a giant tarpaulin that has to be replaced every 20 years. This is nonsense; its the reason it wont work. Sun Cable are now in administration. Why? Because, as the front page of the Australian reported, one of the proponents said it was not technically feasible—yet those opposite are suggesting that we can run solar energy from Cairns to Melbourne and it would be technically feasible.

"0","0","0","1","1","Wilson, Josh MP","265970","Fremantle","ALP","N/A","36"," The idea that Australia should waste time, resources and taxpayers money on the pursuit of nuclear energy is bananas. It is daft in the extreme. There is literally nothing in favour of that course of action. It would waste taxpayers money on projects that are fundamentally uncommercial. It would delay the supply of new energy generation. It would make us more dependent on foreign technology. It would lock in higher energy prices for decades. It would create new health and environmental risks. It would have negative geostrategic consequences. That is some scorecard right there, yet the coalition, which couldnt settle a national energy policy in nine years and presided over a decrease in energy generation capacity, has now got just one bright idea: lets go nuclear.They are obsessed with having a perpetual conversation about nuclear while complaining that we need to have a conversation about nuclear, never mind the Howard government inquiry chaired by Dr Ziggy Switkowski in 2006 or the South Australian royal commission or the New South Wales parliamentary inquiry or the inquiry by the Standing Committee on the Environment and Energy in the last parliament, back in 2019, that was chaired by the current shadow minister for energy, the member for Fairfax, and participated in by the member for Lyne. At that most recent inquiry, Dr Switkowski said:… one of the things that have changed over the last decade or so is that nuclear power has got more expensive rather than less expensive.All of the inquiries and endless conversations tell us that nuclear is the most expensive form of new generation and the slowest to deliver and the least flexible. Dont worry about the fact that nuclear is not being delivered on a commercial basis anywhere in the world or that the nuclear power industry, now more than 70 years old, has still not delivered a single permanent storage site for its high-level waste.Those are the consistent conclusions reached by the same merry-go-round nuclear conversation weve been having for decades. Thats why the existing ban under the EPBC Act is utterly sensible. It provides absolute clarity, and that clarity protects us from wasting precious time and resources. If for some insane reason you open the door to nuclear energy in Australia, the first thing you would need to do is establish a fit-for-purpose regulatory and oversight framework that would suck up millions of dollars in taxpayers money. The budget requests of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in the United States in 2022 was US$887 million. The first thing we would need, if we went down the crazy nuclear path proposed by those opposite, would be an expensive and distracting expansion of bureaucracy and red tape. The second thing you would get, for sure, is the nuclear white-shoe brigade, all the spruikers who would end up in these halls trying to chisel some taxpayers money for their pet pilot projects. Thats because nuclear energy is fundamentally uncommercial. It is funded by governments. The still-to-be-delivered NuScale small modular reactor project that is beloved of the nuclear fantasy crowd is being funded by government, and, as predicted during the inquiry we held three years ago, NuScale has revised its costs upwards and upwards, including a 53 per cent jump in January this year.For those who persist in pretending that nuclear is favoured elsewhere, this is from the World nuclear industry status report in 2019:In 2018, ten nuclear countries generated more power with renewable than with fission energy. In spite of its ambitious nuclear program, China produced more power from wind alone than from nuclear plants. In India, in the fiscal year to March 2019, not only wind, but for the first time solar out-generated nuclear, and new solar is now competitive with existing coal plants in the market. In the European Union, renewables accounted for 95 percent of all new electricity generating capacity added in the past year.The most recent report, from 2022, said:Nuclear energys share of global commercial gross electricity generation in 2021 dropped to 9.8 percent—the first time below 10 percent and the lowest value in four decades …And, it said:In 2021, wind and solar alone reached a 10.2 percent share of gross power generation, the first time, they provided more than 10 percent of global electricity and surpassed the contribution of nuclear energy.Globally, the contribution of nuclear power to our energy needs continues to decline while the contribution of renewables grows strongly year on year. The bottom line is this: we know everything we need to know about nuclear energy technology. It is uncommercial. It is eye-wateringly expensive. It is slow and inflexible. It is toxic and dangerous. It has no solution for its own waste after 70 years. Nothing tells you more about the coalitions complete abandonment of any faintly sensible or reasonable position when it comes to energy policy than the fact that the only new idea they have is for Australia to go nuclear.","Nuclear Energy","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr JOSH WILSON (Fremantle) ","(10:23):"
"0","0","0","1","1","Stevens, James MP","176304","Sturt","LP","N/A","37"," Australia already is nuclear. I rise to speak, most particularly, as a member from the city of Adelaide, which, until I heard some of the contributions earlier, I believed was receiving bipartisan support towards the decision made two years ago to obtain nuclear propelled submarines to be built in my home city of Adelaide.My colleague and friend the member for Grey, of course, has about half the worlds uranium in his electorate. He knows—and everyone in this chamber should know—that Australia has participated in the nuclear industry from many perspectives of the supply chain for many decades. As the member for Sturt, its the future that Im most concerned about when I hear some of the comments made by those opposite, particularly when it comes to the construction of nuclear submarines, which seems to now be in jeopardy, based on some of those remarks regarding safety.There are always two elements to the debate about nuclear energy. One is economic and one is about safety and environmental concerns. This motion has nothing to do with economic points to do with nuclear energy because its about removing a prohibition on it. It doesnt call for any taxpayer investment in building a particular nuclear plant, and, for those who understand the electricity market in this country—particularly in states that have a proper market operating—new generation comes into the market based on decisions that can be made by private capital, and they cant when youve got a prohibition on a certain technology. But, if there are economic arguments against any technology like nuclear energy, removing the ban wont change the economics of it, so the economic argument is completely irrelevant because no-one will put their private capital into an investment that is not going to achieve an economic return. Thats the reason that we on this side of the chamber are so passionate about markets. So, when it comes to ruling out a technology on economic grounds, that means that youve got some kind of secret plan to dramatically change the way in which the electricity markets operate in this country, and that doesnt surprise us because, of course, youve been doing that very consistently and very recently.But, on the safety side and on the dangerous rhetoric coming from those opposite, what were effectively starting to understand about this government is that they have got a prejudice against nuclear technology. That is very concerning to anyone who relies on nuclear medicine. That is concerning to anyone, and its particularly concerning to someone from a state like mine. Im representing many people who have an ambition to work in the nuclear industry into the future, particularly on the Future Submarine program, which involves nuclear technology, nuclear generation, nuclear reactors, frankly—small nuclear reactors, which are being demonised and attacked from a safety point of view. Eight of them, I understood—until I heard this contribution from those opposite recently—were going into the bellies of submarines at construction yards in my home city of Adelaide as part of what I understood to be a bipartisan commitment towards the Royal Australian Navy being given a capability of nuclear propulsion within those submarines.If that is now not the position of the government because of the points theyve made about safety when it comes to small modular reactors, then it is the most spectacular revelation with unbelievable national security consequences that I have heard in my career in this chamber. If youre now junking nuclear subs because theyre not safe and because, apparently, these reactors are dangerous and people do not want them—and weve heard even the minister rubbish the concept of small modular reactors—then Id love to hear from other members of the government from Adelaide as to whether or not they support eight nuclear reactors being in the bellies of eight submarines that are being constructed in my home city of Adelaide, generating thousands of jobs for decades to come. If these reactors are unsafe, theyre just as unsafe on the docks of Port Adelaide as they are in any other part of the nation. If you believe that the people of Adelaide are going to be unsafe with these nuclear reactors, then say so. I believe thats incorrect, and I am very passionately a supporter of nuclear submarine propulsion technology and of that happening in my home city of Adelaide. But, if the government now says thats dangerous and theyre against it, firstly, come clean on it but, secondly, that is a dramatic and frightening revelation coming out of this debate.","Nuclear Energy","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr STEVENS (Sturt) ","(10:29):"

Ill say this to the member for Sturt: we already have a nuclear reactor in Australia, at Lucas Heights in Sydney. Its currently producing really important compounds that help treat and detect cancers and other medical instruments. Its a really important industry. Ive been there, and Ive stood over our OPAL reactor and peered down into an incredible piece of engineering and technology and a really important part of our medical industry.What we are talking about here is not whether or not we should have that sort of technology being developed. Were not talking about whether or not were going to move towards nuclear powered submarines. We are talking about this fantasy that keeps being brought up by the National Party that, somehow, nuclear energy makes any sense whatsoever for the Australian energy market. I think the most compelling truth of the fantasy that is constantly being brought up by the National Party—and now, it appears, the new, young, dynamic aspects of the Liberal Party—that, if they were so keen on having a nuclear reactor to power our energy sector, you wouldve thought that maybe in the last decade, when these characters were on the treasury bench, they wouldve taken at least one step towards thinking about, maybe, potentially, sometime, building a nuclear reactor—but they didnt. They didnt go near it because it makes absolutely no financial sense whatsoever.We clearly have nuclear technology in this country. Weve had it for decades. Thats not the question. The question is: for our energy sector, does it make one skerrick of sense to have a nuclear reactor powering our homes and powering our industry? The answer is no. Why? Because the thing is so expensive. If we were going to buy a large-scale nuclear reactor we would have to do things like upskill our engineering workforce. We would need to train nuclear scientists to not just deal with a nuclear reactor but deal with an energy-creating nuclear reactor. This has been the direct advice from ANSTO; they were very clear that, in their current capability, they would need to upskill and potentially import for the first few years a whole range of skills we currently dont have in Australia—thats not to say its impossible; its just part of the process—not to mention building this thing, which would take at least 10 to 12 years. Nuclear reactors rarely get built before they are scheduled to be completed. In America right now, especially for the small modular reactors, all the time lines are being pushed back and pushed back and pushed back and pushed back. Its just not feasible. Were talking about a technology that will not be created in the next 10 to 15 years, when we talk about the capability gap and construction costs. Thats for a large-scale reactor.Then these characters like to drone on about small modular reactors, which are in prototype form around the world. Theyre not there. Theres no SMR thats been constructed in a factory and rolled out across multiple sites thats saving people millions and millions of dollars in construction and ongoing fees. It just doesnt exist yet. Now, thats not to say that at some stage we shouldnt have a look at SMRs; sure, lets have a look at them once theyve been rolled out and we know they can operate safely, they can be managed and they actually save costs. According to their own report done by the CSIRO—not when we were in government but when these were people were in government—the CSIRO made it clear that small modular reactors are still more expensive than, or as expensive as, the large-scale reactors, and way more expensive than renewables.Dont listen to the drivel that these people come into this place with, pretending that all of a sudden theyve got this really fantastic, new whiz-bang idea. In the 10 years they had a chance to help shape our energy market, all they did at each and every stage was fight renewable energy being brought into the market. They did not do one thing to pursue the course of nuclear energy—not one. They didnt do it because they know it doesnt make sense. Unless they want Australian taxpayers bills to skyrocket, they should drop this fantasy and focus on renewables because thats our future.","Nuclear Energy","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[3]","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","1","Landry, Michelle MP","249764","Capricornia","LNP","N/A","39"," Australians are in the tight grip of a cost-of-living crisis. In my seat of Capricornia I hear from families who tell me they are struggling to put food on the table and a roof over their heads. Family owned businesses are battling to keep their doors open. Rising costs and supplies, manufacturing, and transport and energy are tearing these businesses down. One of the greatest challenges we currently face is skyrocketing energy prices. Now more than ever, we need to be working towards an effective and reliable means of energy production.The Labor government have been absorbed in their need to meet climate change targets. They are relying heavily on renewables to deliver 82 per cent of Australias energy supply by 2030 to reach their climate objectives. Renewable energy does have its part to play, but it is being set up to fail by Labors complementary technology policies. Despite plans for over 80 per cent renewable energy by 2030, investment in this sector has plummeted since Labor came to government.The Albanese governments plans to decarbonise the economy are not working. After just six months in government, they have already broken their promise to reduce our power bills by $275. In their October budget, it was predicted that electricity prices would increase by 55 per cent this year. Labors panic-stricken legislation before Christmas to enforce a price fix on the energy market only created further pressure. Their rushed policies will result in bill blowouts and more blackouts.The Albanese government is losing control of domestic supply. Their policies are restricting the use of our gas supplies and the development of gas resources that we have available. Without adequate access to energy-creating materials, it further forces us to rely on energy resources from overseas, especially from China. Our families are suffering and businesses are on their knees while they wait for Labor to find a tangible solution to this issue.The Australian Workers Union estimates there will be 800,000 job losses if a solution is not found to drop energy prices. A local manufacturing business in my electorate has told me that, if something is not done to stop the increase in electricity prices, it will jeopardise their trade with overseas countries. Higher production costs have to be passed onto the consumer, leaving them struggling to be competitive in an already volatile overseas market. This family owned business has been around for generations. They have supported hundreds of locals with jobs, contributed significantly to the economy, and helped put manufacturing in Central Queensland on the map. This is just one business out of many across my electorate of Capricornia that is facing the same challenges.We need to look at better short- and long-term solutions to our energy crisis. In the short to medium term, the focus needs to be on supply. While in government, the coalition ensured that gas continued to come onto the market to support the demand for power. Unfortunately, the current government has not been engaging with the market and the states to unlock more gas for use during this energy crisis.Labor has no long-term solution. They are floundering and taking stabs in the dark, which threatens to leave Australians in the dark. Now is the time to talk nuclear and the role that it can play alongside other technologies to reduce how we pay for electricity and strengthen our manufacturing businesses. In order to achieve an outcome that meets climate change objectives while also lowering the cost of energy, our focus must move to new technology.Countries all over the world are successfully harnessing a range of technologies, including nuclear energy, to assist in lowering power prices. Thirty-three nations are currently operating with nuclear power, while another 50 are working on implementing nuclear energy programs to fix their power price crisis. Nuclear power constitutes 70 per cent of Frances energy supply. The United Kingdom, a country not unlike our own, has plans underway for nuclear energy to form 25 per cent of its energy mix by 2050. These countries are ensuring they have reliable and low-cost solutions to power their nations.Australia possesses the largest uranium reserves in the world and is the worlds third-largest supplier of this resource, but we do not power our own country with nuclear energy. This untapped energy source produces no greenhouse gas emissions during operation and has a 24/7 base-load power that can be adjusted to meet the sporadic nature of renewable resources like solar and wind. Nuclear ticks all the boxes: friendly to the environment, reliable and cheap. Now is the time to begin discussions on nuclear and help our nation to begin to recover from this crisis.","Nuclear Energy","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms LANDRY (Capricornia) ","(10:39):"
"0","0","0","1","1","Perrett, Graham Douglas MP","HVP","Moreton","ALP","N/A","40"," The Nationals are banging the drum on nuclear energy. Its deja vu again, isnt it? Its always the same. I will include a few Liberal members in this as well who are representing the people in the bush. Anytime theyre asked by the people in the bush to do something about dangerous climate change and reducing emissions, they go straight to the old nuclear-power playbook: If irrelevant, break glass. Weve heard it all before. Its funny—I heard the member for Capricornia talk about nuclear power, and she didnt mention the coal-fired power station the Nationals committed to in Collinsville that they didnt deliver when in office.The fundamental flaw in this motion right from the word go—with their happy go-to strategy—is that they didnt actually do anything about nuclear power when they were in government. No-one should be under any misapprehension here; this is just another attempt to undermine this countrys need to transition to renewables. We didnt see former minister Pitt or the member for Cook—the other minister for mines—bring in a policy for nuclear energy when they were in government. They had a decade to move on their nuclear ambitions and did not do so. If this is such an important and urgent need, why didnt they lift a finger during those dark ages from 2013 to 2022?This mornings posturing is nothing more than a rearguard attempt to undermine and deny a transition to renewables—the equivalent of a policy Hail Mary, for those who are hanging out for the American football final coming up next week. As the energy minister, Chris Bowen, said in parliament last year:What this represents is the third quiver in the armoury of those who dont want to see Australia take action on climate change. They accompany delay and denial with distraction.Everyone knows, except those in the LNP, that nuclear energy is by far the most expensive form of energy. Compounding this further, as Australia doesnt have much of a nuclear industry, it makes it even more expensive Down Under.Youve heard in the debate those opposite talking about the small modular reactors, or SMRs, and about how successfully theyre being built right across the globe. The opposition leader spruiked that theyre being built in Canada, France, Japan, South Korea, the UK and the US, but guess what? The number of SMRs being built in those countries is a big fat zero. The only country where we have at least some movement beyond an announcement is in the US, where the figures for the price of energy from proposed SMRs is going up and up and up. From 2016 to 2020, NuScale and UAMPS said that the power price of the SMR would be just US$55 per megawatt hour. Thats competitive, as the member for Hunter would know. He knows energy very well. But then it went up to US$58 per megawatt hour. And get this! The increased price included the project being halved in size and output. A more detailed report recently says it has gone up to US$89 per megawatt hour. In anyones language, except maybe that of the member for Fairfax, US$89 per megawatt hour isnt cheap energy.But its actually bleaker than that. When you dig under the surface, the project expects to receive a US$1.4 billion contribution from the Department of Energy, which will deliver an estimated US$30 per megawatt hour subsidy through the Inflation Reduction Act, on top of the US taxpayer pumping in more than US$4 billion in subsidies to NuScale and UAMPS. Its hardly a ringing endorsement of where private capital should be investing. So we have an actual SMR project heavily subsidised by the US taxpayers that shrunk in scope by 50 per cent, delivering sometime in the never-never some of the most expensive energy on the planet at a real cost of around US$119 per megawatt hour, and thats even before it starts being built.I didnt get an invite to the oppositions nuclear love-in last year, but I think there was a bit of back-slapping about how good the SMR in the US was going to be—but look at that real cost. We know this because every energy expert with a scrap of integrity knows that nuclear is the most expensive and slowest form of energy to implement. We have cost-of-living pressures right now. We cant wait 15, 16 or 20 years to deliver a higher cost of energy. Nuclear power doesnt make sense. We know that, despite over 50 years of industrial experience, costs go up and up and up.","Nuclear Energy","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr PERRETT (Moreton) ","(10:44):"

This created Medicare out of the ashes of Medibank and provided Australians a health insurance system that is simple and affordable, to quote Dr Blewett. Thirty-nine years on, we mark the anniversary of Australias first-class, world-leading universal health system, Medicare.Labor governments have prided themselves on championing equitable, universal and affordable health care as a right for Australians. I remember before Medicare the discussions between my parents about who should go to the doctor, what our family could afford and who was sick enough to justify the cost. The green Medicare card meant that our family and Australians all around our country had access to support and medical advice they could afford. My parents relief was obvious to me. It was the Labor governments of Whitlam and Hawke that introduced these reforms. Whilst the first reforms of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme date back to the Chifley Labor government, it is Labor governments that established our world-leading healthcare system, and the Albanese government will continue to defend and strengthen it.For the first time in its 75-year history, the PBS has been amended to provide Australians with life-saving medicines at a more affordable price. With new medicines being added to the PBS monthly, it remains crucial that these medicines are accessible should Australians need them. It is the governments responsibility to ensure that there is equitable and available access to medicines and to health care. The last decade saw this dwindle. The continued freeze on Medicare forced doctors out and bulk-billing rates to drop. In communities like mine and all over Australia it is harder to see a GP, and more and more GPs can no longer afford to bulk-bill.The release last week of the report of the Strengthening Medicare Taskforce sets recommendations that the Albanese government are currently working through to turn this around and rebuild the systems that all Australians have relied on for the past four decades. Australias healthcare system ranks among the best in the world. Its an achievement to be proud of, and Labor will always be the party to defend and support it. We understand that in order for Australia to prosper it needs a healthy population, and no barrier—especially financial—should hinder a persons ability to access the health care and medications they need.The Australian people are currently facing a cost-of-living crisis, and our government should not shy away from supporting Australians during the difficult times. Thats why from 1 January 2023 the maximum co-payment has been reduced by $12.50 to the new maximum of $30. There are 3.6 million Australians who use over $30 a month in prescriptions and who, from 1 January, will save on their scripts under the Albanese government. Ive heard constituents tell me of their experiences of being prescribed life-saving cancer medication that would have cost them thousands if not tens of thousands of dollars and who can now focus on getting better rather than worrying about how or whether they can afford the treatment prescribed.But Ive also met with constituents with chronic conditions who, unfortunately, make choices about the medications they can afford. This is becoming more and more common as cost-of-living pressures mount, and it is obviously the most vulnerable who are disproportionately affected. Australia must never be a country where people must choose between providing food and shelter for their family and seeing their doctor or filling a script. There should never be a moment in this country when people are forced to ration health care or face bankruptcy, as was the case before the introduction of universal health care in Australia.Labors measures to reduce the cost of vital medications is another step in that direction. We promised in our 2022 election platform to reduce the price of medicines, and we delivered: $190 million a year directly into the pockets of Australians. We are a country that ensures that all Australians receive the medical care they need regardless of income. That should always be the pillar of our healthcare system. Labor is the party of Medicare, and the Albanese government will ensure that our healthcare system is continuously defended and strengthened.","Medicare","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms STANLEY (Werriwa—Government Whip) ","(10:49):"

"0","0","0","1","1","Webster, Anne MP","281688","Mallee","NATS","N/A","42","Dr WEBSTER ( Mallee ) ( 10:55 ): The member for Werriwa has moved that the House note that Australias healthcare system is based on equitable and fair access for all Australians. In comparison with our global counterparts—the US and the UK—this is true, but in regional Australia in particular there are many who would say it has also deteriorated to the point of crisis. The reality in the bush is higher mortality and morbidity rates than the city.I stand here in this House of government for all Australians. Every decision made here should be based on the principles of fairness and equity. However, if the healthcare system is based on equitable and fair access then why do those who live in regional centres perpetually have poorer outcomes? What may be true in Western Sydney is not reflected in Mallee or, indeed, most other regional centres. In my maiden speech I said your health status should not depend on your postcode. But it does, and I will continue to state this inequity until there is significant change—not change in rhetoric but change in outcomes. There is cold, hard evidence of the unfairness and inequity Labor are helping to perpetuate—for example, in the expansion of the distribution priority areas. This policy is harming access to doctors in regional centres, making a bad situation worse.I currently have a survey on my website for people to tell their story about their access to health care in Mallee. Sadly, but not surprisingly, the results are not good. Nearly 2,000 people have written a response. Thirty per cent of respondents say they do not have a regular GP, 40 per cent of respondents have put off seeing a GP because its too hard to get an appointment and 33 per cent of people have presented to their local hospital because they could not see a GP.The best health outcomes occur when patients have longstanding relationships with a doctor who can provide ongoing care. As one doctor said to me last week: When you have been seeing the same patient for 16 years you know when they walk into the room if something is not right. Continuity of care is everything in primary care and that is what this government does not understand. When patients have no ongoing GP it puts pressure on already stretched hospital emergency departments.Where is the fair and equitable access? An 80-year-old cancer patient told me she puts off going to the clinic because of the weeks she has to wait, even though she knows she would be better to have regular check-ups. A young mother told me that since her clinic in Mildura closed she has been forced to send her two young children to two different clinics while she and her husband attend a third, and they still cant get a regular doctor. Many people have said it takes up to eight weeks to get an appointment. These people are not receiving fair and equitable access to health care. Even worse, just last week I spoke with a nurse practitioner in my electorate who provides the only health service in a small town. She has had to dip into her superannuation to manage her operational running costs. That is ridiculous, you might say, but such is her dedication to her local community. The fact is Medicare rebates and funding models must improve for her to be able to continue to offer services in that rural town.To pretend there is a silver bullet is naive, I know. Thin workforces are just one of the problems facing equitable healthcare delivery in regional areas right across Australia. Decisions made by the Labor government have contributed to inequity and unfairness, however, in rural and remote locations. For example, in July 2022 one of the first decisions made by the new Labor government was, as I mentioned, to expand the distribution priority areas. As a result, international medical graduates have the option to move to an outer urban setting rather than regional areas with the same incentives. The current system cannot provide fair and equitable access to health care without an incentive for doctors to practise in all corners of Australia. We need solutions, and we need them now. We need solutions to doctor shortages and, indeed, all health professional shortages. The regional workforce needs to have its voice heard.","Medicare","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","1","Reid, Gordon MP","300126","Robertson","ALP","N/A","42"," February 2023 marks the 39th anniversary of the introduction of Medicare by the government of Prime Minister Hawke. Australias healthcare system is based on equitable and fair access for all Australians. It was in my maiden speech to this parliament that I spoke about how our healthcare system is based on fair and equitable access for all. Our hospitals, for example, including those in my region, Gosford Hospital and Wyong Hospital, are places where it does not matter who you are, it doesnt matter where you come from and it doesnt matter the circumstances that lead to your presentation. You will be cared for, and you will be cared for for free. Thats due to a hard-fought Labor initiative that saw a little green card come into the lives of all Australians, a little green card with the word that represents universal access and complete access: Medicare.This is only going to improve with the introduction of our urgent care centres, one of which my electorate on the Central Coast is receiving. We are creating a new model of care in Australia, one that is seen and established right across the world in different nations—access to care if you are too sick to see the GP and not sick enough to see the emergency department. It is a service that will treat adults, a service that will treat children, a service with extended operating hours and, most importantly, a service that will be bulk-billed. This is part of our promise, the Albanese-Labor governments promise, to strengthen Medicare and improve access to Medicare services.A major issue that I see in the emergency departments on the Central Coast is the rationing of medications, meaning that patients are taking their prescribed medications every second day, every third day, every fourth day or sometimes once a week. This is all because theyve been unable to afford their prescription medications. I can think of multiple clinical examples where this has been a significant issue. Lets take a patient whos taking a blood thinner, apixaban, which is Eliquis, in an attempt to prevent a blood clot causing a stroke secondary to an abnormal heart rhythm, such as atrial fibrillation. They are all very common conditions throughout our community. Patients would only be taking medication infrequently, and, therefore, this condition would lead to that patient presenting to the emergency department with a significant physical deficit—inability to use their arms, inability to use their legs and walk, inability to see, inability to swallow or the inability to talk—because of a stroke.I think of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus presenting with several complications secondary to consistently elevated levels of blood sugar, including blindness because of damage to the retina; kidney failure requiring dialysis; damage to the nerves in the extremities and issues with the blood vessels in the legs, leading to wounds which get infected and requiring amputation of those limbs. I think of stroke. I think of coronary artery disease and heart disease, just to name a few. These are only two examples where the patients were unable to afford their medications, so they would ration them, as I said, every second day, every third day or once a week, or sometimes not take them at all. And these are two examples of patients who have chronic diseases where the sequelae are preventable if the medications are taken on a regular basis as prescribed by their doctor.Im proud to be part of a government, this Labor government, that is improving medication access for millions of Australians, including thousands on the Central Coast. From 1 January 2023 the government reduced the cost of Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme co-payments by $12.50 to a maximum of $30. This is not only a cost-of-living measure but also a measure that will prevent unnecessary trips to the doctor and unnecessary presentations to the emergency department, and it will ultimately save lives.","Medicare","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr REID (Robertson) ","(11:00):"
"0","0","0","1","1","Birrell, Sam MP","288713","Nicholls","NATS","N/A","43"," I am very pleased to rise to offer a belated happy birthday to Medicare. Its worth celebrating the establishment of a scheme for basic health care for all Australians. Its also worth noting that, while the Whitlam government introduced what was then known as Medibank, it was the Fraser coalition government that established the levy of 2.5 per cent on income to fund it. Medibank closed in 1981 but was revived and rebadged as a Medicare in 1984.No system is perfect. Medicare has had to adapt and change to meet advances in diagnostic medicine and treatments, and, while the member for Werriwa is happy to boast in her motion that as of 1 January 2023, the government will have reduced the cost of Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme co-payments, there is no mention that, also as of 1 January 2023, the government has slashed by half the number of Medicare subsidised psychology sessions. These are really important, and I urge the government to reconsider this cut.A concerned psychologist in my electorate took the time to interrogate the clinics patient records from 2016. The research showed that the percentage of clients discharged, once their mental health disorder had been appropriately treated, rose from 52 per cent in 2016 to 100 per cent in 2020 when the coalition increased the number of Medicare funded sessions to 20. In this clinic, it remained at 100 per cent through 2021 and 2022. So everyone with those 20 sessions was getting the care they needed. In 2016, 48 per cent of clients were discharged with only a partial improvement in their mental health, because they ran out of sessions. That dropped to zero when the coalition doubled the sessions.The Labor government has voted to enshrine cuts to Medicare-subsidised mental health for all Australians. These cuts have come at a time when Australians in my electorate and others are facing natural disasters and cost-of-living pressures and when household energy bills are skyrocketing.An important thing to focus on is the workforce shortages that affect our health system. Medicare is a great system, but it needs the professional staff to operate properly. The shortages in our health system disproportionately impact our regional and rural areas. The coalition had, and has, a solution for Nicholls. We committed $19.5 million to fund a collaborative effort by La Trobe University and Goulburn Valley Health to establish a dedicated rural clinical health school in Shepparton. This would train nurses, midwives and allied health professionals of the future. They would train in a regional setting and, more often than not, based on the outcomes from the rural doctor training —which the coalition improved in my region—would choose to continue to work in regional areas. Labor came to government and chose to scrap the funding stream that supported that clinical health school. New governments have that choice, but I dont agree with it, and I urge the government to reconsider. I think the government has got to address the current skills gaps and help train the healthcare workforce of the future, particularly in regional and rural areas.The rural clinical health school proposed for Shepparton, to service northern Victoria, is worth another look. Its a strong collaboration between La Trobe University and Goulburn Valley Health. Itll provide increased opportunities for young people across the area to pursue a career in health and undertake study locally. We need that in our hospitals and our aged-care facilities. The Nationals were very keen to fund this not because it was our idea or our policy but because it was the best fit to tackle critical work shortages in the region.Medicare is a great institution, but it only works if you have access to health care. You need doctors, nurses, midwives and allied health professionals to deliver that care. There is a long-term and critical shortage of health, aged-care and community-care workforce at Goulburn Valley Health, with double the critical numbers required for the future. The proposed Goulburn Valley clinical health school would complement existing campuses of La Trobe University and GOTAFE in central Shepparton, including current and future planned extensions to expand educational opportunities in the region. Im sure there are other regions with the right combination of hospital and university that could come together. They just need some government support to make this a reality.So I urge the government—and I want to work constructively and collaboratively with those opposite, with the Minister for Health and Aged Care, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government—to look at this clinical health school. Its a no-brainer. Itll be a great thing for our young people. Itll be a great thing for moving young people through training and into looking after our most vulnerable people: those in aged care and those who need acute health care.","Medicare","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BIRRELL (Nicholls—Deputy Nationals Whip) ","(11:05):"

It is so important we celebrate a milestone such as this. It is important that we note the milestones of any government service that is so important to the direct wellbeing of Australians.Medicare has survived through eight prime ministers and a handful of recessions, epidemics and pandemics. Medicare was created to ensure access for all Australians to Australias world-class healthcare system when Australians need it. It is a promise that, no matter what, every Australian should be afforded the dignity of health care. It does not matter their skin colour or income or gender or age. In Australia, something so important does not matter; all that matters is that when Australians need help they can get it.Medicare has had many victories since it was born. Australians all over the country have deeply personal stories about Medicare and about how, without Medicare, there could be one less place set at the dinner table. Each of Medicares greatest victories can look very different for each family. To me, it means that my eldest daughter was able to focus on fighting cancer and getting well, and not on the cost of her fight or whether she could afford it. Her country had her back.There is still work to be done to make health care more affordable and accessible for all Australians. I am pleased to celebrate that, as of 1 January this year, the government has reduced the cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme co-payment by $12.50 to a maximum of $30. This means that medicine will be cheaper and more accessible for Australian families. This reduction in the cost of medicine is just one step in our ongoing commitment to improve the accessibility and affordability of health care for all Australians. We will continue to work to ensure that all Australians have access to the medical care they need when they need it.The reduction in the PBS co-payment does not just ease cost-of-living pressures for Australians who are struggling with their health and struggling with their wallet. It is so much more. This says something about Australia as a nation, as a community and as individuals. We want to be there for one another. We want to support people when they are in the fight of their lives, or for their lives. We want you to win. We want you to know that your community and your nation are together with you, even at a time when you may feel like the loneliest person in the most difficult place of your life. We want to help you so you dont have to look into your wallet before you decide to get better. We will cover the bill because we know that you as an individual would want to do the same for us.That is what makes this country so great. As individuals, people want to cover the bill and, as a community and as a nation, we want to, and so we do. Many of us owe you our lives, and we make it up to each other before and after we ever get sick. Happy anniversary, Medicare. You make me proud to be an Australian.","Medicare","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr LIM (Tangney) ","(11:10):"
"0","0","0","1","1","McIntosh, Melissa MP","281513","Lindsay","LP","N/A","44"," Id like to thank the member for Werriwa for bringing this motion to the House, but I do find it quite extraordinary that those opposite, on the government benches, are singing their own praises about fair and accessible Medicare, when over the Christmas break we saw an extraordinary cut to Medicare when it comes to mental health. Perhaps those opposite havent been keeping up to date with whats been going on within their own government. The Minister for Health and Aged Care cut access to Medicare for thousands of people. Over a million mental health sessions have been held since the coalition government doubled the accessibility of mental health sessions during the pandemic, from 10 to 20. It is quite extraordinary that the minister for health cut those sessions, when we certainly are not on the other side of the pandemic. In fact, today many people are very much struggling with their mental health when it comes to COVID-19.This cut was made over the Christmas period, when so many people really struggle with their mental health. Not only was it a poorly timed cut to mental health sessions; it was a pretty heartless cut. Psychologists contacted me from right across this country really concerned about the mental health of their patients, because those patients were saying, We dont know what to do, because we need those sessions. I had mothers write to me saying that, because their children had been able to access the 20 sessions, they were now interacting with other children in the schoolyard, and they had more confidence to go out and about. And those mothers could not afford to pay for any more.This is what were left with: a heartless cut over Christmas, during a pandemic, when people are suffering the most. Theyre not only suffering with the pandemic; theyre suffering through the cumulative impacts of multiple disasters—floods and fires. Ive stood with people when theyve lost everything due to floods, when their homes are no longer standing, when they are trying to pick up their lives. They were suffering trauma. They were suffering mental health problems because of the cumulative impacts of these disasters.Many people asked the health minister to reverse these cuts. Psychologists across the country called for it. In fact, the minister promised he would hold a roundtable with stakeholders to come up with a better solution. So we waited in hope. But that roundtable did not produce a reinstatement of what had been cut. In fact, just days after, the minister released a report from his Strengthening Medicare Taskforce. This report, which looked into the state of Medicare and provided recommendations to improve Medicare in this country, barely mentioned mental health at all. It certainly did not prioritise the mental health of people in this country. The Medicare report did not mention mental health, yet 70 per cent of GPs across this country say that one of the top three reasons people come in and see them is for mental health issues. So it is extraordinary that we have a cut to Medicare mental health sessions, and now the Medicare report does not even mention mental health. Perhaps thats because the minister did not have one mental health professional on his Strengthening Medicare Taskforce—not one. It is extraordinary, when we have a mental health crisis in this country, that the minister has cut the mental health sessions from 20 to 10, he has not mentioned mental health in the Medicare report and he did not have one mental health representative on his task force.What is this telling the Australian people? It is telling them that their minister for health is not listening and, worse, he is possibly not caring. When we have multiple disasters, when we are still in the midst of a pandemic, when we have young people struggling with being locked up through COVID, when we have a mental health crisis, this government is not listening. This government needs to start taking the mental health of Australians a lot more seriously.","Medicare","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs McINTOSH (Lindsay) ","(11:14):"
"0","0","0","1","1","Perrett, Graham Douglas MP","HVP","Moreton","ALP","N/A","45"," I thank the member for Werriwa for bringing this motion about the fact that Medicare was introduced by the Hawke government in 1984. Medicare is the nations universal health insurance scheme—for young, for old, for rich, for poor, for bush, for city, for those in sickness and those in health. The system guarantees all Australians access to a wide range of health and hospital services at low or no cost. I would like to table the member for Tangneys speech, if I could. I will stick to what my staff have written for me.When the Hawke government introduced Medicare, the quality of health care depended on many factors, including where you lived and who you chose as your parents. Mostly, it was about how much you earned. It was tough if you got sick and couldnt afford a doctor; you had to rely on the chemist, or some sort of family remedy, or prayers. It was rare for people to ever consider going to the hospital. A voluntary health insurance arrangement set up by the Menzies government meant doctors fees were met by a combination of one-third government benefit, one-third private health fund benefit and one-third out-of-pocket payment by the patient.Here is what Bob Hawke said in a speech delivered on 5 March 1984, a month after establishing Medicare:It was totally unacceptable that nearly two million Australians were for several years without private insurance or the Commonwealth governments cover provided to pensioners, unemployed and low income earners. Many of the two million were simply unable to afford the cost of private insurance…Labors Medicare scheme allowed Australians to obtain the medical treatment they needed regardless of how much they earned. We know the consequences when people cant get early access to a GP. Early access identifies health problems before they become acute and costly for the individual and for the economy. The Labor Party has a history of legislating for the common good. Our belief in access to universal health care is an enduring value. We are the party of Medicare. We have a history of defending Medicare.Sadly, coalition governments have a long history of running Medicare down. It was Gough Whitlam who first introduced the system of universal health care in Australia called Medibank. Subsequently, access to Medibank was heavily restricted under the Fraser government. Then, in turn, the Hawke government introduced Medicare and reinstated universal access. Who can forget John Howards promise to Australians that he would not touch Medicare? Upon receiving the keys to the Lodge, he proceeded to cut funding to Medicare, raise the safety net threshold, and coerce and scare Australians into taking up private health insurance. The Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments froze the Medicare rebate, tried to introduce a GP tax three times and planned to privatise the Medicare payment system.During the 2016 election campaign, a tough election campaign, we were packing up after a community barbecue in Moreton when two cars full of senior citizens pulled up. My office started to explain to the people that the barbecue was over, but they said. Never mind. Were Liberal voters and we hate what Malcolm Turnbull wants to do to Medicare. Weve come to sign your petition and we hope were not too late. All sensible Australians understand the value of universal health care.There are now too many stories of Australians not being able to see a bulk-billing doctor or of GPs changing from bulk-billing to mixed billing. Only this week, sadly, I met with a Moreton GP who, after practising on the south side, said it is no longer financially viable to run his practice. He loves helping battlers. I could see the passion that he had for medicine. I take my hat off to every GP that is out there doing their bit for people healthwise. This guy loved helping battlers, but hes not sure if he can continue and doubts that anybody would even want to buy his practice. Only 15 per cent of graduates go into general practice; there arent many of them. Sadly, the coalition froze the Medicare rebate for six years, ripped billions out of primary care and caused gap fees to skyrocket. Its no wonder that devoted doctors like the gentleman I mentioned are walking away from general practice. They are exhausted.Every new Labor government has to clean up the Liberals mess. But theres no easy fix. These problems have been festering for a decade, and, as we know, they have gone septic in some suburbs and many parts of the bush. The Albanese government is committed to investing in general practice and strengthening Medicare. The Strengthening Medicare Taskforce is identifying the best ways to boost affordability, improve access and deliver support for patients.","Medicare","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr PERRETT (Moreton) ","(11:19):"

Once again, hes fallen into the trap of blaming the coalition for all the ills of the nation whilst praising the Labor government. I stand at the dispatch box and say that Medicare is a good system. I stand at the dispatch box and say that we have the very best health system in the world, and we should be proud of that. If you dont believe me, go anywhere else in the world and see for yourself the sort of health system they have in place in the country you are visiting. Thank your lucky stars that you can return to Australia, that you live in Australia and that you have governments—plural—of all political persuasions that have pumped money into Medicare and into the health system.We just heard from the member for Moreton. This is the member who, when speaking about infrastructure, questioned why, if a road hadnt been sealed for 70 years, you would seal it now. I recommend that he read Clare Armstrongs report in the Daily Telegraph today about the crisis in health care at the moment, particularly in remote Australia. I know those opposite are very much pushing the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice and the Uluru Statement from the Heart. They would do well to read not just the report but also Ms Armstrongs op-ed and the editorial in the Daily Telegraph, the Sydney newspaper, today.In the editorial they talk about the Royal Flying Doctor Service, which is, indeed, financially supported by the Daily Telegraph as part of the groundbreaking Bush Summit. I know theyve held several of those and found that almost 45,000 people in remote Australia have no access to any type of primary healthcare service within a one-hour drive, as recommended by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. I know a lot of people choose to live in remote Australia. Many of those people who live in remote areas have to do so because they are providing the food and fibre for this nation.I know—and, Deputy Speaker Freelander, I know you also know this well—that the head of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, Trent Twomey, has made comments in recent days and weeks about the health system. Whilst I acknowledge that the health system is exceptional, there are things that we can change. There are things that we certainly can improve and need to improve. Mr Twomey said:… the COVID-19 pandemic—during which pharmacists helped with the vaccine rollout—Indeed, they did, and I thank them for that—had shifted power and made decision-makers more likely to listen to the guilds proposals to improve the health system. The Pharmacy Guild represents about 5900 community pharmacy owners.Mr Twomey was quoted as saying:The point Im saying is, the hospital system is under strain, and other elements of primary care are under strain ... Money is not the solution to system reform, he said.Twomey said the only solution to Australias health crisis was fully utilising all health practitioners to their full scope. Nurses, yes. Dentists, yes. Pharmacists as well, he said.I agree with him on that point. I know the role that chemists play in rural areas, particularly when, in some of those very small country towns, they are the only primary healthcare deliverer because—as the member for Forrest just pointed out—there is a lack of general practitioners.Coming from a regional area, I know how important this is. There needs to be a balance. We need to strike the right balance. That is why Im very pleased that my home town, Wagga Wagga, which is the head of a very large Murrumbidgee Valley healthcare provider, is looking after a quarter of a million people through the Wagga Wagga Base Hospital and the Murrumbidgee Local Health District.In 2020 the then federal regional health minister, the member for Parkes, put in place a new model to boost access to GPs in our region and make rural generalist training more attractive for young doctors. The model, which was launched on 12 October 2020 in Wagga Wagga, gives junior doctors interested in working in rural general practice in the Murrumbidgee region the experience, exposure and qualifications they need to become rural generalist doctors: GPs with additional skills such as obstetrics or emergency medicine. I know that, coupled with the Murray-Darling medical school that I put in place, is going to make a real difference to get GPs in country areas. They can work with chemists. They can indeed work through the Medicare system.I will repeat my comment from the outset of this speech: in Australia, we have the best medical system of all and we can improve upon it.","Medicare","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr McCORMACK (Riverina) ","(11:24):"

However, the government must also address the workforce shortage, which the sector has been crying out for. Im moving this motion to provide some urgently needed practical solutions following my consultations with childcare providers in my electorate of Fowler. It aims to address the demand for childcare services the bill will create and the current workforce shortage, and to better meet the needs of workers, children and parents.In my electorate of Fowler theres a higher percentage of children from culturally and linguistically diverse and refugee backgrounds—an indicator that there are special needs, and they would require additional support, in particular for low-income families. Development vulnerability needs to be addressed early, as it becomes more expensive later. Theres so much at stake socially and financially if we continue to get this wrong, and so much to gain if we get it right.I met with Kindikids Edensor Park, KidsMatter and 3 Bears Childcare at Cabramatta, Growth Mindset at Bonnyrigg and Kids World Kindy in Bossley Park, and thanked them for their valuable time sharing their experiences with me and their commitment to the families of Fowler. The feedback was unanimous in the forum. Burnout is huge in the sector. There are staff shortages across the board. There is a huge increase in children with diverse and special needs, and there is not sufficient government support to cater for this growing need.As legislators we must transform how the childcare sector is viewed and valued by inspiring young people to be part of the sector and offering important opportunities for upskilling and better conditions to encourage people to stay for the long term. Workers in the field say they are often thought of as just glorified babysitters. I want them to know that they are not, because they play an important role in caring, nurturing and teaching our young Australians. We entrust our children in their care, and, as a government, we need to ensure there is legislation and policy to better support the sector.I propose solutions to increase the number of early childcare teachers in the system and ease the shortage such as: simplifying the New South Wales staffing ratio to be equivalent to the national quality framework; simplifying the early learning cadetship training model so that candidates can upskill to an early childhood teacher and study at the same time, or have their level of experience be taken into account if they want to become an ECT; and removing the need for university students already working in childcare facilities to do their practical course at another provider, as these demands are removing a valuable workforce from the current employer.Weve also been told there needs to be additional funding for the inclusion development fund subsidy to help support the inclusion of the growing number of children with diverse and additional needs. Providers with over 15 years experience have told me that the increase in children with diverse and additional needs is unprecedented, especially in my electorate of Fowler.The current funding model is not working. The process to apply for inclusion of support workers is burdensome and there are out-of-pocket costs for the providers, with many centres stressing they cannot afford the out-of-pocket costs. These centres are not immune to the cost-of-living crisis. Currently the government funds the service $25 an hour in order to hire an inclusion support worker, but the true cost for this additional staff member, with superannuation, WorkCover and leave, is about $35 an hour. This additional staff member is crucial to ensure childrens needs are met.This is a recipe for disaster for all involved. There are children and families who need additional support but cannot access a service provider. Sometimes the focus on special needs often means other children miss out on required attention, placing huge burdens on teachers. I recommend that the government cover all employee costs of inclusion support services.Lastly, families in Western Sydney are missing out on crucial subsidies, due to the childcare subsidy application process. The process must be simplified to ensure families where English is a second language are not missing out on this much-needed subsidy.I ask the government to seriously consider the practical solutions Ive put forward in this motion that will immensely support the childcare sector, children and families like those in my community of Fowler.","Child Care","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms LE (Fowler) ","(11:30):"

"0","0","0","1","1","Repacholi, Dan MP","298840","Hunter","ALP","N/A","48"," It seems as though after nearly a decade of neglect and inaction the opposition, many of which made up the former government, have suddenly decided to care about child care. Quality child care is a vital part of a young persons development, and it is the Labor Party who knows this, and it is the government who cares about education and child care.Yes, thats right; we care about child care so much that were actually going to do something to fix the issues that were ignored by the previous government. I know that this may be foreign to those opposite, but the concept is quite simple: its just the opposite of doing nothing and ignoring the issues that are right in front of you. I know that doing nothing is something that those opposite are well acquainted with, so it shouldnt be too hard to figure out what the opposite is.Child care is vitally important, but in recent years it hasnt been affordable or accessible for many families. Research shows that many children who participate in quality preschool programs are more likely to arrive at school equipped with the social, cognitive and emotional skills they need to help them continue to learn. These skills dont just benefit children throughout primary school; theyre skills theyll have for their whole lives. Higher levels of educational success, employment and social skills have all been linked to moderate levels of participation in quality early childhood education. These benefits should not be restricted to those few that can afford child care or the few that are lucky enough to be able to secure a place. The benefits dont stop there. More children in child care means more parents who are able to get back to work, which means more businesses with eased pressure on staffing shortages.Again, this motion will see a list of issues rattled off by those opposite as if its the first time this has been brought to their attention. They do a really good job of pretending these issues didnt exist less than a year ago when they were in government. But, of course, we all know that these issues have existed for much longer than the past few months. Just ask any parent of a young child in my electorate and they will tell you how hard it was for them to get their children into child care and just how much it costs. The Upper Hunter is one of the worst childcare deserts in Australia, with there being over five children waiting for a place in child care for every one place available. One in five is simply not good enough. That is four in five parents who cannot get back into the workforce sooner. That is one in five children with a head start on their journey of education. Thats four in five children and families that are being left behind.But this government leaves no one behind, and thats why we introduced the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Cheaper Child Care) Bill 2022. Child care should be accessible, and it shouldnt only be for the ones that can afford it. Thats exactly what this bill is going to make a reality. Because of this bill, 6,300 families in the Hunter will be better off, 6,300 more families will be able to access child care, and 6,300 more families will be able to afford child care without having to sacrifice something else in their life to make sure their children have the best start to their life. This bill will ensure that 6,300 more parents will be able to get back to work. Thats 6,300 more employers with additional staff. Most importantly: because of this governments bill, 6,300 more children in the Hunter will have access to early childhood education, a head start in learning and a head start in developing both independence and vital social skills. This bill is good for children, good for parents and good for our country. It is a very welcome beacon of light in my electorate, which is crying out for more accessible child care right now.","Child Care","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr REPACHOLI (Hunter) ","(11:35):"
"0","0","0","1","1","Tink, Kylea MP","300124","North Sydney","IND","N/A","49"," I rise today to speak on the motion moved by the member for Fowler. Despite the wonderful oratory we just heard from the member for Hunter, I make the point that this motion is actually about access to those who can provide child care, not just those seeking to access it.Many people may think that the electorates of Fowler and North Sydney have little in common, but were more alike than not, especially when it comes to the issues of childcare affordability and availability. Like Fowler, and many other electorates across the country, North Sydney is a vibrant and diverse community, with 50 per cent of people living in the area having been born overseas and 30 per cent speaking a language other than English at home. Also, much like Fowler, families in North Sydney are suffering the knock-on effects of a severe shortage of early childhood care and education spots.Research consistently shows the considerable economic benefits of spending on early childhood education and high-quality care—quite simply, the more families who can access early childhood education to help their childs development and enable parents to work as they wish, the better. But successive governments from both sides of the aisle, both federal and state, have failed to adequately monitor the needs of this sector. So we find ourselves requiring urgent and necessary reform.Childcare fees in North Sydney are the highest in the country and run substantially above the government benefit rates. In North Sydney, for families on an average household income, the net cost after current subsidies of placing one child in day care five days a week is about $23,000 per year, or nearly 20 per cent of their income. These costs are negatively impacting many. Theyre preventing parents—most often mothers—from working when they would like to; deterring families, in some instances, from having more children; placing an expensive burden on older members of the family as they step in to help with care; and, perhaps worst of all, leading to missed opportunities for children to benefit from early education.But, as is often the case, while those of us who sit in government may struggle to find ways forward, those in business or on the front line see opportunities for innovative ways to overcome hurdles. Today I stand to speak for those currently managing early childhood care and education facilities across my community to provide some insight into the challenges they have identified and, importantly, the possible solutions they see. I thank them in advance for their considered thoughts.A long day care centre in Lane Cove recently told my office that every service in our area—and many more that they were aware of—were suffering immensely with respect to the dire skills shortage. The shortage of educators is, in their words, absolutely frightening, and, as business owners, theyve had to consider the operations of their business. But, as small-business owners often do, whilst they see the challenges presented, they also give significant thought to potential solutions. They identified that many of their childcare educators are on student visas, the conditions of which mean they must move interstate or to a regional area in order to extend their visa or improve their pathway to permanent residency. This required move disrupts not only the centre but also the local community, where those people contribute significantly. They suggested, then, that the government consider changing this visa requirement for early childhood carers and educators to remove this disruption of the workforce. Its a simple and obvious solution, but I wonder how difficult it would be for us to enact.We know we need at least 9,000 early educators to ensure services are able to accommodate the increasing demand for places for children. In this context, ensuring early educators are also paid appropriately for their skilled and valuable work is key. We must move to shore up the workforce by looking at temporary wage bonuses and addressing the 30 per cent wage disparity between early childhood educators and primary school teachers.Another locally run centre highlighted the fee differentials between profit, not-for-profit and family run centres as a key concern. They suggested this could be addressed through reforms, including making child care tax deductible for working families at a certain level of combined income and then redirecting government funding to those most in need. These are just a few of the ideas theyve come up with. The opportunity for us, as legislators, is to listen to this frontline experience, acknowledge the strength of the observations and then move accordingly. I note that the government is hosting an early childhood education and care roundtable in coming weeks. My call to the government is to not just listen but to move expediently to act.Every child has a right to education. Whether they are in North Sydney or Fowler or anywhere else should be irrelevant.","Child Care","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms TINK (North Sydney) ","(11:39):"
"0","0","0","1","1","Templeman, Susan MP","181810","Macquarie","ALP","N/A","50"," I got to hang out with a bunch of four- and five-year-olds just before Christmas at the graduation of students from the Euroka Childrens Centre, a not-for-profit community-based long day care centre in the Blue Mountain thats been operating since 1985. We were outside in their play area, which we as a government have committed $20,000 to to help with improvements in the play space. Their plan is for things like slides, a rock wall and scramble nets.Its too easy to dismiss the idea of play areas as a secondary thing in education and as something thats simply a respite from learning, whereas some of the most important lessons young children can learn—and I would argue all children—happen in the playground. Learning to share, learning to take turns and learning to respond appropriately to social cues can mean the difference between an easier or harder journey as an adult, not to mention the physical skills development that occurs, the managing of fear and excitement and 1,001 other emotions and skills. So its no surprise to me that parents who have watched their children develop under the care of the Euroka team cheered to know that even though their children might not benefit, future kids would. Their biggest applause was when I mentioned the Albanese governments commitment to making early childhood education and care more affordable for families.I thank the member for Fowler for raising this important issue, which is a game changer for families and for our economy. We know our landmark reforms are only possible if we retain, recruit and train a high-quality workforce, and we have a plan to do exactly that.I want early childhood educators in my electorate of Macquarie, the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury, to know that I appreciate the pressures that youre facing and your workload, and that we, as a government, value the vital role you play, which can shape a childs future. Our plan to support early educators, the directors of preschools and long day care centres and the parents who rely on them begins with recognition of the professionalisation of this workforce, recognition that they are educators not childminders, recognition that they are highly trained experts, recognition of the need for significant career pathways and recognition that all these things have been ignored by a decade of neglect and inaction from previous Liberal governments.We know changes are needed. Weve committed to working with early educators, the sector and unions to overcome long-term issues like the persistent challenges to attract and retain staff, and the huge gaps that mean people in regional areas, including mine, cannot access early childhood education and care when they need it or as much as they need it. Both the Hawkesbury and Blue Mountains have been identified as having serious shortages of places.The contrast between our approach to these issues and that of the Liberals while in government is stark. They ignored, denied, minimised and did as little as possible to address the really pressing issues. By contrast, we take these issues seriously and look to have responses that mean we dont have to revisit the same issue every few years, because we aim for a longer-term, sustainable response.Tackling childcare costs is a fundamental way to reduce the cost-of-living pressures that families are facing. It will make early childhood education more affordable for 1.2 million families. Seventy-five per cent of those families earn less than $180,000 a year, and around 50 per cent earn less than $120,000 a year. The costs of child care for these families are a big chunk of their pay packet, and this will help. Whats more, it means that people who couldnt look for work, because of the prohibitive costs of early childhood education and care, will now have more choices. Last year, 73,000 people who wanted to work didnt look, just for that reason. That means that, while this is about families with young children, its also about the skills shortage and the local businesses in my community who cant find people to work.Attracting new workers to the early childhood sector is essential for all this to happen. We know that the shortages cant, in the short term, be filled through the domestic market, so weve looked to migration to help ease the shortages by expanding the migration program to 35,000 places and prioritising visa processing for qualified teachers, including early childhood teachers. In partnership with the states, were delivering 180,000 fee-free TAFE and vocational places. That includes 10,000 places right now for early childhood studies in New South Wales. Thats a start, and we know theres more that well do.","Child Care","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms TEMPLEMAN (Macquarie) ","(11:45):"

"0","0","0","1","1","Taylor, Angus MP","231027","Hume","LP","N/A","51"," I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Modernising Business Communications and Other Measures) Bill. The bill reintroduces measures advanced before the election to modernise AGM and other business communications rules and provides an initial response to the Australian Law Reform Commission review into financial services legislation. The former measures were contained in coalition legislation that lapsed at the last election. We will be supporting this bill and the amendments proposed by the government.The bill implements law improvement measures across four streams. Schedule 1 introduces amendments to give effect to technology-neutral communications. Schedule 2 introduces amendments to implement recommendations of the ALRC review. Schedule 3 rationalises a number of ASIC instruments, and schedule 4 makes a number of minor and technical amendments. The bill revives and expands legislation that lapsed before the last election, as I said. The main body of additions to the bill implement initial recommendations from the Australian Law Reform Commissions review into financial services legislation commissioned by the previous government. As I said, the bill implements law improvement measures across four streams over those four schedules, and the amendments in schedules 2 and 4 are largely made within existing policy parameters.In a little more detail, schedule 1 amends the Corporations Act and other Commonwealth acts to modernise communication methods available to consumers, businesses and regulators when interacting with each other by: firstly, extending the global communications regime, allowing members of certain entities to elect to receive documents in either hard copy or electronic form, and providing relief to entities that are unable to contact members under the Corporations Act; secondly, ensuring that regulatory bodies in the Treasury portfolio can hold hearings and examinations using technology; thirdly, updating payment provisions in Treasury laws to allow electronic payments to be used; and, finally, replacing requirements in Treasury laws to publish notices in newspapers with a requirement that notices be published in an accessible and reasonably prominent manner. These are all sensible modernisation provisions designed to make use of modern technologies in a way that reflects practice we are seeing much more broadly across the economy and across society.Schedule 2 to the bill implements recommendations and other suggested improvements identified by the ALRC in its interim report A, which was all about simplifying and improving the navigability of Australias financial services law. In its interim report A, the ALRC found that Australias financial services legislation is challenging to navigate and complex for individuals and businesses who may have obligations under the law. This is an important area of red tape reduction and a very significant priority for this opposition, as it was for the previous government, because we know when we get out and talk to businesses across our communities that red tape is right at the top of the list of the issues that they have concerns about. We want to see sensible changes in that area, and we will always work with this government on sensible red tape reduction. Its a priority for us, and we want to see it as a priority for the government.Schedule 3 to the bill amends the Corporations Act and the NCCPA to transfer longstanding and accepted matters currently contained in the ASIC legislative instruments into the primary law. The amendments will improve navigability of the law and provide industry and consumers with greater certainty and clarity when interacting with Treasury laws. That has to be, again, a good thing. If youre in business in this day and age, you have mounds and piles of legislation—state, federal and local regulations as well—that are constantly a barrage you have to deal with just to get the basics done. If youre a small business without a government relations department, an HR department and all the other departments, or a legal department that works through all these things, it is a nigh on impossible task. Simplifying it has to be a good thing and must be a priority of any good government.Schedule 4 to the bill makes a number of miscellaneous and technical amendments to Treasury portfolio legislation. The amendments correct drafting errors, repeal inoperative provisions, address unintended outcomes and make a series of other technical changes.I mentioned the importance of reducing red tape. Its an issue very close to my heart. Sadly, there are far fewer people in this parliament, frankly—particularly from the government—who have experience in business, particularly small business, and understand that red tape cripples small-business people. Small-business people want to get out and run their business. They want to serve their customers. They want to attract and retain the very best talent they can in a jobs market with a strength coming out of the pandemic that no-one could have dreamed of. Thats what they want to spend their time on. Thats what they have to spend their time on. Indeed, if they dont spend their time on that, theyre going to lose out. Theyre going to lose market share; theyre going to lose profits and revenues; and theyre going to go backwards. So they have no choice but to focus on those issues central to their business around customers and employees. But you cant do that if youre dealing with red tape. You simply cant do it.Independent researchers estimated that the annual cost to the economy of red tape is $176 billion a year. We know that it has to be a relentless focus. This is never-ending work. Those opposite like to say, If something wasnt done in the past, then it doesnt need to be done now. But the truth is that red tape reduction is never-ending work for any government. A government must be continual and relentless in its focus on removing red tape. Its also important to note that the cost of red tape to the economy is more than just the direct cost, that $176 billion I talked about; it includes businesses that never started.We know small-business people or people who want to start a small business—take a tradie who says they want to start their own plumbing or electrician business—start looking at what they have to do to start that business, and we know red tape is a very significant deterrent. Jobs are never created and ambitions are never fulfilled, because the tidal wave of red tape coming at that small-business person who wants to get started is just too much. Ultimately, they give up, and that is unfortunate. We dont want people who want to go into business to give up. We want them to keep going because theyre the job creators. Thats where jobs come from. They dont come from the government. They come from businesspeople who are building businesses. To the extent that its government that creates a job, thats at the expense of those businesspeople because they have to pay the taxes that fund those government jobs.Any businessperson you talk to will tell you that the cost and burden of compliance is, along with staff shortages, their No. 1 issue. And, of course, because they want to spend that time on attracting and retaining talent, bringing great people to their business and attracting and retaining customers, its the one they dont want to have to spend their time on. I hear this endlessly as I get around and talk to businesses. In fact, we were down in Melbourne last week talking to small-business people. As the Treasurer was trying to explain his 6,000-word ideological essay to the press gallery, we were talking to small businesses down in the suburbs of Melbourne. Thats where we were. We didnt have to explain what our economic policy is using long, complex, convoluted sentences and words, because it includes getting rid of red tape and bringing down inflation and interest rates, amongst other things—practical things that affect businesses today, not ideological diatribes.APRA has pointed out in its information paper Modernising the prudential regulation that there are currently 140 prudential standards and practice guides in total covering the five APRA regulated industries—140 practice guides! The Basel framework—this is a global framework, not one that Australia can directly affect, other than as a part of an international process—has expanded from around 300 pages before the global financial crisis to 1,600 pages today.The Australian Law Reform Commission has pointed out that the consolidated legislative framework for Australias financial services sector runs to over 43,300 pages. We knew there was work to be done coming out of the global financial crisis to make sure that we had a financial services sector that was fit for purpose. The truth is, our sector performed better than most in the world, and has continually done so. But 43,000 pages is something that I think needs to be dealt with. Combined with further reforms of the coalition, this bill, which as I say we support, is expected to reduce regulatory burden for businesses by more than $500 million per year. Thats a big impost.Now, in financial services we know there are a lot of big businesses, and big businesses can handle red tape better than smaller ones, but its still a cost. Ultimately, that has to be paid for by customers. We do want to see a lot more small businesses in the financial services sector; in fact, the technological changes that we are seeing right now are encouraging smaller businesses into the financial services space. That is a good thing, because that kind of competitive rivalry, that dynamic sector that you see when you have lots of smaller businesses coming in and taking on new innovations and taking different approaches to serving customers, is exactly what we need.This project is no small task. The Treasury portfolio laws cover over 50 acts containing thousands of provisions spanning corporations law, taxation, competition and consumer policy and financial sector regulation. All of those areas of legislation and regulation have good objectives. Theres nothing wrong with wanting to have a sector that is properly regulated, but do we need this much? Is there some of it we can just take out because its not helping? Indeed, is technology making it easier nowadays for us to actually regulate in much smarter and much cleverer ways? This is the beginning, not the end, of reducing red tape and supporting deregulation. It must be just one of a never-ending series of initiatives and pursuits to focus on taking red tape out of our economy.We should also remember, as we are talking about regulation, that the best regulator of any industry is an empowered customer. Everything we can do to empower customers to demand of their service providers what they need is a good thing. Its why Ive been such a strong advocate in this place of good consumer and competition laws, making sure that they are focused on genuine competition, not vested interests or crony capitalism. That ensures that you have an empowered customer. Digital initiatives can ensure digital identity. There is a good example of this where we are making sure—and we certainly did make sure when we were in government—that the customer is given as much power as possible so that the customer can do the regulation, not a regulator sitting here in Canberra or another capital city.Business needs a government that listens to them, not one that tells them that government is at the centre of the economy. When business does well, the economy does well, from the sole trader all the way up to big employers. As I said earlier, wealth creation doesnt come from government departments; it comes from hardworking, entrepreneurial businesspeople innovating, providing solutions to their customers, employing people, attracting great people and empowering them to do good work for their customers.Sadly, the signs are not good for the focus on business as the centre of wealth creation in this economy. This government, to date, though I live in hope, is about more intervention, not less. We saw this in the Treasurers essay over the summer. The Treasurer spent the summer writing a 6,000-word essay. This is at a time when Australians have taken, in many cases, the first holiday they have taken in a number of years where they could get out and really enjoy this wonderful nation we have. They could buy presents for their family and see all the family members in person at a Christmas event. I know from observing it that they got to January and many of them were looking at the credit card bill and the bank accounts and went, I wasnt expecting that. It is a tough time for them as they are making ends meet. Many businesspeople are starting to see the impact of rising interest rates and rising inflation. Despite that context, we had a Treasurer who buried himself in his 6,000-word ideological essay focused on making government the centre of the economy. Government will never be the centre of the economy—at least, not an economy I want to be a part of. If government is at the centre, its not a community and society Id want to be a part of. The Treasurer believes his proposal for an activist government running the economy from the top is a solution to the challenges Australians face today. He thinks thats the solution.Our solution on this side is about the aspirations of every Australian and the enterprise of every Australian business—empowering them, putting them at the centre of the economy, so that their dreams and visions are the dreams and visions of the government. We shouldnt be imposing our view of how they should live their lives. We should be empowering them to live their lives, to run their businesses the way they want to run them, to serve their customers, to manage their household budgets, to live the best lives they possibly can, to support their children and to give them the best opportunities possible. Thats what government should be about, but the fact is that the Treasurer spent the summer writing this long essay. I read it, Deputy Speaker Claydon. It was hard work, I have to say, but I read it all. It is a damning statement on the priorities of this government that that is how he spent his summer.He did do something else: he decided he wanted to change the look of the $5 note. He did that as well. Thats a priority, isnt it? Thats a priority, according to the Treasurer. Australians dont want to change who is on the $5 note, relative to what they really want. What they really want to do is work out how to make sure theyve got more $5 notes to pay their bills. These are the practical issues that Australians are facing, and, sadly, this is a government that were seeing has already, just six months or so in, lost a sense of their priorities. Their priorities are not the priorities of the Australian people. Its a government that thinks it knows better than hardworking, aspirational Australians. Governments never know better than hardworking, aspirational Australians. They know what is right for their families, for their businesses and for their lives. It is really for them to make those decisions, and for government to do everything they can to enable them and to support them.On this side of the House we dont believe in what we read in this diatribe, and, certainly, we dont believe in the Treasurer spending his summer on that kind of priority, because they are not the priorities of the Australian people. We believe that the private sector drives opportunity and prosperity, not government. We believe that a dynamic, resilient small business sector is at the heart of the economy—not bureaucracies, but hardworking small businesses. We believe that hardworking families know what is best for them, not public servants, and certainly not politicians. And we believe that the vision of every Australian should be the vision of our nation—that vision should not be a vision conjured up in focus groups or in long essays.Now, as I said, were talking about this bill and these important principles in the context of whats going to be a very tough year for Australian families, and tomorrow were going to see the Reserve Bank make another decision on interest rates. The expectation in the market is that well see another increase. Consensus is that a 25 basis point, a quarter of a percentage point, increase is coming tomorrow. Some are saying it could indeed be more. Well have to wait and see. Its a decision of the independent Reserve Bank, as it should be. But what we do know is that the cost of mortgage payments is going up dramatically. As Australians see the interest rate increases—nine consecutive interest rates, if we see one tomorrow—we see that being passed through to households and businesses, and we shouldnt forget that businesses are paying interest too. Weve got the added impact of the fact that many Australians locked in mortgages at low interest rates and theyre shifting onto flexible rates, and were going to see more and more Australian families being hit with that. On top of that, a trip to the supermarket is costing more. Summer air conditioning is going to cost more. Rent is costing more. Fuel is costing more. Inflation is eating a giant hole into the household budgets of Australian families.Over the 12 months to December 2022 the CPI rose 7.8 per cent. Its the highest movement since 1990. Rental price growth in Sydney and Melbourne has continued to increase this quarter, with both cities recording their strongest annual increases since 2014-15. We are going to hear a lot more of this from the Select Committee on the Cost of Living, chaired by Senator Hume, but it has already confirmed what families across the country are seeing. Woolworths have had to increase their food donations by around 20 per cent because of the increased demand from charities helping families who are struggling to make ends meet. As Ive seen in my electorate and in the broader region that I live in in New South Wales, families that you might not expect to be suffering from mortgage stress are indeed suffering from mortgage stress—often two-income families. Theyve bought a house and theyve paid good money for that house. Theyre enjoying the fact that theyve been able to own their own part of Australia, but the truth is that their mortgage payments are escalating rapidly at the same time as were seeing very strong inflation.Its true that we have an independent Reserve Bank, and that is as it should be, as I said earlier. But it is also true that there is a great deal that government can do to take pressure off interest rates and inflation. The truth of the matter is that the Reserve Bank sets its interest rates within the context of the governments policies, and the governments fiscal policy in particular. The governments energy policies have an impact on inflation. The governments budget posture has an impact on inflation. In an environment where we are seeing strong inflation and sharply rising interest rates, it is beyond comprehension that this Treasurer, in the November budget, decided—the first time since the 1990s that a government have done this—to drop budget balance as an objective of the budget. That is absolutely extraordinary. The government dropped it. That commitment to budget balance has been there since the Charter of Budget Honesty went into place under Peter Costello back in the 1990s. Its been there ever since. No Treasurer has taken it away. Indeed, Wayne Swan maintained it. He didnt really bother about it too much, but he maintained it at least. This Treasurer has completely given up the ghost.The truth is that, if the government arent seeking to make ends meet, then households and businesses will have to do it for them. That is the reality. That is how economics works. So I implore the Treasurer: at the next budget—youve got another opportunity in May—bring it back. Get back to an objective of budget balance. Dont listen to that long queue of your Labor colleagues who all want to be heroes, who all want to throw gazillions of dollars at their portfolios. Theyve all got grand, visionary Labor plans. We know that. They want to leave their massive legacy. But it is all at the expense of the Australian people. If the Treasurer does spend more money, as we saw on the front page of the Australian this morning he was going to do—he told us it was his goal to spend more money—then the truth of the matter is that Australians will pay for that with escalated interest rates and inflation and potentially, in the future, higher taxes.Let me spend a moment on taxes. We know Labor governments always want to tax more. They pretend otherwise. We heard them before the last election say: No, no. Were going to be a government that doesnt raise taxes. But, within months of their getting into government, we saw this Treasurer floating the idea of getting rid of the stage 3 tax cuts. He was very careful in the lead-up to the election. Whereas the Prime Minister came out clearly and said, Were going to keep the stage 3 tax cuts, the Treasurer hedged his bets. He has floated that balloon several times now. Before the budget in October last year, we saw him floating the idea of getting rid of the stage 3 tax cuts. He is revving up the usual pro-big-tax commentators in the media to say: Weve got to get rid of these stage 3 tax cuts. We cant afford them. He wants them to go. We know that. And, no doubt, in the lead-up to the next budget he is going to be looking for ways of taxing Australians more.Weve seen Labors proposal on franking credits come out in the last little while. When you look at that, its not the narrow approach to dealing with a very technical issue in the application of franking credits that we all expected and that was promised to us. Indeed, this is a full-blown assault on franking credits. Thats what it is. This is a government that doesnt like franking credits. As we saw in the 2019 election campaign, they were going to get rid of them. Now theyre going to do it the sneaky way, by the back door. Anyone who is worried about getting access to franking credits, which many older Australians rely on for their incomes, should talk to their accountant about what is coming forward in that legislation, because this is a full-blown assault on franking credits.We havent even been to superannuation. The Labor Party is scurrying away there with their favourite think tank, the Grattan Institute, looking at ways they can hit superannuation harder. This government, the Labor Party, has always seen superannuation as their money—not as Australians money but as their money—to be used for their pet projects and to be taxed as they see fit. So I have no doubt that were going to see an assault on Australians superannuation in the coming months and years from this Labor government. Theyre certainly contemplating it; we know that. And I think theyre going to have a good crack at it. Lets see. But one way or another, this Treasurer is going to want more money. He told us that this morning—more spending, is what he said, and hes going to keep floating ideas for how he is going to do that.The truth of the matter is that when he spends more money, just as he did at the last budget—over $110 billion in extra spending in the last budget than in the previous one—he likes to pretend otherwise. He contorts the numbers in all sorts of ways. You just have to look at two lines: spending in the last budget and spending in this budget over the forwards: $110 billion of extra spending. Who knows how much more its going to be at the May budget? If governments spend more, it puts upward pressure on interest rates and inflation—economics 101. Thats how it works, and that is exactly what were seeing. And of course then the Reserve Bank ends up having to do all the heavy lifting. Sadly, some of that heavy lifting may well happen tomorrow; it is expected to happen tomorrow. I have no doubt that if the government doesnt do the heavy lifting then the Reserve Bank will do exactly that.Its not just me saying this. A new IMF report makes it very clear that one of best things the government can do to alleviate pressures on the budget and inflation is to rein in spending and reconsider some of its big spending programs. In the budget-in-reply speech the Leader of the Opposition offered to work closely with Labor on some of the more-difficult programs in that area—important programs—that we want to see succeed, like the NDIS. It is time for those opposite to focus on the priorities of the Australian people—not their own priorities, not their own dalliances but the priorities of the Australian people, and that is: helping them to deal with the cost-of-living pressures they are facing in their households and in their businesses every single day.","Treasury Laws Amendment (Modernising Business Communications and Other Measures) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[1]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr TAYLOR (Hume) ","(11:52):"
"0","0","0","1","1","van Manen, Bert MP","188315","Forde","LNP","N/A","56"," Its always a pleasure to follow the member for Hume and his fulsome coverage of the many issues that this country is facing under those opposite. Im pleased to stand in this chamber and support the package of measures in the Treasury Laws Amendment (Modernising Business Communications and Other Measures) Bill 2022, given that it is a piece of legislation and a piece of work that largely was put in place by the former coalition government. As the member for Hume has rightly touched on, it focuses on the need to reduce red tape and regulation and the cost of doing business.Looking at that particular aspect and going through a list of some of the red tape that currently exists across our economy, independent research has shown that the cost of red tape in our economy is some $176 billion a year. What could we do with $176 billion freed up from regulation and red tape, or even a portion of that? It would allow our business community to grow and prosper and develop and maybe develop new ideas. People might take the chance and the opportunity to open a new business, to employ more Australians, on a full-time or a part-time basis, or whatever works for those employees. When I talk to small businesses across my electorate—and the member for Hume touched on this very well in his contribution—red tape is one of the biggest issues they talk to me about consistently.The reason small to medium business talk to me about red tape and regulation is that we have a one-size-fits-all regulatory model, which doesnt reflect differences and different sizes of business. If youre a large, multinational business, you have HR department, a legal department and a whole variety of departments that can manage the red-tape challenge that faces our economy. If youre a small business, such as a local café, a local mechanic shop, a local manufacturer or any number of small businesses across my electorate, you dont have all of those resources. The owners of the business are that resource. They have to work out how they spread their time across dealing with the red tape issues and, more importantly, growing their business, serving their customers, developing new products and developing new ideas. We know that it is actually the small to medium businesses in this country that are the drivers of innovation and new ideas in our economy. Many of our large businesses now are no more than big bureaucracies. Theyre a private sector version of the bureaucracy. Its where ideas dont get developed, because they no longer wish to take the risk that maybe they once did to grow their business to that size.Lets have a look at some of these figures. APRA pointed out in a recent issues paper that modernising prudential regulations is important because there are currently 140 different prudential standards and practice guides. As the member for Hume touched on, the Basel framework that affects our financial services sector has gone from 300 pages before the global financial crisis to more than 1,600 pages today. The Corporations Act has almost doubled in size since 2001 and now contains some 14,500 internal cross-references. The Law Reform Commission pointed out that the consolidated legislative framework for Australias financial services sector runs at over 43,000 pages. These figures should scare everyone in this chamber. Somewhere along the line, somebody in some business has got to understand and be across these regulations and this challenge of meeting this red tape burden.Lets have a look at some of these figures.

These figures should scare everyone in this chamber. Somewhere along the line, somebody in some business has got to understand and be across these regulations and this challenge of meeting this red tape burden. Of course, we will always require a level of regulation to ensure that our economy functions properly and that businesses and people do the right things, but we need to ensure that that regulation is fit for purpose for a modern, 21st-century economy, and I think its fair to say that thats probably not the case.In addition, this bill also introduces some other schedules that make amendments to give effect to the ability to communicate for meetings and other matters in a more broadbrush manner using the technology thats available today rather than the narrow list of ways that are currently in place. Schedule 2 introduces amendments to implement the recommendations of the ALRC review. Schedule 3 rationalises a number of ASIC instruments. Thats an important step. We know that ASIC does some really good work. In my time on the corporations and financial services committee, where we had ASIC in front of us regularly, we had some very good discussions about the range of work they were doing on a wide variety of matters. But, with any of that work, sometimes, somewhere along the way, you can get captured in your focus on what youre doing and maybe not look outside the box for solutions or not look for the solutions necessary to make things simpler and more streamlined. So that is a good measure. As always, making minor and technical amendments along the way is an important piece of governing.This bill revives a bill that was put into this place by the previous government. Im pleased to see that the government is taking this on board and proceeding with this legislation because, if we can free up our regulatory environment and ensure that it is fit for purpose not only for big business but also for our small to medium-sized businesses—which are the predominant type of business across my electorate of Forde—it will make those businesses more profitable, more efficient and more able to focus on their day-to-day needs in terms of servicing their customers, developing new products and building and growing our economic wealth.It is in our small to medium-sized businesses, across this country, where our wealth and economic activity is generated. We hear stories all the time about big mining companies, big banks and our big institutions, but its the small to medium-sized businesses that are the majority employers in this nation. As I said earlier, its where much of our innovation and new ideas are developed, grown and built. It is this part of the economy that will benefit most from this red tape reduction. I hope, that through this legislation and, hopefully, much more to come to continue this process, we will see our regulatory environment become fit for purpose for the 21st century, so that everybody in our economy benefits—most importantly, the Australian people. I commend the bill to the House.","Treasury Laws Amendment (Modernising Business Communications and Other Measures) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[1]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr VAN MANEN (Forde—Chief Opposition Whip) ","(12:22):"
"0","0","0","1","1","Violi, Aaron MP","300147","Casey","LP","N/A","57"," I want to commend the member for Forde for his speech, in particular about small business. Its so important that we continue to be a voice for small business in this House and understand not only the opportunities but also the threats that small businesses face, and thats something I am passionate about and will continue to be while Im in this role.As Australias business environment evolves and adapts to global events and technological advances, so too regulation needs to evolve. The purpose of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Modernising Business Communications and Other Measures) Bill 2022 is to maintain and improve Treasury legislation to ensure it remains current and relevant. This legislation implements reforms spearheaded by the former coalition government that reduce red tape, lower the cost of doing business and support digital innovation in the delivery of core business functions. This legislation is significant because rapid digital and technological advances continue to be a feature of the business and consumer environment; however, regulation has not always kept pace. It is vital that, as legislators, we do all we can to ensure regulation keeps pace with technological advancements, to unleash economic growth and also to ensure consumers, businesses and infrastructure are safe from cyberattacks.According to the Financial Services Council, this bill will make communication requirements technology neutral, benefiting consumers, creating faster turnaround times and improving accessibility for rural and regional businesses and communities, including businesses in my electorate of Casey. It is a great example of the importance of updating legislation to allow a digital environment to flourish for the benefit of all Australians. This makes it all the more worrying that this Labor government does not think the digital economy is important. They have decided not to have a minister responsible for it and either do not understand its significance to Australias future or just dont care. Any business owner you talk to will tell you that the cost and burden of compliance, along with staff shortages, is their No. 1 issue and their biggest constraint. Independent research has estimated that the annual cost to the economy from red tape is $176 billion a year. Red tapes cost to the economy is more than just the direct cost. It includes businesses never started, jobs never created and ambitions that are never fulfilled due to bureaucratic interference. I dont have to remind this side of the House that when business—from the sole trader up to the big employers—does well, Australia does well.What does this bill do? This legislation reintroduces measures advanced before the election to modernise AGM and other business communication rules and provides an initial response to the Australian Law Reform Commission review into financial services legislation. The bill implements law improvement measures across four streams: technology-neutral communications in schedule 1, recommendations of the ALRC review in schedule 2, the rationalisation of ASIC instruments in schedule 3 and minor and technical amendments in schedule 4. The amendments in schedules 2 to 4 are made largely within existing policy parameters. Temporary changes, where necessary, were enacted by the government during COVID and showed the ability of businesses to adapt and respond quickly to changing environments. These changes were around virtual meetings and the electronic execution of documents to ensure businesses could continue to operate and meet their legal obligations. These measures have now been made permanent. This is an important change which will continue to drive efficiency for businesses, which is so crucial to our future economic success as a nation.The amendments within schedule 1 are the most significant to most Australians. They amend the Corporations Act and other Commonwealth acts to modernise communication methods available to consumers, businesses and regulators when interacting with each other by extending the global communications regime—allowing members of certain entities to receive documents in either hard copy or electronic form and providing relief to entities that are unable to contact members under the Corporations Act—and by ensuring that regulatory bodies in the Treasury portfolio can hold hearings and examinations using technology. It also updates payment provisions in Treasury laws to allow electronic payments to be used and replaces requirements in Treasury laws that notices be published in newspapers with a requirement that notices be published in an accessible and reasonably prominent way.The Corporations Act has almost doubled in size since 2001 and contains over 14,500 internal cross-references. Combined with the coalitions further reforms, this bill is expected to reduce the regulatory burden on businesses by more than $500 million per year. This project is no small task, with Treasury portfolio laws covering over 50 acts that contain thousands of provisions spanning corporations law; taxation, competition and consumer policy; and financial sector regulation. This needs to be the beginning, not the end, of reducing red tape and supporting deregulation.Businesses need a government that listens to them, not one that tells them that government is at the centre of the economy. Sadly, this governments policies, its public statements and even its essays demonstrate that it isnt listening and has the wrong priorities. After promising to work with business, this government has released a wave of new regulation and a ministry whose instincts and reflexes are to stifle business. At a time of rising interest rates, high inflation and a need to support economic growth over the medium term, business needs to be supported and nurtured. Australians need a government that supports their aspirations and supports enterprise to drive innovation, create jobs and deliver prosperity.Australia faces unique economic challenges this year. Inflation is likely to stay higher for longer than first expected, 800,000 Australian mortgage holders are due to switch from fixed to variable interest rates and the real risk of a global economic downturn exists. But businesses big and small are rightly identifying the issues and the solutions to Australias current economic challenges. Last week Ernst & Youngs chief economist, Cherelle Murphy, called for the government to take pressure off the economy and the RBA by delaying their own spending, and said that governments dont need to be adding fiscal stimulus and working at cross-purposes with the RBA.Legislation the government plans to pass in the next year calls for a mammoth $36.5 billion of extra borrowing for extra spending. The government insists this wont drive up demand and affect inflation. While the Treasurer says these funds will not affect the budget, the money still has to be borrowed. Its impact will still be felt across the economy and make the task of taming inflation much harder.In the past week, the Australian Industry Groups, the Business Council of Australias and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industrys prebudget submissions have all echoed the coalitions calls since the October budget to restore the fiscal guardrails, to rein in spending and to drive productivity reforms that support business to invest, to grow our economy and to employ more Australians. The government should listen to these calls to provide relief to the challenges Australians are facing today. The government should listen to business and prioritise solutions that reduce pressure on inflation and secure Australias economic prosperity.Driving productivity is a crucial lever to help Australians navigate the economic challenges we face. A key driver of improved productivity, as this bill demonstrates, is through technology and embracing the digital economy. Not appointing a minister for the digital economy is just another example of how this is a prime minister who doesnt understand the economy and has no plan to tackle the economic challenges we face. We know that Australias digital activity value-add increased by 7.4 per cent in 2019-20, compared with a two per cent increase for the total Australian economy. This is a huge value-add for our economy. It is vital that we continue to build digital skills across our economy. We must help small and medium sized businesses build their digital capability and we must continue to invest in the technologies of the future.Supporting small business with their technological capabilities is not just about their productivity and economic growth; its about allowing those small-business owners, those farmers and those tradies to get their work done and get home to spend more time with their families. Tradies start on the tools because they love it. They didnt join to do admin and paperwork. Technology can allow them to do what they love, build their business, support their family and spend more time with their loved ones.The coalition have made a range of practical proposals which put aspirational Australian families and businesses at the heart of our policy agenda. Across the country, the coalitions team are meeting with small-business owners, employers and community organisations to hear their issues and concerns. In Casey I have met with many local small businesses, almost every day, and they are worried. The main concerns they raise are increased demand for food relief, rising energy prices, skills shortages and engaging young people in the value of work. I listen to them, and I will fight for them, and they deserve a government that listens to them. They deserve a government that understands the opportunities and benefits to small business that a digital economy can bring. A minister for the digital economy is a vital part of maximising the digital economy, Australias economic growth and a secure future.","Treasury Laws Amendment (Modernising Business Communications and Other Measures) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[1]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr VIOLI (Casey) ","(12:31):"

Its true that the Albanese government has a plan for a modern data-enabled economy that extends the benefits of digital technology throughout the financial services sector and to every corporation in the country.The Treasury Laws Amendment (Modernising Business Communications and Other Measures) Bill 2022 contains measures designed to maintain and improve Treasury portfolio legislation to ensure that it remains current and fit for purpose. It reflects the governments commitment to its regulatory stewardship role and is a step towards more modern and efficient legislative framework that supports businesses and consumers in their interactions with each other.Schedule 1 of the bill modernises several Treasury portfolio laws by removing barriers to the use of digital communications, such as electronic signatures and virtual meetings. These amendments build on temporary changes that were introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic and will support a more effective use of technology, providing businesses with greater flexibility to respond to advancing technological changes.Schedule 2 to the bill implements recommendations to reduce complexity in Australias financial services laws that were made by the Australian Law Reform Commission, including by removing a whole heap of redundant definitions and using consistent headings for definition sections. Schedule 3 to the bill transfers longstanding and accepted matters contained in ASIC instruments into the Corporations Act and the National Consumer Credit Protection Act. The amendments will improve the clarity of the law, provide certainty and make it simpler for regulated entities and consumers to understand their rights and obligations.Finally, schedule 4 makes minor and technical amendments to Treasury portfolio legislation, including amendments that clarify the law to ensure it operates in accordance with the actual policy intent of parliament and make minor policy changes to improve administrative outcomes, remedy unintended consequences and correct technical or drafting defects.

He grew up with a community way of life. From working on his parents farm to enlisting in the Army reserves, he has always put his community first.During his first speech, the member spoke about the importance of First Nations voices being heard. Implementing the Uluru Statement from the Heart is about voice, treaty and truth. The referendum is a step towards healing the wounds that have been open too long, and I know the member for Spence will be very active in this campaign.In New South Wales we welcomed the new member for Cunningham, Alison Byrnes. The new member has made it her mission to ensure the concerns of locals are heard in Canberra. I know she will be a strong voice in her community on issues such as the gender pay gap, supporting the NDIS and backing in industry in her electorate to meet the challenges of net zero emissions by 2050.The new member for Parramatta is here in the chamber this morning. Andrew Charlton is an exceptional voice in parliament for his electorate of Parramatta. He is an example of the high calibre of MPs now representing Labor in this place. He is an incredibly strong and articulate voice for the people of Parramatta. As he pointed out in his first speech in this place, if New South Wales businesses are not in Parramatta, they are missing out on the future of Sydney. He reminded us that good economic policy is fundamentally about people, and I couldnt agree more.The new member for Hunter, Dan Repacholi, is an Australian sporting champion. He represented the green and gold five times in the Olympics and is a three-time Commonwealth Games gold medallist in sports shooting. I know he recently had a crack at running the 100 metres on one of his Instagram posts, but I dont think hes going to represent us in that sport! Whilst juggling shooting commitments, the member has worked as a coalminer and most recently as a manager for a medium-sized machinery sales business that services the mining and agricultural sectors. He knows what it means to represent his country on the national stage, and he is fighting for the people of Hunter in this parliament. As the member noted in his first speech, he is a proud former coalminer and he is proud of his electorates mining history, as we all should be.I would also like to welcome the member for Bennelong, Jerome Laxale. The member has delivered for the local community on Ryde council since 2012, including five years as mayor. He sought election because he wants this place to be the home of good government. He has a remarkable background. His father is from Mauritius and his mother is from Reunion. He spoke about the sega dance he witnessed at parties as a young child. Ive since found out this dance is a little bit risque, so, whilst I might have asked for a rendition, Ill leave that for another time. I welcome the member for Bennelong to this chamber.In Reid we have a very special story. The new member for Reid is the daughter of hardworking Chinese parents who fled Laos after the Vietnam War. She is a passionate advocate for the freedom and opportunities that allowed her family to prosper in Australia. The member understands that with hard work and access to a good education, everyone can build the future they want for their family.Also in New South Wales I welcome the representative for Robertson, Gordon Reid, to this place. A proud Wiradjuri man from Darkinyung country, the member was on the frontlines during the COVID pandemic, working as an emergency doctor at local hospitals. These same hospitals were the catalysts for the member to run for parliament and represent the people of Robertson. As the son of small-business owners, he understands the importance of small businesses to the community and the wider economy, and this is one of the many reasons I believe he is an outstanding representative for the electorate of Robertson.In Victoria, I congratulate the member for Chisholm, Carina Garland. She understands the pressure faced by immigrants coming to Australia for a new and better life. Chisholms namesake, Caroline Chisholm, was a fierce advocate for womens immigration and social justice, and I anticipate the new member will be equally effective in achieving these important goals.As the first Labor member for Higgins, Michelle Ananda-Rajah is the first person of colour to represent that seat since its formation, and she sets an example to us all. Born to Sri Lankan parents in London and migrating to Australia early in her life, the member has an established medical career in infectious diseases, which meant that before her election she saw the highs and lows of the COVID pandemic on that frontline. She brings years of international medical experience to this place, to the people of Higgins and to the wider Australian community. She will undoubtedly make an enormous contribution to this parliament.In the seat of Holt, the new member, Cassandra Fernando, has seen history made, being the first Sri Lankan-born member of the Australian parliament elected to this place. As a migrant and a person of colour, the member for Holt understands what its like to feel underrepresented in all aspects of Australian life and the need for diverse voices in our countrys chamber. She has worked in various retail sectors and has come to represent those same workers in their fight to improve pay, conditions and industry standards. Also a pastry chef, she will be an excellent representative for the people of Holt. I congratulate her on her election.Id like to welcome the member for the newly formed electorate of Hawke in Melbournes inner west, Sam Rae. The member for Hawke has pledged his commitment to working with the Albanese government to address housing affordability and invest in local education and health care, important goals for the people of Hawke and, of course, for the whole nation. And congratulations to the member and his partner, Zoe, on the arrival last year of their baby, Mack.I want to also pay tribute to the new member for Lingiari, Marion Scrymgour, who has lived and worked across the Territory her entire life. She served in the NT Legislative Assembly for 11 years and was the first First Nations Australian woman to be elected to the NT parliament. Her many years of experience representing her community will be invaluable to this place, and I am grateful for her assistance and engagement, particularly in my capacity as the Minister for Northern Australia.I welcome Senator Linda White. Senator White has fought for the rights of the working class through her time at the Australian Services Union. As a senator for Victoria, Senator White will continue to fight hard for working Australians in this parliament. As she has made clear, getting justice for others has been her driving ambition, whether as a union delegate or as a lawyer.Also in Victoria, I welcome and congratulate Senator Jana Stewart. Senator Stewart is a proud First Nations Australian of the Mutthi Mutthi and Wamba Wamba peoples. Through her career as a family therapist, working for the Victorian Aboriginal Child Care Agency and the Victorian Child Protection System, Senator Stewart has gained a deep understanding of the needs of Victorian communities. Her inspiring dedication to her community will make her a great senator and a great asset to this place.I think the election result on 21 May in 2022 made clear that the people of Australia wanted change. They wanted secure local jobs. They voted for affordable child care. They voted for affordable housing. They wanted to see real action on climate change, and action is being taken. The people of Australia want reconciliation with and reconciliation of our First Nations people. Well work across the community of this vast continent to ensure that First Nations peoples have a voice to this parliament, and we will implement the Uluru Statement from the Heart in its entirety. My colleagues and I in the Albanese government are working to build a better future where no-one is held back and no-one is left behind.In my last remaining few minutes, I want to acknowledge and thank my team—its substantially larger than it was on 20 May last year—and I do want to acknowledge the transition teams that came in from the various departments to help support members of the then opposition, which then transitioned into government. It says a lot about our democracy that we can have a change of government and the bureaucracy stands by it and makes sure that all new ministers, assistant ministers and everyone who has to take on new responsibility is ably supported by a good, thoughtful Public Service. I really want to thank all those teams in the Department of Industry, Science and Resources who helped me, and Im sure other newer ministers feel the same way. I particularly want to thank my electorate office team. They have been brilliant, in our office in Rockingham, through the election and post the election. Its also a transition for them, of course, as I am a shadow minister going into a ministerial role. So I really thank you all for your ongoing commitment to the community. As we all know, electorate offices around this country really are at the front line of communities engagement with each of the members of parliament. They sometimes have to put up with a lot of things we would hope they did not, yet they persevere, have great patience and help the community a great deal.To my ministerial office team, thank you all for joining me, helping me into this new role, hanging around to keep the office going and providing all your good, honest and thoughtful advice. I am really, deeply grateful for the time, effort and commitment that you put into your jobs, which make my job possible to undertake. I also want to acknowledge the importance of departmental liaison officers. I had a bit to deal with when I worked for the former member for Brand, and Im sorry to say—if any of them are still paying attention!—I didnt quite understand their role. But now I really understand as a minister how vital the DLOs are, certainly in getting me ready for a number of things in the operation of government and liaison with the departments. So I want to thank you, the DLOs. I wont mention anyone by name, because now the teams are so much bigger than they were; I fear leaving names out. But thank you all. Thank you for your commitment since before the election, of course, and then since the election last year to helping being part of good government and being part of my team as the federal member for Brand and the Minister for Resources and Minister for Northern Australia.","Address-in-Reply","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms MADELEINE KING (Brand—Minister for Resources and Minister for Northern Australia) ","(12:48):"
"0","0","0","1","1","Young, Terry MP","201906","Longman","LNP","N/A","61"," Now that Ive been re-elected for a second term, I want to thank the people of Longman for again putting their trust in me to represent them. All I can promise them is that Ill continue to represent and work hard for them in the Australian parliament. Ive learnt much from my first term, and Im even more determined to fulfil my vision to make Longman the most desirable place in Australia to live. To achieve this, I will continue to maintain my level of community engagement by attending as many community events as possible, and I encourage anyone to come and raise any issue with me when they see me out and about. Im also happy to read written correspondence sent to my office by mail or email and meet people face to face. I will then take this community feedback and advocate for the various projects that are needed in the Longman community to fulfil my vision.Last term it was amazing to be a part of a government that delivered over 240 projects for the Longman community, from smaller projects like solar panels for local clubs and community groups and fuel vouchers for hardworking volunteers to major road projects like the third lane on the Bruce Highway from Caboolture to Steve Irwin Way, the New Settlement Road overpass on the Bruce Highway and contributing to the couple of much-needed improvements for the Bribie Island Road. Much was achieved, but there is much more to do. Im happy to work with all levels of government, regardless of their political colour, to achieve the outcomes our community deserves.Im so proud of my campaign team and volunteers from the election. Unfortunately it was quite an unpleasant election due to the weather but also the negative campaigning, with some of my opponents resorting to mudslinging, intentionally misleading the people of Longman and straight-out lying. The behaviour and language of some of the volunteers from other candidates certainly did not reflect well on those candidates. When I actually spoke to one of the other candidates about this face to face, they said, Thats politics, to which I replied, It doesnt have to be, and I still believe that. I also firmly believe that there needs to be truth in election campaigns, as the Australian people expect, and rightly so, that any statements made in the media and advertising material that include facts and figures are accurate so they can make an accurate, informed decision. I know this is a new concept.I was advised by some well-meaning people that I couldnt win by running a positive campaign, that I needed to get down in the gutter and fight dirty like the rest. I didnt stoop to that level, and Im pleased to say, by the mere fact that Im standing here, that it must have worked. This is what Im most proud of: that we ran a positive campaign with integrity and were still able to win. I hope this will be infectious to other candidates from all political persuasions. I believe the Australian public will become more politically engaged if campaigns are run in a more respectful and positive manner. As part of my role I will also put pressure on this Labor government to deliver on all their election promises in a timely manner. What the people of Longman dont want is all these promises fulfilled six months before the next election or, even worse, not at all.It has now been nearly six months since the last federal election, where the Australian people sort of decided on an Albanese Labor government. I say sort of because the reality is that only 32 per cent of people actually voted 1 for the Labor Party, which was in fact less than voted 1 for the coalition. Although I make this tongue-in-cheek remark, I do respect the decision of the Australian people, and this government were voted in fairly under our current system. This has, however, prompted many questions from constituents in my electorate of Longman and prompted many discussions and suggestions around our entire electoral system.While there have been many varied suggestions and opinions, there are a couple of suggestions that the majority of people have and agree on. The first suggestion is that they are tired of the compulsory preferential voting system. Many feel it is actually antidemocratic to force people to fill in every box on the ballot paper. Some are against compulsory preferencing, but most believe in optional preferencing.Next, people would like to see fixed four-year terms. Im also personally a supporter of this. Four years would align with local and state government election cycles and give governments time to get more done. I know there are quite a large number of people against a fixed election date, but I am in the camp of a fixed date. The main reason I would like to see this change is that before the last election, like most MPs, I had identified and fought for many worthy projects and programs in my electorate of Longman. As we approached the election date, I asked very clearly if each project was an election promise or a decision of government, as I wanted to communicate accurately to my constituents so that there could be no confusion. We announced decisions on government projects, such as $5 million for the Caboolture PCYC under the Community Development Grants Programme; $3.5 billion for the Caboolture Sports Football Club under the same program; $1.8 million from the health budget for four years funding for Bribie headspace to help our young on Bribie Island struggling with mental health issues; $5 million for a veterans wellness centre in our community; and funding from the coalitions $28.2 million Peri-Urban Mobile Program for additional mobile towers in communities like Longman that are geographically uniquely located where the suburbs meet the bush. These are all game-changing projects for the Longman community and these are all decisions of government, not election promises.Unfortunately, due to timing issues with the signing of documents due to going into caretaker mode for the election, some of these were not officially signed off. This created a loophole for the new Labor government to legally, although not morally, back out of these projects, which, for a time, on a couple of them, they tried to do. Fortunately, with the help of shadow ministers, Ive been able to ensure that the funding for most of these projects will go ahead as promised, and I hope I will eventually get them all across the line. I also note that this Labor government are now saying that they will fund them under different programs theyve come up with, with different names or as election promises. Its a cheap shot—I know—but, at the end of the day, the community gets what they were promised, and thats all that matters. To prevent this type of thing from happening again, if we had fixed four-year terms, governments would have no reason not to have any decisions of government signed off before going into caretaker mode, removing the issue of a change of government backing out of promised projects.Another issue highlighted in the last term was the need for an update to our Constitution, particularly the powers of state and federal governments. People rightly expected their federal government and Prime Minister to lead through the pandemic. It is reasonable to expect, in a time of national crisis, the federal government to lead and have jurisdiction and freedoms to make decisions on behalf of the nation. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister was not able to do this, as the Constitution clearly states that the states are responsible for the delivery of public health care and imposed the vaccine mandates. This needs to change.Longman is one of the fastest growing communities in Australia, and, as such, there is much infrastructure, services and amenities needed to accommodate this growth. My commitment to the people of Longman is that I will work with this government to achieve the outcomes for our residents to achieve the standard of living that they deserve. When good decisions are made, I will support this government; when decisions are made that are not in the best interest of the Longman community or the Australian people at large, then I will speak and vote against those decisions. I commit to the people of Longman that Ill continue to be positive and talk up our wonderful community and our great country.In closing, I would like to acknowledge all the hardworking volunteers who helped on the campaign, of which there are simply too many to mention here today. You know who you are, and I thank you. A special mention goes out to my campaign committee, including Peter and Beth, Graeme and Lynne, John, Fiona, Peter, James, Beck, Lou and Mitchell. I also want to thank my staff, Sherilee, Sue, David, Emily, James, Peter, Mel, Alistar and Fiona, for all their hard work during the campaign. Lastly, I want to thank my family, who rarely saw me for about six weeks, especially my wonderful wife, Alexandra, who, despite having her own job, helped out tremendously. Thank you, babe; I love you.","Address-in-Reply","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr YOUNG (Longman) ","(12:59):"
"0","0","0","1","1","King, Catherine Fiona MP","00AMR","Ballarat","ALP","N/A","63"," I want to begin by acknowledging the traditional custodians of the land we gather on here today, the Ngunnawal people. At the beginning of this speech, I also want to acknowledge and thank the traditional owners of the land on which I live and the land that I represent in this place, the Wadawurrung and the Dja Dja Wurrung, and I pay my respects to elders past, present and emerging.Representing the people of Ballarat is an honour of a lifetime. Its something I have never taken for granted, and its something I never will take for granted. I have said that at every election. We have to deserve peoples votes, and that starts the minute youre elected, not in the 33-day election campaign. To have the people of Ballarat, my hometown, place their faith in me over the course of a few elections now is something for which I will always be both grateful and enormously proud. To the people of Ballarat who voted for me to represent them, I thank you very much. I wouldnt be here without the tireless support of so many in the wider Ballarat community. To those who didnt vote for me, of course I also represent all of you with all of my heart.In every corner of the electorate, from Ballarat to Creswick, from Trentham to Linton and from Clunes to Shelford, our positive campaign and our plan for a better future was given a ringing endorsement, and it was heartening to see this replicated right across the country. In particular, I want to acknowledge the new communities that I represent for the first time, largely across the Golden Plains shire. Your part of the region is incredibly beautiful. Ive thoroughly enjoyed getting to know you over the past 18 months, and I look forward to getting to know you even better over the years to come.For the communities that have left my directorate—Blackwood, Bacchus Marsh and Ballan chief amongst them—thank you for the many years of support. I will miss engaging with you on a daily basis, but I think you might still see me at the occasional Easter woodchop and autumn show and especially the cherry festival. I know that in the new member for Hawke, Sam Rae, you will continue to have an engaged and dedicated local representative for years to come.The election result in Ballarat was a terrific outcome—a 2.7 per cent swing, something for which I am very grateful. But not a single point of that swing would have been possible without an immense amount of hard work from a dedicated group of staff and volunteers. Any election campaign is the combined work of hundreds of volunteers, supporters friends and family. The list is exhaustive—thank you—so I will just name a few, starting with my family: my husband, Mark, and my son, Ryan, who were out there every day. Ryan also accompanied me on the election day itself and handed out for me.Next are my dedicated staff in the electorate office and the portfolio offices. Thank you for the late nights and the early mornings. It was certainly all worth it. To the volunteers and branch members, the people who put up garden signs or handed out how-to-vote cards, who stood in the cold at the Ballarat showgrounds on prepoll: I certainly could not have done it without you. We had so many people out there, including someone who volunteered to provide food and hot coffee for us every single day, which was very kind. And of course I want to give a particular thankyou to Craig Fletcher, my campaign chair, and my entire campaign committee. Thank you again for all your help and your support.Campaigns are built on commitment and sacrifice, but that commitment and sacrifice is always easier when you know what youre fighting for and that youre fighting for a good cause to build a better country—and build a better country the Albanese-Labor government will. Whether it was our commitments to Medicare, our promise to take real action on climate change or our commitment to make child care cheaper, our message of hope and an ability to imagine a better Australia resonated with voters across the country. Our government has focused on making the lives of everyday Australians better. We havent waited. Were already delivering on that commitment. Cheaper medicines took effect on 1 January, making life a little better and a little easier for Australians who rely on prescription medicine. From July, 1.2 million families will benefit from cheaper child care. Our May budget will deliver electricity bill relief, easing the stress faced by many around the country. Were training Australian workers and tackling the skills shortages that are holding back businesses with 180,000 fee-free TAFE places. Weve established 10 days of paid family and domestic violence leave. Weve established Jobs and Skills Australia and a royal commission into robodebt to fully understand the governments and public servants role in what is a pretty shameful period of our social services history.Weve passed the Climate Change Bill and updated our climate targets. Were setting up the National Anti-Corruption Commission. Weve delivered a pay rise for aged-care workers and others on the minimum wage. And weve passed legislation to get wages moving. Weve repaired Australias standing in the world, which has been incredibly important for us both economically and in our capacity to have a say at the table at major security forums across the world. Weve ended the cashless debit card and expanded the seniors healthcare card. But perhaps most importantly, were taking the next steps on the long journey of reconciliation by delivering the Uluru Statement from the Heart in full and initiating long-awaited constitutional change.We cant fix all the problems that were left over from the previous government overnight, but were certainly not wasting a day. We want to deliver these changes, not for our own good but because we dont want to waste our time here. Ive spent long enough for the other side of the chamber to know that the halls of government are not something to be taken lightly; nor are they to be taken for granted. We have only a short amount of time here in this place and we cant waste it. I dont want to waste it in my local community and I dont want to waste it in a portfolio I represent.I have the absolute honour of having responsibility for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, a portfolio that is focused on improving the lives of everyday Australians. Every day, we commit money to projects where we look at the multitude of areas across the transport portfolio as well. These are nation-building portfolios that can and do make a real difference in the lives of all Australians, portfolios that reach into the heart of every community around the country.Good infrastructure and transport projects are key enabling forces to drive economic growth. They create jobs, they boost productivity and they improve peoples lives. Particularly as we look to build back better after COVID, effective transport policy and targeted infrastructure investments can help build equity into the hearts of communities across Australia. We want to build infrastructure so that transport is not a constraint on peoples lives but instead an enabling force allowing them to thrive. Investing in transport means those in marginalised suburbs and regions can take advantage of opportunity. It allows wealth to spread, it allows people to live where they want to and it builds a better, more connected region right the way across our nation.On our side of politics we dont see infrastructure as simply bricks and mortar or—even more cynically—a means to attain votes or sandbag seats. We see infrastructure as a means of genuinely improving peoples lives, creating secure Australian jobs and delivering a better life for working families. When we were last in government we invested in nation-building projects, in partnership with the states, like the Pacific Highway duplication, Cross River Rail and metro projects in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth.In our first months, weve picked up right where we left off. This is clear in our actions to review Infrastructure Australia, turning it back into the expert advisory body to the Commonwealth, advising Commonwealth investment that Australia really needs. It is clear in our actions to establish the national High Speed Rail Authority as well as a $500 million down payment to start works on the important corridor between Newcastle and Sydney and the Central Coast. Its clear in our ongoing commitment to the Western Sydney airport and the Inland Rail project, particularly to get the latter—the Inland Rail project—back on track so that it contributes to our national freight task.While infrastructure and transport projects are vitally important to the future of our nation, they are particularly important in our regional communities. As a regional MP, I am particularly delighted to have overall responsibility for regional development. I have a keen understanding of the issues faced by the seven million Australians who live outside of our capital cities. Those of you who are lucky enough to live in our regions, I am committing to elevating and supporting you.Those of us who call our regions home understand that our national story is as much about the contribution of our regional centres, towns and villages to the economic growth of the nation as it is about our capital cities. Its a story of incredible diversity, of richness of culture, heritage and place. This has continued over the course of the pandemic, with many being drawn away from the cities to our regional areas.Importantly, we cannot view our regions as one, for, as many similarities our regions may have, no two are the same. Our regions are defined by their diversity and their difference. Each and every region has different strengths, weaknesses, needs and possibilities, and thats been the story of this country. Governments role is to identify what those strengths are, invest in them, build on them and support regional Australia to reach its full potential.The people of Australia overwhelmingly voted for an Albanese government and the bold commitments that we brought to the election, but they also sent a clear message that the privilege of government should be given the respect that it deserves, that we need to govern in the best interests of all Australians. Australians want integrity, accountability and transparency back in their political system.We saw it with commuter car parks. We saw it with road upgrades. Weve seen it with the Community Development Grants Program that the previous member referred to. Weve seen it most recently with the audit reports of the Building Better Regions Fund. We saw it with the way in which sports grants were allocated. We didnt talk much about it but, if you look at it, the infrastructure investment pipeline had a fair bit for the previous government to answer to as well.Our government is committed to building a better future for all regional Australians, because it doesnt matter whether you live in Burnie or Broome. Our communities potential is worth much more than politics and its vital for the future of the country. When Australians see a need for a vision and for a big-picture view of the future in our economy, they turn to Labor governments. From the city to the country, Im determined to see these key economic portfolios play their role in helping to build a better future for all Australians. Thats the commitment I make.We took the promise of a better future to the Australian people and weve already taken steps to turn that vision into reality. I thank all Australians for the opportunity to govern and I particularly thank the people of Ballarat for their continued support at the last election and those proceeding. With that, I commend the address-in-reply to the House.","Address-in-Reply","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms CATHERINE KING (Ballarat—Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government) ","(13:08):"
"0","0","0","1","1","Chester, Darren MP","IPZ","Gippsland","NATS","N/A","65"," Like all members, I was very humbled to be elected to the 47th Parliament and am honoured to continue to represent the people of Gippsland to the best of my ability. I am determined, as the member for Ballarat just spoke about a few moments ago, to make sure that we can work wherever possible to build a safer, stronger, fairer and better regional Australia where everyone can get ahead. I say a simple thank you to the people of Gippsland for the trust they showed in me again in allowing me to represent their interests in this place.In that spirit of bipartisanship, I acknowledge in particular the election of the new government, recognise the Prime Ministers success and congratulate new ministers on their roles. It is a great credit to the people of Australia that a change of government can occur in this country in such a seamless way. Our democracy is precious, and the fact that we can change governments without resorting to violence should never be taken for granted. The fact that we can change governments without the election result being contested, as it may be in other parts of the world, I think is a credit to organisations such as the Australian Electoral Commission for being able to manage a sometimes emotional and difficult political debate while maintaining the confidence of the Australian people to have a fair, open and transparent election. Those results, to the best of my knowledge, werent contested in any part of the country. I congratulate the AEC for its work. I dont congratulate the AEC for the prolonged period of pre-poll voting, but Ill have more discussions with them in the months to come about exactly how many hours we need to provide for people to vote in the lead-up to the election. I think thats one area of reform that we can keep working on.Elections are a huge logistical task for all the candidates. It ran very smoothly, though, in Gippsland. I acknowledge all the other candidates who contested that election; again, the AEC staff in my region; and the volunteers who manned the booths and engaged in a very constructive, positive and respectful way across Gippsland during the election period. Also in that same vein I acknowledge my hardworking staff and family members, who deserve enormous credit for their efforts in achieving the result we as a team achieved across Gippsland. I thank them for their ongoing support in my role as the member for Gippsland.I also want to acknowledge the achievements of the previous government, former Prime Minister Scott Morrison and all the MPs and ministers I served with, whether it was in an outer ministry role or a cabinet role. I also acknowledge the members who did not return for the 47th Parliament, either through retirement or election results. Were in a stronger position than most other nations because of decisions we as a government made and because of the hard work of millions of Australians in the face of incredible difficulties.During the time of the previous coalition government we encountered natural crises, whether it be drought, storms, floods or bushfires, and of course the impacts of the pandemic. The Australian spirit has been severely tested in recent years. We as a nation have a great deal, though, to be thankful for. I will touch on those issues again later on in my comments, but we as a nation have a great deal to be thankful for. We have the institutions of government and the civic authorities that can respond to peoples needs at critical times.This year will be my 15th year as an MP. My commitment is to keep working in a very constructive way for the benefit for all Gippslanders and to make sure that I can work with the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, the previous speaker, to deliver the infrastructure and critical services we need for the future of my community. Wherever possible Ill be seeking to have a positive and constructive relationship across the chamber but also within my own community as we build partnerships to simply get stuff done on the ground. Its all very well to make decisions in Melbourne, Sydney or Canberra, but you actually have to focus on getting stuff done on the ground where it really makes a difference in peoples lives.One of the main reasons I wanted to continue as the member for Gippsland is to ensure that we are working in a very positive way to build hope and optimism, particularly among young people. I think theyve been the ones most directly impacted by the pandemic and had their confidence shaken. We need to make sure were working with those young people right across Australia, particularly in our regional areas, to let them know they can achieve their full potential from those rural and regional backgrounds, and let them know anything is possible for them in this country if they are prepared to work hard and are passionate about their studies, to learn about their trade, to take up an opportunity to start their own business or to proceed to university and get a tertiary qualification. We should never sell ourselves short as Australians or in this place for the achievements that this parliament can work in partnership with the Australian people to achieve every day.Im proud of everything that my region contributes to the nation, and Im proud of what Gippslanders do to ensure we have a safe and prosperous community. Naturally I will get an argument from every other member in this place when I say this, but Gippsland is the best region in the country. We have an enormous contribution to make to the future of the nation. But its not perfect and theres always more to be done, and I have the energy and enthusiasm and experience now to keep delivering for all Gippslanders.We recently commemorated Australia Day on 26 January. Im not here to seek an argument about that date or seek to cause further division on that particular issue. But I find Australia Day a perfect opportunity to pause and reflect on what has made our nation so successful and to even reinvigorate some pride in our achievements, plus consolidate the enthusiasm within the community to build the determination we know were going to need to overcome any challenges that might come our way in the future. I take the theme of Australia Day—reflect, respect and celebrate—as an invitation for us all to stop talking our country down and to start counting our blessings more often. That doesnt mean we ignore our modern-day problems or disregard parts of our heritage which are distressing or make us uncomfortable in some way, but it does mean we seek to build a spirit of optimism, resilience and positivity across our nation. It prompts the question on that day: what makes Australia such a great nation? Other countries have beautiful environments. There are many other countries where democracies can still flourish. Were not the only nation that has brought together many different cultures in a largely harmonious way. In my mind, in my community, it is the people of Gippsland and the people of Australia that make us exceptional.I reflected before about the challenges weve faced in recent times, with the summer bushfires of 2019-20, the floods, the storms and the ongoing impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. Throughout our nation, we are incredibly blessed to have so many people willing to volunteer in a wide variety of organisations simply to serve their communities. Whether its frontline health and emergency services or people working with environmental groups or sporting and community charities, we have people willing to give their time for their communitys benefit every day of the year. There are so many Australians who simply donate their time to quietly and diligently supporting their communities every day of the week. On Australia Day and throughout the year we should be thanking them and committing ourselves to keeping that tradition alive as a country. Its a tradition based on mateship, its a tradition based on helping those who need a hand and its also a tradition based on the need to feel part of something bigger than just our own lives.The Australian story will never be finished. Its our generation that gets to write just a few chapters during our short lifetime. I believe, in this place and in our own communities, we can all choose to contribute positively to that story by volunteering and making a statement that we care about our communities—in my case, the future of Gippsland, Victoria and Australia.Its also a time when much of the political and media commentary focuses on whats wrong with Australia. We should try and count our blessings more often as a nation. As we cast our eyes around the world and witness the stories of the pandemic, of armed conflicts and of minority groups being persecuted, we should be thankful for the freedoms we enjoy and the largely safe and secure communities we share.We cant ignore our colonial past. Its a simple fact that the lives of Indigenous people were changed forever when European settlement occurred. Subsequent generations, though, have built the civilisation we enjoy today, and, by any comparison around the world, we have brought together diverse cultures to live largely harmoniously. Thats not to say for a second that there arent problems and unfinished business we would like to change as a nation, but I believe were heading in the right direction. By working together we can address these difficult challenges, like poverty, homelessness, Indigenous disadvantage, mental illness, illicit drugs, family violence and any other shortcomings we might find in our government services. Its up to us in this place to be hopeful, optimistic and confident, and its up to the more fortunate ones among us to lend a helping hand right now to those who may be struggling physically, mentally or financially. We have to believe in ourselves and each other as we keep writing this remarkable Australian story. Now is the time for leaders in this nation to find more common ground and unite around issues of critical importance to the future of Australia.","Address-in-Reply","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr CHE STER (Gippsland) ","(13:20):"

The celebration gave us an opportunity to reflect on our own journeys. Despite most of us at Box Hill Town Hall that evening having taken different paths in life, we shared in common a birthplace, a culture and a heritage. It was pleasant to interact with many others who were born in the busy Colombo suburb of Dehiwala, where I grew up. The shared sense of experience of the bakeries and restaurants I visited as a child took me back 25 years into the past. For most of the 130,000-strong Sri Lankan diaspora, many of whom reside in my electorate of Holt, Australia is our home and has been for so many years. Yet our heritage is special to us. We are proud to carry on some of the traditions our grandparents followed. As the Chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Sri Lanka and the first Sri Lankan-born federal MP, I thank the Albanese Labor government for supporting Sri Lanka during these times of need and congratulate Sri Lanka on completing 75 years of independence.","Sri Lanka: Independence Day","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1[1]/speech/talk.text/body/p","Ms FERNANDO (Holt) ","(13:30):"

It was a privilege for me recently to facilitate the Stroke Foundations StrokeSafe speakers event at the St Vincents aged-care facility at Heathcote within my electorate of Hughes. I thank Paul from the Stroke Foundation, who provided an informative and collaborative forum through sharing his experiences. Stroke Foundation Australia focuses on prevention and treatment of strokes. My much-loved nanna and my father-in-law both died of complications from strokes, many years ago. Therefore, I have maintained an interest ever since in this debilitating condition. The Stroke Foundation partners with the community to prevent stroke, save lives and enhance recovery. This is done through raising awareness, facilitating research and supporting stroke survivors. More than 80 per cent of strokes are preventable. With strokes, the earlier the discovery, the better the recovery. It is not an automatic death sentence. StrokeSafe speakers are volunteers trained in public speaking and experienced in delivering life-saving messages about stroke. Many have either had a stroke themselves or are close to someone who has. This means each presentation is both informative and draws on their own personal experiences, making each talk very important and very powerful. I commend the work of Stroke Foundation Australia and all of the volunteers involved in the StrokeSafe speakers program.","Stroke Foundation StrokeSafe Speakers","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p","Ms WARE (Hughes) ","(13:31):"

With Professor Marcia Langton, he co-led the co-design of the Voice to Parliament initiative. We will have a referendum on this nation-building and healing issue this year.This recognition is a testament to the quality and consistency of Toms hard work, his commitment to making Australia a fairer place, and the trust with which he is regarded by all sides of politics.

This is a vital legacy project of the previous coalition governments almost $40 billion infrastructure investment in Queensland over the past 10 years. As part of this $75 million upgrade, which was jointly funded by the Morrison government and the state government, the project has doubled the number of available lanes on this stretch of highway, to four from the previous two. Anyone who has travelled that piece of road will know how important that is from a safety perspective.The finishing touches are now being put in place on these lanes, with all four expected to open to traffic in the coming weeks. Once the road is fully open, the increased capacity will significantly cut travel times for motorists and greatly improve traffic flow. Safety enhancements have also been made, such as the installation of safety barriers, and a greater emphasis is being placed on conserving the surrounding environment, with improved fauna connectivity and protection. This is in addition to the new northbound and southbound bridges at Norris Creek, Munruben, which were officially opened last year.I want to thank all the residents and motorists for their patience during the work and all the contractors for the work they did to bring this project to completion.

He is now back at school at St Edwards College and quickly showing his immediate circle of friends and family that he will not let this accident affect him further. Although Jonte still manages fatigue, stress and ongoing concussion, hes showing great signs of progress in his recovery.

It is not new—its been happening in other clinics for a long time—but it does make me angry.What makes me angry is that the previous government failed to invest in Medicare and left us in a position where we have people who cant access the primary health care that they need, because they cant afford gap fees. I welcome the Strengthening Medicare Taskforce report and I look forward to finding out from our Minister for Health and Aged Care and from our government what we will be doing to help rebuild Medicare, because we have to.

ANUs 2022 Australian Election Study shows that more than half of the country believes that government is run for a few big interests. Australians know that donations have the potential to exert influence on politics, so before they vote they need to know whos funding their candidates so they can make up their own minds about how that might influence policy positions on, for example, gambling, alcohol or climate action. I voluntarily declared all cash donations in real time during my campaign so anyone could go to my website and see my donors before deciding how to vote. Its really not hard to do.Last Wednesday, the AEC released the parties financial data for the May 2022 election. Voters had to wait until eight months after casting their votes before getting any information about the funding of party campaigns and, even now, nearly $100 million received by the major parties remains undisclosed. We have no idea where that money came from. Currently, someone could donate about $1.3 million to the coalition without disclosure by making donations below the $15,000 threshold to 83 different funding entities. No-one would know except the party, which might feel it owed them one. To rebuild trust in our democracy we need to lower the disclosure threshold, require real-time disclosure and close the loopholes.","Donations to Political Parties","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1[8]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms CHANEY (Curtin) ","(13:41):"

I know the green propaganda betrays this as some sort of a subsidy to agriculture and mining. To put it simply, this is a rebate on the tax that is paid on your fuel and that goes towards road expenses. If youre driving a tractor on a farm or using an irrigation pump or some mining equipment in a mine or quarry, you are not using those roads. So to portray this as a subsidy—I know the green movement and even Lock the Gate have gotten caught up in this when they talk about the subsidies to agriculture and mining. This is not a subsidy. This is a rebate back to a user of a tax to fund something that that particular user does not use. The agriculture and mining sector, I might remind the House, are the two sectors that have kept this country in the black over the last few years.

Theodores BullsnBarrels Bonanza hires two ATMs, as it cant use EFTPOS due to poor communications and internet reception. The same thing happened at Jambins Australia Day ceremony. Too many people were trying to access the wi-fi, which crashed the system and left people unable to purchase anything.On many occasions, the big banks have advertised for customers to use online services. While this may be viable for some people, I have serious concerns for our elderly and those who rely on local bank services.

For him, the common cause across his postings was democracy, working alongside the Papua New Guinea Defence Force in the early days of independence; serving in Indonesia during the fall of Suharto and through the establishment of a new democratic government; working in Timor-Leste evacuating people ahead of INTERFETs arrival; commanding the force sent to evacuate Australian citizens from the Solomons; and, finally, serving as the deputy chief of staff for strategic operations in the headquarters of the coalition forces in Iraq. His work in this final posting saw him awarded both the Distinguished Service Cross by Australia and the Legion of Merit by the United States of America.But when it came time for retirement, the old soldier didnt want to fade away. He wanted to continue to serve Australia, to serve democracy and to strengthen it. And so at age 67 he became a senator for New South Wales, something of an unconventional road yet somehow just right for a politician who was always very much his own man. As he joked in his first speech, even when in the military the only order he ever obeyed without question was Duck!In his passionate advocacy for the Defence Force and his deep engagement with national security issues, Jim always spoke with clarity, depth of feeling and the weight that can only come with experience. Those of us on this side of politics may not have always agreed with his views, but we never doubted the strength or the sincerity of his convictions. And I know that, during his illness and after his passing, I and many of my colleagues have recalled that, whatever passionate public disagreements one might have with Jim Molan, the private person was always very engaging company and a wonderful source of warmth and humour.Those of us engaged in politics and those of us who cover it often reach for the vivid colour of military language. We talk about decisive battles, rallying the troops, fighting for the cause or waging war on this or that social ill. But those Australians who have risked their lives for our country, those who have fought for the beliefs that we share and the freedoms that we exercise, have earned a different and deeper understanding of those words and their meaning. They have a truer sense of courage and sacrifice and of the great love required to lay down your life for your friend. They know what it is to carry the scars and trauma of those struggles, seen and unseen, and to try and adjust to civilian life, a very different world. And they know people who dont make it through.Our parliament, like every workplace, like every community, is a better place for the veterans who serve in it, who tell the truth to it, who serve their country again by speaking for those who still wear the uniform and those we have promised to always remember, as we did last evening at the Australian War Memorial. Today we honour Jim Molans contribution to our nation. We give thanks for his life, for all that he gave to Australia, to our region, to the cause of peace and to the democratic ideals to which all of us are pledged. We offer the condolences of the parliament and the people of Australia to his friends and his colleagues. I offer my condolences to the Liberal Party on behalf of the Australian Labor Party.Above all, we give our condolences to his family, who are present in the gallery—to his wife, Anne; his children, Sarah, Erin, Felicity and Michael; and his grandchildren, Sophie, Angus, Eliza, Gracie and Andy. For every honour and decoration and title and office Jim Molan held and won, he took the greatest pride and the deepest joy in being a husband, a father and a grandfather. How fitting that he passed in the loving embrace of his family and will live on in their hearts. He had, and remains having, my utmost respect. May he rest in peace.","Molan, Senator Andrew James (Jim), AO, DSC","CONDOLENCES","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ALBANESE (Grayndler—Prime Minister) ","(14:00):"
"0","0","0","1","1","Dutton, Peter Craig MP","00AKI","Dickson","LNP","N/A","73"," I want to thank the Prime Minister for his fine and gracious words, and I join with him in honouring the life of Jim Molan AO, DSC. Its an honour to have the Molan family with us today in this parliament.For all of those who attended Jims funeral on 25 January, many stories were told about his life and his legacy. One of the most touching stories was how Jim met Anne at a cadet dance in Jims first year at Duntroon. That evening, after the dance, Anne enthusiastically told her mother about the young man who had left quite an impression, about how much she liked him, and that he said he would call her. Annes mother, somewhat provocatively but at the same time protectively, I suppose, said, They all say that. But the next morning, true to his word, Jim made his way to the public telephone at the RMC shops. Such was the start of a 55-year love story, from boyfriend and girlfriend to husband and wife, to father and mother.One does not have to spend much time around Jim and Annes wonderful children, Sarah, Erin, Felicity and Michael, to see the influence of their parents. The Molan family story is certainly one of the clearest examples of parents shaping their children and children in turn shaping their parents. Jim cherished his roles as a father, as a husband, as a grandfather and as a brother above all else, and today we celebrate him in the round. The family man, the soldier, the diplomat, the adviser, the politician, the author and the commentator—there was an interplay in all that he was. Those who knew Jim could see the fathers care in the general, the generals mind in the writer, the writers knowledge in the senator, and the senators love in the family man.Jim considered himself to be an ordinary Australian, but he had an extraordinary life. He was a man who was at the centre of so many pivotal events which have shaped our nation, the region and, of course, the world: Papua New Guineas independence, the fall of Suharto in Indonesia, evacuations from the Solomon Islands, peacekeeping in East Timor, counterinsurgency in Iraq, Australian bushfires, illegal maritime arrivals on our border and the rise of China.Very few Australians could claim to have lived as fully as Jim Molan, to have seen what Jim saw, or to have engaged with the times as Jim engaged with them. He was a man thrust into some of the most difficult and challenging circumstances. He was in the middle of war and bloodshed. He witnessed suffering and the struggle for democracy. He saw firsthand what we would call the darker side of humanity. Those experiences could have made him angry and cynical or, at the very least, aloof. But for all that Jim encountered, he was kind and considerate. Whether you knew Jim or met him for the first time, he drew you in immediately with his warm and captivating quality. In turn, you always had Jims undivided attention. He always displayed generosity to the views of others, even to those with whom he disagreed. He was a gentleman, with an unfailingly courteous manner. He was an optimist about humanity, and that speaks volumes about the mettle of his character and the kindness in his heart.Jim joined the Australian Army upon finishing school. His military career saw him rise swiftly through the ranks to ultimately become a major general. He performed a variety of combat, diplomatic and leadership roles on deployment in our region and beyond. For his work in Indonesia and East Timor he was made an Officer of the Order of Australia. For the critical role he played in Iraq he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and the Legion of Merit by the Australian and US governments respectively.As the chief of operations for the coalition forces, Jim was instrumental in repelling insurgents and ensuring the security of Iraqs transport and infrastructure. Jim retired from the military in 2008, and instead of being fired upon in battle he would soon find himself battling fires—he volunteered for his local firefighting brigade. He flew rescue and water-bombing missions, drawing on his experience as a military helicopter pilot. In 2011 he was appointed as a director of the National Aerial Firefighting Centre.Perhaps unexpectedly, he was contacted by then opposition leader Tony Abbott to start work on a policy to stop the boats. After the coalition was returned to government, Prime Minister Abbott appointed Jim as his special envoy. With Scott Morrison, they set about putting policy into practice. Operation Sovereign Borders had its expected detractors, but one of its architects was Jim Molan. He helped to break the people smugglers business model—to prevent further tragic deaths of asylum seekers at sea, even to this very day, and to restore the integrity of Australias maritime security.The naysayers were proved wrong. Indeed, the policy that Jim co-designed has not escaped the attention of leaders in Europe who, to this day, contend with the same wicked problem of people-smuggling. In 2014 Jim was appointed as a special adviser to the defence minister and provided advice on the 2016 Defence white paper. He was proud of the changes it had on defence industry, technology and force structure. His passion was for national security issues.His admiration for our nation and his desire to represent the aspirations of Australians all whetted his appetite for politics. Twice he ran as a Liberal senator for New South Wales; twice he proved to be immensely popular among the partys rank and file. Twice he missed out, having been placed in an unwinnable position on both tickets. But twice he would be elected, filling vacancies left by Fiona Nash in 2017 and Arthur Sinodinos in 2019. In his maiden speech, Jims self-deprecating sense of humour was on show. Speaking after Senator Steele-John, the youngest senator to be elected, Jim said:I am definitely not competing with him on that issue! Im proud to be a member of the fastest growing demographic in this country.Jim brought his years of experience and wisdom to the role, particularly as a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, as well as migration. He also used his time as a senator to champion many causes. He supported our veterans, especially those transitioning to civilian life. He advanced research and awareness in the areas of stillbirth, online safety and prostate cancer.In all that he did, Jim fought hard, decently and well—whether in khaki abroad or wearing a suit on the Senate floor, Jim uttered his convictions with courage. He said that if opponents dont speak against you, youre probably not standing up for enough. Jim was never afraid to utter his centre-right beliefs. In a column in 2018 he wrote:ONE great strength of Australia is its natural conservatism. That conservatism does not reside only with right-of-centre parties or groups, but resides quietly in many areas of Australian society. Australians, unlike some Australian governments, will not be panicked into ill-considered change.He went on to say:We may not be a perfect society but, having travelled widely, I have yet to find a better one in the world. … you have a better chance of succeeding in Australia through hard, honest work than anywhere else.Those words speak to Jim Molan, the patriot. He was a man who knew what was valuable in our magnificent society, as he put it. He knew it needed to be defended, as he put it, from the assaults of the pessimists and the ideologues.Jims love of country, of democracy and of peace was why he spoke and wrote so often about the threats facing Australia, our region and our world. This was why he was a recognisable face on television, his voice compelling on podcasts and his words so persuasive in newspapers. The mind of a military man, one with tactical, operational and strategic insights, was on show in his bestseller, Running the War in Iraq.But its his final book, Danger On Our Doorstep, for which Jim will be most remembered. Its a warning to the present about Chinas ambitions and military build-up, a chilling assessment to ensure we dont drift into complacency or sleepwalk into disaster. His words are not those of a China hawk; theyre the words of a realist with a deep historical appreciation and ability to read the world. Testimony to his fortitude, Jim wrote that masterpiece during his battle with cancer. It was in the final chapter of this book that Jim reiterated his long-held view and ambition for Australian government to develop a comprehensive national security strategy to bolster our national resilience and self-reliance.He often thought about the future, and when he wrote Danger On Our Doorstep Im sure he was thinking about his children and grandchildren, whom he loved so much. They will grow up in a better world than the one he knew. For the boy who dreamt of being a soldier, Jim said that Australias servicemen and women represent everything that is good about Australia because they are Australian. In farewelling Jim, we can say that he represented everything great about Australia because he was not just an Australian; he was one of our greatest Australians.Jim was immensely popular and respected by his colleagues and the broader Liberal Party family. On behalf of the coalition, I offer my heartfelt condolences to our colleagues and to our party members, to his friends and to his family, but especially to his wife, Anne; his daughters, Sarah, Erin and Felicity; his son, Michael; and his five grandchildren. May he rest in peace.","Molan, Senator Andrew James (Jim), AO, DSC","CONDOLENCES","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr DUTTON (Dickson—Leader of the Opposition) ","(14:06):"

"0","1","0","0","1","Albanese, Anthony MP","R36","Grayndler","ALP","N/A","78"," I thank the member for Dunkley for her question and welcome her back from the excellent representation that she and the member for Gippsland gave Australia at the United Nations at the end of last year.We have been delivering the positive and practical changes that the Australian people voted for on 22 May. We promised the Australian people that, after a wasted decade, we would not waste a day. And, indeed, we havent. Cheaper medicines started on 1 January—the first time theres ever been a price cut in the 75-year history of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Cutting the price of medicines to $30 means that a family with two or three scripts could save up to $450 a year. On 1 February, 10 days paid family and domestic violence leave came into effect, meaning that women in a situation whereby they need to escape a violent circumstance wont have to choose between that and being able to put food on the table, because they are able to get that assistance.During the break as well, tragically, we provided immediate flood assistance and disaster relief to communities in Western Australia around Fitzroy Crossing, to South Australia in the Riverland and to New South Wales—more funding for those communities hit by devastating floods. Expressions of interest for urgent-care clinics have opened. Weve released the Strengthening Medicare Taskforce report. When it comes to our defence, we announced key acquisitions for the ADF, including high-mobility artillery rocket systems, guided weapons and upgrades to the RAAFs fleet of electronic aircraft. We launched our National Cultural Policy in Melbourne, supporting Australian artists and culture, and, at the same time, supporting our economy. We established the royal commission into robodebt. You might hear a bit more about that over coming days, because the evidence there has been quite extraordinary, with the devastating testimony about the impact of that disgraceful program on peoples lives.That follows from the other work that weve done through legislation, where changes will come in this year: cheaper child care from 1 July, and legislating a National Anti-Corruption Commission. This is a government with a sense of purpose. This is a government that is not here to occupy the space but to make a difference to peoples lives, and that is exactly what we are doing.","Labor Government","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1[2]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ALBANESE (Grayndler—Prime Minister) ","(14:22):"

Before the election, the Prime Minister promised he would deliver cheaper mortgages.

"0","1","0","0","1","Albanese, Anthony MP","R36","Grayndler","ALP","N/A","78"," Its a reality of a world where theres inflation. I think Australians understand that. Theres a lot of upward pressure on interest rates at the moment. Theyre not my words; theyre his—the Leader of the Opposition. They are the words of the Leader of the Opposition on 3 May 2022, when interest rates began to rise. The shadow Treasurer had a bit to say, too. He said, The problems are caused by factors outside our control. He said: Were facing circumstances in whats happening in the Ukraine and Russia that were not expected and were very hard to predict. These pressures are driven by extenuating circumstances.Now, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has tried this on a number of times. What she is talking about is a shared equity scheme—where, instead of 100 per cent of a mortgage being paid by the mortgage holder, less than 100 per cent of the mortgage is paid by the mortgage holder. Shared equity is what she is talking about. The deputy leader is a member of the New South Wales branch of the Liberal Party, of course. And this week the Liberal Party in New South Wales, the government of Dominic Perrottet, announced a shared equity scheme, joining Victoria and joining Western Australia. I mean, for goodness sake, dont ask questions here—maybe you should get on the phone to the New South Wales premier and to the others who had to save your preselection last time around.","Economy","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1[3]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ALBANESE (Grayndler—Prime Minister) ","(14:25):"

"0","1","0","0","1","Marles, Richard Donald MP","HWQ","Corio","ALP","N/A","78"," I thank the member for his question. Almost immediately after we rose from question time last year, the foreign minister and I went to the United States, where we participated in the AUSMIN discussions, and there was a shared sense among both ourselves and the United States that the worlds global rules-based order is under as much strain now as at any point since the end of the Second World War and that this demands that Australia and the United States work even more closely together. As a result, we announced an increased tempo of activities and exercises between Australia and the United States. The following day I participated in the AUKUS defence ministers meeting. I can report to the House that the process for establishing the optimal pathway by which Australia will acquire a nuclear-powered submarine capability is on track, and we will be making that announcement in the very near future. Despite a lost decade from those opposite, which has seen the very real potential of a capability gap opening up with our submarines, I am confident that the pathway we will announce will provide a solution to this as well as give rise to the single biggest evolution in Australias military capability since the establishment of the Royal Australian Navy by the Fisher government in 1913.Last week the foreign minister and I were in France. I can again report to the House that, after a difficult 18 months, our relationship with France is back on, thanks very much to the leadership of the Prime Minister. France is a neighbour—a Pacific power—and it matters. Under the Albanese government, France stands in the very top tier of the most important relationships that we have.Last week we also participated in AUKMIN with our UK counterparts. This is our oldest relationship. But through AUKUS, the free trade agreement, the work that we can now do together on climate change means this relationship is being given a contemporary and forward-looking focus which is deep and substantial. Later this week well be meeting in Canberra with our Indonesian counterparts. There, again, the agenda is full.After these last two months what I can say is that the world is desperate to have Australia back at the table again. When we work with our friends and allies there is so much we can do to advance our national interest in the advance of the Australian people. Spending a decade yelling at the world got us nowhere. But despite the real challenges we face, I am confident that, working with our friends, we can walk a path which will keep Australians safe.

The government said it was committing to providing more social and affordable housing in the longer term. However, families in Fowler and Western Sydney need immediate solutions to keep a roof over their heads.

"0","1","0","0","1","Rishworth, Amanda Louise MP","HWA","Kingston","ALP","N/A","79"," Id like to thank the member for Fowler for her question, to recognise that this is an important issue for her electorate and to thank her for her ongoing advocacy on rental affordability. The government does understand that rental affordability, along with housing affordability, is a challenge for many Australians. That is why something like the Commonwealth rent assistance payment is so important to help those on income support. This payment is indexed twice a year to reflect inflation and is adjusted in both March and September in line with the consumer price index. The next indexation increase will happen on 20 March 2023. The government expects to spend around $5.1 billion in rent assistance to help 1.3 million households pay their rent.Going to the members question about an increase in the Commonwealth rent assistance, as we enter into the budgetary process there are many competing priorities, and we will go through them during the budgetary process. Late last year the Treasurer and I established the Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee and have asked them to review the adequacy, effectiveness and sustainability of income support payments ahead of every federal budget. This includes payments like rent assistance. The committee is meeting regularly and is considering issues and developing advice on income support payments. Well provide that advice to government.I think, as noted in the members question, that when it comes to rental and housing affordability there unfortunately is no silver bullet. The Albanese government is already taking action through a range of measures to develop long-term solutions that do go beyond rent assistance. I would like to recognise my colleague who is leading this charge, the minister for housing and homelessness, for her work in delivering an ambitious agenda on comprehensive housing. Of course, we need to see an increase of supply in this country, and that is exactly the work that shes doing in increasing the amount of social and affordable housing through the $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund.This is one of the many initiatives that were taking. We take the issue of housing affordability, and particularly rental affordability, seriously. I look forward to continuing to work with the member.","Housing","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[1]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms RISHWORTH (Kingston—Minister for Social Services) ","(14:32):"

"0","1","0","0","1","Chalmers, Jim MP","37998","Rankin","ALP","N/A","80"," I thank the member for Hawke for his question. We are optimistic about the future of our economy and the future of our country. But we need to be realistic as well about our prospects in 2023. We need to be realistic about the challenges that are coming at us from around the world and impacting our people and our economy.Inflation is the major challenge in the global economy. Its the major challenge in our own economy. Its the major focus of the Albanese Labor government as well. Honourable members will be aware that 2022 finished with inflation at 7.8 per cent. But what they may not be aware of is that the worst quarter for inflation last year was actually the March quarter. The fastest growth in inflation was at the beginning of the year, not at the end of the year. We do know, and we do expect, that inflation has begun to moderate in our economy. While 7.8 per cent is obviously unacceptably high and puts a lot of pressure on families and others in our community, we expect that inflation is starting to moderate. It will stay higher than wed like, for longer than wed like. That is the truth of it. Interest rate rises are an inevitable consequence, as the Leader of the Opposition has previously said, and the Prime Minister quoted him a moment ago. Interest rate rises are an inevitable consequence of inflation being as high as it is in our economy.The Reserve Bank will take its decision tomorrow independently. Our focus as a government is on the pressures which are coming at us from around the world but being felt around the kitchen tables of this nation. Thats why weve got a plan for inflation which has three major parts.The first part is to provide responsible cost-of-living relief without adding to inflation—responsible cost-of-living relief with an economic dividend. Were doing that with cheaper early childhood education and cheaper medicines, and were doing that with the electricity bill relief that those opposite voted against.Second, were dealing with the supply-side issues in the economy, which were left to get worse and worse over the past decade, by addressing the broken energy market, by addressing the skills crisis and by building the resilience of our supply chains, including through the National Reconstruction Fund.Third, were showing spending restraint in the budget, returning 99 per cent of the revenue upgrades over the next two years to the budget bottom line, when inflationary pressures are most acute. That is unrecognisable to those opposite, who managed to return just 40 per cent of the revenue upgrades in the budget.This will be a challenging year for our economy, the global economy and our country, but we can do more than just batten down the hatches and ride it out. We will see this inflation moderate, we will keep building our buffers, we will keep building an economy thats strong and we will keep building a better future that Australians deserve.","Economy","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[2]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr CHALMERS (Rankin—Treasurer) ","(14:36):"

This is the year that early childhood education will become more affordable for over 1.26 million families right across Australia. That is because of this governments legislation, which passed last year, within our first six months of being elected, through the cheaper child care bill.From 1 July this year, the government is lifting the maximum subsidy rate to 90 per cent for families in electorates like Calwell, where 7,000 families will benefit from our reforms. That means that families will have more choice. Theyll be able to participate in the workforce and, importantly, theyll be able to give their children a better start in life. We went to the election with a comprehensive plan for early childhood education and care. We went to the election with a promise to ensure that more parents could go back to work and balance work and care responsibilities. We went to the election with a commitment to allow more parents to go back to the workforce, take on more hours, boost their household income and boost productivity and the economy.

In December we put to the House a very simple proposition: that Australian gas companies should be required to sell Australian gas, from under Australian soil and Australia seas, to Australians for a reasonable price—for $12 a gigajoule—going forward. Those opposite think they should be able to charge unreasonable prices. Thats their position—that they should be able to charge unreasonable prices. The fact of the matter is that, in 2021, 96 per cent of gas was sold at a price under the cap. Those opposite say its a disaster, that gas companies should be able to sell for more than that.

"0","1","0","0","1","Butler, Mark Christopher MP","HWK","Hindmarsh","ALP","N/A","82"," I thank the member for Cunningham for her question and for her relentless advocacy for better health services in the Illawarra. In May last year we promised Australians cheaper medicines, and on 1 January this year we delivered on that promise, with the largest cut to the cost of medicines in the 75-year history of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. From 1 January our government has slashed the maximum price for general scripts from $42.50 to just $30. Someone taking one medication a month could save as much as $150 every year, but a family with two or three general scripts could save up to $450 a year.We also promised to reduce the safety net threshold for millions of pensioners and concession card holders, and we delivered on that promise so that, over the course of the year, the most that those Australians will pay for PBS medicines is an average of just $5 per week. These changes to the safety net threshold will benefit around 2.4 million Australians each and every year. We also promised to lift the income thresholds for seniors health card holders, and we delivered on that, with more older Australians now eligible for a seniors health card to access PBS medicines at cheaper prices and bulk-billed doctor visits.Our cheaper-medicines policy is changing lives. Bec from Sydney said: Thank you, Albo. As a daily user of several medications, this comes as a relief when buying prescriptions, so thank you to you and to your government. Maxwell James from South Australia said: Today I was able to fill my heart medication script for just $30, instead of $42.50. Cheaper medicines mean people can afford to pay for them and not go without other household items.We are continuing to deliver on our promise to list new medicines on the PBS as quickly as possible. Just last week we listed Opicapone, to treat Parkinsons, on the PBS. Its a treatment that helps other medications operate more effectively and for longer. Around 1,300 Australians living with Parkinsons would otherwise pay as much as $1,800 every year for this treatment. Now they will pay just a $30 maximum for a general script. Simon, a 45-year-old who has been living with Parkinsons for nine years, working and trying to live independently, said, This offers myself and other Australians living with Parkinsons more options and more choice.Since 1 July just last year, our government has made 65 new or amended listings on the PBS. Cheaper medicine is not just good for the hip pocket at a time of rising prices; its also good for Australias health.","Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[6]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BUTLER (Hindmarsh—Minister for Health and Aged Care and Deputy Leader of the House) ","(14:48):"

"0","1","0","0","1","Butler, Mark Christopher MP","HWK","Hindmarsh","ALP","N/A","83"," I thank the Prime Minister for the opportunity to say a few words about this. As I am sure the member for Lindsay knows, the availability of the 10 additional sessions was a COVID measure introduced at the height of the lockdowns and decided by the former government to expire on 31 December.I will also say that the decision not to extend the additional sessions was taken after serious consideration and in light of the evaluation of Better Access I published in December. I will just run through a few conclusions from that evaluation. While the evaluation said that Better Access was largely a program that delivered positive outcomes, it also found that it was a highly inequitable program. The evaluation said this:Those on the lowest incomes are least likely to access services.And it said:All of these indicators have worsened over time.It pointed out that poorer Australians in the poorest quintile of the community have more than twice the levels of high or very high mental distress but have the poorest access to this program. It said that location of provider services was a significant factor contributing to that. It also said that poorer Australians, because of their inequitable access to this program, are far more likely to be medicated.The critical conclusion of the evaluation in response to the member for Lindsays question, though, is this. It found that the addition of 10 sessions didnt make access better; it made access worse. It cut tens and tens of thousands of Australians out of any access to services whatsoever. The number of new entrants to the program actually reduced by seven per cent and, overwhelmingly, all of the additional services went to the wealthier parts of the community, while poorer Australians actually went backwards in their access to services.I and the Assistant Minister for Mental Health and Suicide Prevention held a forum with about 80 different groups for mental health early last week. I can say this: other than the two associations representing private psychologists, not a single group urged the government to reintroduce the additional sessions. Thats because they recognise what the evaluation said: although there is a need for additional services for complex mental health, this program was not delivering it.","Mental Health","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[7]/answer[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BUTLER (Hindmarsh—Minister for Health and Aged Care and Deputy Leader of the House) ","(14:52):"

He said that the issues of current policy responsibility were a matter for the former social services minister. At different times, not only did he blame most of his current cabinet colleagues; he then blamed the left-wing media, and he then blamed previous Labor governments. The human blame factory here also blamed the complainants of the scheme.However, I thank the last word about the evidence that we heard from that particular minister concerning the unlawful robodebt scheme should be left to his former media adviser, who put it better than most: The minister requested the file of every person who appeared in the media in order to make other victims think twice before coming forward.

I know that shell be following this very closely.Improving paid parental leave was one of the most frequent proposals raised at the Jobs and Skills Summit, which this government held in September. It brought together unions and businesses, who really articulated the importance of improving paid parental leave. The Albanese government is now delivering on that. We are delivering a half-a-billion-dollar investment, announced in the October budget, to expand the scheme to six months by 2026. We wasted no time in delivering this commitment, introducing legislation in November 2022 to fix paid parental leave so its right for the times and right for the future.The legislation, currently before the House, implements the first stage of the governments changes from 1 July 2023. Each year, 180,000 families will benefit from a stronger and more generous Paid Parental Leave scheme. The current scheme does not have enough access for dads and partners. It limits flexibility for parents to choose how they take leave and transition back to work. And the eligibility rules are unfair to families where the mother is the high-income earner. Our legislation fixes this. It gives more families access to the payment, provides parents with more flexibility in how they take leave, and encourages them to share the care to support gender equality.From 1 July 2023 we will move to a single payment scheme to allow all parents to access government paid leave at the same time as their employer paid leave. This will help families maintain their income while caring for a newborn. Well also expand eligibility with a more generous household income test of $350,000, which will give more families access to the payment. We will encourage parents to share care, with an easier claiming process that allows either parent to take leave first and removes the assumptions about mothers and fathers being primary and secondary carers. Parents will also be able to take leave in a way that works for them.On 1 July 2024 well add two additional weeks to the scheme each year until it reaches 26 weeks. To ensure that were on track, weve got the Womens Economic Equality Taskforce consulting with parents, families and the community to make sure that weve got the expansion to 26 weeks right. We are delivering on our plan for a better future for families, a fairer future for families and a stronger Australia.","Paid Parental Leave Scheme","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[10]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms RISHWORTH (Kingston—Minister for Social Services) ","(15:05):"

Today the cabinet met, and the Northern Territory cabinet met as well, chaired by Natasha Fyles, and she already made a joint announcement on our behalf after we received the report from Dorelle Anderson. Its true that there were changes as a result of the decision of the former government to stop the stronger futures program in June last year, after it was put in place by the formal Labor government in 2012 over a 10-year period under then Minister Macklin.The Northern Territory government will legislate new alcohol restrictions when they meet next week so that Northern Territory town camps and communities can return to an opt-out system. The dry zones will remain in place until an approved community alcohol management plan is developed and agreed to by the liquor controller in the Northern Territory, and then it will need to be put to the local community with a 60 per cent threshold.But, as the member is aware Im sure, this is not just about alcohol. Indeed, of the 96 remote communities in the Northern Territory, 88 of them are dry. This is about intergenerational disadvantage. Its about the lack of employment services, a lack of community services, a lack of educational opportunity. This is intergenerational disadvantage, and the truth is that all governments could have done better—Labor, Liberal in the Northern Territory, here in Canberra could have done better.Thats why we have also announced a Central Australia plan for a better, safer future for Central Australia, with $250 million of investment on top of what we announced just a week ago. That will include improved community safety and cohesion through more youth engagement and diversion programs, along with improved CCTV and lighting. It will improve job creation. It will: improve on country learning; importantly, prevent and address issues caused by foetal alcohol spectrum disorders; provide better services; invest in families; and invest in domestic violence services. These policies will be developed and implemented in partnership with the Northern Territory government—with the Northern Territory controller, Dorelle Anderson. Theyre driven by one goal: real, lasting improvements in peoples lives.We know it will not be solved overnight, but we know you get better outcomes if you involve communities on the ground rather than think decisions are best made in Canberra. That is why weve structured it like this. Im very pleased that the cabinet approved this on that basis, after receiving the report from Dorelle Anderson. That report will be released publicly for all to see now that it has been considered by both the Northern Territory cabinet and the Australian cabinet.I invite the opposition to participate constructively in this. Theres nothing to be served by trying to politicise these issues. What we need to do is work together, all of us, to achieve better outcomes for the most disadvantaged group in Australian society: First Nations people.

Last week I joined the member for Jagajaga at Melbourne Polytechnic in Heidelberg to meet students who have enrolled in fee-free TAFE courses for this year. We met with students and apprentices in waterproofing, carpentry, electrical and locksmithing. We also met the hardworking teachers and support staff who help mentor the next generation.While there, the member for Jagajaga and I spoke with Natalie, one of the few female locksmith teachers in Australia. After completing her locksmithing course back in 2004, Natalie decided to return to Melbourne Polytechnic in 2018 to teach, to inspire and to support the next generation of locksmiths. According to Natalie, locksmithing is a wonderfully old and beautiful trade with a great career pathway, but like most other trades it is, of course, changing as a result of technology. Locksmithing isnt just about locks and safes; its also focused on emerging areas such as electronic security. In TAFEs all over Australia we find people like Natalie who are dedicated to supporting the next generation of tradespeople. Like them, Natalie is a great advocate for vocational education and training and someone whos focused on highlighting the many benefits of VET, with employment into good, secure and rewarding jobs.According to the OECD, Australia has the second-highest labour supply shortage per capita in the developed world. Last year the number of occupations on the national Skills Priority List almost doubled, going from 153 to 286 occupations. Thats why its so critical that we see enrolment in the 180,000 fee-free TAFE places this year: so we can ensure that workers have the skills that are in demand, that businesses have the skills theyre crying out for and that our economy has the skills it needs to grow.The Albanese government is taking a collaborative approach by working with all state and territory governments. Late last year we signed eight separate agreements with states and territories to deliver these enrolments and, as I have been advised, theres been some very good progress. For those listening, if youre interested in getting new skills or reskilling and moving into other areas, particularly areas of demand, I invite you to consider enrolling in these courses.Along the way, during the course of this year, as those places are being filled and people are acquiring skills, well be negotiating a five-year national skills agreement with state and territory governments to ensure that we have reforms in the VET sector, a sector that needs to deliver the skills that our economy demands.","Vocational Education and Training","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[12]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr OCONNOR (Gorton—Minister for Skills and Training) ","(15:13):"

What that means in practice for Australia is that, if we keep going the way were going, the plastic in the oceans will weigh more than the fish in the oceans by 2050.

In terms of that argument, you should check what the shadow said. One of the arguments thats been put, in terms of the reception of Revive—Ill go straight to it before I go to some of the detail—was that it should have been more like the RISE program. The RISE program is the one that, when it decided which Australian stories it would fund, funded Guns N Roses. It chose the Guns N Roses tour so that people could sit there hearing Axl sing Sweet Child O Mine and think: Theres an Australian story. That was their approach.What we have established now is a change to the traditional model of the Australia Council by establishing Creative Australia, bringing in creative partnerships—which previously, as a separate organisation, was separating philanthropy—but also bringing in a capacity for the organisation to deal with the commercial sector. Live Music Australia and contemporary music have forever been underfunded at a federal level. There has never been support, on the basis that its a commercial sector that looks after itself. It is the same for writers and various areas of literature. But the people who work in those sectors are the same people who go in and out of the funded sectors. What those opposite dont seem to understand—some of them do; one of them doesnt—is that people working in the arts and entertainment industry are workers too, and they have a right to fair remuneration. They also have a right to a safe workplace.Im particularly pleased that after the Me Too calls—particularly those leading to the Raising their voices report, which came out of some horrific stories from within the music industry—therell now be a centre for arts and entertainment workplaces thatll able to have a bit of responsibility in saying: You deserve a safe workplace free from harassment and free from bullying, because being an arts and entertainment worker is not being some sort of hobbyist. Its a real job; its a $17 billion industry. The fact that they give us so much joy and the fact that they touch our hearts doesnt change the fact that they should have the respect of a livelihood and the respect of a safe workplace.

Virginia Bell AC; the statement by the member for Cook, during debate in the House which referenced the Bell report; and the members reliance on ministry lists presented to the House, which noted that ministers might be sworn to administer portfolios for which they were not listed. I will refer to these materials briefly, as they raise significant issues for our Australian system of parliamentary government.The member for Cook, in his contribution to debate on the motion of censure, focused on matters of executive government, reflecting on various aspects of his prime ministership, including his ability to respond to questions in the House. He noted that the Solicitor-General had found that the then Prime Minister had been validly appointed to administer an additional department, and that there was no consistent practice for publication of appointments in the Gazette.The member for Cook acknowledged that the nondisclosure of arrangements had caused offence and he offered an apology to those who were offended, but he did not apologise for taking what he refers to as redundancy action in being appointed secretly to administer additional departments in the circumstances of a national crisis.The Bell report attributed responsibility for the failure to notify the parliament of the making of these appointments to the former Prime Minister, at paragraph 201. The report relied on the opinion of the Solicitor-General that the absence of any notification of the appointment to administer a department was not consistent with the principle of responsible government—a central concept of the Constitution which, according to the High Court, is based on a combination of law, convention and political practice.In terms of parliamentary practice about such notifications, since its first edition in 1981, the authoritative text, House of Representatives Practice, has contained an explanatory statement that any ministerial and departmental change is notified publicly and announced in the House.I find the final implication expressed in the Bell report to be most concerning—that the lack of disclosure of the appointments to the public was apt to undermine public confidence in government. Once the appointments became known, the secrecy with which they had been surrounded was corrosive of trust in government.Nevertheless, as fundamentally important as these matters are for the House and our parliament, I see no prima facie evidence to support a matter of deliberately misleading the House by the member for Cook.I remind members that the House has addressed this matter through a different procedure. By resolution on 30 November, the House censured the member for Cook, following an extensive debate on the issues I have referred to, for his failure to disclose appointments to administer multiple departments when he was Prime Minister.The matter of deliberately misleading the House is a serious one and rightly there should be prima facie evidence that the House has been misled, and the misleading has been deliberate, in order for a Speaker to act under standing order 51, and allow such a matter to be referred, as of right, to the Committee of Privileges and Members Interests. I am not able to grant precedence for a referral on this occasion.","Member for Cook","STATEMENT BY THE SPEAKER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","The SPEAKER ","(15:24):"

"0","0","0","1","1","Hill, Julian MP","86256","Bruce","ALP","N/A","90"," Of all the nonsense spouted at the last election, I think its fair to say the biggest lie was that Labor had no agenda. People tried to label us as a small target, but the first six months of the government have exposed what utter rubbish that was.We promised the Australian people that, after a wasted decade, we would not waste a day. During our first six months in government, weve passed more than 60 bills in the parliament and delivered an increase in the minimum wage and a pay rise for aged-care workers. Weve made child care cheaper, established 10 days of paid family and domestic violence leave, convened a jobs and skills summit, established Jobs and Skills Australia, ended the cashless debit card, expanded the Commonwealth seniors health card, established a royal commission into robodebt, delivered the Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee, passed a climate change bill and updated our climate targets, repaired our international relations, established a national anti-corruption commission and passed legislation to get wages moving—the secure jobs, better pay bill.The government have an enormous agenda in front of us to pursue this year. Theres the Energy Price Relief Plan to take the sting out of power bills in the face of global shocks like the war in Ukraine. Theres action to strengthen Medicare after nearly a decade of Liberal cuts and neglect. Weve got major national security decisions coming, with the Defence Strategic Review, and the nuclear submarines task force and the force posture reports. Were taking action on affordable housing, including delivering the $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund. Were cleaning up the shocking mess, the maladministration, in the Department of Home Affairs. There was a backlog of over one million visa and citizen applications when we took office. Were providing permanent protection to genuine refugees whove been in this country for years on TPVs and SHEVs. Were closing unfair loopholes used by dodgy employers that cut peoples wages.Were working on constitutional recognition of the Indigenous peoples of this land and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice to Parliament. More will be said about that in the weeks and months ahead, in the lead-up to this historic referendum in which all Australians will have their say on this humble request from Indigenous people via the Uluru Statement from the Heart.Theres a lot more I will talk about shortly, but I want to make some comments on an issue of recent and growing public concern that Ive been reflecting on.Recently there have been media reports of students in Australia using artificial intelligence to cheat in their exams. AI technology, such as smart software that can write essays and generate answers, is becoming more accessible to students, allowing them to complete assignments and tests without actually understanding the material. This is causing understandable concern for teachers, who are worried about the impact on the integrity of the education system. By using AI to complete their work, students are effectively bypassing the educational process and gaining an unfair advantage over their peers. This can lead to a lack of critical-thinking skills and a decrease in the overall quality of education. Moreover, teachers may not be able to detect if a student has used AI to complete an assignment, making it difficult to identify and address cheating. The use of AI to cheat also raises ethical questions about the responsibility of students to learn and understand the material theyre being tested on. It also highlights the need for teachers to adapt their teaching methods and assessment techniques to address the challenges posed by new technologies.Now, I have to admit I didnt write that. In fact, no human wrote that. The AI large language model ChatGPT wrote that. Last night I simply asked ChatGPT: In 90 seconds, please summarise recent media reports about students using artificial intelligence in Australia to cheat, and explain why teachers are worried about this. I think it did a pretty good job, and it represents a significant step forward towards AGI—artificial general intelligence—which we need to think about.To be clear, the development and implementation of artificial general intelligence in Australia brings both risks and benefits to the country. On the benefits side, AGI has the potential to revolutionise many industries, including health care, transportation and finance, by increasing efficiency, reducing costs and improving decision-making. AGI could also bring new opportunities and economic growth as companies invest in developing and implementing the technology. However, AGI also brings a range of risks that must be carefully considered and managed. One of the main risks is for potential job loss as machines and algorithms become better at performing tasks that were previously done by humans. There is also a risk that AGI could perpetuate existing biases and discrimination, particularly in decision-making processes such as hiring and lending. AGI raises significant ethical and moral questions such as: who is responsible when a machine or algorithm causes harm or makes a decision that is harmful to society or individuals? There is also a risk that AGI could be used for malicious purposes such as cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns.It is important for the Australian government and our society to carefully consider the risks and benefits of AGI and take a responsible approach to its development and implementation. This may include investing in training and education programs to prepare workers for the changing job market, as well as regulation and oversight to ensure that AGI is developed and used in a responsible and ethical manner. AGI brings both benefits and risks to Australia, and it is crucial for the government and society to carefully weigh the potential outcomes and take a responsible approach to its development and implementation.I confess, I did not write that, either. I asked ChatGPT to explain in two minutes the risks to Australia from artificial general intelligence—another pretty good job! I dont think Ive breached any standing orders but I am sure I will be told later if I have. I dont think theres a rule that says that members cant write their speeches with ChatGPT. Its certainly not a practice I would recommend or propose to continue in the future, though the opposition may find it useful. They could find good applications for it! What do we stand for? What are our values? Why does the deputy leader think it is okay not to have any policies? See what it has to say on that. Which of our 22 different energy policies should we have stuck with? Is climate change real? Why did we think it was a good idea to dump Malcolm Turnbull? Who let Senator Rennick into our party room? What is wrong with Alan Tudge? Ill stop with the ChatGPT references now, because I think I have made my point, but it is a serious point that I am trying to illustrate.AGI—artificial general intelligence—presents a broader and deeper set of both risks and opportunities to society than any previous technology. Plausible risks include the disruptive, the catastrophic and the existential. It doesnt take long, if you start thinking, to realise that the disruptive and catastrophic risks from untamed AGI are real, plausible and easy to imagine. Existential, however, is an exceptionally strong word, I know. It sounds and is inherently alarmist. Existential risks are posed by events that would annihilate, or permanently and drastically curtail, the potential of intelligent life on earth. There are specialist scientists and brilliant thinkers who spend their lives studying these risks—things like asteroids, runaway climate change, super volcanoes, nuclear devastation, solar flares or high-mortality pandemics—but artificial general intelligence is increasingly topping their list of worries.I havent asked ChatGPT about this, but I spent time over the summer talking with leading researchers and drawing the rest of my remarks from an article by Wim Naude and Otto Barten. AGI has the potential to revolutionise our world in ways we cant yet imagine, but if AGI surpasses human intelligence, it could cause significant harm to humanity if its goals and motivations are not aligned with our own. If humans managed to control AGI before an intelligence explosion, it could transform science, economies, our environment and societies with advances in every conceivable field of human endeavour.But the risk that increasingly worries people who are far cleverer than me is what they call the unlikelihood that humans will be able to control AGI or that a malevolent actor may harness AGI for mass destruction. Of course, many—optimists, if you like—doubt that these risks will materialise, and they remain optimistic that humans will find a way to manage them. But things are evolving so rapidly. In just the last few weeks weve seen the explosion of articles in the media about ChatGPT, for instance, and theres a new version coming soon, vastly superior. Theyre evolving so rapidly that, just as the world has finally and belatedly started acting collectively on climate change, we have to get our collective act together on AGI—and urgently so.Many think the challenges of collective action on AGI across nations is directly comparable to the decades-long efforts on nuclear nonproliferation or action on climate change through international climate agreements. So, we have to start now. While the certainty and timing of the arrival of AGI remain in question, the level of risk it poses—the same arguments weve had about climate change—and the scope of policy development that is needed to manage it warrant immediate attention and action by the government and the parliament: a concerted, serious, urgent policy think, not in the next few years but certainly this term and preferably starting this year.In every conceivable public policy domain one can foresee astounding benefits accompanied by serious risk. This includes the most serious national security and defence domains. The military applications of AI are well known, and it is widely acknowledged that AGI has the potential to transform warfare as we know it. If AGI surpasses human intelligence it could then pose a threat to our military, potentially rendering our current defensive capabilities obsolete. Defence nerds—chairing the defence committee, I spent a bit of time with them—rightly tell us theres a rapid race across developed militaries across the world to pursue artificial intelligence, given the radically improved command-and-control enhancements it can bring. But, if we lose that battle, an AGI-enabled adversary could conquer Australia or unleash societal-level destruction without being restrained by globally agreed norms.In foreign affairs, an AGI global diplomat—its not inconceivable—could actually start resolving international conflicts and see ways through that humans havent been able to see. But unequal access to AGI between nations inflates international conflict through disinformation and asymmetric political warfare. Thats in the risk column. Think about trade: the benefits, the growth in AGI-enabled or enhanced services for export. As with other technologies, if we race to get the technology, particularly in the services sector, we become more competitive and grow our economy through trade. But, conversely, those who lose out in the battle are the non-AGI-enabled industries, defeated by AGI-enabled international competitors.In employment and workplace relations, in the benefits column we can see new employment opportunities through human-centred AGI—cobots, human AGI-created goods and services using and harnessing that technology. The worst, most dystopian fears are mass unemployment as more and more of our jobs—areas of society we thought could never be automated—suddenly can be automated and done more cheaply.In the arts, online were seeing deepfakes as well as now publicly accessible art sites that can create unbelievable images just through typing in the style of a particular person or object. There is AGI enhancement of artistic creativity and endeavour. But, in the negative column, AGI could replace human artists in the literature, filmmaking, game-creation and visual arts domains. Imagine if Netflix and co could lower their costs. Australian content would be the least of our issues.In health and aged care, AGI can generate cures and treatments for diseases, we could imagine, reducing pressure on health and aged-care services. The Minister for Health and Aged Care is sitting over there. Im sure hed appreciate a bit of lowering of the cost. But in the risks column, untamed health care—AGI—could rationally decide that really eliminating the ill and the aged is the best way to achieve its goals. There is a need for ethics in all these decision-making processes.In infrastructure and transport, you could imagine an AGI road network coordinator improving safety and productivity and the environmental outcomes of road transport—big technology optimising things in ways that are currently beyond us, getting more from our assets. On the risk side: the AGI road network coordinator is hacked, allowing large-scale coordinated takeover of networked autonomous vehicles. These are not fantasy scenarios. These are scenarios we can, lets say, reasonably imagine that our national security agencies and others across the world are plausibly contemplating.Law and justice: in the benefits column, you could see improved judicial process through coordination and data analysis, improved efficiency of the penal system through tracking and other coordinated constraints. But theres a real risk column and questions: Are the existing legal constraints, which have been designed for humans, ineffective for artificial agents? Whos actually accountable for the actions of an artificial intelligence system, legally? Will we need separate legal personalities, just as companies gained centuries ago?Cybersecurity: AGI could monitor and neutralise cyberthreats at a scale and speed beyond human capability. But in the risk column, again, they could be hacked if theyre running critical infrastructure. Home Affairs or domestic security: you can see the benefits from coordinated identification, tracking and disruption of antisocial individuals and groups, and our intelligence agencies and those across the world are looking at this. But you can also see the potential for radical groups to be empowered, if they gain access to this technology, through turbocharged influence campaigns, misinformation, deepfakes and coordinated weapons systems.Even aside from the almost endless policy-nerd analysis that you could do on this, AGI has the potential to change how we as humans relate to each other. What might AGI do for loneliness? What might it do to inequality? Governments will rapidly possess ever-greater artificial intelligence capabilities, but citizens may be left behind, leaving populations in many parts of the world far more vulnerable to populist and authoritarian regimes and manipulation. Unequal adoption of the technology within societies may see large swathes of our citizens left further behind.I firmly believe that action by governments to grapple with the impact of AGI is now urgent. Nations across the world, in my view, are not yet exhibiting the necessary degree of urgency, and Australia can lead the way. We need to examine serious and fundamentally important questions right across all public policy domains in our society and our economy. What are the benefits of AGI? Think this through. What are the risks? How likely is it that well achieve AGI at all? When are we likely to achieve AGI, if we do? What risk-control efforts are already underway? What public policy thinking have we done here and elsewhere in the world around this? Are those risk controls and efforts sufficient? Why should government get involved in controlling the risks of AGI? What could government do to harness benefits while controlling the risks of AGI?These kinds of questions and deep dives will require us to consider the full toolkit of government interventions, ranging from research, policy, legislation and regulation as well as direct public investment, grants, co-investment and equity investments for public goods where markets may or are failing to serve the collective interest, whether thats research grants or similar. There are many forms that such a proper examination could take, and it wont be a static-point-in-time thing.Thinking this through at a societal and governmental level will require ongoing and, possibly, institutionalised reflection. We could consider a white paper, an expert inquiry, a parliamentary inquiry, a commission, like the Climate Change Commission, to institutionalise this topic for the next few years, at least, an international intergovernmental collaboration—that sounds catchy—that Australia leads the way to assemble or some combination of the above. The key message I want to convey is that we have to start now.Im old fashioned, as you know, on this side of the House. The Minister for Health and Aged Care is a former minister for climate change, and hes old fashioned too. We on this side of the House believe you should listen to the science.","Address-in-Reply","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr HILL (Bruce) ","(15:30):"

"0","0","0","1","1","Pitt, Keith MP","148150","Hinkler","LNP","N/A","93"," Its been a minute since the last election, but I do want to take this opportunity to pass out a few thankyous while I can. As everyone in this place knows, elections are not won by individuals alone; they are won by teams, by volunteers, by supporters and by individuals out there doing hard work for what they believe in, regardless of which side of the parliament you are on.At the election last year, I have to say they were the most atrocious conditions I have ever witnessed. In my patch, it was freezing cold, blowing 20 to 30 knots and raining. To the day I die, I will never forget Warren Truss, the former deputy prime minister, in a high-vis fluorescent raincoat standing in the rain without an umbrella trying to hand out how-to-vote cards at a school in Hervey Bay. He was in his absolute element. When I went over and asked, Warren, what are you doing? He said, Well, it has to be done, and this is what I have done for many years. I think Lyn Truss would have been quite happy to stay in bed that morning. Thats what she told me! But it is those types of contributions that make the difference locally for elections.I, of course, want to thank my family and my wife, Allison, for their ongoing tolerance and forbearance, because they get involved in this, too, as every members family does. To my office staff—to Anne, Stacey, Liz, Paula and Judy—I thank you for what you do every day. They are the forward-facing individuals who see most of the constituents—the 117,000 I have now. I thank my former ministerial staff, Gerard McManus, Kylie Barron and Candice Stower, the former chiefs of staff through the COVID pandemic, which I have to say was a punishing period of work. It is punishing to work in this place as it is, but in the midst of a one-in-100-year pandemic it was quite extraordinary, and their contribution made a real difference to our country and the response and the position we find ourselves in now. I want to thank all of them. I thank Debbie Leis, who had been with me for almost10 years. I lost her after the last election. She has gone on to do other things. What a magnificent contribution she made to my office and across the board. I thank all the members and volunteers for their support.To those on the other side who might be getting excited that this is a valedictory, it is not a valedictory. I am very clearly continuing, and I will continue to come to this place as long as my constituents send me. As long as the people of Hinkler send me to this place, I will come. As long as I have the support of the Liberal National Party and the local members, I will be here fighting for them and fighting for the things that matter.One of those things is Paradise Dam. What an incredible story: a dam that was built to a price, not to a standard, by the Queensland Labor government. It was an extraordinary failure. It is the biggest public infrastructure failure in this countrys history. It is extraordinary: the fact it was built to the standard it was built and the decisions that were made by the state. This is now a project which will cost $1.2 billion of taxpayers money to repair—to make it the same capacity it was when it started.The impact has been significant on my local region, because, without reliable water supply, you cannot grow tree crops. You cannot have high-value horticulture, because you simply cannot make the decisions necessary in the long term knowing that you can keep those products alive. If you cant water your trees, they die and they are lost. Sugarcane is a very different proposition. You can have a disastrous season and you can recover with the support of banks and others. But tree cropping is very different, as is horticulture.I want to name some constituents who were involved heavily in the fight for Paradise Dam. Jamie Hansen had been incredibly frustrated. Hes a good grower, and were about the same age. We actually went to high school together—sometimes I wonder whether far too many people might have my mobile number! I know Jamies frustration over the long period of time that it took to get this right. Our local community waited 868 days for the Queensland state Labor government to actually commit to rebuilding the dam. Its really not that difficult. Can you imagine the frustration for people who owe money, who owe their banks, who have mortgages they are committed to, who have planted tree crops looking for a future in the long term for them and their families? The hardship they have been through around this issue is quite extraordinary. It has an impact on property prices. We lost investors. We have very significant farm changeovers. It has been an incredibly difficult period.To Wayne Baldry; to Bree Grima, head of the Bundaberg Fruit and Vegetable Growers; to Dean Akers, a former sweet potato grower now growing other things—these are people who know what hard work means, and they know what happens to their businesses and the people they employ if they cannot rely on their governments to deliver the infrastructure they need. This dam was built to a price, not to a standard, and it failed. I think all governments should recognise and acknowledge what thats meant for my local community and what has now needed to be done to make it reliable, to strengthen it and to use it into the future.We continue to see challenges with the Paradise Dam. There are all sorts of experts, as you would imagine. We have seen significant problems locally in simply getting answers. Its not that much, if youre a local grower, to ask your government to make a commitment, knowing you have to pay the bank for the next 15, 20 or 30 years based on what you can produce from your hard work and the land that you own. It is not that difficult.A short history: on 24 September 2019, the Labor state government announced what you would think would be a great thing—free water for everybody. They released 100,000 megalitres of water in the middle of a drought to drop the dams capacity to 42 per cent so they could do repairs. If you can imagine, that water simply runs down the river. If you cant utilise it, its no good to you; its gone, it goes out to sea. It runs straight past my house. A short video of that water running through the weir had over 100,000 views. There was nothing to it; it was just fresh water that should have been stored for use into the future running out to sea.The state Labor government spent $100 million to lower the height of the dam wall by 5.8 metres, to knock it down. In July 2021, medium priority water allocations were just 22 per cent. Imagine trying to run your household on a 22 per cent allocation of what you expect in terms of water into your home. Thankfully, there was significant rainfall in November 2021. It led to about 20,000 megalitres a day flowing into the sea because it couldnt be stored, because the wall had been knocked down. In February 2022, state Labor finally announced how much it would cost to restore the dam: $1.2 billion. That was a knock-em-down, drag-em-out fight to secure $600 million in federal funding. I want to thank Michael McCormack, Barnaby Joyce and the former Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, for recognising how important it was that we deliver that infrastructure for the people I represent. They grow hundreds of millions of dollars worth of agriculture. Without reliable water they simply cant do that job. They are helping to feed the nation. Its an important role and one that should always be recognised.As a former minister for resources and water, I will make a few very brief comments. I want to thank the sector. I want to thank every single individual that works in the resources sector. They were extraordinary over the period of the pandemic. Their response was simply magnificent, and we see the results now, in that their contribution to the economy has grown from under $250 billion to a forecast $450 billion this financial year. Thats how you pay for roads and schools and hospitals, and it is all thanks to those hardworking men and women out there doing what they had to do and making some very tough decisions, including staying away from their families for months on end. I want to acknowledge them and the contribution theyve made. Im very proud of them. Im not ashamed of the sector; I think its a great part of Australia. They certainly help in regional Australia constantly.The Hinkler Regional Deal, just to give the House and my constituents an update, was first announced in November 2018, and we made a commitment of $172 million on behalf of the Commonwealth. Unfortunately, the Queensland state Labor government refused to sign on. They simply wouldnt sign the agreement. We had the two councils sign on to the regional deal. But, fortunately, state Labor has actually contributed and delivered most of the projects that were there and within their bailiwick. So, regardless of the fact that they didnt sign on to the piece of paper, those projects have been delivered or are underway.But there are delays, particularly at the Port of Bundaberg, on a piece of infrastructure known as a multipurpose conveyor. Picture a river port which was designed for the sugar sector. It was designed for sugar sheds, with one delivery point to deliver sugar for an industry which now is nowhere near as big. When I was working in sugar, it was considerable. It was the industry in the local region; it is not that anymore, unfortunately. There is equipment and facilities that can be utilised for other products, but they cant do it unless they can load and unload. To do that, they need a multipurpose conveyor. The years of delays for approval by Queensland state Labor resulted in an estimated almost $8 million blowout in cost, which we then had to secure federally, and we did. I hope that project starts soon, but Im told that there are even more political problems for it on the horizon. It is just a conveyor. Just build it. It will mean more work. It will mean more opportunities at the local port. It will mean more businesses that take up that opportunity.The $7 million Fraser Coast Hospice is delivered and operational. While its a terrible part of life, it is a part of life. I personally know a number of people who have utilised those services for their own end of life, and I congratulate the Fraser Coast Hospice, their board and all of the volunteers for being so committed and so strong to actually get that delivered with a $7 million package from the Commonwealth. The $5 million Hinkler agtech precinct is underway and utilised. The Hervey Bay Airport upgrade of $9 million is complete and being utilised.In terms of roads, the Boundary Road extension in Hervey Bay that we contributed almost $8 million to is almost complete. It is the missing link in Hervey Bay. It is another cross-city link that will allow, in particular, much quicker access to hospitals for ambulances and other emergency services than other areas. The common user conveyor that I spoke about has ended up at a price of almost $18 million. It should have been $10 million, it should have been built and it should have been complete. The Torbanlea Pialba Road floodproofing, with $24 million from the Commonwealth, is well underway and is almost complete. I drove through that region in the last week. It will make a difference because it provides a floodproof link for the people of Hervey Bay to the Bruce Highway. For those of us that live in Queensland, the Bruce Highway is the lifeblood of the regions. If it is cut, we are isolated; its that simple. This is a significant contribution and build.The Royal Flying Doctor Service Aviation Training Facility, with $15 million from the regional deal, has started construction. Im very pleased to say this has started construction. Can you imagine that we were ready to go for a training facility for the RFDS for their aircraft, COVID struck and, of course, there was no travel? There was hardly any aircraft movement apart from the Royal Flying Doctor Service. There were some delays, but that is underway. Im advised that it will contribute to the local economy, with some 1,200-plus bed nights for visitors to utilise at this facility. The simulator will be the only one of its type in Australia for the new aircraft the RFDS is moving into.The biggest issue for my constituents locally continues to be cost of living. Many of them are not wealthy. They cannot afford increases in power prices, food prices and fuel prices. Many of them are on the age pension. Many of them do rely on social services and parenting payments. All of them are hurting because of the current state of the economy, and the cost of food and electricity in particular. We know that those opposite have an ideological bent towards a particular solution in terms of energy. Ill be upfront: I dont. Its my technical background. I support things that work. The reason that I fight against those proposals is that they simply wont work. You cannot have the entire Australian economy reliant on the weather—because its reliant on the weather! As someone who has come off the land, I know exactly what its like to look for rain into the future and try to determine what you do if you get too much rain, too little rain or no rain. The concept that wed have the entire Australian economy reliant on the weather for its electricity supply is fraught with danger. It is a foolish proposition and it certainly shouldnt go ahead.The people of my electorate have high expectations, as you would expect, and they expect us to fight for them. No-one sends me to Canberra to sit around nodding my head in furious agreement, and unfortunately there are times where that might upset some colleagues. I remember a former colleague, Mr Laundy, always told me I was outspoken and opinionated, and while he loved it, nobody else did. Unfortunately I think I will continue to do that, because it just tends to be in my nature.However, there is more to do. If you look at the commitments the coalition made at the last election, the most important in my patch was a commitment of up to $60 million for an evacuation route for the people of Bundaberg North. Weve just had the 10-year anniversary of the 2013 flood. Most of the people I speak to, including me, would like to forget that and never see it again. It was a terrible and devastating natural event. It meant the people of North Bundaberg lost access to emergency services. They lost access to the hospital, police and ambulance in a reasonable time. They could get there, but its a very, very long way around to go back out through Gin Gin to the Bruce Highway, back through Wallaville to come all the way back around. One single investment will give them access, and that is an evacuation route aligned with the existing bridge from Bundaberg North to the Bundaberg CBD, and it is a project that should be delivered.There will continue to be debate about whether youre better to build a flood levee. In my mind, that is an incredibly difficult engineering technical problem because the banks of the Burnett River are renowned for requiring extensive piering. They are soft; they sink—its incredibly difficult. I spent a lot of time working for organisations along the riverbank, and they would put in pier after pier after pier, trying to find a foundation. The idea that youd have a pile of dirt nine metres wide and five or eight or nine metres high and not have it sink into the river could be quite challenging. So its a very, very difficult proposition, and I think it will be incredibly expensive. My view has always been the same: work out what the price is, explain the technical feasibility and get support from the local community, because it will split the city of Bundaberg down the middle. I know that those people in Bundaberg North are much more focused on the ability to save their lives, to evacuate quickly and to have that evacuation route put in place. We will continue to fight for it because its an important piece of infrastructure.I would say to the state government: yes, we all know youve got an election coming up. We all know that the state seat of Bundaberg is a very marginal seat. But there are over 10,000 people on the north side who are relying on all of us to deliver for them the opportunity for them to be safer into the future. Whether its this generation or the next, that is something that simply needs to be built.For the Port of Bundaberg, I was surprised but quite pleased to see an announcement down at the Bundaberg port. We committed some $6 million five or six years ago for a new port project which will allow for tug access, hard stand and delivery of significant infrastructure to the Bundaberg port. That is another string and another piece of the economy. I was very surprised to see it announced by the local state Labor member, who had absolutely nothing to do with it. They didnt deliver any money and werent even there when it was first announced. These are the things that happen when there is a change of government, Madam Deputy Speaker, as I am sure you know. We will continue to deliver on the things that matter locally: roads, economic development, new jobs, new opportunities.I am still incredibly disappointed that we lost a tough but necessary policy in the cashless debit card. It was overwhelmingly supported by the people who live there. More than 60 per cent—in some research as much as 70 per cent—support it. There are very few policies that come from this place that have that level of support across the entire constituency. They supported it and they knew it was difficult, but it worked. The amount of people who would stop me on the street to thank me because it made a difference for their grandkids, for their kids, for their cousins, for their aunties, for their uncles—it had extensive support, it made a real difference and, unfortunately, that has been lost. We will continue to put forward policy positions like that because they make a difference. What else are we here for if not to make improvements for the people that we represent?When I came to this place, almost 10 years ago—10 years in September—my sole focus, and it remains, was to build our local economy so that we can lift people out of poverty, so we can give them an opportunity for a job, an opportunity to be trained, an opportunity for them to make their own decisions and an opportunity for them to live their lives in the way that they choose and to pay their own way. To do that, they have to be employed in well-paid jobs that are in the region. And Ill continue to fight for that, because it matters. The unemployment rate has come down significantly—significantly—but it is still not at the national average. It is still above the national average, including for youth unemployment. So that is what I will continue to deliver on for the people whom I represent.As I said at the commencement, while they continue to send me, Ill keep coming here and Ill continue to fight for them.","Address-in-Reply","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr PITT (Hinkler) ","(15:50):"

I pay my respects to elders, past and present. I extend respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples here today.Our First Nations people are at the heart of our national identity, and the identity of First Nations people must be at the heart of our nation. The spirit of reconciliation must not be confined to pleasant words and false promises. It must not be determined by those who do not directly represent First Nations people. It must stem from a source of action—action to reconcile, action to represent and action to recognise. It was Prime Minister Gough Whitlam and a Labor government who poured the soil stolen from the Gurindji people back into the hands of Vincent Lingiari. It was Prime Minister Keating and a Labor government who confronted our national identity when Keating delivered the Redfern address. And it was Kevin Rudd and a Labor government who led the parliament in an apology to our First Nations people. And it will be Anthony Albanese and this Labor government who will implement the Uluru Statement from the Heart in full: Voice, treaty and truth.With a draft question suggested, it is now time to listen and to make our way towards implementation. In doing so, we progress a referendum to constitutionally enshrine the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice to Parliament as a matter of priority. For far too long, tragedy has unfolded for First Nations Australians: they die too soon, they are educated far less, incarcerated too often and suffer more preventable disease. It is saddening to me that not much has changed in the 10 years since the apology. Its really time to improve, finally, the lives of First Nations people. These issues are generational and structural, and the only way to remedy the issues is to implement structural change while talking with First Australians. The Uluru Statement from the Heart, constitutional recognition and an Indigenous Voice to Parliament will work towards doing this.Last years election was a choice, and I want to thank the people of Werriwa for choosing me to be their representative in the federal parliament for a third term. It is an amazing honour to represent an area where I have lived all of my life and where I have raised my children. No campaign is won through the actions of a single person, and that rings true, of course, for my campaign. There were so many people willing to sacrifice their hard-earned time to help re-elect me and a Labor government. I want to acknowledge all the volunteers and branch members who helped out in any way they could. Whether by letterboxing, doorknocking, phone-banking, on pre-poll or on election day, your help was vital in our success and you should be as proud as I am humble at what we achieved together.I would like to extend a special thank you to my staff, who supported me during the tough campaign: Sharon, Natalina, Liam, Adrian and Raff. I appreciate your support and care for our community. To former staff members Nathan and Christy: thank you for your support over the past three years. I would also like to acknowledge my campaign manager extraordinaire, Loretta Fletcher, who steered the ship so well and whose friendship and support I am always really grateful for. Id like to thank Ethan, Stella and Daniel for the support that they also gave the campaign.It would be remiss of me if I did not mention the wonderful elected members of parliament in my part of the world, a group of people who truly care about our community. I acknowledge them for their support: the members for Macarthur, Liverpool, Macquarie Fields, Fairfield and Campbelltown, and also the Liverpool, Campbelltown and Fairfield Labor councillors. I look forward to our continued work together, this time in government, to improve the lives of people we represent.I also acknowledge the support of my family, whose unconditional support, advice, help and love is always appreciated. Larry, Matthew, Christopher, Andrew, Chantell, Siobhan, Kate, Meaghan, Horatio and Kathy and my wider friends and family, I couldnt have done any of this without you, and I certainly couldnt have staffed several of the booths.On Saturday 21 May, there was a culmination of Australias eligible voters participating in democracy and voting for a change in government for a better future. Over 13 million voters made a choice in this election, many of whom were participating for the first time. They expect a lot from this government, and I will work to ensure that they are not disappointed, because Australia really did need a change in direction. But democracy is fragile and, with the pursuit of political pointscoring comes the danger of misleading voters. Words matter. What you do matters. Once the trust in the system is lost, societies start to disintegrate. It is not okay to make up fanciful or farcical things about policies or opponents.The lies I observed during this election campaign are something that I have not experienced in 30 years of political activism, and it needs to stop. Basic politeness and truth are necessary. Bullying voters is not okay, telling them untruths is not okay and manipulating images and words is neither cute nor funny. It is also not okay for members of the public or those running for office to continually break rules and abuse the process. Perhaps the most egregious example of this was when a message went out to voters on election day revealing the arrival of an asylum boat, completely ignoring previous policies of that government about on-water matters and other conventions.I would, however, really like to congratulate the AEC workers across Australia and especially those who handled the election for the seat of Werriwa. They work long and stressful hours in the election period, but they are beyond reproach, ensuring that elections are run fairly. They do not deserve what I saw in terms of the abuse that they got. In future, members of the parliament and those seeking office should think about that.Thankfully, though, the people of not just Werriwa but Australia as a whole didnt fall for these misleading comments or succumb to widespread misinformation. They voted for a better future. They voted for a better life, because Labor will strengthen Medicare, we have already made child care cheaper, we will build more affordable housing and we will address the structural issues that cause inequality. People voted for secure, well-paid jobs as Labor creates them in growing industries, offering 465,000 fee-free TAFE places, creating up to 20,000 new university places and closing the gender pay gap. Our government has already delivered fee-free TAFE places, starting from the beginning of this year.Australians voted for a future made in Australia. Our Labor government will back Australian workers and businesses, invest in our manufacturing capability, diversify our economy and make Australia self-reliant—something that was clearly necessary through the last few years and, sadly, wasnt there. The Albanese government has already introduced much of the legislation needed to enact these promises, and we will continue to work to improve the economy and the fabric for Australians.The Jobs and Skills Summit held in September last year saw what a government can really do when it talks to its constituents. With delegates from all corners of Australian society, there was a mood for change, with 36 immediate initiatives identified to help spur wages growth and alleviate the skills shortage. Australians voted for action on climate change, and Labor has already legislated for net zero by 2050, with a 43 per cent reduction target by 2030. It will be backed by the creation of over 600,000 jobs, complemented by our Rewiring the Nation plan and the electric car discount and community batteries policies.Australians voted for a national anticorruption commission, and Labor has already passed legislation in this House for a commission with teeth. With every state having a dedicated corruption commission, its really an embarrassment that the previous government failed to even table a piece of legislation in the House. Integrity is one of the key issues that voters care about, and action has to be taken.Australians want to see our oldest citizens afforded proper care and dignity, and our government has already implemented significant numbers of the recommendations from the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety final report, with work continuing to implement more.They voted to put the humans back into human services and to protect the NDIS and get it back on track so that it works for people with disability and, more importantly, works with them. The Albanese government and Minister Shorten have worked to improve the NDIS, streamlining cases before the AAT and improving support to participants.The Albanese government is also working to ensure that Australians can live in housing they can afford by building up to 30,000 new social and affordable housing over the next five years. Twenty thousand of those homes will be for some of the most vulnerable members of our society—particularly those fleeing family violence and older Australians at the risk of homelessness—and 10,000 of those homes will be for frontline workers who selflessly worked every day through the global pandemic, keeping us safe.Australians have been feeling the effects of nine years of neglect. Those most vulnerable who live in social housing have experienced it firsthand. Their houses have been left to fall apart, without repair for years, especially in remote Indigenous communities, which are experiencing some of the worst housing standards in the world. Weve committed $200 million to tackle this problem.The wait for social housing in my part of the world is 20 years, and a decade of New South Wales Liberal government has just made this worse. Several of my constituents have come to my office telling me that their social housing is about to be sold, which is causing even more distress at the possibility of having to leave a community theyve lived in for more than 60 years. Unfortunately, the letters telling them that the houses would be sold do not come with a real indication of what happens next for them or how people who have lived in their homes for 40 or 60 years are going to be able to make that move. This is something that has got to be rethought for my community.We know that young people have been acutely affected by the pandemic, exacerbating issues that disproportionately affect them, such as mental health, housing and job security. The results of the 2021 census show us that Werriwa is a significantly younger electorate than the rest of Australia and New South Wales and that the median age is 34 compared to New South Waless average of 39. According to the Salvation Army Social Justice Stocktake, the biggest issues that my constituents care about are mental health and housing affordability—with housing affordability coming a close second. Thats why the commitment, at the last election, for a headspace in Edmondson Park, in my electorate, will be something that will be welcomed by young people there. Ultimately, these local and national initiatives mean that the people of Australia no longer need to feel left behind by their government. They no longer have to put up with someone who never takes responsibility and constantly spouts untruths. The Australian people have a leader and a team to take responsibility for things that matter most to Australians.The 2021 census showed Werriwa is becoming more diverse, with almost 50,000 of our residents being born overseas and 66 per cent of households using a language other than English at home. But Werriwa is not a static electorate. Our cultural identity constantly shifts, ebbing and flowing as the rich diversity of cultures that is south-west Sydney continues to grow and call our suburbs home. Not only are we a culturally diverse community; were also a spiritual one compared to the rest of New South Wales and Australia as a whole. I am always honoured to attend observations in Catholic, Anglican, Islamic, Buddhist or Hindu places of worship and schools, and to join observations for Ramadan, Eid, Diwali, Holi, Lunar New Year, Easter, Christmas and the other wonderful celebrations and events. I sincerely thank the members of these congregations for their patience and generosity. By inviting me to share your beliefs and customs, you enrich my understanding of the world as a whole and of our community.The electors of Werriwa have needed a government that will work for them, with meaningful policies to address GP availability, affordable medicines, housing, climate change and aged care, and a federal ICAC. With our communities in south-west Sydney growing rapidly and with the new developments and the creation of the Western Sydney airport, it is important that there is proper planning and sustainable growth. Jobs from the construction phase of the airport and ongoing jobs need to be created, to the benefit of the local area. We also need the infrastructure, the road networks and the train networks that will service the airport and make our part of the world continue to work.I will continue to fight for the residents of Werriwa on the issues that they care about, and I thank them all for supporting my election, and me, again.","Address-in-Reply","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms STANLEY (Werriwa—Government Whip) ","(16:10):"
"0","0","0","1","1","Gillespie, David MP","72184","Lyne","NATS","N/A","99"," I rise today to speak about the wonderful happenings in the Lyne electorate and matters in this wonderful place Im privileged to stand in. This morning, I moved a motion in favour of recognising the amazing nuclear capability that our nation has through ANSTO and ARPANSA and the operating of three nuclear power plants. We are a world leader in radioisotope production. In fact, we supply 27 per cent of the worlds medical isotopes for diagnosis and treatment. Not many people realise that. We have been irradiating silicon to make silicon chips for the computer market for decades. We have a huge slice of that, and the world depends on us to do that work at Lucas Heights; otherwise, there wouldnt be enough chips.The amazing thing about the Australian nuclear potential is that we have the possibility of the whole box and dice, with new, modern small modular reactors replacing our retiring coal fleet. To put things in perspective, that is quite urgent. We saw what happened to the electricity market when one power station closed one of four units. That was Liddell—but there are three more units to close. By 2030, if any more coal-fired power stations bring their closure plans forward, we could be losing up to 60 per cent of our baseload generating capacity.We know that, because of the percentage of time that renewable energy generators produce energy, whether they are wind or solar farms, their capacity factors vary from full on. For solar, theyre available on average 24 per cent of the time in a really sunny country like Australia, but there are plenty of times when they produce none, like every night and every evening, and at dawn, when theres not enough to generate electricity. And there are weeks and months when there is low wind activity, even in the high-wind areas. Thats why the capacity factor, or the percentage of time that renewable wind farms produce energy is, on average, about 30 per cent on land. Offshore, you might get to 35 per cent. They also have a finite life span. These wind turbines and solar panels only operate for so many years. After about 10 years, 15 per cent of wind turbines will have some mechanical problems. Theyve got a design life of 20-plus years, but, from experience overseas, it turns out that its much shorter than that. Thats why we need to replace base load with base load.In Australia the transition, which is now enforced by legislation, means that these coal-fired power stations will close, unfortunately, without any adequate replacement. Thats why the whole motion I moved was aimed at removing the blanket prohibitions that exist at the federal level—because were dealing with federal legislation in the ARPANS Act—that prevent ARPANSA licensing a nuclear power plant to produce electricity. The paradox is that weve had three nuclear power plants in this country. The one at Lucas Heights is an open reactor, so it doesnt have a pressure vessel that stores the heat, but it is the same technology. And were quite comfy with Lucas Heights operating.","Address-in-Reply","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr GILLESPIE (Lyne) ","(16:25):"

Its a blanket prohibition on nuclear fuel being made here or in a nuclear reactor. But a nuclear reactor, as I explained this morning, uses less than five per cent enriched uranium rods, which is far less than what is in the reactor at Lucas Heights, which is high-assay, low-enriched uranium. Its up to 19½ per cent. No-one bats an eyelid down there, but its between three and 4.9 per cent. There is no way that can irradiate anyone in the region. Inside a pressure vessel, if you happen to be stuck inside one, you might get some radiation. But its a nuclear kettle; thats all it is. Im trying to demystify what is in a nuclear reactor. People shouldnt be afraid of it. Unfortunately, we have seen responses that nuclear reactors, particularly the small modular reactors, are something way off in the distant future.As I mentioned, in Canada, Ontario Power Generation, the public utility that runs the power system and runs 22 nuclear plants in Canada, is well advanced in its plans to build a new 300-megawatt small modular reactor. Its going through its final licensing. It will be built and operating in five years. Its not off in the twenties, forties or fifties, which people on the other side seem obsessed with.The economics of them is the other issue that they tend to criticise us about. When I was in Canada, the retail price for electricity at the electricity plug in the block of units I was staying in—I thought, Lets see how cheap it is in Ontario? Have you looked at your bill lately, Mr Speaker? You might find that youre paying 35c wholesale before all the margins are added by transmission costs and those things—it was 6½c Canadian. Thats about 8c. Thats the retail price at your plug in Canada, because, in Ontario, 65 per cent of their power comes from nuclear power plants. Theyve also got hydro. They had a green energy act doing all the things that we are doing now. It started in 2008. But by 2008 theyd abandoned it in Ontario and repealed it because they found their cheap, reliable electricity was becoming more expensive every year. Whilst electricity is cheap when youre getting it from a wind turbine or a solar panel in the paddock or out at the massive solar farm or on your roof, to integrate it into an electricity grid and machines is very expensive, and people dont appreciate that.The argument that is always put up is that nuclear energy is too expensive. Well, that is an absolutely false assumption. Electricity in France is the cheapest in Europe, almost. The only people that get cheaper electricity are up in Sweden, and theyre expanding their nuclear capabilities too. They sell into Europe. They are the biggest exporter of electricity in the world. They have 70 per cent of their energy from nuclear. They have never had a nuclear accident, which is the same as Canada. They have been involved in nuclear power plants since the 1950s and have never had an accident.Three experienced engineers have analysed the average cost of these new SMRs. They have lectured on these economics and it looks to be an overnight cost of A$7,200, if you look at all the published data around the world. That is a far better figure than what is mentioned in the GenCost report, which hasnt even analysed nuclear for two years and wont until the next GenCost report in two years. But its quoted as bible.A standing committee of this House in 2019 interrogated the GenCost report. The member for Fremantle spoke on this, but what he omitted was that there were many more depositions from people who actually had experience of being involved in power plants who disputed those figures. So we interrogated the CSIRO, which had their name put to that report. They said: We didnt actually write the report. We got this company, an engineering firm based in New South Wales and Queensland, to do it. So we interrogated them, and they hadnt even checked with any vendors or operators of nuclear power plants. They hadnt even done their homework. They relied on one article, put out by the World Nuclear Association, and extrapolated on it. So we contacted the World Nuclear Association, and they didnt have any figures that were remotely like anything proposed in the GenCost report.Now the GenCost report is written by a different engineering firm. There are other engineering groups that have analysed the GenCost report. A very eminent Canadian trainer and experienced engineer and a group of concerned engineers and scientists have written to AEMO, alerting them to this fact—that their projections are not accurate and are faulty. There is another group that have analysed it—the Energy Policy Institute of Australia. It is a not-for-profit, non-partisan group that analyses all energy policy. They did an economic analysis of the integrated system plan which is based on that GenCost report, and they found it totally inaccurate. The scary thing is that the integrated system plan has relied on the GenCost report in its nonconsideration of nuclear. Its been summarily dismissed.So it is a question of getting some reliable data on the record about the cost of nuclear. Looking at recent builds in the world, Japans last build took three years to build a huge—over 1,000 megawatts—plant. When I visited the Emirates in 2013 in my first term in parliament, they were then embarking on building their nuclear power plants. Now they have built four of them in the space of time that I have been here. Theyre four huge, 1,400-megawatt plants. Thats almost as big as Liddell, and they have built four of them. Three of them are commissioned and running now and the fourth one is due to come online this year.The people at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have analysed the cost of all these builds, and there are three standout large nuclear builds that have been running over time and over budget. They are case studies for how you shouldnt build them. They were built without full plans or full certification. They changed the plans. If you know how long it takes to get regulatory approval, you will know it was a very unwise move. But, if you are building with a known plan and a known product, you are fully licensed and you have competent builders with a supply chain, they can build them very quickly.As I said, the small modular reactors will deliver efficiencies of scale. They are all the latest generation, either generation III or generation III+. The old generation, generation I, were built in the 1950s, and in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s it was generation II, and then we went into generation III, which were built with passive safety features. So you can walk away and just turn them off and wind them down. Everyone knows the disaster that happened at Chernobyl. Those old Russian designs arent built anymore. If you used one of them, it would be like buying a new car but getting a 1950s designed car. It was badly managed. They had no safety culture and they used it way beyond expectation. That design had inherent faults in it. Thats why there was such a horrible accident.Fukushima was a horrible accident. We admit that. But it wasnt a nuclear explosion that happened; there was a hydrogen gas explosion inside the plant because the cooling systems that were destroyed by the tsunami were knocked out. Diesel pumps flooded by the tsunami were the reason the heat in the core built up, and there was a meltdown. When it gets that hot, the oxygen and other things get separated from the zirconium alloy, and hydrogen is produced. When that meltdown occurred, when the hydrogen gas got exposed to air, it ignited, and thats what caused the explosion in Fukushima.That was a generation II plant. Plants built since then have inherent safety features, just like the Volvos that you get now have a lot of passive safety systems, just like your mobile phone is now small and much better and much more capable. Things can get smaller but more efficient, and thats whats happening in the nuclear space. These generation III+ and the new generation IV ones that are planned—youve heard of the Natrium reactor that Bill Gates is involved in—are of the next generation. They are incredibly safe.I will just take this opportunity to mention where we sit in the world of nuclear. I mentioned this morning that we are incredibly well respected. We are part of the International Atomic Energy Agency membership. We sit on all the safety committees. ARPANSA regularly has Australian officers interrogating. In fact, the former head of ARPANSA, whos still finishing up the inquiry into Fukushima, is an Australian. Thats how well regarded we are. We are incredibly well regulated. We have a non-proliferation office. Weve signed up to all the appropriate international treaties, such that other countries trust us and know that we can regulate this technology very well.At the moment there is a huge expansion of nuclear activity in the world, almost like a stampede. In the past its been called a renaissance, but its actually a stampede. Countries that are existing nuclear giants, such as France, the UK, America and Canada, have all announced that they are undergoing massive expansions of their nuclear plants, both large reactors and new small modular reactors. Canada are the most advanced, and they have an equivalent regulatory structure and phenomenon of legislative similarities. They are very similar to Australia, and they would be a great model for us to follow.Other countries around the world are getting into nuclear. Sweden has now announced that, rather than retreating from nuclear, its building more, and its the same with Holland and, as I mentioned, with France, where there are 14 new reactors and where theyre building their own small modular reactor.President Biden has given $6 billion to maintain all the existing nuclear plants in the US, and theyve got developments happening across the country as well. In California, the California legislature voted 157 to three to keep the huge nuclear reactor at Diablo Canyon running. The phenomenon they have is that they have a very large penetration of renewables in their grid, and—surprise, surprise!—they have blackouts quite regularly, like South Africa has. They have blackouts regularly. Theyve let their baseload coal-fired power stations decline. And thats where were going to end up. Were going to end up like California and South Africa, where they issue notices every day about which city wont get electricity, like it used to be in the 1950s and 60s. It is scary.Other countries around the world are lining up to increase the percentage of their grid to nuclear. That is something that we need to consider very seriously. We have all these coal-fired plants that are going to close because the regulations restrict their free trade and because the renewable energy targets and our other legislated climate targets mean they are doomed to fail. So we need to get an adequate replacement. We can do it, but the first cab off the rank is to consider removing the ARPANS Act and the EPBC Act so that our bureaucrats can analyse things, as we have done, and businesses can look at feasibility studies. No-one will come to Australia and do it unless we remove those prohibitions. They will still have to be analysed for safety and environmental outcomes, like any other major development, but I call on this House to have a say and look at how important a civil nuclear industry is when weve got the AUKUS agreement, where were going to run nuclear subs. We need a civil nuclear industry to support the take-up of nuclear-powered submarines. Its a critical part of infrastructure that isnt even mentioned but is going to be essential for Australia, for us to have nuclear powered subs— (Time expired)","Address-in-Reply","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[6]","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","1","Elliot, Justine MP","DZW","Richmond","ALP","N/A","101"," Following on from the member for Lyne, who, I note, dedicated his entire speaking time to talking about nuclear power—I know he and many of the National Party members do like to spruik nuclear power everywhere—can I make it really clear that my opinion and the opinion of people in my area is that nuclear power is too expensive and far too dangerous. That is a view that has been echoed many, many times right throughout the North Coast of New South Wales. One of the reasons people are such strong opponents is that we do know that it must be based in close proximity to water. So coastal areas, indeed, such as the members electorate, would be a prime location. I did want to put on the record, given the previous speakers strong commitment to nuclear power, how much I oppose it, considering how dangerous it is.Today, for the address-in-reply, I would like to particularly thank the people of Richmond for entrusting me to be their representative here in the federal parliament and, very importantly, for their strong voice for the Albanese Labor government. It is indeed a great honour to represent your community here, and one that I take very seriously.Of course, in the election in May last year, people in my region voted for change, for a new government and for a new direction for this country. I would like to acknowledge and thank the Prime Minister for his leadership and commitment to improving the lives of all Australians, no matter where they live. Those of us in regional and rural Australia certainly know what a strong understanding the Prime Minister and the entire government have of the needs of people in regional Australia.When it comes to my area, the Prime Minister has been to the New South Wales North Coast many, many times over many decades. He certainly understands the people and the issues. In particular, he was there on the ground a year ago, soon after the very devastating floods that we had. Indeed, we are coming up to the first anniversary of the floods that hit the North Coast very hard. There is still a lot of widespread trauma across the region because of the floods. Many people are still looking to get a lot of their premises and residences repaired. As we often say, when it rains, everyone panics across the North Coast, because of the extent of that devastation. The Prime Minister was there soon after, on the ground, listening to locals about the impact of the floods. Were talking about the area from the border region right through to Ballina in the southern part of my electorate and, of course, the adjoining area in Page—Lismore—which was severely devastated. The Prime Minister was there listening and talking to people right throughout the region, in my area, in Ballina and in Murwillumbah. Indeed, many others from the Labor team came to hear firsthand about the impact on our community. Since being elected, the Albanese Labor government has delivered much-needed funding to the region to assist with the recovery.As I said many times during the federal election campaign, only voting Labor will ensure that you get a Labor majority government to deliver on our commitments. It is the only way we can deliver on our agenda to improve peoples lives. I really want to acknowledge and particularly thank all the many Labor members and volunteers who worked very hard for my re-election and the election of the Albanese Labor government. I would especially like to acknowledge my incredible, hardworking and dedicated staff.As I said before, our region has been devastated by the floods, and, as Ive said many times to people in my community, Im here with you every day, every step of the way. It has been a very long year and a very difficult year, but we are a very resilient, very close community and we look out for each other. What I would like to point out is that there is still a lot of widespread concern that the former Morrison government failed to provide the support we needed on the ground at the time, especially by denying us extra disaster payments, which were made to people in areas south of my electorate of Richmond. To this very day I find it absolutely staggering, as do people in my region, that the former Prime Minister, the member for Cook, played politics with peoples lives when they had been devastated by floods. You just cant do that. Indeed, we saw a similar tale in New South Wales with the former Deputy Premier of that state, when we were made aware of the rorts that he set up in relation to the bushfire grants. What I say to all of those in the Liberal and National parties is that this is above politics. When people are hit with natural disasters, you need to (1) be on the ground and listen to them and (2) provide the support and services they need, because this impacts people for a long time. At the time when the member for Cook denied us that extra funding, it was a really significant blow to those people who had lost so much.In terms of the flooding and its impact, we do need to see greater planning from the New South Wales government around emergency management. That was certainly highlighted at the time and in all subsequent inquiries. What was exposed was that the New South Wales government had really nothing in place to provide the immediate support needed, the recovery or the rebuilding. We were left on our own. The community rightly demanded a lot better in terms of that planning and resourcing. This is an issue on which the state government certainly needs to place a greater emphasis.At the federal election, the people of my area voted for change, for a new government and, of course, for our plans to build a better future for everyone. Since the election, weve hit the ground running and demonstrated the approach to the values that really do shape this government and demonstrated that we really want to get things done in a determined way to improve peoples lives. After that decade of waste, inaction and delay from the previous government, we inherited a whole range of problems that we got to work on immediately. The previous government left us an economy with a trillion dollars in debt, declining productivity, wages going backwards and Medicare in crisis. There are so many issues right across the board. Aged care is in crisis as well. We inherited this from the previous government because of their inaction. It always does fall to Labor governments to make the big reforms that create lasting prosperity and a better future for everyone.Weve really hit the ground running across a whole range of different areas, and here we are now, on the first sitting day of 2023, looking back on all of the commitments weve delivered on since being elected. There have been so many changes that have improved peoples lives. One of the most important things in my area is investing in secure local jobs. In the regions, its vitally important. Weve delivered investments in skills and training, including fee-free TAFE in areas of skills shortage. Thats really important to support local jobs and protect local regional economies.Also, of course, weve delivered real action on climate change—an issue that so many people in my area and across the country have been calling out for for such a long period of time. Many issues that were addressing relate to the cost-of-living increases, like cheaper child care. Again, this is another issue that families have desperately called on for so long. Fixing the aged-care crisis is vitally important for our older Australians when they need to access that care. When it comes to health care, were providing cheaper medicines and working to fix Medicare and all of the problems that we inherited because of the inaction of the previous government. Another really important issue is housing affordability, which we are acting on through a whole range of different measures. This, particularly in regional areas such as mine, is incredibly important.Another reform that people have called for for a long time is the federal anticorruption commission. Finally we have that underway in this country because of the Albanese Labor government. Many people have been calling for this for a long time. We are very proud to have been delivering on that, as well as on the 10 days of paid domestic violence leave and paid parental leave, which are so incredibly important. Also, advancing the Voice to Parliament is a really important initiative that I hope all members of this House think seriously and deeply about. I hope they embrace that and stand with us to get the Voice to Parliament. It is such an important issue as we move forward.One of the many things that we have achieved is scrapping the former Morrison governments cruel cashless debit card. We committed to doing that, and we have done that. In doing so, we protected many pensioners from being forced onto that card. We knew the Morrison governments agenda was to force our age pensioners, in particular, onto the cashless debit card. People elected us to get rid of it, and we have done that. Many of our initiatives, like our Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Secure Jobs, Better Pay) Act 2022, have been about getting wages moving, helping close the gender pay gap and promoting job security.On a local level, we are delivering on all of the commitments that I made during the election, and they will mean big improvements for the North Coast. First is the $5 million for the one-stop veteran wellbeing centre in the Tweed shire. It will be a one-stop shop for veterans and their families to access a range of services, including wellbeing support, advocacy, employment, housing assistance and social connection. Its so important to have this veterans hub. These are people who have sacrificed so much for our nation. They need to have that dedicated space to have that assistance provided. All that work is underway in consultation with our local RSLs to make sure that we have in place the veterans hub they need.Another election commitment was $1 million for a new pound and rehoming centre at Murwillumbah. This has been desperately needed since the old pound closed in September 2019. This $1 million election commitment comes on top of another $1.76 million in federal funding, a significant amount of federal funding, for that new pound. The new pound will have 16 dog pens, 11 cat cages and a brand-new facility that includes a Friends of the Pound shelter, with up to 28 dog and cat pens, two stables and paddocks for farm animals. Id like to take this opportunity to acknowledge Friends of the Pound, an incredible animal rescue charity that works very closely with the community and the council to ensure these beautiful animals are cared for and rehomed. Thats a centre that we will be very pleased to see open.Another election commitment was $750,000 for a new social enterprise commercial laundry in Bangalow, which will be run by social enterprise organisation White Box Enterprises. This project will provide long-term unemployed locals with an opportunity to build their work experience in Bangalow. Another election commitment was $1.5 million for the Lennox Head village upgrade. Lennox is one of our many special, beautiful coastal villages. This upgrade, which is underway and looks amazing so far, really does complete the Lennox Head village project.I am very pleased to have been delivering on all my election commitments. Also, just after the election, I announced some vital funding for headspace: $2 million for an expansion of headspace Tweed Heads. And a few months ago I announced $3.4 million for a new headspace in Ballina, which is desperately needed in that area.Im also very honoured to be the Assistant Minister for Social Services and the Assistant Minister for the Prevention of Family Violence. In terms of womens safety, this government has had many achievements since we were elected. First of all, last year we delivered the National Plan to End Violence against Women and their Children. Its a shared vision of all Australian governments to end gender based violence within one generation. It provides the blueprint for the next 10 years to end family, domestic and sexual violence. In our budget in October we announced a $1.7 billion investment to make sure there were more women and childrens safety measures to support the plan. That delivered our election commitment of 500 frontline service and community workers. Its an important initiative to have those extra workers throughout the country.Last year we also announced Australias first Domestic, Family and Sexual Violence Commissioner. Micaela Cronin commenced that role in November and is one of only three national domestic violence commissioners worldwide. Micaela Cronin is doing an outstanding job in that role, and that role is central to the oversight of our national plan. Across so many areas, we are delivering so much and delivering on all of those election commitments.In the remaining time that I have, I would like to talk about the current state government of New South Wales, the Liberal and Nationals state government. The fact is that in New South Wales we need a new government. We have the tired, old Perrottet government thats run out of steam—scandal after scandal. We need to see them gone and we need to see a Minns Labor government elected on 25 March.Aside from all of the rorts, weve seen many plans theyve had that have been so detrimental to the people in my area on the North Coast. I did refer earlier to the Perrottet governments lack of planning when it comes to preparation for natural disasters such as flooding. In fact, they have no plans. When our community was hit by the floods, the state government were nowhere to be seen. Their response was inadequate. People will remember that—and theyll remember that when they go to vote in March.Weve seen another range of measures from the New South Wales Liberals and Nationals that have hurt our community. First and foremost, wages have been cut to public sector workers through the wages cap. This impacts so many frontline workers and means they are getting less in their wages. Its an issue people raise with me every day and its impacting so many people across the board. When it comes to frontline workers, weve also had a lack of police, nurses and teachers because the Perrottet government and governments before that have failed to invest. Theyve failed to invest in these services. Theyve failed to provide adequate wages and conditions. We have so many of them leaving northern New South Wales. Were on the border. They go to Queensland because they have better wages and conditions for so many of the frontline workers. So, again, we need to have a new government.We particularly need to have more police and policing resources. I say that as a former police officer. An issue that community members raise with me every day is that crime is out of control. I hear it every day. I see constantly in all of the community Facebook groups about the lack of resources. Our police do an incredible job, but they have a government in New South Wales that does not support them and does not provide enough resources for them. Police numbers are so incredibly low within our region, and thats added to it.Theyve gone down over the last 10 years. Only a few months ago, we found out that in our district—the Tweed-Byron police district—there are 181 sworn police. This compares to February 2012 when we had 198 officers. Thats how far its gone down. The New South Wales government tries to hide these figures all the time. The reason they try to hide them is that they keep going down. Our community are calling for more police resources, and theyre calling for a new government. Theyre calling for a Minns Labor government.These are some of the many issues that highlight why weve been failed by the Perrottet government—not to mention their great big new housing tax, which will impact the pensioners in my region. People are particularly terrified of that.Theres also the closure of the schools at Murwillumbah. This is an issue that I have previously raised in this House. In October 2020, without any consultation, without telling anybody, half of the National Party rolled up at Murwillumbah. This included the Tweed Nationals MP, Geoff Provest, and the then leader of the Nats and the education minister. They announced, without talking to anyone, that all four public schools in Murwillumbah were going to close and, instead, they were going to build a megaschool. That was it. They didnt talk to anybody and theyve refused to consult with people since then. Its completely insulting to the community.We have concerns about why theyre doing that. There are some big land grabs, we think, underway at Wollumbin High. They want to flog that one off for sure. Its part of their privatisation agenda we see right throughout the state, and we see it time and time again. This shameful act by the New South Wales Premier and the Tweed Nationals MP, Geoff Provest, must be stopped. The fact is that their government is unfit, unwilling and unable to govern New South Wales with cuts like this. Shutting those four schools not only hurts the children and the community; but jobs will be cut there. It is devastating for the whole community.People have an opportunity to stop this. New South Wales Labor will not allow these schools to be closed at all, and that is a very strong point thats been made by the state member for Lismore, Janelle Saffin. She is a fantastic Labor member—outstanding—and has talked a lot about the fact that these schools will all remain open under Labor. I urge people in Murwillumbah and right throughout the North Coast to make sure they change the government. Get rid of this old, tired Perrottet government and get a fresh new start with Chris Minns and all the incredible agendas he and his team have for improving health, education and frontline services and for ending privatisation.We particularly need to see, in our region, these schools saved. Who in their right mind shuts four schools and forces everyone into one campus? Were talking about very young children right through to high-school children. The level of trauma this has caused the community is absolutely massive. This has been going since October 2020, and they have refused to come and listen to people. That they behave in this way shows what they think of us and how insulting they are to regional and rural people. The question is: whose school will be next? Where else throughout the New South Wales North Coast will they be shutting schools? Tweed? Kingscliff? Pottsville? All the way down to Byron Bay or further and beyond? It shows how insulting they are.In fact, the only people that can really provide that assistance for regional and rural Australia are the Labor Party. Weve shown at a federal level how committed we are to the people of the regions. We know a Minns Labor government will be equally committed to the people of the regions. It is only Labor that will stand up for the people in regional and rural Australia.","Address-in-Reply","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs ELLIOT (Richmond—Assistant Minister for Social Services and Assistant Minister for the Prevention of Family Violence) ","(16:46):"
"0","0","0","1","1","Webster, Anne MP","281688","Mallee","NATS","N/A","105"," As I reflect on my first speech to parliament in 2019, I remain constantly reminded of the privilege to serve the people of Mallee and represent them in federal parliament. A lot has changed since my maiden speech, both in Mallee and more broadly in Australia—and, indeed, around the world. The COVID-19 pandemic changed us all and changed many aspects of our lives—how society operates and how politics is perceived and operates right around the globe. Thankfully, we have pushed through those challenges and are now on the other side, getting back to business.Some things, however, do not change. Mallee is a beautiful, diverse, productive and innovative region. It is a great privilege to represent the people of Mallee, from Talbot in the south, Cohuna in the east, Poolaijelo in the west and Mildura in the north. Mallee is over a third of the geographical area of Victoria—83½ thousand square kilometres. From the river country in the north to the mountains in the south and the planes in between, Mallees varied landscape means produce is incredibly diverse. Incredible productivity comes from prime agricultural and horticultural land. Producers grow stone fruit, grapes, vegetables, wheat, legumes, olives, almonds, dairy, sheep and beef, just to name a few.Mallee is about not only agriculture but other key industries such as minerals and clean energy systems which contribute to the economy. REMPLAN now estimates Mallees gross regional product at $9.92 billion, with an annual economic output of more than $14 billion. The people of Mallee are proud of their innovation, with groups such as the Birchip Cropping Group and Mallee Sustainable Farming pioneering farmer driven research to enhance the agricultural industry in our area and beyond.The people and communities of Mallee are particularly resilient, and thrive when faced with challenge. Travelling around the district, I am filled with pride at the many local enterprises in Mallee. Despite the odds, they are thriving. People are connected, towns are alive and services are operating. To bring a little bit of Mallee to my colleagues here in the House, I invited producers from across Mallee to showcase their fabulous produce in 2022. Magnificent Mallee was supposed to occur in 2020, but COVID prevented it taking place. Im thrilled to say that over 20 producers were at the showcase, and what a night it was for all concerned. It is an event I am incredibly proud of.Another example of resilience and innovation in Mallee is the extraordinary development and uptake of digital agriculture, for farmers to engage with and access global markets. Young people continue to return to the family farm precisely because farming has become high tech and they can reach global markets on their digital devices while sitting in their autosteered harvesters. When the coalition was in government, I worked hard to help Mallee farmers remain digitally connected. Community is built on communication. If you dont have it, the result is entrenched isolation, and nobody thrives in isolation. When we were in government, we delivered the Regional Connectivity Program and $1.3 billion to improve telecommunications, which included $480 million to upgrade NBN fixed-wireless and satellite networks as well as $811 million to expand regional mobile coverage and address black spots for 8,000 kilometres of roads and adjoining homes and businesses. To improve telecommunication, 1,200 mobile black spot base stations were funded by the coalition, and I will continue to advocate for more connectivity in Mallee.One of the most significant challenges we face every day in Australia, and certainly in Mallee, is a relatively small population spread over large distances. Roads, rail and bridges are essential for productivity and community life. Getting locals and tourists alike safely home and wherever they need to go is a priority. Our farmers and industry rightly demand efficient transport systems to access domestic and export markets. Millions of tonnes of product are transported by road and rail each year in Mallee, and both road and rail are in dire need of significant infrastructure expenditure, especially once the floods have dried up.When in government, we delivered more than $440 million for the Murray Basin Rail Project, $200 million of which I personally fought for and achieved. The completion of the project will connect primary producers in the north-west of Victoria with the ports of Portland, Geelong and Melbourne. The project is expected to improve the productivity and efficiency of freight networks and to improve road safety by moving freight from road to rail. Unfortunately the Victorian government, under Premier Daniel Andrews, has failed to uphold its end of the bargain and complete this project in a timely manner.More disappointingly, the current federal Labor government has taken $280 million out of our ROSI program in the Mallee. There are five highways that desperately need that infrastructure spend, and its been ripped out by this government. As someone who regularly travels on Mallee roads throughout my electorate, I know that an efficient regional rail system would bring many social, safety and productivity benefits for everyone. More trains mean fewer B-doubles and B-quads on the road.I have Australias mightiest river as my northern border and other rivers, such as the Avoca and the Loddon, in my electorate. Consequently, water is a priority issue. Droughts and floods have dire consequences, as weve seen recently in communities in Mallee. Water from the Murray River is the lifeblood of our regions, underpinning agriculture and primary industry sectors which support 220,000 jobs and inject billions into our national economy. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan is key to this and critical to the people of Mallee. We need to protect our farming communities by ensuring greater regulation, accountability and transparency. However, the greatest risk we face now is Labor committing to water buybacks. Buybacks are a disaster to regional communities. Making it worse, Labor are not transparent about any of it. Apparently the member for Sydney does not believe its necessary. This has Mallee farmers more than worried about the potential impacts on them if the cost of licensed water rises. We have always advocated for the people and that any water taken must not impact our communities, undeniably Australias food bowl. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan must be managed in a way that considers the continent, not parochial corners of it, as Edmund Barton would say.The cost of living, particularly energy prices, remains another pressing issue for Mallee—indeed, for all Australians. Power prices are going up and up, and the Labor government has no plan to mitigate the impact on mum-and-dad families.Labor has broken promises to cut power bills by $275, and the average Australian family will be $2,000 worse off in the current situation. The Labor government has committed to reckless renewable energy targets which will further drive up these prices. The Minister for Climate Change and Energy has acknowledged that, since the election last year, 22,000 solar panels will have to be installed every day and 40 wind turbines built every month until 2030. In addition, 28,000 kilometres of poles and wires need to be built to transfer power onto the grid and around the country. The great news is that the first eight kilometres have been approved for Snowy 2.0, so theres only 27,992 kilometres to go.I am committed to emissions reductions and lowering energy prices while ensuring sustainability and reliability. Consequently, I will always advocate for sensible, measured approaches. Under the previous coalition government, we had set a technology road map which meant that targets could legitimately be achieved while ensuring sustainable energy costs and delivery. Indeed, Mallee is perfectly positioned for renewables. In 2019, when I was elected, the capacity of existing grid infrastructure made some promising options unviable. I lobbied the former Minister for Energy, Angus Taylor, and welcomed the announcement of the VNI West interconnector via Kerang, which is in Mallee, to be delivered by 2027.KerangLink will deliver an extra 1,800 megawatts of capacity during peak demand periods, help lower prices and allow Victoria to export 1,930 megawatts to New South Wales. The project will help maintain system security and reliability while also allowing more renewable energy to be connected to the grid. The project will open the floodgates for private sector investment in what is known as the Murray River Renewable Energy Zone, an area mapped by the Australian Energy Market Operator that encompasses significant renewable resources. In Mallee, there are currently 11 wind farms and 44 solar farms, with another with 390,000 solar panels soon to be installed on the way.Working with businesses in Mallee has been a big part of my role in my first term—and now my second term—of parliament. Pre COVID, we had almost 20,000 small and medium-sized businesses in Mallee, many of which are family owned. Back then, they struggled to attract workforce, and the pandemic years created additional challenges, with many businesses just unable to survive. Attracting a workforce remains a significant issue, particularly in the horticulture industry. Without workers, you cannot harvest, food goes to waste and supply is affected. When supply is affected, prices go up. That is why I fought so hard for an agricultural visa to help growers in Mallee and beyond solve that issue.The Nationals in government delivered this, with Vietnam signing a memorandum of understanding with the federal government. The ag visa was to be demand driven and would allow skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled workers from participating countries to come to Australia. It offered a pathway to permanency. The Labor Party scrapped this visa, insulting growers across Australia, who were robbed of a solution to their issues. Thankfully, the memorandum of understanding with Vietnam will be upheld, but my inquiries lead me to understand that there are no Vietnamese workers in the country under the visa as yet. We need to do better. As long as I stand as a member of parliament, I will fight for better.I was recently honoured to be offered the shadow regional health portfolio, tackling an issue that is of utmost importance not only for the constituents of Mallee but for all who live in regional Australia. In my first speech, I addressed this issue: your health status should not depend on your postcode. But it absolutely does. We need responsive and sustainable healthcare delivery for the nine million people who call the regions their home. Isolation is a key contributor to poor health outcomes and risks. While isolation might be mitigated by telecommunications and the network of first responders, distance and the lack of workforce are key troubles for regional communities. We need more doctors, nurses, allied health workers and mental health workers. We have reached crisis point, and the current federal and state governments have offered only bandaid solutions. A survey I am running for the people of Mallee, which has been responded to by 2,000 people so far, shows that 30 per cent do not have a regular GP, and 40 per cent put off trying to get an appointment because its just too hard and it takes weeks. Many have to wait eight weeks. A third of respondents have had to turn to the hospital ED because they cannot get an appointment with a GP. This is untenable and results in poorer mortality and morbidity rates in regional areas.A longer-term solution is training local students in health in our regional centres, such as Mildura, Horsham and Swan Hill. I fought for and achieved an election promise to fund a biomedical wet lab at La Trobe University in partnership with Monash and Melbourne universities in Mildura to help build the workforce into the future. In opposition, I have approached the Minister for Health and Aged Care and the Minister for Education to support this vital project. I have invited both ministers to come to Mildura and meet the local universities and the hospitals to further this important scheme. This is a local solution and needs support. This investment in modern, high-tech facilities would mean that La Trobe will be even better placed to ease some of the pressure we currently face in the regional health workforce.I will continue to fight for Mallees healthcare system at all levels. A great source of pride was when I was able to deliver funding for the multimillion-dollar radiation therapy bunker in Mildura, with Mildura Health Private Hospital. This centre, which will open in the next few weeks, will mean people will not have to travel to Adelaide, Bendigo or Melbourne for radiotherapy and cancer treatment. I know the added burden that travel and isolation from families mean when you are sick. In my maiden speech, I was privileged to have my father in the House. He was suffering from terrible cancer at that time and had to travel for radiation therapy to Melbourne. We lost him not many months later. Cancer is an awful disease and everything must be done in research and services to make this journey easier for those who suffer, but even more so for families in regional communities. The inequity is unacceptable. I am pleased that patients will shortly be able to receive life-saving treatment in Mildura, closer to their families and near their homes.I remain passionate about injustice and understand the need for holistic approaches to the barriers faced by regional and rural communities. Before I came to parliament, with a small team I founded a not-for-profit organisation, Zoe Support, a holistic, wraparound and place based support to meet the needs of teen mothers and assist them to re-engage in education and employment. Zoes Support continues to have extraordinary outcomes, impacting two generations and sometimes even three. Homelessness, mental health issues, drug and alcohol use and family violence have been significantly reduced through this essential service. Many young mothers are now educated and employed, and their children regularly attend school. Many are in their own private housing, not public housing, and are managing their affairs.Over the years, I studied vulnerability in my PhD. I saw it in the mums at Zoe, and it provided great insight into our service model. I understand that the vulnerable are all around us and, in fact, are us: young mothers, Indigenous Australians, refugees, farmers in drought or flood, the unemployed, the aged, the chronically ill, those who live with a disability and returned soldiers, among others. The structural factors of vulnerability are irreversibility, dependency and unpredictability. While these factors are present every day in all of our lives to some extent or another, for the vulnerable they can be overwhelming and paralysing. I will continue to fight for the vulnerable and for my regional and rural communities in Mallee.In closing, I said when I took office that I was deeply humbled to be given the opportunity to represent the people of Mallee. Now in my fourth year in office, I remain deeply humbled and grateful for the opportunity. I look forward to continuing to fight for Mallee and to contributing to the prosperity and wellbeing of all Australians.","Address-in-Reply","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr WEBSTER (Mallee) ","(17:06):"
"0","0","0","1","1","McBain, Kristy MP","281988","Eden-Monaro","ALP","N/A","107"," Im thrilled to rise today as the Minister for Regional Development, Local Government and Territories and, more importantly, as the member for Eden-Monaro. Ive been given a portfolio that I am incredibly passionate about, having grown up in regional Victoria and then moved to regional New South Wales, where I am also raising my own kids in a beautiful part of the world, the Bega Valley, a stunning spot for anyone who wants to come and visit.I know how important it is that regional communities arent left behind. I want to see our regional areas continue to thrive so that our kids have the same opportunities as their counterparts who live in the cities. As a former mayor of the Bega Valley Shire, I am also all too aware of the challenges facing our local government sector, and I look forward to working closely with my local government counterparts on the issues impacting them, financial sustainability chief among them.Over the last eight months I have dived headfirst into my role as Minister for Regional Development, Local Government and Territories and I have learnt a lot so far; however, there is always more to know and there are always more communities to understand. I have been fortunate enough to travel to a number of rural and regional areas across Australia already, and I am looking forward to exploring more of our vast regions and meeting those people who make our regions so amazing. I have been to Norfolk Island on a couple of different occasions, and I will soon be travelling to Jervis Bay, the Northern Territory and the Indian Ocean Territories. As part of my ministerial role, I have really enjoyed the opportunity to speak with over 170 local councils to hear what is important to them and to give them an opportunity to raise their concerns. I intend to continue doing this, and I am looking forward to as many meetings with councils as possible during my time as minister.The Albanese government went to the election with an ambitious legislative agenda, and, since that election, the Albanese government has delivered. It has delivered cheaper medicine, which took effect on 1 January, and many people across Eden-Monaro—particularly those on medication, but also a number of our local pharmacists—have highlighted what a major reform this is. Cheaper child care will benefit 1.2 million families from 1 July, and there are many of those in Eden-Monaro. There are 180,000 fee-free TAFE places to help ease the skills shortages and help more Australians train for better jobs—a job that those opposite vacated in their time. Work has now begun on important renewable energy projects that will create jobs, boost communities and make sure Australia has a secure, reliable energy supply. Australians will soon have the opportunity to vote for a constitutionally enshrined Voice to Parliament for First Australians, a gracious invitation that has been extended. We have the opportunity to honour the oldest continuing culture in a meaningful way.Whilst my ministerial portfolio will keep me busy, serving Eden-Monaro remains my highest priority. We have had an incredibly tough couple of years, and our communities deserve a strong local voice in Canberra. I will continue to be just that. I will always advocate for the needs of Eden-Monaro to ensure that we get the best for our region. With an electorate that spans 42,000 square kilometres, I know that there is a lot to deliver for our communities. While I know there is more to do, I was pleased that the Albanese Labor government had committed to delivering much more than the last government did for our region.We have committed to delivering better health services across the electorate, with $1.1 million going to the respite care centre in Queanbeyan, a much-needed facility championed by the recently passed Yvonne Cuscheri after her experience of having a child with a terminal illness who, unfortunately, passed away in an aged-care facility, without a dedicated respite facility for people of his own age. Theres also $5 million for the veterans wellbeing centre in Queanbeyan. We know that there is a huge cohort of current and former defence personnel in our region, and we need to make sure they have access to the services they need, which is why this announcement was so fantastic and much needed. Theres $4.7 million for the return of maternity services to Yass District Hospital. With one of the biggest country regions booming, it is high time that we delivered those services back to that local hospital.Theres $2 million for the Googong sports and social club, upgrades to Freebody Oval and George Brown Memorial Oval, and fire trail maintenance in the Snowy valleys. Theres $750,000 for an all-abilities playground in Murrumbateman. These are all things that are needed to make our communities liveable. There are infrastructure and furniture improvements for preschools and schools across Eden-Monaro. Theres $10,000 for the Cooma Lambie Street Preschool, the Cooma North Preschool and the Captains Flat Community Preschool. Theres $20,000 for Eden Public Schools landscaping, $80,000 for the Yass High School basketball court, $20,000 for the Brungle Public School playground and $20,000 for Khancoban Public School for desks and chairs. These are all much-needed upgrades going to some of the 120-odd schools across Eden-Monaro.Improving phone connectivity and getting rid of black spots is a huge priority for us, especially after the number of natural disasters our communities have endured, which is why we have committed a million dollars each for the Snowy Mountains, Monaro and Kings highways, and $3.5 million for patchy areas along the Princes Highway between Ulladulla and Eden. We know the royal commission into the Black Summer bushfires showed that people were expecting to get information while travelling on these main thoroughfares as they were leaving emergency areas. More needs to be done, and our government will deliver it.Carwoola, Mystery Bay, Dalmeny and Talbingo will receive $500,000 each to deal with mobile black spots. These communities have been campaigning for these much-needed upgrades for years now. Were also delivering critical safety upgrades for roads across Eden-Monaro. Theres $17.4 million for the Brindabella Road and $65 million for the creation of Dunns Creek Road. In addition to this funding—key upgrades and improvements that are very much needed—and after listening to local feedback, the government has increased the funding for Brindabella Road by $20 million, bringing our investment to $37.4 million, which will provide much-needed safety upgrades and will improve tourism opportunities in the Tumut region.Im incredibly proud to be the member for Eden-Monaro. It is a privilege that I will never take for granted. Every single time I stand up in this parliament, I always have the Eden-Monaro community front of mind. That being said, I will use the rest of my time to shine a light on some of the incredible things that have been happening across my electorate.Snowboarding has really taken off in Eden-Monaro, which is home to the Snowy Mountains, as it should be. A huge congratulations to Jindabynes Josie Baff, who got her first ever snowboard World Cup podium finish in snowboard cross—and it was gold—and to Dalmeny local Valentino Guseli for a huge effort to win the crystal globe at the 2022-23 FIS Snowboard World Cup in Australia. Incredible work, Josie and Valentino. Thank you for everything youre doing for Eden-Monaro and for making Australia proud.At this years Australia Day ceremony in Queanbeyan, it was fantastic to recognise the brilliant season of the Queanbeyan Whites Rugby Union Club, the Queanbeyan Tigers AFL Club and the Monaro Panthers Football Club, which were all recognised for their premiership-winning seasons in 2022. And if the Queanbeyan Blues had managed to score a few more, four of the Queanbeyan football codes would have taken a premiership cup. Its Queanbeyans sports excellence at its finest, and Im confident to say that there will be even more stellar results in the 2023 season.I also want to give a shout-out to our very own futsal superstar, Christian Marchetti, from Jerrabomberra. Christian has been selected in the Australian futsal team and will compete in the national futsal championships in Barcelona later this year. All the best to Christian. Im sure all your hard work and training will pay off, and I look forward to catching up with you on your return. Whilst Im talking about futsal champions—they abound in our region—I want to say congratulations to Eloise Morrison, Evelyn Knight, Beatrice Morrison and Addison Brummell for representing the ACT and surrounds at the Australian futsal championships a few weeks ago.One of my favourite things to do is to hit the road and visit the wonderful communities that make up Eden-Monaro. Recently, Ive held mobile offices in Talbingo, Wyndham, Cooma, Narooma, Yass, Adelong, Bungendore, Cobargo and Queanbeyan. During these catch-ups, Ive had the opportunity to hear from communities about the important issues that matter to them, from improving communications connectivity in our regional and remote areas to hearing firsthand experiences of flood-ravaged communities. Im looking forward to catching up with the Rosewood and Batlow communities in coming weeks, and if youre in the Queanbeyan area, my annual office open day is happening on 13 March. Id love to see you.Eden-Monaro is home to so many fantastic festivals and events, and we celebrate what the arts do for our community, which is bring people together and give people a reason to travel to our beautiful part of the world. Last year I had the privilege of attending the melanoma awareness day festival—something thats very close to my heart—and I want to give a shout-out to all those involved. That day was put together after we lost a beautiful community member, Tracey Beasley. Our local community will continue to hold the melanoma awareness day festival, and I look forward to attending again later this year. We also had the inaugural Wanderer Festival at Pambula Beach and the Thaw Festival in Merimbula the following weekend. It was great to see the Numeralla Folk Festival back a few weekends ago after the disruptions of the past few years.These events not only are a fantastic opportunity for our communities to come together and a fantastic opportunity for visitors to come; but they do really show what our communities have to offer, and I am incredibly proud that all of these festivals are mainly run by volunteers. Weve seen music performances, artisan workshops, comedy and the Oktoberfest, and I want to thank the organisers of all of these events for their ambitious contributions to our region. I look forward to seeing these and other local events reach new heights in 2023 as our landmark National Cultural Policy starts delivering benefits for Eden-Monaro.Attending citizenship ceremonies remains one of the highlights of my role as a local member, as it did when I was a local mayor. Im not surprised Eden-Monaro continues to attract new citizens who have chosen to make our beautiful part of Australia their home. Ive been really honoured to attend citizenship ceremonies in Queanbeyan, Cooma and Bega, and I thank the local councils for putting on such memorable ceremonies to welcome our new citizens. Since July last year weve had the pleasure of welcoming over 250 people from around the world. My part of the world certainly is a vibrant, multicultural electorate, and I look forward to the positive impact our newest citizens will have on our communities.Interest in and understanding of civics and citizenship are values that are fostered from a young age in our schools, which is why Im always proud to engage with students from across Eden-Monaro. In the last few months alone weve had the privilege of welcoming 15 schools to Parliament House from across the electorate. Whether its a large school, like Bega High School, or a smaller regional school, like St Josephs in Adelong, the experience of walking these halls, the halls of our nations democracy, is something that most students wont forget. Now more than ever, a respectful dialogue that positions First Nations people as central to our future is paramount, and thats why it was a real honour to meet Lumen Christi Catholic College with the Hon. Linda Burney MP for the unveiling of an amazing piece of First Nations art done by the school students. Thank you to those students for including us in that experience.Ive been fortunate enough to get out to visit the students of Eden-Monaro in their own schools. A highlight for me, and I hope for the students too, was being involved in Stephanie Alexanders kitchen garden initiative with the Cobargo Primary School. Welcoming Stephanie Alexander to a small community after what had been a pretty terrible experience during the 2019-2020 bushfires was amazing. Seeing how well those kids took to that program, seeing her interaction with the kids in the kitchen and then eating that food was amazing, and I want to thank her for the work that she does with schools across this country. That program is amazing, and Id ask schools to have a look at whether they could incorporate the kitchen garden initiative into their own schools if they have a chance.I was even able to revisit my days working as a lawyer, when the year 11 legal studies students of Bega High kindly invited me into their classroom for a chat about what being a lawyer is all about and what a fulfilling career it can be. Im looking forward to getting out to even more schools in 2023 and Im excited to bring Parliament House to your classroom.Last year we saw the passing of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, which coincided with her Platinum Jubilee. In my speech commemorating Queen Elizabeth in this place I recounted the many times that she had visited the seat of Eden-Monaro and the many memories of the Queen and her long service to our country held by constituents.To celebrate her Platinum Jubilee, the federal government initiated the Planting Trees for the Queens Jubilee Program. It saw community groups and organisations honour the Queen and her legacy of service and achievements by commemorative tree plantings. Projects took place across Australia, and in my own electorate of Eden-Monaro tree planting projects took place in Queanbeyan, Bookham, Cooma, Bredbo and Bega. Ive had the honour of attending the official planting of trees at many of these events. Planting trees to mark the Queens 70 years of service will leave a lasting reminder of the Queens service for future generations to enjoy. I extend a heartfelt thank you to all of our community service organisations and volunteers.I was so proud to learn of Amar Singhs Australia Day Local Hero Award for 2023. Amar is the founder of Turbans 4 Australia. In response to the Black Summer bushfires, during the COVID-19 lockdowns and at any time of need, Turbans 4 Australia have made meals, put together food hampers and delivered truckloads of water, groceries, toiletries, toys and tools to those in need. Im so proud of the work they have done in Eden-Monaro, and I want to say thank you for taking the time to take our communities into your heart and helping them. Its an award well deserved, Amar.Id also like to pay tribute to the many individuals and organisations who work tirelessly to improve our community. A small honour roll might include Orange Sky, who provides washing services in Queanbeyan every Wednesday and Sunday; sleepbus, in Queanbeyan, who this week will celebrate providing 1,000 safe sleeps to our community; Yass Valley SPIN, who, through volunteering at event after event, raised money for local people suffering illness; Montys Place, in Narooma, who give free meals to the community; Vinnies, Anglicare and Salvos in Queanbeyan—the list could seriously go on and on. These organisations and volunteers do so much across our community. In Eden-Monaro, more than a quarter of our population volunteer in some capacity, whether thats for a service club, for a sporting organisation or for the local P&C. I want to say a big thank you to you. Our small communities, our country communities, dont run unless we have amazing volunteers like yourselves doing fantastic work. I want you to know that thank you is never enough, but here in this place I want to say thank you for the work that volunteers do across Eden-Monaro.Just last week we had the Terry Campese Foundation providing cash vouchers to families to help with back-to-school supplies for local kids. Its an amazing foundation set up to provide youth mentoring services from a lifelong local who wanted to contribute back to youth in his community after his first grade rugby league career was finalised. People like Terry Campese provide not only a role model but a voice for many young people across our region. I wish him all the best in the upcoming New South Wales state election. Youve been a champion on the football field, and I know that youll be a champion for the people of Monaro.The generosity of community spirit in Eden-Monaro is alive and well, and it never ceases to amaze me how people go out of their way to support those around them. Im incredibly proud to represent the people of Eden-Monaro, and I hope that I am given the honour of continuing to represent them for many years to come.","Address-in-Reply","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms McBAIN (Eden-Monaro—Minister for Regional Development, Local Government and Territories) ","(17:24):"
"0","0","0","1","1","Wallace, Andrew MP","265967","Fisher","LNP","N/A","110"," As students right across Fisher embark on a new school year, I want to wish them and their families all the very best for the coming year. Its been a challenging year for them; its been a challenging few years for us all. Its my hope that, in 2023, students will look ahead and aspire to greater things.I want to pay tribute to the teachers and support staff who do such outstanding work creating vibrant learning spaces for our kids. My wife, Leoni, was a teacher, so Ive seen the price that teachers pay to prepare our kids to reach their potential. On behalf of a grateful community, I want to thank teachers across the country, but particularly in Fisher, for the great work that they do and for their dedication.I think 2023 needs to be a year when we focus on young people, and thats what I want to do in Fisher. Im the father of four incredibly strong, and strong-willed, daughters. Each of them has a unique journey, a unique skill set and a unique destiny ahead of them, and Im exceptionally proud of them. Theyre at the forefront of my mind when I stand, when I speak and as I serve in this House. Young people like them should be at the core of our decision-making in this place. After all, were doing more than just leaving individual, personal legacies here. With each bill that becomes law were building the future for a generation of young Australians, and we should never forget that in this place. With each decision we make, we are either helping or hindering young Australians in their pursuit of the great Australian dream. Once upon a time the great Australian dream was confined to the concept of owning your own home, but its much broader than that now. Yes, the dream is to own ones home, but its also to raise a family in safe and vibrant communities, and to provide the best education for your kids to study, to work, and to start and grow their own businesses.The coalition delivered a plan to help young people—young Australians—to realise the great Australian dream. In government, the coalition took this view, and we delivered a plan to make the Australian dream a reality. We delivered HomeBuilder so that young Australians like Erin in Nirimba could build their own homes. We introduced the First Home Super Saver Scheme, the regional home guarantee and the family home guarantee to ensure that young people, regional families and single parents would have the same opportunities to own their homes as anyone else does. We introduced JobTrainer and the Job-ready Graduates package to make further education and training more affordable and to skill up our young people for a dynamic digital economy.Labors attempts to rewrite history remind me a bit of that scene in Monty Pythons Life of Brian where Reg and the gang are complaining about the Romans and Reg says, Alright, but apart from the sanitation, the medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, a freshwater system and public health, what have the Romans ever done for us? Apart from the record funding on education, mental health, primary health and prevention, red tape reduction, defence industry, science and innovation, what did the coalition ever do for this country? We delivered a plan to back young Australians, their families and their businesses, to keep them safe, to improve their health and wellbeing and to facilitate their potential.The coalition believes in stoking Australians pioneer spirit and supporting those who have a go. Once upon a time, that was a bipartisan ambition. Its true that Labor cannot manage the economy and cannot even keep a promise. Eight months in and we see that things are very, very different. Inflation is at its highest point in 33 years, the highest in a third of a century. From Hawke and Keating to Rudd and Albanese, the old stereotype rings ever true: Labor cannot manage the economy. But it goes deeper than that. Labor now cannot keep a promise. They promised to address the cost of living, yet they have dismally failed.Every day I hear story after story about young Australians who are anxious about their future, such as 24-year-old single mum Georgia from Mooloolaba, who is worried about whether she can afford to continue her full-time carer responsibilities, with the cost of fuel and food continually going up. Thirty-year-old entrepreneur Jade from Nirimba, who launched her business last year, is already deciding whether or not she can afford to continue. And 18-year-old UniSC student Sarah couch surfs two nights a week because she cannot afford to drive to and from her classes every day.These are young Australians with aspirations to break generational inequities, to make a difference and to build a brighter future. Many of them lent Labor their vote at the last election, and Labor is squandering their goodwill. They voted for Labor, who led a fierce marketing campaign about opportunity and equality, and what we have is the worst cost-of-living crisis in three decades. What we have is a greater divide between regional Australia and urban elites than ever before.Labor promise the world, and then they give you an atlas—or, in this case, pretend they never made the promise at all. They promised to cut power bills. Ninety-seven times they promised to cut them by $275. We have repeated this fact ad nauseam and will continue to do so. Labor dont even acknowledge it. Meanwhile, they are presiding over the most expensive average wholesale electricity price on record. By the governments own admission, electricity prices are set to rise by more than 63 per cent, and gas prices by 40 per cent, over the next two years. I think about this impact and the impact it will have on my local IGA, my butcher and my local fish-and-chip shop. Theyll be forced to reduce service, increase prices, lay off staff or, in the worst case, close up shop. Were seeing it across the country already. I think about how this will affect my daughters and young people like them across the country.There are students who wont be able to put fuel in the car, who will reconsider visiting a GP or who can no longer afford to go to the gym. There are young families who will not be able to afford to pay for their kids swimming lessons or soccer boots. There are young homeowners who will struggle to eat and pay their bills in the same week, young homeowners who will have no-one to bail them out of financial hardship and will be forced into selling or perhaps bankruptcy. There are young entrepreneurs who might throw their hands in the air and be forced back into another job, giving up on their ambition to realise that great Australian dream of running their own business.This opposition—we on this bench—will keep the torch to the governments feet on power bills, because that is what Australians expect us to do. We on this side of the House will keep the government to its promises, to its election commitments, because that is what Australians expect us to do and its what Australians expect this government to do—that is, to live up to their promises.Labor promised to bring down fuel costs. Instead, they removed the excise freeze and have increased red tape for the small businesses and franchises that make up a large number of servos across my electorate. At the same time, the government are funding climate warrior training programs and thrusting brand-new emissions taxes on primary producers and mining companies, increasing the cost of supply even more. How does that help everyday Australians? Ask the mum or dad who has to drive their kids to soccer on a Saturday morning whether their fuel prices are down under Labor. Ask the young hospitality worker who, after a long shift at work, is forced to pay more for their Uber, thanks to Labors inaction on fuel prices. Ask the truckie whos lost his job because the companys hit hard times and the farmer who cant get his produce off the property because there arent enough drivers. How are these things fair to Australians?The Labor government promised to cut the cost of health care—after nearly a decade of record investment, reform and growth in health care, thanks to the coalition. Labor inherited a health system that was the envy of the world. Now Australians are paying for their false promises and intervention. The government have cut 70 telehealth services, further increasing the healthcare gap between regional Australia and the inner city. They promised urgent care clinics across the country. Not a shovel has hit the ground. They promised 50 of these urgent care clinics—and just a couple of weeks ago the Prime Minister stood up and made this big announcement about expressions of interest for three out of the 50. They promised that 50 would be up and running within their first 12 months of government. What we will see is none in the first 12 months.Meanwhile, ambulance ramping in my state of Queensland is at an all-time high. Police have stepped up and stepped in to fill the ambulance gap, bringing people to hospital, only to be ramped as well. Weve got not only a ramping of ambulances in Queensland hospitals but also a ramping of police officers. At a time where in Queensland there is such an incredible law-and-order crisis, the Queensland state government is, in effect, benching Queensland police officers to do the work that ambulances should be doing.Thats what a Labor government looks like, whether it be at state or at a federal level. Despite the federal coalitions record investment into Queensland hospitals, the Palaszczuk Labor government and the Albanese Labor government are squandering the goodwill of Queenslanders in exchange for red carpets and tennis matches. It is costing young Aussies their start-ups, their jobs, their houses and, sadly, in the worst-case scenario, their lives. Food, fuel, GP charges, power bills, mortgage repayments, business costs—while young Australians, their families and their businesses struggle to make ends meet, this Labor government are busy playing politics at the whim and the wallet of their union paymasters.I wish I wasnt standing here saying all of this. When we were in government, I used to sit here as a member of the government and listen to those opposite whine and whinge and complain incessantly, but things are only getting worse under this government. The Reserve Bank estimates that 800,000 Australian mortgages will be moving off fixed mortgage rates this year. Before tomorrows RBA decision is made—and the RBA will make its own decision—the annual repayments on a $758,000 mortgage will have climbed by almost $16,000. Thats $16,000 extra a year that mum-and-dad Australians are having to find to pay for that mortgage. Thats $307.70 a week. All of these things are adding to this cost-of-living crisis for single mums and dads, young families and young aspirational Aussies who have bought their own home and want to be a part of that great Australian dream. These are real people—real young people, real families, real veterans and real retirees. This coalition, when in government, delivered real outcomes for them, and they are all worse off under this Albanese Labor government.They promised to tackle mental health and wellbeing. Their failure to address the cost of living and their failure to deliver a plan for young Australians extends to Australians mental health too. While young Australians continue to grapple with the mental health consequences of the global pandemic, natural disasters and growing financial pressures, Labor has slashed Medicare funding for psychologist visits. This was a measure we introduced in government, along with our landmark $3 billion National Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Plan. When we were in government, we funded a national PTSD centre in my electorate in Bokarina. We funded a headspace in Caloundra. We have provided life-saving funding for people who live with eating disorders. We were able to deliver on a plan to boost mental health services and outcomes for young people and our most vulnerable throughout this country.Yet, instead of a plan, instead of their promised wellbeing budget, Labor offers cuts, cuts and more cuts. If the LNP cut Medicare funding for psychologist visits like this Labor government did, the people who reside up in the gallery would be up in arms. They would be screaming on every media outlet about how heartless the coalition is. And what do we hear? Crickets. Labors betrayal of young people and the most vulnerable in our community goes largely unreported.Labor turned their backs on first responders until we embarrassed them into reversing their funding cuts to Fortem Australia. They turned their backs on veterans on the Sunshine Coast when we didnt get a veteran wellbeing centre, requiring veterans to drive for hours for specialist care. Two veterans are with me in the chamber right now. When it comes to the mental health of young people and everyday Australians, this Labor government is simply out of touch. The health minister in question time this afternoon talked about the report on the Better Access initiative, trying to justify the Labor governments decision to halve psychologist visits. What he didnt talk about was recommendation 12 in that report, which recommended that the 20 visits remain. Funny, that—he just left that little bit of detail out.While regional Australia struggles with a health and mental health crisis, Labor are cutting, slashing and trashing healthcare mobility. While this country contends with a cost-of-living crisis, this Labor federal government is turning a blind eye. Theyd rather redesign the $5 note than put money back into taxpayers pockets. While families struggle to pay their power bills or put food on the table, Labor are throwing taxpayers money at consultants, climate warriors and communication exercises. Instead of making it easier for businesses to start, employ and grow, Labor are wreaking havoc on our IR laws to appease their union paymasters. This will cost young Australians their jobs and rob them of hope for a better future.Labor promised the world to young, aspirational Australians, and they have given them an atlas. Homeownership, health care and manageable household budgets should not be luxuries to young Australians, yet, after nine years of good government, the Australian dream is slipping from their grasp. This Labor government has no plan for young Australians. They dont have a plan to back small and family business. They dont have a plan to tackle the cost of living. They dont have a plan to protect and propel Australia forward. Eight months in, we have a government frantic, fumbling and failing to listen to those who elected them to this place.I say to the young people of Fisher and to young Australians the country over: the coalition are listening to your voices. We are your voice in opposition, and we strive to be your champions in this place. I encourage you to speak up, reach out and make your voices heard. We are building your future in this place, and it is essential that we play our part to work with you, together, in building a better future for you.","Address-in-Reply","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr WALLACE (Fisher) ","(17:43):"
"0","0","0","1","1","Claydon, Sharon MP","248181","Newcastle","ALP","N/A","113"," It is with great optimism that I stand in this chamber to begin the parliamentary new year with a reflection on the address-in-reply to the Governor-Generals speech to this parliament—many months ago now, it is fair to say.Id like to offer my congratulations to all members who have been elected in this place and, indeed, the other place. Of course, I celebrate a Labor government victory. Im very heartened to see the incredible work that Labor has done already. After a wasted decade, we are not wasting a single day. It was Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating who remarked that, when you change the government, you change the country. How right he was. From the moment the Labor government were sworn in, weve been working to clear away the mess and chaos of the previous government. We have hit the ground running. We are restoring security to the national energy grid. Were delivering support to flood affected communities. Were implementing the strongest ever biosecurity measures to protect our agriculture sector from foot-and-mouth disease. Were establishing the Defence Strategic Review to make sure that our Defence Force has the capability to meet our changing national security environment. Were backing a pay rise for workers on a minimum wage. Were lifting our climate change ambition and rebuilding Australias reputation in the region and in our international relations.Weve also moved to change the way that government functions, making parliament a better place to work for everyone. I had a look at my previous address-in-reply speeches ahead of writing this speech, and, in 2016, I spoke about the serious lack of diversity in the 45th Parliament. Out of 150 members, only 43 were women. In the other place, there were 30 women senators out of a total of 76 senators. That, thankfully, is not the same as what I see here today. I am so heartened that in the 47th Parliament, there are now 58 women—almost 40 per cent in the House of Representatives. In the other place, there are 43 women, which is now 56.6 per cent of the Senate make-up. Our work is not done, and there are parties who still have significant discrepancies in their representation, but it is nonetheless a heartening difference, and I applaud the women who have put their hands up to run for parliament. Like my colleague the member for Dobell who sits at the dispatch box, I am extremely proud to stand in a government party room where we are now the majority. Fifty-two per cent of our party room are women—exceptional women, I might add.Many of us have come back to this place after an election campaign. This is now my fourth term in the Australian parliament, and I am deeply indebted to the people of Newcastle for returning me to this place and placing in me their trust to be their voice in this place. A majority of Novocastrians clearly understood Labors plans for Newcastle, and they voted for it. They saw the vision that Labor had especially for carbon-intensive regions and economies, like the one from my hometown of Newcastle and the Hunter region. They understood Labors plans to use our energy smarts to diversify our economic base and make Newcastle a new energy superpower; rather than burying our heads in the sand on the new energy, like the coalition did previously.My electorate of Newcastle knows better than most the importance not only of reaching net zero by 2050 but also of diversifying and strengthening our economy with renewable energies. The Labor governments Powering Australia plan will deliver on our commitment to ensure that five out of six new jobs will be in regions like ours. Those are regions that, of course, have always been at the heart of energy production and distribution in this nation. The Newcastle and Hunter region has powered Australia for generations, and, under Labor, we will continue to power Australia into the future.The people of Newcastle are over the moon to see the back of the climate wars. They know that its time that we take action and transition our economy, rather than leaving behind thousands of people directly and indirectly employed by fossil fuel industries. That is not the Labor way, and the people of our region have entrusted the Labor government with that transition process. The Business Council of Australia, the Australian Industry Group, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Greenpeace, the Australian Conservation Foundation, the National Farmers Federation and the Clean Energy Council have all said they support our legislation, and they have called for parliament to pass that legislation. I was delighted to see this place and, indeed, the other place commit to those new, more ambitious targets in law when the legislation passed in the House.Novocastrian people, businesses and industry groups that I meet with are regularly telling me how excited they are about the opportunities before Newcastle and the Hunter now. Newcastle and the Hunter is rapidly becoming a centre for green hydrogen. There are quite a few projects on the horizon. The Albanese Labor government is partnering with the University of Newcastle to invest $16 million to build a new facility to test and invent solutions to a range of global challenges when it comes to the use of hydrogen and many of these new energy industries and technologies. The skills, techniques and technologies developed by this project at the University of Newcastle will enable local industry, including hydrogen investments at the Port of Newcastle, to reach their full potential.Theres been a lot of thinking as to what will be required, what industry is going to need in a skilled workforce and also about places to test, accredit and ensure safety in the use of these new energy technologies. There are also two green hydrogen projects that federal Labor committed to help fund, with $41 million going to each of those two projects. One is with Orica and Origin and another one is based with the Port of Newcastle.There are huge opportunities for the production and export of green hydrogen. It makes sense for the Port of Newcastle to play a substantial role in Australias bid to become a significant exporter of renewable energy, especially green hydrogen. With its existing access to global energy supply chains, world-class infrastructure, strong industry partnerships, proximity to existing demand, links to domestic rail and road networks, a local, highly skilled workforce and proximity to renewable energy zones, the Port of Newcastle is well placed to develop a hydrogen hub and to export hydrogen as a tradable energy commodity. I look forward to Labor supporting the port in its significant work to ensure the future of the port and all who work there and rely on it.The diversification of the worlds biggest coal port is important to both the people of Newcastle and our entire region. There is an exciting opportunity for the port to diversify further by building a multipurpose container terminal. A deepwater container terminal is a critically important project for the economic future of Newcastle and the Hunter, and its one that I strongly support, as do my Labor colleagues in the region.Labor knows that good infrastructure serves communities. It creates secure, well-paid local jobs and connects our region with the national economy. Labor know it because we have built it. Labor also knows the value and importance of efficient public transport and of increased use of public transport to reduce emissions. However, when taking the train to Sydney adds over an hour to your travel had you done it by car, its often hard to justify. Thats why Labor will invest $500 million to begin work on high-speed rail, with the corridor between Newcastle and Sydney as the first priority. We will start with the fast rail corridor, but we will plan and build on that existing fast rail work to move to high-speed rail. Faster rail will see travel times between Newcastle and Sydney cut to around two hours. Once high-speed rail is up and running, this journey will take only 45 minutes.I know the people of Newcastle have long waited for this project. Indeed, they would be amongst the first to say, Weve heard many governments talk about high-speed rail in the past but fail to deliver. I want to assure people that it was the current Prime Minister of Australia who put forward the proposition for high-speed rail in Australia, when he was the minister for infrastructure, so I assure the people of Newcastle that you have a Prime Minister and a government that are absolutely dedicated to ensuring that this high-speed rail project proceeds. That will make our region in Newcastle a more connected place. It will be giving businesses opportunities for much closer collaboration. It will bring economic benefits to local industries like tourism and hospitality. High-speed rail is a game changer for workers commuting to Sydney and further afield.Families in Newcastle are also telling me just how hard and more expensive it has become to see a GP than it was last time Labor was in government. Families in Newcastle have been hit with the triple whammy of the area losing its classification as an area of doctor shortage; having the bulk-billing incentive cut; and, when the now opposition were in power, the outrageous attack on the GP Access After Hours service. Labor built Medicare, and the people of Newcastle have entrusted us to again fix this mess. Ten years of undermining universal healthcare systems in this country has come home to roost. It is extremely difficult for people. The primary healthcare system has gone to great lengths to demonstrate just how stretched, how underfunded and how under-resourced it feels. Thats what 10 years of active undermining of universal health care has done to this country.Already Labor has acted on the GP shortage crisis in the Hunter by making it a distribution priority area, a DPA; and providing the whole region with access to the Bonded Medical Program and overseas trained doctors, which has been reinstated. Labor will reverse the $500,000 worth of Liberal cuts to our GP Access After Hours service and restore the service to full capacity. The Department of Health and Aged Care is in discussions with the Hunter, New England and Central Coast Primary Health Network and GP Access After Hours about the implementation of that election commitment. I know that my constituents are greatly looking forward to these services being reinstated in full. We know we had the best service in the country for after-hours GP care, and we want to see that service restored, to be fully reinstated, so that we can continue to deliver best practice, high-quality services to the people of Newcastle.Labor is also investing $1 million over four years to revitalise the Kaden Centre cancer exercise oncology clinic to ensure that they can keep their doors open. The Kaden Centre delivers custom targeted exercise programs prescribed by allied health professionals to drastically improve the long-term health outcomes for people living with cancer. This is an essential service for people living with cancer and chronic illness. The Kaden Centre has developed a groundbreaking model of care delivery for patients undertaking chemotherapy, involving a personalised exercise program to optimise a patients fitness prior to the definitive cancer treatment. The program has seen a 50 per cent reduction in major complications, shorter lengths of hospital stays, reduced re-admissions and more patients returning to complete their intended oncology treatment. Under the Albanese Labor government the Kaden Centre will be able to support thousands more cancer patients on their pathway to recovery.I want to give a big shout-out to all the people who work and volunteer at the Kaden Centre and the extraordinary people who use the centre, who mounted a terrific campaign to ensure the future success of the Kaden Centre in our region. I thank you. At a time when you were challenged by your own illnesses or those of your families, you took time to ensure that our community did not lose a vital service for cancer patients.Labor also wants every child in every school to get a great education, and this Albanese Labor government will make sure that our children get the help they need to bounce back after COVID. The past two years have been tough on families in Newcastle, as is the case across Australia. Kids have missed out on activities and experience and many have been struggling with their mental wellbeing. It has also meant that P&Cs havent been able to raise funds to help their schools as they would ordinarily. In Newcastle, Labor is investing more than $130,000 in Newcastle schools, committing to upgrades of playgrounds, air conditioning and an innovative outdoor learning facility in its first term. Labor will deliver $50,000 for upgrades to the outdoor learning space and environment at Heaton Public School. We will be delivering $50,000 for an air-conditioning and ventilation system at Mayfield West Demonstration School and $31,150 for playground upgrades at Belair Public School. Being able to learn and play outdoors is so important for the development of our children. Im very pleased to be committing funding to improve the outdoor learning facilities at Heaton public and supporting the installation of a dry creek bed and nature play facility at Belair public.We know that a good education is a ticket to a lifetime of opportunity and that being in a comfortable and enjoyable setting helps foster an environment that is conducive to learning. Thats why our Schools Upgrade Fund will help students at Mayfield West with the installation of new ducted air-conditioning and ventilation systems to improve air quality, eliminate germs and cool down the classrooms.Newcastle also loves its sports. Following COVID, Novocastrians are thrilled to be back out with their local clubs getting active and connecting with family and friends again. The Albanese Labor government are investing in community sports infrastructure in Newcastle because we know its good for local families and local workers too. Were investing $285,000 to deliver much-needed upgrades to the Wallsend Park irrigation system. That place is home to Wallsend cricket club, Wallsend Football Club and Wallsend RSL Junior Cricket Club, some of the strongest sporting clubs in our region. Wallsend Park has hundreds of people who use that space on a regular basis.Well also provide funding of $625,000 for a new grandstand and sporting facilities upgrade for the Newcastle Olympic Football Club at their Darling Street Oval.These are just some of the really important projects we are funding. Were also ensuring, of course, that women and children fleeing family violence are not being turned away from accommodation support services. We will be investing heavily in that space as well.","Address-in-Reply","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/speech[9]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms CLAYDON (Newcastle—Deputy Speaker) ","(18:03):"
"0","0","0","1","1","Howarth, Luke MP","247742","Petrie","LNP","N/A","116"," Firstly and most importantly, Id like to thank the people of Petrie for placing their confidence in me once again. Im happy to speak on the Governor-Generals address-in-reply, and I will continue to do my very best, to the best of my ability, in this 47th Parliament to represent the people of Petrie as their federal MP. After all, that is what we are here to do—represent our electorates—and, being in my fourth term now, I cant thank the people of Petrie enough for putting their trust in me. Ill continue to work hard.I want to thank my campaign team, the federal divisional council of the Liberal National Party for the Petrie electorate, for the work that they did during the campaign and leading up to the election in May last year. To the executive, all the volunteers, office staff and everyone else: I really want to thank you. My office staff, both my electorate office staff and my ministry staff at the time, did an exceptional job. To my campaign manager, Salome Nel: thank you for stepping up. Youd never done it before and you did a really good job. To the volunteers: whether you had signs up for me in your premises, whether you handed out for me on election day or at pre-poll, or whether you did letterbox drops for me, I very much appreciate it. There were a lot of people who helped, and without volunteers you cant win elections, so I very much want to say a big thankyou to them.The coalition were in government for three terms, and I think we did achieve a lot. There was a legacy of building stronger communities, with programs like the Green Army, which has been operating in my electorate for five, six or seven years, and we have trees that are five or six metres tall. We put in place the fish in schools program.The Powering Communities grants program installed solar panels and LED lighting at sporting clubs and not-for-profit clubs to help keep their energy bills down. Every little bit helps in these clubs. We put in a new netball precinct at North Lakes with brand-new netball courts for the North Lakes Blues. That was great because thats one of the fastest-growing communities in my electorate and there was basically no sporting infrastructure there at all.We provided billions of dollars in road and infrastructure funding from Aspley and Bridgeman Downs all the way up to Deception Bay and Burpengary East. There have been new school halls and scout halls, a new swimming pool, science and environment centres and the very exciting grandstand for the Dolphins. We put some $8 million into Dolphin Stadium, which probably helped the Dolphins win their NRL bid. In a couple of weeks from now, the Dolphins will be the 17th team in the NRL competition as they officially kick off. They had a trial game yesterday.The coalition government did a lot in Petrie but also right around the country. We also did a lot while I was Assistant Minister for Youth and Employment Services. Some 700,000 jobs were saved through JobKeeper during COVID-19. Over 128,000 young Australians are supported by headspace each year. In March last year more than 1.9 million young Australians were employed, and Australias rate of youth unemployment dropped down to 8.3 per cent, the first time in decades it has been under 10 per cent. Thats the lowest youth unemployment rate since 2008.One of the coalition governments priorities in employment was jobs fairs. I had the pleasure of doing those right around the country, whether in Queensland, in New South Wales or down in Tassie. I remember attending one out in Alice Springs at the end of 2021. With some of the problems weve seen happening out there, it certainly isnt a case of not enough jobs. There were 600 jobs on offer that day in Alice Springs and we managed to get 350 to 400 people through the jobs fair that day, which was fantastic.Lower taxes are also a highlight of the coalition government. We not only lowered company tax but also brought in things like lower income taxes and a lot of support for businesses, like the instant asset tax write-off, which basically enabled small, medium and some larger businesses to buy goods and write them off instantly. This really helped drive employment as well. I heard so many stories in my own electorate of where the instant asset tax write-off was utilised and helped bring in more business for companies, which enabled them to employ more people.Obviously, the company tax cut legislation was a huge achievement of the previous federal coalition government. We legislated to ensure that people wont pay more than 30 per cent in income tax. If theyre earning under $200,000, they will pay 30 cents—thats it; its very fair—and keep 70 cents. For anyone earning between $45,000 and $200,000, the maximum tax rate will be 30 per cent. Its legislated, its law and it will kick in in about 18 months, which is great news.We also created the First Home Super Saver Scheme, which was a magnificent scheme. The Labor Party voted against that—every single one of them who was in the parliament at that time. The scheme enables people who are looking to buy their first home, particularly millennials wanting to buy their first home or youths wanting to save in super, to do so. So this will really benefit anyone who earns more than $45,000 a year. At the moment the tax rate is 32½ per cent, so for every $10,000 that you save in the bank youre going to end up with only $6,750. The coalition government set up the First Home Super Saver Scheme, which enabled people to pay only 15 per cent tax. So for every $10,000 they save theyll end up with an $8,500 in deposit. We also extended that to enable people to save up to $50,000. So a young couple could put $100,000 into their super and end up with an $85,000 deposit, as opposed to $67,500 if Labor had had their way and we had not implemented the First Home Super Saver Scheme.Id say to all members in this place that its something we should plug, particularly the member for Cowan, whos nodding her head on the other side of the table. Youths dont know about it enough. A lot of young people dont know about this scheme, and I note that the member for Cowan is now the Minister for Youth. Its really important that young people know about this so that they can put money into their super and pull it back out to buy a house—a very important policy. Thats on top of the first home deposit scheme. So there are some great things that the coalition government did.As far as my own electorate goes, Ill never apologise for advocating for funding for my area. Thats a core responsibility of members: to make sure we get funding for our areas. In Petrie we strengthened the community immensely in the nine years of the coalition government. There was a lot of funding for roads through the Brisbane City Council and the Moreton Bay Regional Council. When you live in a fast-growing area, thats really important. There was also funding for rail. That was a promise by the previous government, but we built it. The coalition government built the Moreton Bay Rail Link and funded it after I was elected in September 2013. All the community halls, not-for-profit groups and sporting clubs were funded through the coalition government, and my electorate is much better for it.It was disappointing, though, because in the last election I had $25 million worth of commitments for the people of Petrie on different projects, and the Labor candidate had zero—nothing, not one; couldnt match a dollar. That was very disappointing, because traditionally in Petrie theres been bipartisan support, but here the Prime Minister and his ministers couldnt promise a dollar—anything that we matched. These were grassroots community projects that needed funding—issues like the Suttons Beach pavilion in Margate, an older building. That beach was the first settlement, apart from Indigenous settlement, in Queensland. It was the first European settlement in Queensland. The Suttons Beach pavilion has been there for a long time. It needs repair; its got concrete cancer. Our commitment, under a coalition government, was $5 million to repair or rebuild that project. The Labor candidate was aware of it, but the Albanese government did not decide to make that an election promise. Not only did they decide not to make it an election promise, but Ive since written to the Prime Minister and theyve written back to that group saying they will not fund it. That is important funding that the Petrie electorate will now miss out on under a Labor government federally and a Labor government in Queensland.There are other projects as well, like the Dolphins high-performance centre in Redcliffe, which would help not just the Dolphins players but also the Queensland Cup players as well as students from Redcliffe State High School and other local athletes who would be able to train there. Some $15 million was promised by the coalition government. From Labor: zero; nothing. A new baseball clubhouse for the Padres baseball team and female change rooms for the Tigers AFL and for the Aspley Hornets, which is one of the biggest junior AFL clubs in the country, were all projects that the coalition government committed to in 2022, and the Labor Party couldnt stump up a dollar. When it comes to the 2025 election and the Prime Minister and his ministers want to come up into Queensland, Ill be reminding those groups that they couldnt stump up a dollar. It would have been built by now if the coalition had been re-elected. Im still waiting to hear from the Prime Minister on a number of those projects, as I said, but there was nothing in last years budget in October—zero for the people of Petrie. That is disappointing. I think the Labor Party need to do a lot better.As a federal MP for the area, in my fourth term, Ill continue to advocate for these projects and to work with local people. As I say, and I said it in my maiden speech, life is about relationships. Thats all you take with you when youre gone. Those relationships are really important—getting out, chatting to people and talking to people on the ground—and having this community infrastructure is also really important for my community, for people to meet, socialise and keep fit together. Thats where governments can help.Before every election I sit down with my wife, Louise, and my sons for an open and honest conversation about the challenge ahead, and whether I should run—every time. I never take my seat for granted. I always put it forward and take it one term at a time and work extremely hard. Election campaigns can be tough at times, with mistruths thrown around. Personally—I can only speak for myself—I always try to speak truth, to let people know, to be honest and straight up. If they ask me what my opinion is on this, I let them know. Every time its the same conclusion: Ill run again.This is the best country in the world, Australia. We should be proud of this country. Id done plenty of overseas travel before I was in this place, and I always love to come back home. So it does stump me that some members, including in this place and in some political parties, seem to hate everything about our country. They want to change everything. Theyre ashamed to stand in front of the Australian national flag. That is dangerous; it really is. I and other members of the opposition, and indeed the government should, talk about the great country that we live in, particularly with our youth, because its easy for them to hear negatives. But they have a strong future. We do live in a great country. There is a positive future for them ahead, even with issues like climate change, which the government ran hard on and the Greens ran hard on. I went to a school in my electorate and spoke to a young girl who was only in year 6. She was showing me her artwork. It was a picture of a place on fire, and she said, This is climate change. I was trying to explain to her that the previous government was doing a lot and had reduced emissions and so forth, but because it is a political contest, it didnt matter what we did. We could say we were doing the zero emissions, which we did do. The other side always want to up us, right? It doesnt matter what we say. Labor will go one better and the Greens will go one better than Labor, but the result of that is that some of our youth are really scared. The reality is that they do have a strong future, that Australia is acting, that were pulling our weight and that in a global community were doing a lot more than many other countries. Its something that the Labor Party should think about too, now that theyve been elected and have got the legislation through. How are you going to respond to young people now? Are you going to tell them that things are okay and that were doing alright? I still hear hysteria from the Greens every time they come in here, but its not helping our youth. Its contributing to mental health issues.I want to ensure that all Australians—our young people and our older people—have happiness and success in their lives. Thats really important. Thats what Ill continue to do—try and talk to people in my electorate and let them know that we have a positive future and that Im here to help as their MP. Im here to represent them well and speak in this place, not just in the House but with my coalition colleagues, and do the very best I can.With any job, there are always highs and lows. But when I head out into the community, talking to the students at schools, the volunteers at sports carnivals or the workers in businesses, or having a cuppa with the residents at a retirement or aged-care home, it reminds me why I do this job. Thats what I love about the job—the on-the-ground work, the communication out there. Thats particularly what I do well.The best of Australia lives in those people—their stories, their challenges, their victories, weaved together to continue to shape the Australian story. The latest census shows nearly 30 per cent of our citizens were born overseas. With some of their parents as well, almost half of all Australians are born overseas. At some point they decided Australia was the country for them. They are now proud Australians. They embrace the values and traditions of this country and work to interpret and fit into the culture, and inevitably go on to enrich it.One of my favourite responsibilities as the member for Petrie is to attend citizenship ceremonies, which is really important. At the time I read the scripts from previous ministers like the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Peter Dutton MP, and the previous minister, Mr Hawke. But with the change of government there was a new script written by the current minister for immigration. A lot of it is really good, but, as the shadow minister for defence industry and shadow minister for defence personnel, I was disappointed that some of the references to veterans and acknowledgement, sacrifices made in past wars and the defence of Australia and its values have been completely wiped from the citizenship script. I read the new script on Australia Day, and its gone. I will write to the new immigration minister and ask him to put something back in that, because I think it was really important—particularly with our veterans on both sides of the House, including the shadow assistant minister for defence here at the table.Ive got a son in the Army, at the Australian Defence Force Academy, who wants to serve. Hes in his third year. He joined up because he loves the country. I taught him its an honour to serve your country, whether you do it through politics, like people in this place, or whether you do it through the ADF. Its an honour and we should be giving back to people. In my role as shadow minister for defence personnel, Im excited about having a son in defence personnel, and I will doing my best to get out there to encourage people to join the ADF. I think that is bipartisan, that the new Albanese government—theyre not that new now; theyve been there for nine months—and the opposition both want to see a strong Defence Force. We want to see more people join. We have committed to 18½ thousand more people in the ADF by 2040. I will certainly do my best to encourage people to join, and I hope that all members will as well.Our defence personnel serve proudly under the Australian flag—particularly the Army, who have the Australian national flag as their flag. Many people have fought and died for that flag. Theyre buried under it; its put on their coffins. Its part of their uniform. They present arms to it. Its a powerful symbol of unity.

Let me say welcome back to everybody here for the first week of parliament sitting. Its almost like being back at school, isnt it? Im particularly excited for the year ahead and for the year that has been, where weve been able to deliver on the governments commitments made during the election campaign.The member for Petrie spoke about that absolute honour and that dedication to representing your electorate. Im also honoured, as I know most people here are, to be representing my electorate. Im particularly honoured to be representing the electorate of Cowan. It is such a diverse and vibrant community full of such caring and hardworking people who put their unique talents to use to really help one another and lift each other up. Its something that I see every day as a local member.Im also very proud to be part of the Albanese government, a government that is delivering for the people of Cowan and for the broader Australian community through a range of initiatives. Through my ministerial portfolios of early education and care and youth Im really proud and excited by the future and by the change that we can deliver for families, for early childhood educators, for children and for young people in Cowan and right across Australia in electorates like Dobell and Petrie.Let me start with last Thursday, because thats what I can recall, given that it was only a few days ago now. Last Thursday, I joined with the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health in the suburb of Morley in the electorate of Cowan. I know the member for Moore knows the suburb of Morley well, he being one of my neighbours in Western Australia. We were there—the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health along with my state colleague the Western Australian Minister for Health and member for Morley, Amber-Jade Sanderson MLA—to announce the opening of expressions of interest for urgent care clinics, including one in the north-eastern community of Morley.These urgent care clinics will take this growing pressure off our hospital emergency departments. We know that a lot of people show up at the emergency department of a hospital for things that can be treated outside of the emergency department. A broken arm, a broken foot or ankle, a cut of some sort—they can be treated outside of emergency departments, but right now, our hospitals and our emergency departments are under this incredible pressure from the number of people who present there because they have nowhere else to go. When I visited this centre in Morley, I said to them: Where do Morley residents go? Where do people from Morley and the surrounding suburbs go when they have to present at emergency? Many of them travel what is roughly around 30 kilometres to go to Fiona Stanley Hospital, which is in the southern suburbs of Perth. So Im very excited about potentially having an urgent care clinic in Morley taking that pressure off our emergency departments.Like many parents in this place, Ive done that midnight run to the hospital with a child. In the case of my son, who had chronic asthma, that midnight run was often with him turning blue and having to be put on a nebulizer. So I know what its going to mean for parents, carers and older citizens in the Cowan community that they will be able to access these urgent care clinics that will be open right up till 10 pm, rather than have to go to the emergency department and sometimes have to wait up to eight hours before theyre triaged. So Im really proud of the Albanese government for recognising, first, that there is an issue here but also for recognising that there is a fix, a solution, and that solution is through the funding of bulk-billing urgent care clinics.On a fairly regular basis I have what we call Meet your members. Other members here might call them open offices. We do them in the park, and I have sometimes up to 40 residents come and have a chat with me.","Address-in-Reply","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/speech[11]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr ALY (Cowan—Minister for Early Childhood Education and Minister for Youth) ","(18:43):"

Most recently, I had one gentleman come to one of my Meet your members sessions who was a self-funded retiree. I was really happy to be able to tell him that the Albanese government had frozen the social security deeming rates at their current level until 30 June 2024, and he was really happy to get that information too.Its great to be here, as I said at the beginning of my contribution. Its even greater when you can go into your electorate and have a conversation with someone who you have changed and had an impact on because of the actions that happen in this place. Were three hours ahead of Perth and four hours away on an aeroplane, but it reminds you that what we do in this place matters for real; it matters to the everyday lives of Australians.Im also looking forward to the Albanese governments investment of more than $1.2 million into Cowan to improve community and road safety as part of the $100 million Black Spot Program. I say this with hope and sadness. Under this program, the intersection of Girrawheen Avenue and Marangaroo Drive in Girrawheen will be upgraded to improve the locations safety. I have driven through that intersection many, many times. Its not too far from where I live, actually. I have to say that its well beyond time that this intersection was given the attention to make it safe for residents and people driving on those roads.The investment, along with around $700,000 from the City of Wanneroo, is really due to the tireless efforts and advocacy of people like Linda Femia. Linda is a constituent of Cowan. She has been campaigning for the intersection to be redeveloped after her son, Nicholas, aged just 21, was tragically killed at that intersection. From 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2020, there have been a shocking 50 crashes at that intersection. That number tragically includes the fatal crash in which Nicholas passed. I am proud to have worked with the City of Wanneroo to support Lindas efforts to increase local safety for the Cowan community. I look forward to the day when we dont count the number of crashes or the number of fatalities in Girrawheen.The Albanese government is delivering for constituents in Cowan. Were investing $2 million to help Greenwood College build new facilities for its swimming pool. I visited Greenwood College, and the change rooms for the swimming pool are lite rally almost a kilometre away—you get changed, and then you get exercise while you go to exercise. So Im really proud to be able to say that weve committed money to help them build new change facilities for their swimming pool. This means theyll be able to run more summer swimming programs and also extend the use of the pool to local community groups. That will have a huge impact throughout Cowan.Were also giving $1.6 million for the construction of a Vietnamese cultural and community centre in Girrawheen. The member for Moore and I attended the Tet festival in Girrawheen this weekend. It was great to see that construction has begun and theyve really started working towards that cultural centre. The Vietnamese community in my electorate, the electorate of the member for Moore and, indeed, the member for Pearces electorate is just such a wonderful asset to our community. They are hardworking and dedicated. They have such empathy and compassion and do such great community work. I know that the member for Moore and the member for Pearce would join me in congratulating the Vietnamese community in the Perth northern suburbs for their hard work and ability to secure, finally, a cultural building for them.Theres $750,000 for the Noranda Sporting Complex womens change rooms. That will be great. Let me tell you that I visited those change rooms, and its not a nice place to get changed if youre a woman or a girl playing sports there. Theres also $750,000 for Lightning Park in Noranda to upgrade the undercover facilities so that families can go and watch their children play sports and support the players comfortably. This is all testimony to the fact that the Albanese government is working hard for the people of Cowan, and Im in such a privileged position to be able to deliver those initiatives for the people of Cowan. I look forward to seeing the Cowan community thrive even more than it already is, through these initiatives but also through the passion, the hard work, the dedication and the commitment to community of all the people in Cowan.I want to also talk a little bit about my Early Childhood Education portfolio and my Youth portfolio while I can. Ive visited many early learning centres and I must say that one of the best things about being the Minister for Early Childhood Education is babies, because I love babies and Im waiting on grandchildren. I know I have to say that in every single speech, and hopefully the message will get through to my sons eventually! Just on a side note, Ive had my two nieces get married and my stepdaughter is engaged to be married next year, so the race is on for all the children to see whos going to give me a grandchild first.Its such a wonderful thing to visit children and watch them play and watch them learn through play. It really does inspire you and give you hope. For me, it really energises me. I could be dead tired and have had a 14-hour day, but Ill walk into an early learning centre and suddenly Im ready to play and sing and dance with those little ones. The other privilege of these visits is talking to early childhood educators, who have demonstrated to me an unlimited amount of passion, dedication and commitment to the wellbeing of future generations of young Australians. I cannot speak highly enough in commending early childhood educators and early childhood teachers on the work that they do in helping to raise and educating the next generations of Australians. As a matter of fact, when I was at Morley Medical Practice I met a mother, Ainslie, and her adorable six-month-old, Loki. We started chatting and she said to me that Loki was born quite small and had a bit of a developmental delay but that he had started crawling at such a young age. As I spoke to Ainslie, she said that much of that credit was due to the fact that he attended an early childhood learning centre for three days a week, and that his educators at the early learning centre were just incredible with him. She could not speak more highly of Lokis early childhood educators and teachers and the benefit that he was getting from being in an early learning centre. I want to see every child in Australia have that opportunity and that benefit, and I want to make sure that no child born into any form of disadvantage should carry that disadvantage through their lives.Finally, in the short time that I have left, I want to speak about what the Albanese government is doing in the Youth portfolio, because it doesnt often get a run and Id like to put on record our commitment to young people. We made a commitment in the election campaign to re-establish the office for youth and develop a youth engagement strategy. We have delivered on that commitment, as we have delivered on so many other commitments to Australians. In the Youth portfolio were investing $10½ million to ensure that young people are able to meaningfully engage on policies and programs that impact on them. That funding has already re-established the federal office for youth—which was abolished under the previous government—which will harmonise youth policy across government.Weve established our youth steering committee of 15 diverse and fabulous young Australians to support the development of our youth engagement model. When people say that young people are disengaged and take this deficit model towards the youth of Australia, let me tell you that, when we put our expression of interest out for a 15-person youth steering committee, we had over 1,200 applications from right across Australia—from rural and regional youth, from youth with lived experience of mental health issues, from youth who are carers and from young people who were refugees. From right across the breadth and depth of Australia, 1,200 young people put up their hands and said, We want to be part of the youth steering committee. We want to help the government. We want to have a say in the policies, procedures and legislation that impact on us. We want you to hear us. And, indeed, we have heard them and we are listening to them.Work is underway now to establish five cross-portfolio youth advisory groups that will work directly with the government and government agencies on policy and program development, as well as on our youth engagement strategy. In 2023, those advisory groups are in the areas of a First Nations youth advisory group; a youth advisory group for mental health and wellbeing—these are issues that young people said are important to them and where they wanted to have an advisory group—a youth advisory group for the promotion of science, technology, engineering and maths; a youth advisory group for climate change and conference of the parties; and a youth advisory group for safe and supported young people. These youth advisory groups mean that young people will be involved in the decisions that affect their lives and their futures, as they should be.I have been incredibly impressed by the young people whom I have met, and let me tell you, Deputy Speaker Buchholz, young people have such an infinite amount of ingenuity, intelligence, wisdom—yes, wisdom—and energy, and we need to harness that. Instead of continually taking a deficit model or looking at youth in a negative way, lets start engaging with youth in a positive way. Lets recognise the positive things that young people have and the positive things that young people can contribute and lets encourage them down that positive pathway.I used to run a youth not-for-profit before I entered this place, and when people asked me, What is it that you do with young people who are vulnerable to violence and radicalisation? the answer was very simple, because its not rocket science at all. If you give young people options, if you give them choice, if you give them a positive pathway and encourage them down that positive pathway, you can make a difference to their lives, and they can make a difference to other peoples lives, and thats what I see young people doing every day. They are choosing a positive option, taking the positive pathway and making a difference to lives.So it has indeed been an extraordinarily busy eight months for the Albanese government; I think we all feel that. But we all feel that, and we all feel that because we do not want to waste a day in delivering change for the Australian community. Weve passed landmark legislation thats making a genuine difference to peoples lives. When you go out there and you talk to your constituents, you can see it. At the 2022 election we said wed deliver for Australia. We said wed deliver a range of things, and Im proud to stand here at this dispatch box and say that the Albanese Labor government is doing just that.","Address-in-Reply","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/speech[11]/talk.text/body/p[8]","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","1","Goodenough, Ian MP","74046","Moore","LP","N/A","121"," I refer to His Excellencys speech on opening day, in which he said:Major challenges—new and old—are before us.In confronting these challenges, this parliament must seek to match the resolve and resilience of the people in whose name you serve.The world has undergone momentous changes since that day, with the sad passing of our beloved sovereign and head of state, the late Queen Elizabeth II.I thank the people of Moore for electing me as their representative for a fourth term to continue advocating for better facilities, improved services and economic development for our local community and the northern suburbs of Perth. I also thank the amazing team of Liberal Party members and supporters who volunteered during my campaign for their dedicated efforts. You ran a strong grassroots campaign focusing heavily on local issues. As a result, I was fortunate enough to be able to withstand the massive electoral swing that swept through Western Australia. Moore is now the only wholly metropolitan seat held by the Liberal Party in Western Australia. The result can only be attributed to the strong support I received from my campaign team in running an effective local campaign addressing local issues and maintaining a strong visible presence on the ground. The Liberal Party must never take the seat of Moore for granted. It is regrettable that the same individuals who were responsible for the loss of Moore by the Liberal Party in 1996 are actively working to undermine me. But with the strong support of the good people of Moore, I will defeat them.Our local community has been resolute and resilient in the face of the global pandemic, which has affected the health and livelihoods of all people around the world. Many of my constituents have lost time, been separated from their families, because of border closures and restrictions and also incurred financial losses during the crisis. Our government sprang to action with economic measures such as the JobKeeper program, health measures such as the national vaccination scheme, and extensive restrictions designed to limit the transmission of the virus. From a personal perspective, I spent a total of seven weeks in quarantine in addition to the time I spent in Canberra. So I apologise to my constituents for not being as visible as I would normally be.In hindsight, the government erred on the side of caution in following the medical advice to keep our population safe. I thank my colleagues for the honour of electing me as the Second Deputy Speaker of the House on opening day. I will strive to fulfil my duties to the best of my ability. It was a special occasion to be sworn for the fourth time on the same Bible my grandmother, Sybil Goodenough, gave to me 39 years ago, on 20 July 1983, before I migrated to Australia as a child with my parents, which I have treasured all these years in remembrance of her. Australia is a land of opportunity where everyone can achieve their full potential through personal effort, hard work, talent and endeavour. Life is full of challenges and obstacles. Each of us must overcome our challenges with resilience and persistence.At the heart of the Moore electorate is the regional city of Joondalup, which serves as the central business district of Perths northern suburbs. My focus is on raising the profile of Joondalup to attract private sector investment, to further develop the city centre and expand the local economy, to provide greater amenity for my constituents. I am also working actively to secure federal funding grants to grow our community facilities. By adopting a regional approach to advocacy and development I will support initiatives such as the new hospital in Yanchep and an aquatic centre in Alkimos, as these projects will help take the pressure off Joondalup Hospital and HBF Arena Joondalup, which are currently overstretched, servicing the rapidly growing population located to the north from the coastal suburbs of Pearce.Moore is home to many families, tradespersons, professionals, small-business owners and self-funded retirees, whose priorities include secure employment locally, housing affordability, ability to meet the rising costs of living, and financial security in retirement. Our community needs a government that is focused on prudent economic management, on keeping inflation under control and interest rates affordable, and on adopting policies to increase productivity. My constituents value their access to a quality education, health care and a safe neighbourhood. The people of Moore are also concerned about a range of environmental issues, such as reducing carbon emissions, minimising pollution, promoting recycling and conserving our local wetlands and coastal bushland.However, the people in my electorate also value economic development, as they rely on construction, mining, services and industry for their livelihoods. The challenge of balancing the household budget and having enough money to pay the bills is a constant challenge. They know the value of a dollar and how to make ends meet.Environmental measures must be cost-effective and not tokenistic. The electorate is now ready for a mature, informed debate on lifting the moratorium on nuclear energy, paving the way for lower-cost, reliable baseload power with zero emissions, utilising new technologies such as small-scale modular reactors.A renewed focus on economic development is the key to turning around our economy. It is concerning to learn of large-scale mining, oil and gas projects being blocked by environmentalists and the Greens, for those actions are detrimental to the prosperity of ordinary Australians.I am often asked by critics about what action I have taken on climate change. The answer is quite substantial. I have a track record of working closely with industry organisations such as the LNG Marine Fuels Institute, BE&R Consulting and the Society for Gas as a Marine Fuel to advocate for lower emissions in the shipping industry, on a large scale, in Australian ports.Globally, shipping accounts for almost three per cent of emissions. This will rise to 10 per cent by 2050, which is the equivalent of the emissions of Japan, which is the worlds sixth largest emitter. For example, one large Newcastlemax class iron ore bulk carrier emits as much pollution as 50,000 cars. These ships also emit large quantities of sulphur and nitrous oxides, which adversely impact local populations.To achieve the target of net zero by 2050 in ports, emissions reduction is required through low to zero carbon fuels for ships and zero carbon shore power. A key solution is changes to legislation that encourage the use of cleaner fuels and shore power. This can be achieved through the implementation of emission control areas around major Australian ports.In terms of fuel for shipping, the cleanest readily available option today is liquefied natural gas. Global industry groups such as the Society for Gases as a Marine Fuel have identified this as a key fuel to span the transition from heavy fuel oils to green ammonia and hydrogen. Ports around the world are building liquefied natural gas refuelling capability now and preparing for a transition to greener fuels by selecting, where possible, cross-compatible equipment. It is expected that the required volumes of green fuels needed to decarbonise shipping will become available by around 2040.Ships moored in port account for 90 per cent of emissions in a large port. Green port initiatives include the use of green grid electricity to power land-based machinery, hydrogen-powered forklifts with more efficient electric lighting and electric harbour vessels.The electors of Moore are looking forward to the future, where our regional city has the potential to grow into a vibrant metropolis, with access to a wider range of professional services, amenities and advanced technology, supporting highly skilled jobs for our suburban population. This can only occur by securing funding and investment. It is the role of the federal government to develop policy to promote innovative development and the necessary funding support to deliver this vision. It is necessary to advocate for the development of an innovation precinct in Joondalup for new and emerging technology and industries, such as, but not limited to, robotics, automation, artificial intelligence, data science, space, health and med tech, defence, cybersecurity and critical infrastructure. The City of Joondalup is to be commended for its commitment to becoming an urban centre for artificial intelligence and robotics. I am regularly briefed by Mayor Albert Jacob, chief executive officer James Pearson, and manager of economic development advocacy Luke Wilcox about strategies to attract advanced industries to our city centre.This leads me to inform the House of the launch of the Australian Automation and Robotics Precinct in Neerabup last year, which is being developed as an industry-leading research, development and testing ground for automation, remote operations and robotics. Road and infrastructure works are currently underway in the precincts initial 51-hectare site, with the common-user facility building scheduled to open in 2023. Development of the AARP is set to create at least 70 construction jobs, with up to 5,000 ongoing jobs in the field of robotics, automation and remote operations expected to be generated after completion. When fully complete, the precinct will form one of the largest test facilities of its kind in the world. This innovation precinct will foster a collaborative ecosystem, driving transformation across the mining, resources, energy, oil and gas, space and defence sectors, serving to transform and futureproof our regional economy whilst creating skilled local jobs for the future.Cybersecurity has dominated the national debate in recent times, with the Optus and Medibank data breaches attracting media attention. With the soaring costs of cybercrime threatening Australian and global businesses, the cybersecurity industry is set to spark the next jobs boom in Australia. The City of Joondalups role in the fight against cybercrime deserves recognition. Joondalup is home to the $138 million Cyber Security Cooperative Research Centre and the Western Australian AustCyber Innovation Hub, which aim to grow the Australian cybersecurity ecosystem, export Australias cybersecurity to the world and make Australia the leading centre for cybereducation.By focusing on the needs of my local community since 2013, I have established a track record of delivering major projects for the benefit of the people in my electorate. The extension and widening of the Mitchell Freeway, at a cost of $291 million, has improved the connection of our suburbs to Perth and to employment centres. To alleviate long waiting lines and ambulance ramping at Joondalup hospital, federal funding of $158 million towards the $256 million expansion was delivered, which is under construction. More than $100 million in federal funding was invested in major road upgrades, including traffic bridges over Wanneroo Road at Joondalup Drive and Ocean Reef Road, to connect our suburbs to economic activity centres of employment and to improve east-west access, and in numerous community projects.Locally, Im committed to securing continued access to world-class health care for local residents, as many of my constituents have to travel long distances to access medical treatment at Royal Perth Hospital or Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital. Through investment we can ensure that a wider variety of allied health and professional services, including better aged care, is delivered in our community. We will seek to attract and retain the best researchers and academics to our local educational institutions and expand higher education and training opportunities within our innovative Joondalup Learning Precinct. To achieve this I will continue advocating for the necessary infrastructure and policy development, including improved roads, community facilities and telecommunications to connect more, both physically and digitally, to other metropolitan activity centres.I commit to advocating for the connection of Whitfords Avenue to a realigned Gnangara Road, as this will make the daily commute for 8,000 more residents safer and more direct, fostering economic development in the Wangara industrial area, which is located in the neighbouring electorate of Pearce. During the election campaign I secured a federal funding commitment of $20 million for this project and I must now work with the Albanese government to match this funding. Similarly, the grade separation of the Reid Highway at the extremely busy Erindale Road intersection with a free-flowing traffic bridge will connect the residential population in the coastal suburbs of Moore to the economic activity hubs of Balcatta, Malaga, Perth Airport and beyond via the Tonkin Highway and NorthLink. For thousands of FIFO workers commuting to Perth Airport regularly, this will be a huge advantage. The federal budget contained $2.5 million towards the design of the project. Further federal funding in the order of $100 million is required to deliver the project, and I will be campaigning hard to secure this commitment.Federal funding of $1.5 million was committed for the relocation of the Ocean Reef war memorial to a new permanent location by the previous government. As impending construction works will mean that the arch built to commemorate the centenary of the Anzac landings at Gallipoli will need to be dismantled, on behalf of the Joondalup City sub-branch of the Returned Services League I urgently seek a bipartisan commitment from the Albanese government to fund the shortfall in funding. I have written to my fellow Western Australian counterpart, the member for Burt, the Minister for Veterans Affairs, to seek his assistance. Our community needs the memorial to be restored at the earliest possible opportunity so that generations of Australians can gather on Anzac and remembrance days to commemorate the service of our veterans.Other local projects for which I will continue to advocate a federal funding contribution from the new Albanese government include: $180,000 for a synthetic green at the Sorrento Bowling Club; a $3 million clubhouse redevelopment at the North Shore Community Hub; and the redevelopment of Heathridge Park.The West Perth Football Club, based at HBF Arena Joondalup, is the oldest WAFL club, with 130 years of history. Club president Neale Fong and CEO Joe McCarthy have contacted me to express concern that the existing lighting facilities are inadequate and in need of a major upgrade. The current tower lights and infrastructure at the ground are 28 years old and require replacement. The club has obtained a quote putting the total cost of the lighting upgrade at $1.2 million. The West Perth Football Club has obtained an initial commitment of a 10 per cent contribution from the AFL and is seeking federal funding in the order of $1 million to complete the project. Upgraded lighting would allow the club to play night football, with capacity in future for televised night AFL.In summary, there is much more work to be done in this term of parliament to attract private sector investment to develop our regional city, as well as securing more federal funding to build community facilities for the Moore community. I will continue my focus on economic development to deliver for the people of Moore.","Address-in-Reply","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/speech[12]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr GOODENOUGH (Moore—Second Deputy Speaker) ","(19:03):"

"0","0","0","1","1","Georganas, Steve MP","DZY","Adelaide","ALP","N/A","124"," I am so immensely proud to be part of the Albanese Labor government in this 47th Parliament and to represent the seat of Adelaide. This parliament is one of the most diverse parliaments in the history of our federation. For someone like me, who has been a long-term defender of multiculturalism and has long fought for greater diversity, this makes me extremely proud. It also makes me proud to be part of this Labor government, a government that will govern for all Australians. We will do this in the spirit of unity and togetherness, which is in stark contrast to the combative nature of the previous government.We have wasted no time in implementing the priorities that the Australian people told us they want. In May 2022 Australians voted for change. They voted for a Labor government to build a better, fairer and cleaner future. In the months since the election we have dedicated ourselves to delivering just that. Weve already legislated to fix the previous governments mess of the aged-care sector. Weve legislated to deliver a cleaner and greener future and to tackle climate change. This was one of the core campaign commitments in the lead-up to the 2022 election. People told us that they wanted a cleaner environment and a greener future, and for us to tackle climate change, and thats what were doing.We are also delivering cheaper medicines and reforming Medicare to ensure it is sustainable and appropriate for future generations. We have legislated 10 days of paid family and domestic violence leave. We have repealed the cashless debit card and expanded access to the Commonwealth seniors health card. We are delivering A Future Made in Australia with Jobs and Skills Australia, and weve finally delivered a National Anti-Corruption Commission. That was long overdue, and it was something that people told me quite clearly they wanted, not only in my electorate but all over Australia. Weve delivered cheaper child care for Australian families.But the list does not stop there. Were currently in the process of debating legislation to deliver even more, including secure jobs and better pay, and safer and more secure workplaces for Australian women. We are also continuing to implement a very important part of our parliamentary work, the Uluru Statement from the Heart, in full, with a referendum this year that will enshrine a First Nations Voice to Parliament in the Constitution. Weve wasted no time, and its only the start. Australians wanted change, and this Albanese Labor government will deliver. We made a promise during the election campaign to implement the Uluru Statement from the Heart in full. We are committed to Australia reconciling with our past, telling and knowing the truth about history, and placing a First Nations voice at the heart of our democratic process. Voice, truth and treaty, and closing the gap: we can only do this by working together.The Prime Minister said it all at the Garma festival when he said:We approach these tasks and the work of constitutional change, with humility and with hope.Humility: because over 200 years of broken promises and betrayals, failures and false starts demand nothing less.Humility because—so many times—the gap between the words and deeds of governments has been as wide as this great continent.But also hope.… … …I believe there is room in Australian hearts, for the Statement from the Heart.I can only concur with these words and add my personal commitment to implementing the Uluru Statement from the Heart and achieving true reconciliation. For too long, First Nations people have had to endure a lack of voice, and this must change.Weve also seen a decade of inaction on climate change. Actually, Ill take that back. It wasnt just inaction from the previous government; it was complete denial. We are making acting on climate change a priority for the government and an opportunity for Australia. We recently passed our Climate Change Bill, a historic moment, and well embrace the transition to clean energy and create hundreds of thousands of new jobs in the process.Under our Powering Australia plan we expect to create more than 600,000 job opportunities, with five out of every six in regional Australia. The plan will disburse $76 billion worth of investment and help families and businesses save hundreds of dollars a year on their bills, but its also a plan to bring people together and move the country forward around a collective desire to take fairer and stronger action on climate change, and it will accelerate our efforts towards net zero emissions by 2050.Our Rewiring the Nation plan will modernise the Australian grid, getting us up to 82 per cent renewable energy in our electricity system by 2030. Our National Electric Vehicle Strategy will increase access to affordable electric and hydrogen vehicles, and the National Battery Strategy will use our talented people and our international advantage in raw materials to not just supply minerals but build a domestic industry. These steps will ensure Australia will once again become a world leader on climate change. Weve already delivered on child care. Australians are doing it tough, and weve seen the cost of living and a whole range of other things, worldwide, going up, but were helping by making child care more affordable. The rising cost of child care is putting a lot of pressure on families and is continuing to drag on economic participation and productivity. To honour a key election commitment, we will reduce childcare costs for more than a million families.Debate interrupted.","Address-in-Reply","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/speech[13]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr GEORGANAS (Adelaide) ","(19:23):"
"0","0","0","1","1","Broadbent, Russell MP","MT4","Monash","LP","N/A","125"," I rise tonight because there was a very good article in The Australian today, on page 20: The electric vehicle narrative fails to tell the full story, by Chris Mitchell. I was drawn to one particular paragraph:The rise of EVs also raises equity concerns in car markets. They are more expensive than traditional cars, driven by the wealthy and subsidised by governments. They are in effect a wealth transfer from the poor to the rich.Ive been watching, in my time in this parliament—it has been on and off since 1990—the transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich in the name of the environment, and in the name of reductions of emission. The article makes some very, very good points:The larger problem for the world, and for the car industries of many first world nations, is Chinas rapid rise towards becoming the worlds number two car maker. Many of its new overseas sales are EVs. This industrial transformation is built on soaring fossil fuel power use in China.And who do we sell our coal to—our essential and amazing coal? To China. The article says:As this column has observed, essentially Europe has been outsourcing its polluting industries to China and India for decades. This reduces CO2 emissions in Europe and destroys jobs for European workers but at no net benefit to the planet because European companies are simply making goods in highly polluting countries with lower environmental standards than the UK and EU.Thats us. Were doing the same thing. The article continues:European car makers such as Volkswagen, BMW and Ford Europe are moving production to the US, and more models to China, as power prices in Europe make local production unviable.US President Joe Bidens new green subsidies are accelerating the move to the US. The Guardian reported on January 30 that the UK electric van start-up Arrival would cut 800 jobs—about half its workforce—as it sought US expansion to take advantage of green subsidies.… … …Meanwhile, the Greens here want Australia to stop all new coal mines when coal is our number two export earner, ban expansion of gas exploration and production when we are the worlds largest natural gas supplier, and reject domestic nuclear power when we have 37 per cent of world uranium reserves.You couldnt write this stuff yourself, as to the track that the Australian community is going down. As Chris Mitchell says here, beautifully:Like turkeys voting for Christmas, Western governments, our own included, are not just shutting down reliable fossil fuel power generation but are moving to renewables products largely manufactured in China, again with expanding Chinese fossil fuel use. China makes more than 80 per cent of the worlds solar panels, many manufactured using slave labour in western China. It also dominates the global market for wind turbines, making 70 per cent of world supply.In all areas, governments of all persuasions, be they Liberal, Nationals or Labor governments in this country or be they independents—it seems that we are determined to stand on our own toes the whole time when we consider the overall pattern. All of these processes—you have your panels on your roof and youre getting the subsidies, but who is paying the higher prices? It is the lower socio-economic people in our community that are paying the higher prices. The poor are paying for the wealthy in too many areas in this country, and it has to stop. Electric vehicle subsidisation is exactly that. Our government did it when it decided to subsidise charging posts. This government has again transferred money from the poor, from the Commonwealth of this nation, to the wealthiest people in the community. And how many cars are they driving in this country? Last year, 3.1 per cent of car sales were electric vehicles, which makes them about 0.07 of the car fleet in Australia. This is wrong. It should stop. There should be further consideration of these matters.","Electric Vehicles","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/subdebate.1[1]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BROADBENT (Monash) ","(19:30):"
"0","0","0","1","1","Ananda-Rajah, Michelle MP","290544","Higgins","ALP","N/A","126"," It is heartening that, after a decade, Australia has reversed its downward trend on corruption. Transparency International released its rankings at the end of January this year, showing that Australias ranking is now 13, increasing five spots from 18 last year, halting a decade of decline which bottomed out under the previous government. Scandal after scandal, rorts, politically stacked public institutions, culminating in the multiple ministries saga. Australia was on the slippery slope towards an autocracy. However, the reprieve was short lived, with sordid details now emerging on a daily basis from the robodebt royal commission. The executive arm of the previous government casually adopted a dont look, dont see attitude, paid cursory attention to legal advice and, armed with a dirt file, plotted to intimidate and discredit critics, because thats how they did business. Power in a moral vacuum allowed substandard behaviour to flourish because there were no consequences—until constituents in Higgins and elsewhere in Australia said, Enough.My constituents are watching with growing disgust and, in the same measure, relief that those opposite are gone from government. One can only imagine that the architects of this scheme and their enablers are living on borrowed time in this House. Those vulnerable Australians, the victims of robodebt, have stories. Many were my patients. They were people who had fallen on hard times, from relationship breakdowns to job losses, spiralling addiction, untreated mental illness or consumed by bereavement. They washed up on my daily ward rounds. They were people who lived in Higgins, from all walks of life, young and old, who needed a safety net until they found their feet again. My hospital was their destination of last resort in their moment of crisis. It galls me that these people were fodder for a cold, calculating crusade of warped ideology and values waged by the former government. Nobody likes a bully, especially when that bully co-opts the Commonwealth bureaucracy to do its bidding, to intimidate and cower.Posterity will remember the royal commission into robodebt as an exemplar of power in a moral vacuum. While the Albanese government has improved Australias reputation on corruption by legislating a National Anti-Corruption Commission, we recognise that even we have limitations. We cannot legislate a heart in government. Miracle workers, we aint. The passage of the NACC at the end of last year represents a legacy reform of the Albanese government. While the nation breathed a sigh of relief with its passage, the NACC is the centrepiece in an overarching integrity agenda that has received only piecemeal attention.The Attorney-Generals earliest reform was actually to the Australian Human Rights Commission, ensuring commissioners were appointed through a merit based transparent process. A perversion of process with little regard to competency or transparency, along the familiar lines of more jobs for mostly mediocre mates by successive Liberal governments, threatened to downgrade the Human Rights Commissions A status. This was a damning indictment of Liberal mismanagement, which went to the heart of how we see ourselves in the world, as a beacon of freedom, so that, as Kennedy said, Man can grow to his full stature. That flourishing that Kennedy alluded to does not happen when human rights are stifled. We have restored independence to the Australian Human Rights Commission in order to—wait for it—protect the human rights of Australians rather than the political agenda of the prevailing government.We have also started a long overdue review of all secrecy provisions in the Commonwealth legislation. We are particularly concerned as to whether existing laws adequately protect press freedom, which is why the Albanese government is convening a roundtable with media organisations. Journalists should feel free to do their job without fear of going to jail.I started with the NACC, and I will circle back to it. Deterrence of corruption is one aspect, but preventing it from taking root is the ideal, and that means making our public institutions hostile to this cancer. Hardening the system to corruption should, however, spare its heart, because public institutions, after all, like their political masters, are there to serve the people with equal parts of head and heart.","Albanese Government","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/subdebate.1[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr ANANDA-RAJAH (Higgins) ","(19:35):"
"0","0","0","1","1","Buchholz, Scott MP","230531","Wright","LNP","N/A","127"," This morning, when I was going through the morning papers, I saw with a gasp an article in the Age headed Treasurer urged to reduce fuel tax credits. At face value, most Australians wouldnt know what that meant, but, if youre a transport operator in my electorate of Wright, or anywhere in Australia, an article like that will put shivers through your business. These types of articles keep operators awake at night. It read:Treasurer Jim Chalmers has been urged to overhaul the fuel tax credit scheme to save the federal budget $4 billion a year …I went and pulled the report that this came from. It was the Grattan Institutes Fuelling budget repair: how to reform fuel taxes for business. After reading the report, can I say that the fundamental assumptions that were made in it are incorrect and flawed. I urge the Treasurer to have his Treasury officials to look very carefully at the assumptions in this document.Let me first explain what the fuel tax credits for the heavy vehicle sector are. Anything over 4½ tonnes is able to claim back a credit of around 20c per litre. This was introduced by the Howard government. John Anderson was the Deputy Prime Minister. In 1999 John Anderson said that fuel tax credits were intended to reduce transport costs, particularly for those people living in regional, rural and remote areas, where transport costs are a significant part of the cost of living and doing business. Basically what he was saying was that, if you live in a regional area, outside a metropolitan area, the goods that you purchase have a higher transport component to their costs. This tax credit was given to make them cheaper, or provide a more level playing field for people in our regional and remote areas.As the report says, in 2004 the then minister for industry, Ian Macfarlane, said fuel tax credits were money in the pocket for thousands of rural businesses and consumers. But the report then goes on to say:… more than 60 per cent of businesses in the top-five industries that receive the vast majority of credits are in major cities, where two-thirds of their employees are also based.Well, if youre a transport operator in the great state of Queensland, say, and youre running into regional and remote areas out of the distribution hubs for Woolworths, Coles, our major retailers, thats where the distribution hubs are. Thats where you employ the people. So they start their day there, and they run to the likes of Emerald, Mount Isa and Boulia, and they return back to Brisbane. Thats where the administration centre is. Thats where the tax returns are lodged. So all the benefits are received in the regional areas. But this report is claiming that the benefit is only received by those in the cities. It is fundamentally flawed.Im not suggesting that the government is going to pursue this, but its in the press. The best thing that the Treasurer could do is to come out and say that they are not considering getting rid of the tax credits that give a level playing field to our regional and remote areas. If this were to go ahead, it would be a kick in the guts to the regional and remote families of Australia. If it were to go ahead, not only would it be a kick in the guts for the families but it would be a kick in the guts for the very sensitive parts of the transport industry that are already dealing with increased cost-of-living pressures.I want to finish by saying that the Australian Transport Association has predicted that the trucking industry would be decimated if the Grattan Institute proposal were to succeed. In a news article, David Smith said:There is no way that any transport business could survive this. Diesel is our biggest cost. We are already fighting ridiculous fuel prices; this would be the straw that breaks the camels back.There are some statistics at the end of the article. The Australian Transport Association research shows that only 34 per cent of trucking businesses can actually pass on increased fuel costs, including the reductions in fuel tax credits. This is a bad tax. Its bad for regional Australia, its bad for the industry and its bad for our country. It should not be adopted.","Fuel Tax Credits","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/subdebate.1[3]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BUCHHOLZ (Wright) ","(19:40):"
"0","0","0","1","1","Burnell, Matt MP","300129","Spence","ALP","N/A","127"," Before the House adjourns today, Id like to take this time to speak about a company that has withstood the test of time through many peaks and troughs. Their resilience is a testament to the premium that Australians place on supporting Australian companies, especially those using Australian raw materials and turning them into items of exceptional quality and craftsmanship right here on our doorstep. This is a brand that Im proud to say forms part of the very broad and diverse manufacturing industry family within the northern suburbs of Adelaide within my electorate of Spence. This is a business that is certainly iconic within the great state of South Australia. It is a company that has a lasting impact on our national identity and our soul—or our sole—as a nation.The manner of spelling that word may be a bit ambiguous for those transcribing our speeches into Hansard, but this ambiguity is for a very good reason. Im sure that it is no shock to anyone to discover that I have, of course, been referring to RM Williams. RM Williams is, of course, known for their signature boots. Theyve been worn by people across this great land and throughout the world, and Ive observed many a pair frequenting this chamber throughout the day. Last year marked the 90th birthday of RM Williams, and, at such a milestone, it is even more momentous that this company is back to being not just Australian made but also Australian owned, and proudly so.As a bit of a history lesson, over 90 years ago, this company was founded by its namesake, Reginald Murray Williams, in 1932 during the Great Depression. RM learned to ply his trade up in the north of South Australia in the Flinders Ranges which is located in the modern day division of Grey. Fate caused Reginalds path to cross with that of an Indigenous man, a stockman by the name of Michael George Smith, who has been more often known simply as Dollar Mick. Dollar Mick has been credited, mainly by RM himself, with being a vital part of everything that eventuated from the brand since their first chance encounter because Dollar Mick was a skilled leather worker, and, through their time together, Mick shared his knowledge of the trade with RM and created and sold boots—a variant of the Chelsea boot—along with leather saddles. After learning and mastering his craft, RM set up shop in 1934 in a manner not too dissimilar to modern day start-ups: out of a shed belonging to his father. This shed was located in Percy Street, Prospect, which is a stones throw away from the Adelaide CBD. In fact, even to this day, you can visit Percy Street and leave with a pair of their boots.Admittedly, it is probably the proud local member in me talking right now, but, to me, one of the best parts is that thousands of their boots are handcrafted in Salisbury, South Australia, at a location roughly a five-minute drive from my electorate office. RM Williams have operated out of that factory since the late 1960s, creating many local jobs over the years. Manufacturing is, at its heart, the lifeblood that helped build the northern suburbs of Adelaide and its people helped build products for many iconic Australian brands such as Holdens, which, sadly, closed its doors in 2017. In the years since, the north has generated new industries such as advanced defence manufacturing, yet RM Williams on Frost Road has endured. Enduring is a good descriptor of RM Williams as the company has seen its fair share of upheaval, from facing financial oblivion in the early nineties to being sold to French fashion giants Moet Hennessey Louis Vuitton, until it was finally brought back into Australian hands by Andrew Twiggy Forrests investment firm Tattarang in late 2020. As the company now goes through its 91st year of operation, its boots are worn by people from all walks of life, from farmers to a number of prime ministers. Whether your days involve working hard on the land or the hard work of governing, you know you can get a pair of boots that will last.It is my hope that Australians who are fortunate to invest in a pair of Craftsman boots continue to do so to keep the tradition alive, to keep Australian manufacturing jobs and to put boots made by Australian hands on Australian feet and on feet throughout the world.","RM Williams","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/subdebate.1[4]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BURNELL (Spence) ","(19:45):"

Whether it involves accessing childcare subsidies, lodging a tax return or passport application, or identity verification, governments must be constantly looking at new ways of serving citizens. The most effective way to do this is through the use of digital technology. The coalition recognises this and in government put digital innovation at the centre of its approach to government services. Specialist ministers and the formation of the specialist Digital Transformation Agency were central to our approach.By contrast, this Labor government has shown a distinct lack of focus in this area. There was not a single new digital service initiative in the October budget. Over 1,000 specialist tech jobs have been axed from Services Australia. There has been only one meeting of the data and digital ministers forum in over eight months. The Digital Transformation Agency has been moved from the centre of government and relegated to the bowels of the finance department.Now we have the findings of the Thodey review. Mr Thodey and his fellow reviewers have made a valiant attempt to put on the governments agenda the ongoing need to drive service modernisation through digital transformation. This review puts the Minister for Government Services on notice for his lethargic approach to digital services delivery. Of course, as we know, he is much more interested in political payback exercises like his royal commission. But whether the minister cares or not, with around one million logins every day, myGov is indispensable. Australians rightly expect that the platform is seamless, simple and safe. The review is a vindication of the former coalition governments digital-first approach. The report makes clear that our investment of over $200 million in the enhanced myGov program put in place much-needed building blocks for a better myGov. The report lashes this governments slow progress on legislating in relation to digital identity, which it says is making Australians more vulnerable to privacy breaches.Perplexingly, the current minister has refused even to state his position on the coalitions Trusted Digital Identity Bill 2021, an exposure draft of which we released well before the end of our term of government. As a result of his inaction and lack of interest, this vital policy area has been left hanging in the wind. This is deeply unfortunate because the capacity for a national digital identity to underpin improvements in government service and the delivery of services by private sector businesses is very considerable.The chair of the myGov User Audit, Mr David Thodey AO, and his fellow panel members have done important work here. I hope that the Albanese Labor government will engage with it seriously, although the initial signs are not encouraging, with the minister dismissing suggestions about some changes to the institutional arrangements within government.We saw in the last term of government what a powerful impact strong leadership from Canberra can have on the delivery of government services. Consider the rollout of the COVID-19 digital certificate. The former coalition government worked closely with the New South Wales government to integrate data held by the Australian immunisation register so that citizens could access their certificate by the Service New South Wales app. This was an Australian first and represented a significant step forward in allowing Australians to continue to live safely as we as a nation sought to deal with the virus and roll out the vaccine. It shows what can be achieved with a can-do attitude and a willingness to collaborate. The previous coalition government did similar work with other state governments. In the urgency of dealing with the pandemic, former silos between governments were broken down. We need to regain that spirit.There are some concrete steps that all levels of government could be taking now. The first would be to ensure that there is consistent dialogue across jurisdictions at the highest level. Second, we need a comprehensive understanding of the digital services delivered by each level of government—federal, state and local—as well as the extent to which these services are integrated with each other. A third and pressing priority is that the Albanese Labor government must get on with delivering the national digital identity system. The potential is great. My hope for 2023 is that it doesnt take a crisis or another government report for governments across Australia to press ahead with this urgent work, and lets see some leadership from the minister.","myGov","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/subdebate.1[5]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr FLETCHER (Bradfield—Manager of Opposition Business) ","(19:50):"

I want to report back to the House on that. Connected Beginnings is a program that connects families to local early childhood education, health programs and health support, as well as to family support services. You could say its a holistic approach to child wellbeing with wraparound services. It really focuses on those connections between health, education, parenting and family support.The new sites announced last week when I was in Geraldton are in South Hedland, Canberra, Ngukurr, Mackay, Eagleby, Katherine, Wagga Wagga and Whittlesea. These nine new sites alone will help 3½ thousand First Nations children better prepare for school as the Albanese government continues to work towards Closing the Gap measures in school readiness. In the Geraldton community, it will help provide 460 First Nations children with the best possible start in life in those critical first five years of their development.While I was in Geraldton to announce these nine new sites—which now bring the Connected Beginnings sites up to 34; we have a target of 50 Connected Beginnings sites by 2025 and we are well on our way to achieving that target—I had the opportunity to meet with some other local community organisations. I met with Chloe Collard, the CEO of the Geraldton Streetwork Aboriginal Corporation, or Streeties as its locally known. Streeties has been supporting Aboriginal young people and families since the 1980s. In 2021, Streeties was chosen by the McGowan government as a pilot location for Aboriginal family-led decision-making, a process that supports the right to self-determination of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and enables their families to make decisions on how to keep their children or their young people safe and connected to family, culture, country and community.I also got to sit down with our local community organisations doing incredible work in the early childhood education and youth spaces at Ngala at the Geraldton Regional Community Education Centre. We had a lovely discussion about sharing our aspirations for children and young people right across Australia as well as in Geraldton. One of the highlight of the day was visiting the Bambi Child Care Centre, where I got to meet some beautiful children as well as speak to some fantastic staff who are doing some amazing things there.One of the great memories that Ill take from that day was of a little girl there named Sarah whose parents, the staff informed me, were Egyptian. Many people might not know this, but English was not my first language; the first language I spoke was Arabic. By the time I was six, though, Id forgotten all my Arabic. My mum tells me that, when I was a kid, the very first words that I uttered were those of an Egyptian song called Mama Zamanha Gaya. Little Sarah was a bit upset, so I picked her up and sang her this song in Arabic. She recognised the song—obviously her parents must sing it to her as well—and it was just such a beautiful moment as I was able to connect with this child through language and culture.Towards the end of the day I got to meet with headspace Geraldton. Wow! What an amazing organisation they are, let me tell you! The importance of mental health support services for young people, especially in regional areas, is something that I hear about from young people right across Australia, and I know the member opposite will agree with me about the mental health of young people in regional areas. It was fantastic to meet with Fiona, the CEO there, and her staff. We had a really interesting conversation about young people and mental health.Id like the thank the various organisations that I met with in Geraldton, particularly the incredible team at Bundiyarra, including the CEO, Wayne McDonald, and the program manager, Sonya Dawson. Also a big thank you to Chloe Collard at Streeties, to Ngala for hosting lunch, to Simone and Kelly from Bambi Child Care Centre and to Fiona and the team at headspace. Lastly, thank you to the member for Geraldton, Lara Dalton MLA, and her incredible staff for making your day available to me and for showing me just how beautiful Geraldton is and how wonderful the community is and what we can do when we all join hands and work together for the betterment of our children.House adjourned at 20:00","Geraldton: Community Services","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/subdebate.1[6]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr ALY (Cowan—Minister for Early Childhood Education and Minister for Youth) ","(19:55):"

This year, Lime Cordiale had an amazing four songs voted in, including my favourite song, Colin. Ocean Alley had three. The Rions came in at 64, with their fabulous song Anakin. And, of course, Flume topped the list for the second time, in addition to having two other songs in the top 50. All these artists hail from the northern beaches. And lets add to that list the world-renowned musicians Angus and Julia Stone, who attended the local high school, Barrenjoey High, and whose father was the music teacher there for years. It is this same seaside high school that members of the band the Rions graduated from in 2021 after winning triple Js Unearthed accolade. Is this a coincidence? Actually, I dont think so. Sydneys northern beaches has long been fertile ground for musicians, artists, authors and creatives of all varieties. With authors, we have people like Thomas Keneally, Liane Moriarty and Michael Robotham, who also hail from that area. This concentration of talent and success is what happens when creativity is encouraged, cultivated, supported and cherished.So the launch of the governments National Cultural Policy is very welcome news indeed for my community of Mackellar. The title of the policy, Revive, is a fitting acknowledgement of the incredibly difficult time the arts industry has had, not only throughout the pandemic but as a result of 10 years of neglect by the coalition government, disinterested in fostering artistic talent. I welcome, first of all, the establishment of Creative Australia as the governments principal arts investment and advisory body. I welcome also the underlying principle that decisions about art belong not with politicians but with the arts community. And I welcome the centrality of First Nations arts and culture, with its placement as the first pillar of the entire policy.I was most excited to read about the establishment of the Music Australia body, which will grow the market for contemporary music in Australia, deliver songwriting and recording initiatives in schools, and improve access to live music venues for bands and solo artists, among so many other things. As humans, we all benefit from the creative endeavours of our artists and our musicians. Through art and music we are enriched and we are enlightened. So it puts a smile on my face to think of an entire generation of young people starting their bands in their parents garages up on the northern beaches, blissfully unaware of the release of a government initiative that, hopefully, one day will help be the making of them.","Mackellar Electorate: Arts and Culture","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[1]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr SCAMPS (Mackellar) ","(10:30):"

As has also been frequently highlighted through numerous surveys and research, mental health wellbeing is a primary concern amongst young people, where depression, eating disorders, drug abuse, aggressive behaviours, psychosis and suicidal thoughts are all too prevalent. Despite the many intervention programs initiated by governments, schools, sports clubs, employers and others, one in four young adults reportedly deal with some form of mental health problem.In the north-eastern suburbs of Adelaide, one community group that is making a positive difference in helping young people with mental health issues is Talk Out Loud, otherwise known as TOL. Established in 2016 by its founder, Mary Galouzis, and relying on sponsors, local fundraising and government and community grants, Talk Out Loud has now established a base in Tea Tree Gully and another in Salisbury. Each month over 300 young people use the Talk Out Loud facilities for a diverse range of activities.Last Friday evening I attended the AGM of Talk Out Loud, where we were provided with an update of their work over the past year, when COVID not only added to mental health issues but also impacted on community interactions and programs. COVID did not, however, dampen the work of Talk Out Loud, which to date has, through counselling services, school programs and recreational activities, run 27 youth empowerment camps, made presentations to around 5,000 people in school and community groups, and individually interacted with over 840 people. All the programs are organised by dedicated volunteers, some whom were recognised at last Fridays AGM. We also heard a very traumatic personal story of a young person who has benefited from her association with Talk Out Loud and is now a volunteer with the organisation. This was of course just one of the examples of how Talk Out Loud is changing lives.I take this opportunity to commend and to thank the Talk Out Loud leadership group and committee members, the many volunteers and their sponsors for their extra rework for helping young people and their families get through some of the very difficult issues in their lives from time to time.

The fact that Labor continues to ignore, at best, or rip out the heart of regional areas, at worst, surprises no-one who lives there. Its not only at a federal level but also at a state level that Labor have proven to have no regard for anybody outside their city electorates. This past week I have been inundated with calls from the residents of Stawell, a town of 8,000 people in the south of my electorate. In two months, Stawell medical clinic has sadly lost 50 per cent of its doctors; it is down from six to three. Fourteen months ago an amalgamation occurred under Ballarat Health Services, with Edenhope and District Memorial Hospital and Wimmera Healthcare Group to form Grampians Health. They are organised under the auspices of the Victorian Labor government.At the time of the proposed amalgamation there was an uproar from residents who did not want health care to be centralised in Ballarat, and yet it has come to pass. One outgoing doctor described the Stawell community as his second family but told me that, financially, he couldnt go on practising in the town under new contract conditions he was offered by Grampians Health. Grampians Health wants to pay its doctors a sessional rate but, in smaller towns, typically, doctors are paid fee-for-service. It is a reasonable incentive for a regional doctor, who often has to travel from the city to commit services in a regional town.The doctor I spoke to had served the Stawell community for over 15 years. The Grampians Health chair told me their major stakeholder was the Victorian Labor government and Ballarat Health. What about the regional patients they are supposed to serve? Clearly, cheap options are the best options, but not when you lose your doctors. The doctor is one of three who have left, but it is the townspeople who lose. This doctors passion for the community moved me to tears. Now he has to say goodbye because he could not afford to work under, lets face it, the state government terms.For the past month I have had a survey open for my constituents to tell me their experiences of health care in Mallee. I am getting the same story repeated from residents in Stawell and indeed across the electorate. We are in crisis, they cry. Meanwhile, those opposite and their state Labor counterparts continue to ignore this unfolding tragedy. Labor do not have a plan to fix regional health care and, worse, they do not respect the doctors who have gone out of their way to serve smaller communities that would otherwise have no doctor. Instead of improving regional health care, they are making it worse. I hope this government and the Victorian Labor government can prove me wrong.

World Wetlands Day marks the date on which the Ramsar convention was signed in the town of Ramsar in Iran in 1971. It is the worlds longest-standing environmental convention. Australia was one of its first contracting parties. We listed the worlds first Ramsar site on the Cobourg Peninsula in the Northern Territory. But now there are 67 listed Ramsar wetlands in Australia, including 12 in WA. The call to action for this years conference was, Its time for wetland restoration, and that is absolutely right. Its right because weve already lost too much and because existing wetlands are under pressure. Its right because wetlands are crucial when it comes to protecting biodiversity, and its right because wetlands are especially vulnerable to the impact of climate change whilst at the same time representing the best nature based mitigation through carbon storage.The Beeliar wetlands are the perfect place to understand all these things. The area has been changed through urban development yet remains a crucial link in the east-west chain of Swan coastal plain ecosystems that run to the sea. Not long after I was first elected, my community fought to protect those wetlands from a ridiculous, badly planned private toll road conceived by Liberals in Canberra as a first step to privatising Fremantle port. Now, six years on, were seeing the living evidence of environmental recovery through community engagement in the work of caring for country. Thats the kind of work or stewardship that is consistent with our First Nations heritage, which the Cockburn Wetlands Centres elder and resident Marie Taylor encourages us to share.The scale of that stewardship will grow nationwide because the Albanese government is doubling the number of Indigenous rangers and delivering $200 million of support for local wetland, waterway and estuarine restoration through our Urban Rivers and Catchments Program. Half of all threatened animal species and a quarter of threatened plant species are present in urban areas, so building a sustainable and healthy urban environment requires conservation of the full suite of wetlands, from urban creeks and lakes to our coastal estuarine ecosystems.I want to take this opportunity to thank Karl Haynes and all the staff and volunteers at the Cockburn Wetlands Centre for their work. I acknowledge everyone who participated in this years conference, including those who bring their scientific expertise, research work and landscape management skills as well as grassroots volunteers, activists and even poets who choose to give of themselves to the cause of environmental protection. Finally, I give a shout-out in honour of all those who fought the good and necessary fight in the summer of 2016-17, all those thousands who turned up day after day in the dust and the heat, who stood up and shouted and sang and locked arms and, in the end, prevailed to protect the Beeliar wetlands.","Fremantle Electorate: World Wetlands Day","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[4]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr JOSH WILSON (Fremantle) ","(10:39):"

Right around our state, young juvenile delinquents are running rampant. They are stealing cars, theyre breaking into homes, theyre hurting our kids, and theyre killing innocent people. I recently ran a petition in my electorate, asking people who had been affected by this crime wave to have their say and stand with our state opposition leader, David Crisafulli, in the recall of Queensland parliament. Hundreds of people in Dawson signed this petition because they do not want to have to wait for the Premier to come off holidays to feel safe. These calls have fallen on deaf ears.Reported in the Australian on 30 December, the Premier was quoted on Christmas Day as saying:Can I say this and be upfront and frank? The courts need to do their job.Thats what Ms Palaszczuk said. While Premier is busy playing the blame game, recent figures have revealed that in just December 2022—that is, one month—2,133 cars were stolen in Queensland. In the meantime, while were waiting for Queenslands parliament to return, weve had small-business owners in Bowen robbed at knife point and cars stolen and burned. Last week, Mackay Christian College was terrorised by a joyrider driving erratically in a stolen car. The principal, Dr Barclie Gallogray, said one of his students was nearly killed after this young criminal smashed into a bus stop, missing the students by centimetres—the students were sitting in the bus stop. Our children are now too scared to go to school.Youth dominated crimes are on the rise. Break-ins, burglaries, shop and car thefts, joyrides, arson and property damage are all on the rise, and Queenslands youth reoffending rates are the worst in the nation. There are reports on community Facebook pages each and every day all across my electorate from victims being terrorised. The people in Dawson are living in fear and are essentially prisoners in their own home. This is just not acceptable.

"0","0","0","1","2","Watts, Tim MP","193430","Gellibrand","ALP","N/A","134"," I rise today to express my anguish and the anguish of my community and the broader Melbourne cycling family at the tragic death of young cyclist Angus Collins. Angus was just 22 years of age, and he was much loved by his family and friends, his local Williamstown community and by the Brunswick Cycling Club. Those who knew him have told me that he was a wonderful young man, full of energy and enthusiasm, with a quick smile. I want to express my deep condolences to his friends and family about this tragic loss.Angus died after being struck by a truck at an intersection on Footscray Road, the main and, in relative terms, safest cycling route between Melbournes west and the CBD. A competitive road cyclist, the tragedy is compounded by the fact that Angus died doing something that he loved. Anguss death has struck a broader chord in our community though, as he also died doing an everyday activity on a road that hundreds of residents of Melbournes west use to commute by bike everyday. I know it well, and I ride it regularly myself. Indeed, I rode it everyday during the lockdowns and, in fact, fractured my elbow 100 yards from that intersection.I dont want to prejudice any upcoming coronial processes by commenting on the circumstances of the accident in this place, and while the cycling route where Angus was killed will ultimately become a far safer elevated veloway upon the completion of the West Gate Tunnel project, the safety of this intersection during the construction phase clearly needs to be investigated as a matter of urgency. And, after my discussions with the Victorian state government, Im confident that that will now occur.Ive spoken to Melissa Horne, the minister with responsibility for active transport and the member for Williamstown, about Anguss death, and I know that she shares my anguish. When speaking to Minister Horne, we discussed the upcoming diversion of cycling traffic from Footscray Road to Dynon Road as part of the ongoing construction project for the West Gate Tunnel. The segment of Dynon Road is currently the less safe alternative route available to cyclists commuting to the city from Melbournes west. I discussed with Minister Horne the potential of both short-term safety interventions for cyclists on Dynon Road during the diversion and more permanent longer-term interventions to improve the safety of this road for cyclists. I should say though that there arent obvious simple solutions here. Past planning decisions mean that apartments on this stretch of road have very little setback, leaving government with fewer opportunities than it otherwise might have had to improve the safety of the road.Weve seen more focus on and more investment in cycling infrastructure in Melbournes west in the last few years than we have seen in the decades before, and I congratulate the state member for Footscray, Katie Hall, for her advocacy on this issue as well as the Maribyrnong City Council. But Anguss tragic death this week has reminded us all that we still have a long way to go to ensure the safety of cyclists on our roads.","COLLINS, Angus Robert","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[6]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr WATTS (Gellibrand—Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs) ","(10:45):"
"0","0","0","1","2","Archer, Bridget MP","282237","Bass","LP","N/A","135"," The Tasmanian netball association has 1,550 members across 13 clubs and is growing. Launceston Basketball Association has more than 3,000 players from 500 teams, and thats with an increase in membership of over 30 per cent in just the past year. Female participation in AFL has seen growth of over 23 per cent in the past few years, and Hockey Tasmanias northern roster has more than 1,500 players using the local facility every week during peak season. These are just some of the statistics attached to popular sports in the Northern Tasmania region, and over the past few years Ive met with key stakeholders, players and volunteers across these and other sporting codes all desperate for funding to ensure the facilities are fit for purpose and can meet growing demand.For the Launceston Basketball Association, the significant rise can largely be attributed to the launch of our states very own national basketball team, the Tasmanian JackJumpers, in 2021. While its wonderful to see more and more young people engaged in the sport, its causing a major headache for the association. Association President Craig Gibson has admitted they will not be able to find a spot for everyone this year: Well have to go back to the clubs add tell them we dont have the space. You can only have this many teams, which means therell be kids that dont get to play. After meeting with members of the association late last year, I joined them as they launched their petition calling on all three levels of government to identify possibilities for an additional six courts while investing in the upgrade of the Elphin Sports Centre. Its a huge loss to young sporting enthusiasts, their families and the sporting community if clubs cannot continue to grow due to a lack of suitable infrastructure.Just last year, after working closely with Hockey Tasmania, I was thrilled to announce an election commitment of $1.25 million for upgrades to the decades-old Northern Hockey Centre infrastructure at St Leonards, bringing the centre up to contemporary standards. Sadly, despite of a pattern of me-tooing almost every election commitment I announced last year, the federal Labor government did not support this worthy proposal—much to the disappointment of the hockey community. Like the hockey centre, I was also acutely aware of the out-of-date and frankly dilapidated state of the community clubrooms and advocated for the redevelopment of the Exeter Show and Recreation Centre, securing the funding through the March 2022 budget. Once again, this project has demonstrated its merit, particularly as it will address the needs for a growing number of female participants playing AFL, and it received additional funding from the state government a year prior. After dragging their feet and leaving the community organisation waiting almost six months for news, Labor finally announced in October last year they would uphold my funding commitment. However, were now in February and the funding still hasnt been delivered, causing further costly delays.Supporting grassroots sport through improved infrastructure is a long-term investment in the future of our communities, leading to better physical and mental health outcomes. Ill continue to advocate for Labor to fund critical projects in our region to ensure the longevity of these growing sports.","Bass Electorate: Sport","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[7]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs ARCHER (Bass) ","(10:48):"
"0","0","0","1","2","Vamvakinou, Maria MP","00AMT","Calwell","ALP","N/A","135"," Last Friday, I joined the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, the Hon. Andrew Giles, at the Brotherhood of St Laurences Broadmeadows office in my electorate. We were given the opportunity to hear firsthand from local refugees about the experiences which have shaped their migration and settlement journey in Australia and the challenges facing refugee youth in particular. Fit-for-purpose programs, such as the Youth Transition Support program, have had a considerable impact on local youth from refugee backgrounds. The program offers targeted assistance for newly arrived young people of refugee backgrounds within education, training, vocational support, community participation and employment. The youth representatives present on that day explained the key challenges to social and economic participation in some of the most formative and developmental years.For newly arrived young people of refugee background, the most important areas which contribute to improved settlement outcomes centre around programs which deliver an increased awareness of how the system works; increased skills, knowledge and confidence to access the system and improved workplace readiness; and linkages and opportunities to secure outcomes towards employment that lead to long-term economic participation, settlement and greater social cohesion. These contributions to community and the economy by newly arrived migrants cannot be lost to a system mired in a complexity resulting in exclusion and long-term disadvantage. And, as the minister outlined, in assisting in the settlement and integration of new arrivals, we need to ensure that people have a sense of agency, that they are listened to and that they are able to operate in an environment which allows them to unlock the system. These are the foundations of an improved, just and equitable settlement journey.Areas of economic opportunity and workforce participation are grounded in a complex environment where social disadvantage in any one area often has a direct adverse impact on a whole series of outcomes. When coupled with the intersectional problems facing refugees and refugee youth in particular, the impact is outsized and often enduring. Thats why we need relevant programs which break the cycle—programs which are needs based and more importantly outcomes based and which deliver educational training and long-term employment as a pathway to full participation in society.I want to commend the work of the Brotherhood of St Laurence and Foundation House as well as local organisations, including Banksia Gardens and local employer champion Scalzo Foods. It was the stories of resilience that we heard and experiences shared by our newly arrived local youth which remain the stand-out and whose perspectives will, most importantly, outline to help inform and shape the policies of this government, and I want to commend the work of everyone involved.","Calwell Electorate: Asylum Seekers","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[8]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms VAMVAKINOU (Calwell) ","(10:51):"

We are now a majority migrant nation, and by that I mean that each person is either themselves, or had one parent who was, born overseas. In my seat, that figure is just about at 70 per cent, with 27 per cent of my electorate identifying as being of Chinese heritage, making it the third-largest in the House of Representatives.So I rise to speak about lunar new year, this being the Year of the Rabbit. Lunar new year is celebrated by billions of people throughout the world, including here in Australia and in my electorate. For them, it is one of the most important social and economic holidays in the calendar year. These past few weeks we have seen some wonderful festivals, many of which had been on hold since 2019. If you come to Box Hill or Doncaster, you will see lanterns, dragon races and red pockets, but more than that—you will see families and friends celebrate their love for each other and their community and the new beginnings that come with the calendar year.Lunar new year says so much about our migrant nation—migrants whove sought to make this country home, who have each brought traditions of ancestral lands and made us stronger for it. For example, last night I met with chambers of commerce representing, variously, the provinces of Hubei, Wuxi and Henan. Our commercial and cultural connections are sincere and mutually beneficial. Can I thank Mr Ji and all of the leaders and committee members who made that event happen.Just over one week ago, the Asian Business Association of Whitehorse organised and ran their Lunar New Year Festival, which was held in Box Hill. Over 100,000 people attended, including the Prime Minister and many members of cabinet, and there was bipartisan commitment to that event. Can I thank Bihong Wang and her committee for hosting this formidable demonstration of all of the traditions of the Lunar New Year Festival.It was also a chance for me to speak to my electorate—which includes Warrandyte, where some of the earliest contributions from Chinese-Australians were made; the schools in Doncaster, where some of the top students are Chinese Australians; and small-business owners and senior citizens groups headed by people like Selena Leung and her committee. I also want to thank the Chinese community society of Victoria, headed by Vincent Liu and his committee.Then, finally, we all rely on our staff, but can I say that Im really proud to have one of my new staff members, Maggie, who speaks fluent Chinese. She is there to help anyone in the community in their home language, because often language can be a barrier for representation and communication.So can I thank everyone for putting on some wonderful festivals in the electorate.

Over summer, I was very pleased to receive a letter from Elle, who is an eight-year-old young woman living in Heidelberg in my electorate. Elle wrote to me about how shed noticed that the pedestrian crossing lights in the area where she lives have only men on them, and Elle suggested to me that that should change so that there were men and women on the lights. Elle, I think it is an excellent suggestion. I will do all I can to take that up and push it along.But I did want to reflect a bit on the broader piece that you have picked up on there—that you saw only men on the lights. The fact is that, for too many young girls in our community, when they look around, they see symbols of men—they see that the representation does not look like them. So, Elle, I want to tell you: as well as trying to get the lights changed, I want to try to get the broader piece changed as well. I want you to grow up in a world where you have all the opportunities that the boys you are growing up with do. I want you to grow up in a world that is fairer, and I want you to grow up in a world where you are safe.That is something that our government is very much focused on. We are a government that is doing the piece that changes what people see. We have women in positions of power. We have many female leaders, leading across the spectrum in our government. We have many female MPs in this place. And that is important for girls like Elle and other girls in our community. We are doing the work that sits behind that as well to make sure that this is a fairer community for all. We are working to overcome some of those inequalities, those imbalances, that continue to make it an unfair and unjust place for women in Australia at the moment.I want to highlight some of the important work we are doing. We are reforming paid parental leave. This will be a really significant change in our community, making it easier for men and women to share caring responsibilities from the very beginning, changing that gender balance that we set up from the very start of a childs life. We are introducing cheaper child care for 96 per cent of Australian families, including 6,600 in my community of Jagajaga. I know this will be a big benefit for working families, particularly for working women in our community. We are working to close gender gaps—the gender pay gap and the fact that women disproportionately shoulder unpaid work and caring responsibilities. Our National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children has the ambitious goal of ending violence within one generation. It is ambitious, but it is so important because what we have at the moment is unacceptable. Too many women and children are still unsafe. We are providing significant funding for housing, including to support older women at risk of homelessness, and we are doing a lot to fix womens health and to end medical misogyny.Its a huge list. There is a lot to be done, but, Elle, I want to let you know that we are committed to it.

"0","0","0","1","2","Andrews, Karen MP","230886","McPherson","LNP","N/A","137"," I move:That this House:(1) recognises the importance of the International Day of Women and Girls in Science on 11 February 2023, and the amazing contribution of Australian women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields; and(2) acknowledges the crucial work undertaken by the previous Government to promote gender equity in STEM in Australia.This Saturday, the International Day of Women and Girls in Science allows us, globally, to mark the need to promote the full and equal access and participation of females in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. It is the eighth year of such a commemoration, and I thank the many organisations across the nation that will mark the day. As the former Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, I know that Australian women make a significant contribution to leadership in science, particularly in STEM fields, and Im sure that everyone here can agree that female representation at the highest levels in Australian science is essential to improving outcomes.Australian women certainly do lead by example. Dr Cathy Foley has served as Australias Chief Scientist since 2021 and as the chief scientist at Australias national science agency, CSIRO, since 2018. Astrophysicist Lisa Harvey-Smith, as the Women in STEM Ambassador, works tirelessly to raise awareness of gender inequity and implement the Women in STEM Decadal Plan, and I acknowledge those opposite for reappointing Ms Harvey-Smith in that role last year.I know firsthand that the coalition, in government, was committed to promoting gender equity in STEM across the country, including those crucial senior appointments that I have just mentioned. The coalition broke down barriers to the advancement of women and girls in STEM, investing more than $147 million to support gender equity in STEM across multiple programs and initiatives, including the Women in STEM and Entrepreneurship grants program, the Australian Academy of Sciences Women in STEM Decadal Plan and the first Women in STEM Ambassador, and we established the Boosting Female Founders Initiative in 2018 to assist female entrepreneurs, who are underrepresented in the innovation and technology sectors, often because they face greater obstacles in getting early-stage finance.The 2022 STEM Equity Monitor revealed that, from 2018 to 2021, there was a 34 per cent increase in the number of women in STEM-qualified occupations, compared to a six per cent increase amongst men. Figures also reveal that more women are choosing to study STEM, and I was very pleased to visit a number of schools in my electorate and to hear, anecdotally, that they are seeing more girls choosing to studying maths and science subjects. I am looking forward to even further increases in representation over the coming years and to those students continuing with their studies, post secondary, whether that be at university or through a vocational education qualification.Between 2018 and 2020, the number of women enrolled in STEM courses at university increased from 77,000 to 87,000. This was a 12 per cent increase, compared to a five per cent increase for men. Whilst those numbers remain relatively small, it is a significant improvement. The coalition created broader opportunity for women in STEM fields through policy measures such as the establishment of the Australian Space Agency in 2017, with the goal of tripling the size of Australias space sector and creating up to 20,000 more jobs by 2030. Through our dedicated science policy, we established the National Science and Technology Council as the peak advisory body to the Prime Minister and other ministers on science. I am very, very proud of the more than $1 billion National Innovation and Science Agenda, including the CSIRO Innovation Fund, the Cyber Security Growth Centre, tax incentives for early stage investors, and crowdsourced equity funding legislation. We also established Industry Innovation and Science Australia to make sure that those three fields were as connected as they possibly could be.The International Day of Women and Girls in Science is going to heighten the visibility of girls and women in STEM and the importance of the opportunities this field of study and career can provide. I am very pleased at the widespread support for this motion, but I call on all of the members in this place who share the view that it is in the national interest to drive greater gender equity in the crucial field of STEM to support this motion.","International Day of Women and Girls in Science","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs ANDREWS (McPherson) ","(11:00):"

Today marks the International Day of Women and Girls in Science. This affords us the opportunity to further recognise the role that women and girls play in science, while promoting STEM careers to future generations of women.As we know, many scientific leaders over the centuries have been women and they have advanced the frontiers of human knowledge—women like Marie Curie, Rachel Carson and Ada Lovelace, and Rosalind Franklin, who had an important role in the discovery of DNA. We have many distinguished women scientists in Australia. The Chief Scientist, Cathy Foley, has already been named. Shes a great champion of women and of diversity. Im pleased to say she is a constituent of mine in Bradfield. Tanya Monro is an Australian physicist known for her work in photonics, who became the first ever female Chief Defence Scientist. I want to particularly acknowledge Patricia Selkirk, who was made a Companion of the Order of Australia in the Queens Birthday Honours List halfway through last year. She is a resident of my electorate, and shes made a very distinguished contribution to Antarctic science over many decades.The evidence is very, very clear, if any proof be required, of the distinguished contribution that women have made to science in Australia and globally. But there is much more that we need to do. STEM—science, technology, engineering and maths—careers are enormously important, and the sectors which draw on these careers are continuing to expand. We know, as a general proposition, that diversity leads to better problem-solving, as people bring different perspectives and the more different perspectives that are brought to a problem the more likely the problem is to be solved. That is as true of gender diversity as it is of other kinds of diversity.Over the last few months, Ive had the opportunity to meet a number of very impressive women leaders in my work as shadow minister for science. Ill mention just a few. Theres Michelle Simmons, who was Australian of the Year in 2018 and is a global leader in quantum computing from her very impressive lab at UNSW, and who Ive had the chance to meet. She leads a very dedicated and highly qualified team of people working at the very frontiers of knowledge. Theres Professor Madhu Bhaskaran, who co-leads the Functional Materials and Microsystems Research Group at RMIT University. Shes also the co-founder of the Women Researchers Network at RMIT University and a board member of Women in STEM Australia. Theres Professor Orsola De Marco, at the Research Centre for Astronomy at Macquarie University.What stands out amongst these outstanding women and others Ive had the opportunity to meet is not only their distinguished achievements in scientific research and discovery, but also the work they do to champion careers in science to women at all levels—girls in high school who may be thinking about science as a career; undergraduate students making that decision as to whether they might pursue postgraduate study and a PhD; postdoctoral students and academics at the early stages of their career; women throughout all stages of their careers.The reality is that there remains a set of challenges facing women scientists and women researchers when it comes to juggling the many demands in their lives, including family and motherhood responsibilities in many cases. We also know that women who achieve prominence and distinction get called upon to give assistance and support in so many ways. So the demands that leading women scientists face, in many ways, are of a different character to those faced by male scientists.We all take enormous pride in our scientists generally, but particularly in our women scientists. A great deal has been achieved, but its clear that more needs to be done. Im very pleased to lend my voice in support on this motion on this International Day of Women and Girls in Science.","International Day of Women and Girls in Science","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr FLETCHER (Bradfield—Manager of Opposition Business) ","(11:06):"

Its no secret that Im passionate about encouraging kids to consider careers in STEM, particularly girls. In my first speech I explained how a love of science starts in childhood. We must give girls Lego to start those building blocks, hand girls spanners and encourage them to use a telescope to reach for the stars.When I spoke about reaching for the stars in my first speech I was specifically thinking about Dr Gemma Anderson, whose dad shared his love of the stars and helped her gaze at our vast universe through a telescope. Gemma describes this as being a pivotal moment of her deciding to become an observational astronomer. Using radio waves she has monitored black holes, supernovas and gamma ray bursts.One of Gemmas colleagues, another impressive Swan local, Dr Natasha Hurley-Walker, moved to WA to work on the Murchison Widefield Array, a low-frequency precursor radio telescope to the Square Kilometre Array. Last year, Dr Hurley-Walker was awarded the Astronomical Society of Australias Anne Green Prize for her work in telescopic imaging of the Milky Way. She also has a great TEDxPerth talk.There are more impressive Swan women. Theres Dr Lucy Commander, whos known for her outstanding research on seed germination in arid Western Australia and the Middle East. Her research has helped the mining industry improve ecological restoration. Effective mine rehabilitation is critical for the mining industry to obtain its social licence to operate.Dr Shani Higginbottom is a researcher scientist for Alcoa and is the lead for the Bayer process research and development. Her work in creating efficiencies in creation of alumina from bauxite will be critical in Australia harnessing our bauxite reserves to their fullest potential.And, finally, Dr Irene Suarez-Martinez is a material scientist with expertise on the chemistry and physics of carbon materials. Shes recently studied the relationship between carbon particles and the greenhouse gas effect. She combines her love of science with fashion, making science outfits with a story. When I met Dr Suarez-Martinez last year at the Science Meets Parliament cocktail reception, she wore a dress representing a crystal lattice structure complete with dislocations to create a form-fitting lattice structure. I thank these rockstar women in STEM in Swan.Despite having legendary examples, the number of women who work in STEM is only 18 per cent. As an engineer with an 18-year career, I know firsthand that we arent using our full talent pool. Women are less likely to head into STEM careers. They are also less likely to stay in STEM careers. I remember one of the mothers from my mothers group telling me her mantra as an academic: publish or perish.Finally, to quote Danielle Wood from the Grattan Institute at the Jobs and Skills Summit:… if untapped womens workforce participation was a massive iron ore deposit, we would have governments falling over themselves to give subsidies to get it out of the ground.I know this has to change, especially in STEM. The Albanese Labor government is listening and we are acting. We are committed to developing pathways for women and girls to enter STEM careers and stay in them. Im proud to be a part of a government that is reviewing women-in-STEM programs to determine whats working and whats not and to widen our talent pool. Last month, Minister Husic announced $15.9 million in new WiSE programs for 17 projects that are supporting more women to study and build careers in STEM.We are ensuring that girls are at the core of our clean energy transition. We are formalising the governments commitment to gender equality in the clean energy transition by signing up to the equal pay, equal leadership and equal opportunity objectives of the global Equal by 30 campaign. This commitment is backed by our governments commitment to make Australia a green industry powerhouse. On Friday, Minister Husic commenced consultation on our National Battery Strategy. Developing this strategy will be critical to our transition to decarbonise our economy, hit our targets and foster innovation and industry. This will mean more STEM jobs for women.

I am always delighted when women in the Australian parliament stand on a unity ticket on gender equality.As we approach the International Day of Women and Girls in Science, I am thrilled to be able to stand here today to recognise and, indeed, celebrate the Novocastrian women and girls studying, working and leading in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. The Albanese Labor government is taking action to drive gender equality across the board, including STEM, where women are persistently underrepresented.I want to congratulate the University of Newcastle for being a successful recipient in the federal governments Women in STEM Cadetships and Advanced Apprenticeships program. This initiative is creating an extra 267 places at universities across Australia for women and girls in STEM. In Newcastle, its funding 19 cadetships in STEM for women to undertake a diploma through the College of Engineering, Science and Environment. Its an innovative program to support women to study part time while theyre continuing their careers, and it comes at a vital time for Newcastle, as we are strengthening our position as a clean energy hub. The Albanese government understands that it is crucial to embed gender equality as we decarbonise the economy.I want to highlight a few initiatives running at the University of Newcastle. The Women in STEM Mentoring Program is doing a terrific job connecting undergraduate students with industry professionals and alumni. We all know the value that comes from hearing from someone with lived experience, and this program helps students to create professional networks while theyre studying, explore opportunities, and develop personal and professional skills. The Female Founders Program is another free 12-week program, a course that acts as a springboard for female founders in the startup community. It provides access to a supportive professional network, industry experts and peer-to-peer learning.A big shout-out goes to HunterWiSE, who run a 10-week school outreach program for girls in year 8, as well as networking events for female STEM professionals across the Hunter. HunterWiSE was established in 2017 by seven extraordinary academics at the University of Newcastle, with the aim of increasing the number of women entering the STEM pipeline and retaining women pursuing careers in STEM industries and disciplines. One of its founders, Professor Anna Giacomini, was recently awarded a New South Wales Premiers Prize for Science and Engineering. Professor Giacomini has been working in rock mechanics and civil engineering for more than 20 years. She is particularly focused on improving safety of major transport and infrastructure networks along the coastline. Congratulations, Professor, we need you and many more extraordinary women like you working on those problems that persist for Australians—big, big projects.And because its never too early to actually get into science, I would like to acknowledge and congratulate the Little Scientists program, which runs in four preschools around Newcastle. I was thrilled to celebrate with KU Mayfield preschool when they became certified with Little Scientists in 2017. Its fantastic to see young children learn, through playing in mud and outdoor activities, about all the wonders and joys of our everyday world. They learn very quickly that science is just part of our everyday life, not some special category that only boys get to do and enjoy later in life. So I look forward to seeing a whole new generation of extraordinary women and girls coming up through the ranks to take on some of those big, big challenges for us as communities, for us as a global network.So happy International Day of Women and Girls in Science this Saturday. I look forward to celebrating your astounding contributions to our nation.","International Day of Women and Girls in Science","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms CLAYDON (Newcastle—Deputy Speaker) ","(11:16):"
"0","0","0","1","2","Archer, Bridget MP","282237","Bass","LP","N/A","140"," Ahead of the International Day of Women and Girls in Science this Saturday, 11 February, Im pleased to stand today to join my colleagues in supporting the day, which aims to promote the full and equal access and participation of females in innovation, science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Id also like to commend the member for McPherson for the considerable work she undertook as the former Minister for Industry, Science and Technology in implementing policies to advance women in these fields.The traditional thinking that girls simply do not perform as well as boys in maths and science is antiquated and untrue. The OECDs program for international student assessment in 2018 indicated that girls performed on a similar level to boys in maths and science but on a much higher level in reading and had stronger performance across humanities in general, which is perhaps the reason why females tend to pursue studies in these areas over STEM. With women making up only 36 per of enrolments in university STEM courses and just 16 per cent of enrolments in vocational STEM courses, the tide has been slow to turn. As the education system looks to how to further engage and encourage female students to pursue STEM subjects so, too, must the workplace. The Advancing Women in STEM report noted the following:The causes of the inequality in STEM participation are broad, complex and long-standing. Cultural issues such as bias and stereotyping shape girls and womens views of STEM from an early age. STEM working environments, which are often male dominated and can have strongly hierarchical natures, can support a higher risk of issues such as sexual harassment.In northern Tasmania, a female scientist recently shared with me the challenges she faced in the workplace that accurately represents some of the findings found in the coalitions report. A brilliant mind with a passion for her work, this constituent, who prefers to remain anonymous, battled what she called obstructive and challenging behaviour from male superiors, including being told, This is why we dont hire young females, after suffering hyperemesis while pregnant. In another meeting, she spoke up for a colleague after it was openly discussed whether the colleague should be trained in X because shes at an age now where she will surely go off and have a family soon, so it wouldnt be a good investment. While receiving support from some superiors, the discrimination faced by my constituent due to both of her gender and her disability as someone living with multiple sclerosis eventually led her to leave the job and the field entirely. I do know this would not be the experience of every female working in science, but its clearly not just the exception at this point and it perfectly illustrates why this years theme of promoting equal access and participation of females in STEM is so important.For local northern Tasmanians working in STEM or looking to pursue a career in the area, a fantastic group of women have created a group who call themselves the Launceston STEMinists. Comprising of geologists, viticulturalists, optometrists, natural science experts, physicists, technologists, science educators and PhD students, the group meets casually to discuss challenges and successes in working in the STEM field. Unfortunately, the experience of many of these women also highlights the lack of progress science and engineering fields have made in supporting women who also choose to have a family, acknowledging that stepping away to take maternity leave in these competitive fields risks coming back to less-than-desirable career options. And, while the support of other women is necessary, the STEMinists are spot-on when they discuss the importance of men taking on more active roles. Its not women who need to go to diversity lunches, says geologist Claire Mawdesley.In recent years, employers and organisations have been turning their minds to how to proactively support the pathways for girls and women looking to pursue studies and employment in these fields. In 2017, Science & Technology Australia launched Superstars of STEM, described as a game-changing initiative to smash gender assumptions about who can work in science, technology, engineering and maths. As part of the program, recipients receive training and development in using social media and gaining media coverage and speaking opportunities to share their work and inspire others to follow in their footsteps. One of the first superstars chosen was my own regions Dr Fiona Kerslake, a viticultural researcher and a member of the Launceston STEMinists. As a mum of a daughter, Dr Kerslake admitted that shes hopeful that the program will not be necessary when it comes to her own daughter choosing a career. I want her to go into any field and gender not be an issue, Dr Kerslake said.Finally, you cant be what you cant see. To all the women in STEM of today, thank you for paving the path for the women and girls that will follow.","International Day of Women and Girls in Science","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs ARCHER (Bass) ","(11:21):"
"0","0","0","1","2","Repacholi, Dan MP","298840","Hunter","ALP","N/A","141"," I rise today to speak on the motion moved by the member for McPherson. Id like to begin by thanking the honourable member for raising a topic that is so important. The International Day of Women and Girls in Science is on 11 February this year. The day gives recognition to the amazing contributions that women and girls have made and continue to make in science. But it also brings attention to the fact that, for far too long, far too few women have had the opportunity to make their mark in an industry which has not been as supportive or open to them as it traditionally has been for men. But this is beginning to change, and I say its about time. I hope not only that days such as International Day of Women and Girls in Science can serve as a way to recognise what has been achieved by women; I also hope that they can act as an encouragement to all women, especially young girls, to go out and pursue whatever they are interested in and whatever they are passionate about. There should be no barriers to opportunities that are available to you.Elizabeth Blackburn is just one example of an Australian woman who has made a significant impact in science and has helped shape the modern medical world. Elizabeth Blackburn made a scientific discovery far beyond my ability to comprehend that has significantly impacted cancer research and ageing research. She went on to win the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, making her the first Australian woman to do so. It is women like this that the International Day of Women and Girls in Science is all about, and I want to see more girls encouraged to go on and change the world, just like Elizabeth Blackburn did. This is part of making a better future for Australia.Our world has advanced rapidly in recent decades, largely on the back of science. Its sad to think that, in this time, many women found it hard to have the chance to make their mark. Imagine how much our country and world will advance when were harnessing the minds and intellect of all who have a passion and interest, without letting someones gender have a say in whether or not their ideas are worthy. Opportunities for both men and women in all industries and all fields create opportunities for our country—opportunities for incredible advancements in health and technology, just to name a couple, and this means that we have the opportunity to build a better future. And it is this party, the Labor Party, and this Labor government who are champions of opportunity for women in this country. As everyone in this place would be aware, we have a record number of women on the front bench, and we are very proud to have had the first female Prime Minister, hopefully the first of many more to come over future decades. Its not only science that women have made amazing contributions to; its also the fields of technology, engineering and mathematics, which they offer so much to.As Ive already mentioned many times in this place, Im a proud father of Zoe and Asha. I want my girls, and all other girls and women, to have the same opportunities as anyone else in this country. In my first speech in this place, I promised that I would fight every day to make sure that we have a more equal and fair society to pass on to future generations. This includes the areas of science, technology, engineering and maths.Women have made incredible contributions in all aspects of STEM. It is important to recognise and celebrate that. But it is also vital that we acknowledge the sad reality that women have been underrepresented in these areas and there are still huge improvements that need to be made, and Im proud to be part of a government that is committed to equality for all.","International Day of Women and Girls in Science","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr REPACHOLI (Hunter) ","(11:26):"
"0","0","0","1","2","Ware, Jenny MP","300123","Hughes","LP","N/A","142"," I commend this motion put forward by the member for McPherson. What does the International Day of Women and Girls in Science on 11 February have in common with the philosophy of Plato from 376 BC? This international day is about two things. First, the day aims to promote the full and equal access and participation of females in innovation, science, technology, engineering and mathematics—STEM, as it is known. Plato did not, to my knowledge, avail himself of acronyms in his writings. He was, however—most unusually for the times—a proponent of womens education. He said:If women are expected to do the same work as men, we must teach them the same things.That was in 376 BC.Full and equal participation in science and technology for females necessarily begins with Australian girls within our education system. Women can play a vital role in ensuring diversity in research, expanding the pool of talented researchers and bringing in fresh perspectives to the STEM sector. However, our statistics both in Australia and across the world demonstrate that women are underrepresented within this sector. Globally, around 30 per cent of researchers are women, who are awarded less research funding than men. Women account for just 22 per cent of professionals working in artificial intelligence and 28 per cent of engineering graduates. In the private sector, women are less present in company leadership and in technical roles, particularly in tech industries. These glaring underrepresentations limit our ability to find inclusive, sustainable solutions to modern problems.In my electorate of Hughes, women are taking leadership positions and heading up research within the STEM sector, particularly at organisations such as ANSTO. Our local schools are focusing on encouraging our girls to love science and technology from a young age and then to pursue a career within those technologies.International Day of Women and Girls in Science is also about celebrating those women that have led and are leading scientific action and innovation around the world. Despite the statistics mentioned, women have made remarkable contributions to science and technology throughout history. I take this opportunity to mention a couple of our better-known female scientists: Marie Curie, who won two Nobel prizes in physics and chemistry for her pioneering research on radioactivity; Rosalind Franklin, who brought her physics and chemistry expertise to London coal, where she investigated the properties of carbon during World War II; Ada Lovelace, who worked on the first proposed mechanical general-purpose computer way back in the 1840s; and Barbara McClintock, who won a Nobel Prize for her discovery of jumping genes.Now Ill turn particularly to Australias two Fionas: Fiona Stanley, who won a Nobel Prize for her work in researching maternal and child health, particularly the prevention of neurodefects in unborn babies, and Fiona Wood, for her pioneering research and technology development in burns medicine. She developed the spray-on skin treatment, in which healthy cells are sprayed onto a burn wound. Australians will clearly remember the assistance given to the Bali bombing patients by Dr Fiona Wood.I also acknowledge Dr Cathy Foley, who is currently Australias Chief Scientist. Her best known project is the development of a superconducting sensor that can detect and map deposits of silver, gold and nickel very deep underground. Having a female chief scientist is very important in leading the way for Australian girls and women in science and technology, because you cannot be what you cannot see. Women have played a critical role in the development and progress of science and technology. By working together we can create a more inclusive and welcoming environment in all STEM fields. We can help unleash the full potential of women in these fields and drive the innovation and progress that will shape our world for generations to come.I give support and thanks to all of our Australian girls and women who are currently studying or working in the science and technology fields, and I commend the member for McPherson for this motion.","International Day of Women and Girls in Science","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms WARE (Hughes) ","(11:30):"
"0","0","0","1","2","Mitchell, Brian MP","129164","Lyons","ALP","N/A","142"," Im pleased to have this opportunity to recognise the International Day of Women and Girls in Science, which is coming up on Saturday 11 February, and the amazing contribution of Australian women to science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Of course, these play a major part in Tasmania and in the electorate of Lyons in particular, in the salmon industry, UTAS and the observatory in my electorate, and across agriculture and medicine. These are all really important fields.The Albanese government is taking action to drive gender equality, including through supporting women in STEM. From the early days of our government, at the Jobs and Skills Summit, we have made clear that gender equality is an economic imperative, and this means ensuring that women and girls are benefiting from the STEM jobs that continue to emerge across our transitioning economy. In addition to targeted measures supporting women and girls in STEM, the government is developing a national strategy to achieve gender equality and to drive action on gender equality. The strategy will provide a road map for whole-of-community action to achieve gender equality and will act as a framework for changes to policy and budgeting processes required to drive it in Australia. Of course, the Albanese government is putting its money where its mouth is, investing $5.8 million in the October budget to support a more diverse STEM workforce. This includes funding to undertake a review of women in STEM programs to determine whats working and whats not so as to widen our talent pipeline.Its frankly a disgrace that women make up only 16 per cent of people with STEM qualifications, and our government is determined to ensure that improves. Our review will help us find what works here and overseas and find out where the gaps are to deliver a more diverse and representative STEM workforce. By widening the talent pipeline we will increase our share in the global economy, which will help us to address the skills shortage. The review will assist with the governments goal to achieve 1.2 million tech related workers by 2030. Our investment also includes $4.7 million to support oversubscribed programs for community and industry led projects, like the Women in STEM and Entrepreneurship program, and research undertaken by the Women in STEM Ambassador.In January 2023 Minister Husic announced $15.9 million in new WISE program grants for 17 projects that are supporting more women to study and build careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. This builds on other important initiatives that seek to raise the profile of women in STEM, such as Science & Technology Australias Superstars of STEM program and the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences & Engineering Elevate scholarships.As we recognise the International Day of Women and Girls in Science on Saturday and the amazing contribution of Australian women in the STEM field, I want to give a shout-out to the STEM for Girls organisation thats based in St Helens on the east coast of my electorate. STEM for Girls is a volunteer run organisation which aims to foster a robust STEM education that encourages girls and young women in the community to become critical thinkers, problem-solvers and the innovators of the upcoming generation. STEM for Girls runs workshops across a variety of STEM activities, including coding and programming, engineering, science investigations, computer hardware, maths problem-solving and modelling, food science technology and Lego robotics, just to name a few. At the end of last year STEM for Girls participated in Australias First Lego League challenge, a robotics competition held around the world that promotes science, technology, engineering and maths. Samvrtha, Tahlea, Dolly and Jackson undertook research, problem-solving, coding and engineering tasks, building and programming a Lego robot, and they did a stellar job, with the team receiving the rising All-Star award, a fantastic achievement.We know women are terribly underrepresented across STEM fields, and speakers today have enunciated some of the reasons and the impacts that has on women. Organisations like STEM for Girls play such an important role in our communities, providing opportunities for young women and girls to engage with STEM, showing them the possibilities and giving them confidence to potentially pursue further study and careers in fields which they might not have pursued otherwise and which are so important for both our culture and our economy in the years ahead.","International Day of Women and Girls in Science","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BRIAN MITCHELL (Lyons) ","(11:35):"

"0","0","0","1","2","Smith, David MP","276714","Bean","ALP","N/A","143"," I move:That this House:(1) notes that:(a) in May 2022 Australians voted for a plan for cheaper child care; and(b) on 23 November 2022, the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Cheaper Child Care) Bill 2022 passed the Parliament;(2) commends the Government for meeting its election commitment to the Australian people;(3) further notes that:(a) the reforms will deliver affordable early education for more than a million families;(b) from July 2022, approximately 96 per cent of families with a child in early childhood education and care will benefit;(c) from July 2022, the child care subsidy for families earning $80,000 or less will increase to 90 per cent; and(d) Treasury modelling shows that this will deliver the equivalent of up to 37,000 workers to the economy in the first year; and(4) acknowledges that these reforms will deliver real cost-of-living relief while boosting productivity.On 22 May last year, the people of Australia voted for a plan for cheaper childhood education. By 23 November last year, the parliament approved this plan, and the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Cheaper Child Care) Bill 2022 became law. The Albanese government is getting on with the job of delivering cost-of-living relief for Australian families across the country. From 1 July this year, more than a million families will be able to access more affordable early childhood education. Over the last eight years, we have seen early childhood education costs increase by 41 per cent, putting pressure on already struggling families and risking the future of our kids early education. But at the centre of the first Albanese government budget was a $4.5 billion investment in early childhood care. This is not just an education reform; this has material economic benefits for our economy and social benefits for our people.Last year, 73,000 people who wanted to work didnt look for work. This was because of the prohibitive costs of early childhood education—prohibitive costs that affect constituents in Bean. Parents, especially mums, will now be able to take on more paid work hours. This will have wider benefits for the economy, particularly in its recovery following the disruptions caused by COVID-19. Treasury modelling shows that this will deliver the equivalent of up to 37,000 workers to the economy in its first year alone.From 1 July this year, the childhood education subsidy for families earning $80,000 or less will increase to 90 per cent. These changes will provide household budget relief for families struggling with the rising cost of living. Further, the measures will contribute to the governments gender equality agenda and support childrens school readiness and long-term outcomes by reducing cost barriers to accessing early childhood education and care.There are 47 early childhood education centres in my electorate of Bean, ranging from the Coombs Early Learning Centre to Jenny Wren in Mawson to the wonderful Wonderschools in Phillip and Conder. Its good to know that mums and dads in my electorate will now be able to send their children to these centres for more hours when they are needed. And lets not forget the children. These reforms will also promote the rights of children and the best interests of children, by increasing access to high-quality early childhood education and care.This government will work with state and territory education and early childhood education ministers through National Cabinet to develop a long-term vision and collaborate on opportunities to support better outcomes across the system, with a particular focus on the early childhood education and care workforce. Evidence shows that early childhood education and care, when delivered in a quality setting, is a key protective factor and positively relates to childrens developmental outcomes. Access to quality early childhood education is known to reduce vulnerability and improve early childhood development.Theres also a plan to ensure that early childhood education will have a steady supply of educators to support its growth. Over 1,400 additional university places for early education teachers, along with additional fee-free TAFE courses, will complement this legislation. Additionally, those applying for working visas in the early education space will be prioritised. This will secure a supply of early educators.There will also be an increase in hours of subsidised care available for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. All First Nations children will be able to gain access to 36 hours of subsidised early childhood education. Nationally, this will benefit more than 6,000 First Nations families and represents a positive step in our efforts to close the gap. These reforms also invest $10.2 million to establish the Early Childhood Care and Development Policy Partnership between the Commonwealth and state and territory governments and First Nations representatives.Im proud to be part of the government which is delivering on our election promises and setting up Canberrans and Australians for a better future. This investment means early childhood education will be more affordable for 1.2 million Australian families, and 6,600 families in my electorate of Bean will be better off. This will ensure children can access the benefits of early childhood education no matter their circumstances. This is a big reform that is good for children, good for families, good for our economy and good for early childhood educators, who deliver so much for families across Australia.","Child Care","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr DAVID SMITH (Bean—Government Whip) ","(11:40):"

"0","0","0","1","2","Bell, Angie MP","282981","Moncrieff","LNP","N/A","144"," The member for Bean talks a big game, which of course is a prerequisite of being a Labor Party member these days because Labor just loves to talk about how great they are and how great their policies are and how everything will be better under Labor. Its a rosy picture. Labor loves to sell the Australian people a fantasy, usually too good to be true, and we know that things that are too good to be true usually are. When I look at this governments early childhood education policy, thats what I see. When they come into government, they realise that they have to make all that fantasy a reality, and then they panic because they simply dont actually have a plan to deliver it. Theres a lack of plan, a fantasy with no detail and no real plan for delivery.This government has been full of sweeping statements. Here are just a couple of them: No family will be worse off. Fees wont increase—now theres a promise Im going to hold them to! This policy wont have an effect on inflation. What are we seeing with inflation, people? Up it goes. Well have enough workers in the sector to meet demand. But they havent done the work. They havent done any work to back up any of those statements.I ask the government where the plan is to deliver additional access for families living in childcare deserts. There are nine million of them across the country, and what is the government doing to ensure that those families can access early childhood education? Well, dont worry. That was a rhetorical question, because we know what the answer is and it is that they are doing nothing. Those nine million Australians simply dont have extra access under this legislation.What is the government doing to address the rising costs? Well, the latest CPI data shows costs increasing by a whopping 4.5 per cent in December 2022. Thats the largest quarterly increase outside the reversal of COVID measures since 2007. Already weve seen CPI going through the roof.Fees are going up. One major provider announced that they would increase their fees last month, and its only a matter of time before other providers follow suit. We know what that means. That means that a lot of this money thats coming through—$4.7 billion in July—could be lost simply to price rises and to inflation. How will the government ensure that, come July this year, families arent immediately—due to those price rises—losing a portion of their higher subsidy to those increased fees? They cant guarantee it, because its already happening. Thats another rhetorical question, because they just dont have a plan for that either. Theyve got the ACCC doing a review of the sector, but thats not due to report back until the end of the year, which means they wont do anything to address those rising fees until perhaps next year, 2024.While were here asking for details, Im sure that educators across the country would really love to know what the governments plan is to address their very real concerns. Ive been speaking with educators, as I do, and theyre tired, theyre overworked and theyre feeling underappreciated. What is the government doing to support them? Again, its a rhetorical question. The answer is: nothing. They will point to fee-free TAFE places and university courses, but that doesnt help educators in the sector right here and right now, doing a job that will only get more stressful come July when more families try to enrol their children. I was at a childcare centre in my electorate just at the end of last week. Its a brand-new childcare centre. Its huge—massive—and its a beautiful, beautiful place. They have over 400 people on the waiting list right now. Is this $4.7 billion package going to help them to shorten that waiting list? I dont think so. The government doesnt have a plan to address access and it doesnt have a plan to address rising costs, and theres no plan to address the educator concerns. Its hard to see how this policy is going to deliver all the things that the government, again, has promised it will.We in the coalition have a strong record when it comes to delivering for Australian families. During our time in government, we doubled investment in the ECE sector, to $11 billion in 2022-23. We also did something Labor never did: we delivered ongoing preschool funding. We undertook the biggest reforms to the childcare system in over 40 years. We provided more support to families—targeted support that helped bring down the cost of care—and 280,000 more children were able to access early childhood education. Thats more places. We saw womens workforce participation reach record highs at 62.3 per cent.

So cheaper education and care is good for children, good for families and good for the economy.My community of Chisholm will benefit enormously from the changes to early education and care. In the electorate I represent in Victoria, the number of families who access child care is among the highest in the state. In Chisholm alone, 7,200 families will benefit from our changes. Thats the fourth-highest number in the whole of Victoria. So this is incredibly important to me and to the people who sent me here to Canberra to represent them and help build a better future.Around 96 per cent of families across Australia who use early childhood education and care will be better off, because from July this year, only a few months away, the government will lift the maximum childcare subsidy rate to 90 per cent for families with a combined income of under $80,000 and will increase subsidy rates for families earning less than $530,000. Well also keep the higher CCS for families with multiple children aged five years and under in care. Our plan for cheaper child care makes early childhood education and care more affordable for around 1.26 million Australian families, and no family will be worse off. There are real benefits for Australian families, especially when a lot of people are struggling with inflation. A family on a combined income of $120,000 with one child in care will save around $1,780 in the first year of this plan.Childcare costs, unfortunately, increased by 41 per cent under the previous government. Thats a significant burden to families already struggling to make ends meet. We came into government after a decade of wasted opportunities under a government that oversaw enormous increases to the cost of child care and also saw Australia do really badly when it came to gender equity. We, in fact, went backwards in terms of gender equity under the previous government.Our plan for cheaper early childhood education and care will not just ease financial pressure for families but also aid in lifting womens workforce participation. The reality is most primary caregivers and stay-at-home parents are women, and this decision is often partly fuelled by the question of which parent has the higher earning capacity, given the expensive costs of child care. We have a gender pay gap in Australia of 14.1 per cent, and it is often women in feminised industries who are the ones that do worse, both while working in the early childhood education sector and as consumers of it. So Im really proud that our government is not just putting these measures in place but also working to legislate measures to decrease the gender pay gap and to properly value all workers for the work they do. Workers in female dominated industries have persistently earned less historically, and thats despite the fact that workers in these key industries are vital for the functioning of our society.We know our landmark reforms, such as cheaper early childhood education, are only possible if we retain, recruit and train a high-quality workforce, and we have a plan to deliver just that. That begins with the recognition and professionalisation of the workforce—recognising that this is a workforce of educators, not child minders; that these are highly trained experts; and that there is a significant and respected career pathway in the early education sector. After a decade of neglect and inaction from the previous government, were making changes to ensure that we are able to have a sustainable early childhood education workforce and sector.I know our plan is incredibly important to my community, because people in Chisholm tell me that it is. Im here to listen, to advocate, to represent and to work as a member of the Labor government for real solutions for the real issues facing people in my electorate, and Im so proud of what were delivering.","Child Care","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr GARLAND (Chisholm) ","(11:51):"
"0","0","0","1","2","Ware, Jenny MP","300123","Hughes","LP","N/A","146"," I speak on the motion put forward by the member for Bean. In the words of Nelson Mandela, Education is the most powerful weapon we have to change the world. In that context, I rise to speak about child care. Having spoken in this place on several occasions in relation to early education, I am well known to be a strong supporter of continuous improvement in the way that we deliver early preschool education and child care in Australia. We can always do better in the way we care for and educate Australian children in those formative years before they enter the school system.Whilst this legislation does provide a childcare subsidy for some Australian families, continuous improvement in early education means more than just making child care cheaper. It is about the quality of the child care thats being provided. Its about ensuring effective school-readiness programs are in place. Its about ensuring that there is access for parents in rural and remote communities. Its about ensuring that there are places in sufficient number and of sufficient variety to enable parents to have choice in the form of child care. Most importantly, it is about empowering a sustainable, high-quality workforce of teachers providing early education that is highly valued and respected by the broader Australian community.It is well known that access to quality childcare places significantly increases the participation rates of women in the workforce. When Australian women do well, their families do well, and our nation does well. It is, therefore, vitally important that we do child care well. Child care is a major cost outlay for families, including for those in my electorate of Hughes, where we have 7,810 childcare spaces. To that end, I support incentives that assist parents both in my electorate and throughout Australia to pay for high-quality child care.However, with this legislation the Albanese government has missed an important opportunity to reform child care throughout Australia to foster a sustainable and high-quality workforce of early childhood educators—an opportunity missed by the Albanese government to implement the National Childrens Education and Care Workforce Strategy. The development of this national strategy was endorsed as a joint partnership by all governments and the childrens education and care sector in 2019. It was released in August last year. It has considerable support in this place. For example, I note that the member for Fowler is also calling for its implementation.Contemporary best-practice childcare policy is more than providing subsidies to parents, as important as that may be. Childcare policy is not just about child minding. Childcare policy is not just about childrens entertainment. It is about recognising that childrens education and care is an essential public service. It is about recognising and empowering those that work in the sector supporting childrens early learning, development and wellbeing. It enables parents and carers to work, including during natural disasters and national emergencies.The National Childrens Education and Care Workforce Strategy focuses on delivery of a highly skilled, well-supported and professionally recognised workforce. It focuses on leadership and building capacity, empowering those that work within the childcare sector. It addresses how to retain and attract staff within the sector. It addresses the engagement, satisfaction and wellbeing of the early learning workforce. It establishes clear career pathways for these workers. It is a strategy that needs to be implemented.The National Childrens Education and Care Workforce Strategy opens with a simple, powerful statement:Education has the power to transform lives.Let us begin that transformation in this place. I call upon the Albanese government to implement the National Childrens Education and Care Workforce Strategy.","Child Care","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms WARE (Hughes) ","(11:56):"
"0","0","0","1","2","Laxale, Jerome MP","299174","Bennelong","ALP","N/A","147"," Id like to thank the member for Bean for bringing this motion to the chamber. If theres one thing that has been the hallmark of this government in its first six months, its been our determination and drive to deliver on the promise to reduce the costs of child care and early education—one of a suite of policies we took to the election to reduce the cost of living. More than 1.2 million Australian families, approximately 9,400 of them in my electorate of Bennelong, will be able to access more affordable early childhood education because the Albanese Labor government has gotten on with the job. We said we would decrease the cost of child care, and we will. This is one of many commitments that will reduce the cost of living and provide tangible results for Australian families.The Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Cheaper Child Care) Bill 2022 will remove the barriers to early childhood care that Australian families have faced for years. It will help ease the cost of living in the face of staggering increases in childcare costs under the previous government. It will ensure that all children can benefit from receiving quality early childhood education, and it will mean that all First Nations children will be able to gain access to 36 hours of subsidised child care a fortnight. This is another massive step towards universal and free access to early childhood education, something that Im proud to say is a long-term goal of the party I represent.Bennelong is full of young families raising their children in our local community. These families, like many across the nation, are really struggling with the cost of living. In Bennelong, the median age is 37, and 40 per cent of people rent. We have nearly 10,000 families who will benefit from this policy. Thats the second-highest number across the nation of families per electorate that will benefit. This is a policy that helps families in Bennelong, and its one that they voted for, because the cost of living is one of the biggest issues that is raised with me when Im out and about in the electorate. For many families in Bennelong, the cost of early childhood education forms a huge part of the family budget. When I speak to parents about the costs of child care, many say that they have become prohibitive and too high for them to reconcile. Under the former government, costs of child care went up by 41 per cent in eight years.These are parents like Fabio in Ryde, who reached out to me recently. He was concerned that the cost of child care was eating into his family budget too much. For a family like his, well increase rebates to a maximum of 90 per cent for the lowest income bracket and increase rebate percentages across the board for all income brackets. Child care will be cheaper for Fabio.Then theres Sanjana from Gladesville, who contacted me because she and her husband were recently knocked out of the subsidy limit because of a hard earned increase in their household income. They now earn more than the current system allows—a huge flaw in the system. I dont think families should be penalised for earning more, not on the cost of child care. But weve fixed that problem. Well increase the income limit to $530,000 for families, up from $356,000, meaning that more families will be eligible to receive the rebate and more families will be able to earn more without penalty. Millions of families will benefit from these changes and none will be worse off. Families like these and many more in Bennelong and throughout Australia will benefit from this governments hard work, and our economy will benefit from having more men and women back in the workforce.We know that we need more people in the workforce. Weve got a huge skills shortage. We also know that theres been some evidence which suggests that this policy will help get more people into work. The Grattan Institute estimates that this package will result in eight per cent more hours being worked by second earners with young children. This works out to be about 220,000 extra days worked in Australia every week. Our own Treasury estimates that these measures will increase the hours worked by women with young children by up to 1.4 million hours per week in 2023-24. Thats the equivalent of up to an extra 37,000 full-time workers, which not only makes a real difference to families—meaning they can earn more wages and more super—but makes a huge difference to our economy. This childcare package is one thats good for the nation and good for Bennelong. I thank you for the opportunity.","Child Care","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr LAXALE (Bennelong) ","(12:01):"
"0","0","0","1","2","Stevens, James MP","176304","Sturt","LP","N/A","148"," I rise to speak on the motion and start by noting that the childcare measures that are outlined in this were supported through the parliament by the coalition recently. I commend the contribution by the member for Moncrieff, whos also, of course, the shadow minister in this area, for some of the really concerning issues in child care that she canvassed earlier. What worries me about this motion is some suggestion that everything in child care is now all fine because of the measures that passed in that bill. Thats not the case in any way whatsoever.Like any local member, Im regularly meeting with childcare providers in my electorate. Like any electorate, weve got different operators who have different models. Luckily, in metropolitan Adelaide, I dont have any childcare deserts—the term that is used in my electorate—though access is difficult for families in my electorate. We have issues around waiting lists and the like. But the first point that is really important is that I know there are a lot of regional areas, in particular, that have major issues with any provision of child care whatsoever. The rebate is not relevant to someone who cant access child care at all, and thats a serious equity issue that I hope the government is taking seriously and looking at addressing, because it certainly isnt addressed in the measures that went through the parliament recently.In my electorate—and I know this is a problem nationally—all the providers say exactly the same thing when it comes to workforce challenges: they have enormous issues in attracting and retaining staff. If the forecasts of the success of this package are to be realised, and all these extra hours of work are going to be possible because all these extra people are going into child care, then Im very worried about where the workforce is going to come from to support those extra places. This is a really serious issue. Its a serious issue across the care sector more broadly, as we all know, whether its in the childcare sector or in aged care, disability et cetera.The other thing thats a really dramatic challenge in those workforce areas is inflation running as hot as it is right now. Commitments around pay increases are being completely eroded by the hot-running inflation that we are experiencing at the moment. Seven point eight per cent inflation year on year is way more than 15 per cent in two years. Even if you got, over two years, a 15 per cent pay rise, which is not necessarily the proposition across all the sectors, youre going backwards in real terms if inflation is sitting at 7.8 per cent. So weve got a workforce challenge at a time when the governments own policies would see the real wages of people in these sectors go backwards. Thats not going to encourage or help to address or alleviate those pressures.We think we need a very urgent workforce plan for this sector, which, frankly, needs to stitch together a whole range of other sectors that have the same challenges, because if we dont have the workforce in place to support the childcare centres and other care requirements in our economy then all these other policies wont be able to achieve the outcomes they promise. Thats not political pointscoring at all. It would be good if we could all work together on these challenges, frankly, because they are going to require some very significant lateral thinking, which is probably going to have to be tailored, particularly on a geographic basis, because I know that the challenges of workforce in some of our regional and remote communities can be very different from the challenges in metropolitan areas.So I—like anyone in this chamber, hopefully—am very supportive of making sure that all families in this country have the best possible access to child care and that were providing that access so that everyone who wants to can get that access and participate in the economy as they would like to. But, of course, its not as easy as the government makes out, and weve got to make sure that some of those very significant issues around equity of access and workforce are addressed. It would be good for the government, rather than just congratulating themselves on what theyve done, to tell us what theyre going to do to address those problems in the future.

"0","0","0","1","2","Lim, Sam MP","300130","Tangney","ALP","N/A","148"," Im so proud of this government. Im filled with a sense of hope, and I am passionate for all the things to come from this government. In less than a year, this government has rewritten the history books on how much any government can care for and help Australian families. This government chooses to work hard and work tirelessly for the sake of improving the lives of Australians and their children. This government delivers to its citizens cost-of-living relief that you can see and feel. You can see it as more wages in the bank. You can see it as more women working. You can see it as more full-time employment. It is not tax cuts for wealthy mates or punching down on struggling Australians to pass up the savings to those who dont need them. The Albanese Labor government is delivering an investment—the equivalent of 37,000 jobs—by ensuring more primary caregivers can work. It is an investment that puts in the hands of Australians the opportunity to work hard, to progress their careers and to have peace of mind that their children are receiving first-class education and care.In my electorate of Tangney, 5,600 families are better off and more able to get on with the job by putting food on the table and not having to choose how to cut their working hours to be able to afford early childhood education and care. They are not having to pick between one partners career and anothers. They are not having to choose to give up or to go without. They are choosing to have quality child care that is affordable—child care that is cheaper than it would have been under the last government.In the last eight years, the cost of early childhood education has increased by over 40 per cent for the average family. This government is doing what those opposite would not: delivering cost-of-living relief that means Australian families this generation and next will be better off. These changes mean that more than a million families across Australia can afford a double parental income, they afford single-parent households breathing space when opening bills and they are a step further to assuring them that there will always be bread on the table.Im delighted to be part of a government that is ambitious for its people, that looks at an issue and decides as much as we are able to that theres much that we would dare to do. Were a government that works hard, like parents of children, to try to make sure that every child prospers and succeeds and is afforded a wonderful life because their parents have the means and their children can access quality early learning in the critical years of their development. This is a government that works tirelessly, and Im so proud that what this government works on is ensuring that families and children in Australia have a future thats taken care of. From child care to Medicare to aged care, it has been Labor governments that cared and did the heavy lifting. I love my electorate and I love every person who has ever called Tangney home, does call Tangney home and will call Tangney home. My job is to make sure Tangney is a wonderful place to live, and, because of this governments cheaper child care, 5,600 families in Tangney are better off and many more will be for many years to come.","Child Care","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr LIM (Tangney) ","(12:11):"
"0","0","0","1","2","Marino, Nola Bethwyn MP","HWP","Forrest","LP","N/A","149"," As has been said, as an opposition we supported the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Cheaper Child Care) Bill 2022. But I want to focus on one of the issues raised by the member for Moncrieff for the government to consider, given this childcare legislation and potential future childcare legislation, and that is the question: who have you forgotten? Weve heard about issues around access and workforce, and so I ask: who is not covered by your childcare legislation, and where will the additional 9,000 people needed to fill the extra demand actually come from? Having the places available or not having the places available but simply increasing the rebate that will increase the amount of time that children will spend in child care will require additional staff. Where will the 9,000 people needed to fill the extra demand for those extra days actually come from? Where is the plan that the government should have for the thin markets that exist in rural and remote areas?Im a proud rural member of this place. Many of the families who are desperate for child care live in regional and more remote parts of Australia, and they are equally desperate to get child care for their children. But there isnt funding in this bill for additional places. The funding is for existing places. Where is the funding for those additional places that are desperately needed and the services that are desperately needed? As I said, not one cent has been allocated to additional childcare places. Weve heard about childcare deserts and that 50 per cent of areas that need those extra childcare places are in rural, regional and remote parts of Australia. I have regional, remote and rural areas in my patch, and I want particularly to focus on one today, and that is the Augusta area.Augusta is a tiny town, and I want to acknowledge the years of work put in by Kylie Lucas, Jasmine Meagher and the other fabulous women and mothers who have been trying to get child care in Augusta. Their first goal was to have a facility so that the community would be able to offer child care in such a centre, and Ive been assisting them through that process. They were seeking support from the Augusta-Margaret River shire to upgrade a facility so as to offer child care in the first instance, but there hasnt been a serious commitment to this. In the absence of serious funding from the local government for this childcare facility, I suggested that they use the funding provided by the federal government through the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program that we put in place, and that the funding be used for this purpose. I note that Labor has not provided the phase 3 extension, funded by the coalition in our last budget, to these local governments at this point. So that isnt an avenue thats currently available for the Augusta Margaret River shire and for these wonderful women to be able to provide child care for their children in Augusta for the first time.So I ask the government: when these families get their facility once those premises are available, when will they be able to access the childcare subsidy? Its not available under this legislation. However, this legislation contains childcare fee support for families earning up to $530,000 a year. Now, how do I explain that, and how does the government explain that, to the families who cant access child care at all? Thats another question that Labor needs to answer around whos missing out in this legislation. And childcare fees may have increased since they introduced their legislation. So Ill keep working with those mothers and the families in Augusta.

The rapid rise in technology has dramatically transformed the way we live, work and do business.The former Australian Liberal federal government made significant contributions to the growth and development of the digital economy. These initiatives have paved the way for a bright future and have positioned Australia as a leader in the digital world.This may be a first for federal parliament, but that last paragraph came directly from artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT. Thats the reality of the world we now live in. We have access to next-level technology such as AI chatbots that allow us to ask questions and get instant answers that are scarily human-like. The digital economy has taken the world we knew and transformed it entirely, and a lot of this was done under the previous coalition government. After all, it was the previous coalition government who introduced the very first minister for the digital economy. Despite the string of cyberattacks in late 2022 and the untold opportunities that the digital economy presents, the Albanese Labor government still doesnt have a minister dedicated to improving the digital economy. This is despite Australias peak body for innovation technology, the Australian Information Industry Association, calling for a digital economy minister to be appointed within the Labor cabinet.It was our party that recognised the challenges and opportunities that new technologies present our nation across every sector and every facet of our lives. We knew that change was happening not just on our shores but globally, and we knew that, for Australia to remain ahead, we had to prioritise the growth of the digital economy. Thats why we invested $4.5 billion into the NBN network and over $1.6 billion to support the 2020 Cyber Security Strategy, which strongly focused on increased national cybersecurity awareness.We kept our foot on the digital accelerator to secure our economic recovery from COVID-19. Businesses kept their doors open through finding ways for staff to work remotely. Some moved online and others took advantage of new technology to boost their own productivity. We knew that our increasing connectedness to the online world would outlast the pandemic and remain vital to how we work and interact well into the future. This has proven true, with Australians and businesses still reaping the productivity rewards that come with new technology. The groundwork was set by the previous coalition governments comprehensive strategy to make Australia a top 10 data and digital economy by 2030. To pave the way forward, we invested $3.5 billion in digital initiatives from 2020, from building a digital and cyber workforce to enhancing Australias capabilities in AI and quantum technologies. The coalition government made record investments in telecommunications in regional Australia, including in Casey. But, despite this record investment, more work needs to be done to continue to improve communications in regional Australia.The digital economy isnt just about private enterprise; it also plays an important role in government services. The previous government recognised myGov as critical national infrastructure. We invested over $200 million into myGov for the two-year enhanced myGov program. This was applauded in the recent myGov user audit. Testing suggests that myGov can now support half a million concurrent users, 50 times more than it did previously. It also found that hundreds of thousands of Australians are currently excluded from setting up digital identities, and its slow progress on legislation has restricted wider uptake.The myGov audit found there is a risk of myGov becoming an empty shell without ongoing funding certainties. Our dedicated minister for the digital economy worked on the ground to ensure our digital world continued to progress to keep our country globally competitive. It makes you wonder: how does the Albanese Labor government plan to continue growing our digital economy? How will our digital economy continue to flourish when the government cant even dedicate a minister to work in this space? They dedicate a minister for the republic when its not even on the agenda for discussion, but they wont have a minister for the digital economy. Its time the Albanese government dedicated a minister with the right skill set to take the lead on our digital economy. Its our future thats at stake.","Digital Economy","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr VIOLI (Casey) ","(12:21):"

I wrote this one myself.This is a government thats committed to delivering a robust, inclusive and sustainable future, and the digital economy is a central pillar to achieving this. Research from the industry peak body, the Tech Council of Australia, found that the tech sector contributes $167 billion per annum to the economy, its the third-biggest industry in Australia and it employs nearly 861,000 Australians—that is, one in 16 working Australians work in tech related employment. Since 2005, tech jobs have grown by 66 per cent compared to an average jobs growth rate of 35 per cent across the economy. By 2030, the tech sector activity has potential to contribute more GDP in Australia than primary industries or manufacturing. And tech jobs grew more than twice as fast as average employment in the last decade.Members would be pleased to know that Bennelong is the home of tech jobs in Australia. We have one of the highest concentrations of tech workers in the country; over 18,000 men and women in Bennelong are working in the tech industry. And even within the electorate, and in particular in Macquarie Park, we have one of Australias largest and most thriving tech economies. Its the second-largest business district in New South Wales, the eighth-largest economy in Australia, and home to tech giants like Foxtel, Optus and a swathe of medtech and pharmaceutical companies where nearly every job involves technology and digitisation.Thats something Id like to highlight: the digital economy is here. Were living in it. You read this motion and you hear the debate from the member for Casey, the previous speaker, and you think that digitisation is something to come. The member is speaking of the digital economy like hes literally just discovered it, that hes just the tapped its potential right here in the chamber and unlocked its benefits. Thankfully, this government understands the potential of tech jobs and recognises its value in our economy today and also into the future. We know that tech jobs are well-paid jobs. We know that tech jobs are flexible jobs. And we know that we need to attract more and more tech workers to the industry and, with that, we need to train them and we need to ensure that female and First Nations participation in tech jobs are part of a vibrant tech community.Having worked in a family-owned business for a long time, I can assure you that the digital economy is the economy. Its not something thats coming; its not a future prospect; its here now. We are living in it. Its part of our everyday lives. And the thriving small businesses in my electorate of Bennelong know this too. They understand that every aspect of our economy and world is driven by digital technology and they have been adapting to it for years—as we saw during the COVID pandemic.The government understands the importance of a strong digital economy and is hard at work building the strong foundations it needs to thrive. Were investing in the digital economy and tech-enabling infrastructure. There are just a couple of things Id like to point out, particularly for small businesses right across Australia. We will work with them to deliver these goals. Weve got the technology investment boost. Businesses with an aggregated turnover of less than $50 million will be able to deduct an additional 20 per cent of the cost incurred on business expenses by depreciating assets that support digital adoption, such as portable payment devices, cybersecurity systems or subscriptions to cloud based services. This is a huge investment by the federal government in the digital economy and in helping small businesses across the nation to further invest in technology for their small business and in digitising their small business as well.Weve identified a skill shortage in the sector. So well also address this, with a small business skills and training boost. Those same businesses with an annual turnover of less than $50 million will be able to deduct an additional 20 per cent of expenditure incurred on eligible training courses in this space.We know that tech jobs are good for families, with the flexibility to work from home. We know that tech jobs are well paid and attract people from all over the world. We know the job we need to do to ensure that Australia remains a place for tech companies to set up and to grow. And to claim otherwise is just simply ridiculous. The Albanese government is getting on with the job.","Digital Economy","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr LAXALE (Bennelong) ","(12:26):"
"0","0","0","1","2","Coleman, David MP","241067","Banks","LP","N/A","151"," Im really pleased to speak on this motion. I want to thank the member for Casey for highlighting the importance of technology, because, oddly, whilst in the broader community and the business community we talk about technology all the time, we actually dont talk about it a great deal here in Canberra. In some respects that makes sense, because government is not—and nor should it be—the main driving force when it comes to technological adoption, because government will never be at the centre of innovation in the same way that the private sector is. So what the government should do in this area is to focus on where it can add value, on where the role for government is and what it should be doing, as opposed to trying to do everything, because thats clearly not the case.By coincidence, we actually happen to be at a very interesting point in technological development. We have seen, in the last couple of months, a pretty extraordinary development in artificial intelligence that I think is going to be hugely significant over the coming years and decades.Im about to show my age, but I remember, in 1994, sitting in the Law Library at UNSW and someone showing me this thing called Netscape—which was the first big mainstream web browser—and thinking, Wow, this is going to be a very big deal, because the capacity to access information is just far beyond what weve ever seen before. And I spent most of my career prior to coming to this place in technology. I was head of digital for Nine Entertainment Co and chairman of Ninemsn, and I did a number of other things in technology.Weve seen extraordinary developments over the last 30 years, since the development of the internet, and probably the growth of mobile, in the last 10 or 15 years, is the second most significant thing after the creation of the internet itself. But I think the growth of artificial intelligence is about to be extraordinarily significant. When ChatGPT came out a couple of months ago, a few days later I used it and was quite struck. It was quite an extraordinary product. I was moved to tweet, which I dont do all that often, to say just, Wow! This is an incredible development.And we are going to see extraordinary changes, because weve now got to a point where artificial intelligence can explain the theory of relativity better than most academics; it can write an essay about Hamlet far better than most students; and it can write a script for a play or a short story, based on some quite limited prompts, which is far better than most human beings could do. That is a big deal and is something that people have talked about in science fiction for decades but the moment has arrived. It is inevitable that artificial intelligence will be widely adopted because economics will mean that businesses will make use of artificial intelligence to do tasks more efficiently and at lower costs and, therefore, provide better products to consumers, so that proliferation of artificial intelligence is inevitable. We are going to see some time shortly this year the next iteration from OpenAI, the ChatGPT product, and there will be others from Google and others. We are about to enter into a very interesting and different world, so the question is: What is the role for government? Frankly, that is going to happen regardless of what the Australian government does, but the question for the Australian government is: What should we do? If I was in the ministerial role, which I am not—us, of course, having lost government—I would be asking the Public Service, which is set a difficult task: What is the impact of artificial intelligence on Australia and on the Australian economy? What is good, what is bad and what should we do? Where is the place for government? Because if we can position Australia to benefit from these changes, that has immense potential. Equally, it is always better to develop and own intellectual property than to just use it, so if our government can take steps to encourage an environment in which the development and ownership of intellectual property and artificial environments occurs, that will be a job well done, and that is a difficult task for the bureaucracy but difficult tasks should be set; that is the whole point.This is a massive issue which, frankly, will be far more significant than many, if not most, of the things we debate in this place. It will have revolutionary impacts on our society and our community in the coming years and it is critical for the government to take steps to act in Australias interest on this issue.","Digital Economy","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr COLEMAN (Banks) ","(12:32):"
"0","0","0","1","2","Rae, Sam MP","300122","Hawke","ALP","N/A","152"," The digital economy is central to all of our lives. Every part of our world we live in is driven by digital technology, commerce and data. This transformation of our economy has presented exciting opportunities and complex challenges, from how we drive new investment in emerging technology to supporting workers who are on the frontline of the transformation of how we work, from investments in critical technologies to incentives that support business adoption and making sure that Australian businesses and families have quality high-speed internet.The Albanese government is building the foundations of a strong digital future. We have not wasted a minute in embracing and supporting the digital economy. We have an ambitious plan to create 1.2 million tech related jobs by the year 2030 by supporting new business and new workers with digital skills and support they will need for the jobs of the future. In our first budget, we delivered the small business technology investment boost, allowing small business to deduct 20 per cent of the costs incurred on business expenses and depreciating assets that support their digital adoption such as portable payment devices, cybersecurity systems and subscriptions to cloud based services. And we have allocated a billion dollars for enabling technologies in our National Reconstruction Fund, a record investment in manufacturing; investing in new and emerging industries, partnering research and capital to make it easier to commercialise Australian smarts and technology.Like the member for Casey, I too am a first-time member in this place. However, unlike the member for Casey, I have not conveniently forgotten the Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments woeful record on the digital economy. How anyone opposite can stand up with a straight face and try and proselytise about the previous governments achievements in this space is beyond me. That same Liberal government that destroyed the NBN, systematically tearing apart a once-in-a-generation infrastructure project that has catapulted Australias digital economy to the absolute forefront, also demonised fibre to the premises, wasted billions of dollars trying to create a poor quality replacement and lost the better part of a decade in economic productivity dividends, only to announce that it would actually embrace fibre to the premises in 2020. Perhaps that lost decade explains how, according to the Australian Digital Inclusion Index in October 2021, that same Liberal government left 11 per cent of Australians highly excluded from the digital economy, that same Liberal government that threw a billion dollars at the tech industry but barely moved the needle when it came to job creation. It wasted tax dollars, lost economic productivity and stalled job creation in emerging industries. What a record! That is another fine example of the rot and drift that defined the previous government.There was, however, a greater sin committed by those opposite in respect to the digital economy, one that led to the insidious exploitation of workers, the undercutting of wages and the obliteration of hard-fought and won conditions in the workplace. The proliferation of gig economy workers and the previous governments wilful ignorance to the challenges they faced is a disgrace. They turned a blind eye to the mistreatment of these workers, often some of our newest Australians, either by dereliction or design. They did nothing to protect minimum standards, nothing to enforce minimum wages and nothing to keep workplace laws in line with new forms of work.I am proudly a member of the Transport Workers Union. I have heard firsthand the stories of rideshare drivers and food delivery drivers who copped the brunt of this unregulated and dangerous work. I am proud of these workers and for their union for standing up against these platforms—some of the biggest companies in the world—to fight for minimum standards and conditions. Because of their struggle there has been success, with world-leading deals struck between the TWU, the workers they represent and platforms such as Uber and Deliveroo.There is so much more to do. Thats why the Albanese Labor government and my friend the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations will legislate to close the loopholes left open by those opposite in the workplace relations system. Well require same job, same pay in labour hire, regulate the gig economy by setting conditions for employee-like work, define casual employment and, importantly, make wage theft a crime, no matter the industry.","Digital Economy","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr RAE (Hawke) ","(12:37):"
"0","0","0","1","2","Spender, Allegra MP","286042","Wentworth","IND","N/A","153"," Thank you to the member for Casey for proposing this motion. I understand he has a background in a tech startup and is one of the few parliamentarians who has some experience of tech and running a business, especially the risks faced by businesses and startups. We need more of that experience in this place.Much of Australias tech sector is based in my electorate of Wentworth. A constant message I hear from the industry is that they need to feel better heard and understood by our parliamentarians and our bureaucrats lest the opportunities that their businesses present leave us passed. Too often decisions which affect them are being made without their input or full understanding of the implications for the industry. This is a problem for an industry which is an increasingly important part of our economy.The technology sector contributes around $100 billion to GDP and makes up about five per cent of the Australian economy, a share that is growing quickly and will continue to grow quickly into the future. It will continue to grow quickly because there is enormous promise and potential in Australian technology. That potential will become obvious as more local startups follow in the footsteps of others who are succeeding on the world stage. But the real potential is longer term.We have the creativity, the talent and resources for technology to contribute so much more to our economy and our society. The sectors future is bright, but harnessing this potential is going to take work—work from industry, certainly, but also work from government and educators because the interaction between the sector and the government is far from perfect. While many of the frictions are small, they add up and they hold us back. Thats why the technology community, represented by the Tech Council, are calling for change. Theyre calling for a talent pipeline to bring gifted people from around the world to contribute to Australias tech future. I have to say that this is a message Ive heard firsthand from some of Australias leading technology entrepreneurs. They need the chance to bring the best of technology talent into this country so that we can really be at the forefront of this economic opportunity. They are calling for better, clearer regulation and regulatory frameworks that protect data and privacy while enabling innovation and growth. And, again, so many in the tech sector see that Australia is behind the curve in terms of its regulatory environment in technology—too much businesses are actually leading while government and bureaucrats are left behind. We have to change this so that government is properly informed about the appropriate regulatory framework for Australian businesses, not only to harness the opportunity but also to protect Australian consumers and businesses. Better targeted incentives will address the gaps in commercialising Australian innovations.These are enormous challenges, but I want to talk about my experience as the chief executive officer of the Australian Business and Community Network, a network of 200 low-socioeconomic-status schools and over 40 big businesses, many of them technology based. What was absolutely clear was that the enormous opportunity in technology is not being addressed in our education system, and that means particularly the disadvantaged kids in our community are missing out. They see themselves as consumers of tech but dont necessarily have the capability to be the creators of technology, and that is the change that needs to happen. During the pandemic, up to 50 per cent of kids in the schools that I worked with didnt have access to data and devices to be able to learn online, and that is just an example; it flowed through to all sorts of other technology skills. According to the principals and educators that I worked with, the answer is the pairing of education and business. Business is leading, at the forefront of tech, but education needs to work closely with business so that kids and young people are ready to take those advantages. I think that is one of the key opportunities of this government and future governments if we are truly going to enable technology growth to be inclusive, which is what it has to be, and ensure that technology growth achieves the best possible economic outcomes.I support many of the principles of the Albanese governments action on technology—for instance, supporting small-business investment in technology upgrades—but I think there are also opportunities there. I recommend to the government that it consider bringing the digital economy under one ministerial oversight. I think that would be really valuable. The government needs to truly listen to the industry, not just consult it, for us to get the economic benefits of technology. We need to be at the forefront of good regulation in technology, not just absorbing it from overseas, and we need to ensure that business and education work together to enable young people to thrive in the digital economy, because AI plus human interaction is the greatest opportunity.","Digital Economy","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms SPENDER (Wentworth) ","(12:42):"
"0","0","0","1","2","Roberts, Tracey MP","157125","Pearce","ALP","N/A","154"," I rise to respond to the member for Caseys motion. Let me begin by stating that the Albanese Labor government unequivocally values and understands the critical importance of nurturing, growing and supporting the digital economy. Our government is strategically investing in this sector because digital technology drives everything we do. These skills and innovations are inextricably woven into our lives, and we remain forward-thinking and innovative to scale and grow Australian-made discoveries whilst planning soundly to ensure we squeeze every opportunity out of the burgeoning digital economy to grow emerging technologies and stimulate jobs.As a nation, we still have so much to do. To reach our full potential, we need to invest, and the Albanese Labor government is certainly investing. We have a goal of reaching 1.2 million tech-related jobs in Australia by 2030. The Minister for Industry and Science, Ed Husic, has stated that in order to boost our manufacturing output we must do three things: invest in our human capital, strategically invest in Australian ideas and invest in our future technological potential. We have delivered on our pre-election policy commitments and we have funded the following important policy areas.Our $1 billion investment in critical technologies, as part of the $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund, is one of the biggest government investments in manufacturing. This investment has been welcomed and applauded by prominent technical industry stakeholders, who have described it as a very significant investment, compared with the funding available under the coalition. The Albanese Labor government has said the NRF will additionally provide funding for enabling technologies, many of which are digital technologies, in areas including artificial intelligence, data science and software development.The government will invest $15 billion over seven years to establish the NRF to support, diversify and transform Australian industry and the economy. This will happen through targeted co-investments in seven priority areas: resources; agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors; transport; medical science; renewables and low-emissions technologies; defence capability; and enabling capabilities.There is $2.4 billion committed over four years to boosting fibre access under the NBN, to deliver fibre-ready access to a further 1.5 million premises by late 2025, which was part of our first budget in October 2022. This is about modernising our infrastructure and capturing the digital economic opportunities.The Albanese Labor government is investing $15.4 million over four years to establish a start-up year for university students. The start-up year allows students to stay on for a further year at university to take part in businesses in focused start-up incubators and accelerators, giving them the opportunity to translate fresh ideas into vibrant new businesses. In addition, we are investing in education by injecting significant funding for TAFE and universities to help address skill shortages, including fee-free TAFE.Another excellent measure is the endorsement of the Digital and Tech Skills Compact, which was agreed to at the Jobs and Skills Summit. The compact will develop a model pilot scheme for workers to enter the tech industry, so that they can earn while they learn in entry-level tech roles. The compact affirms a commitment from industry, government and unions to cooperate to help address skill shortages and grow the Australian tech sector, noting that a digital economy will drive productivity, grow our economy and create better paid work opportunities for Australians. The CEO of the Tech Council, Kate Pounder, has stated:This historic compact will create and keep more tech jobs for Australians and top global talent. Providing more reskilling and training opportunities is crucial to reaching our shared goal of 1.2 million tech jobs by 2030.This clearly reflects that the Albanese Labor government is surging ahead with strategic actions in the digital economy.Debate adjourned.","Digital Economy","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms ROBERTS (Pearce) ","(12:47):"

It will be the first time in 24 years that we will hold a referendum, and Im confident that it will be the first time in 46 years that we have a successful referendum in this country, because what we have before us is an opportunity: an opportunity for our country to move forward, to take the history that we have with us and to turn the page on a brighter future.Constitutional recognition through the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice to Parliament is about improving the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. It is a simple proposition. It is about giving people a say in the matters that affect them. And it is an opportunity for our community, for our country, to be part of an important change that will make this country stronger together. It will make this a country that fully embraces our past and can move forward together for a brighter future. It is time to do things differently.In this country, there is a decade life-expectancy gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. We know that years and years of government policy has not worked as it should. In many cases, that has been well-intentioned government policy, but it has failed to get the outcomes that it should have. Often it has failed because people and communities have not been listened to; their voices have not been heard. We do need people in communities to be listened to on the policies that affect them. It is quite a simple proposition. What we get from that is better outcomes, and the Voice is part of the efforts that we will all take to move towards that. At its heart, the Voice is a simple proposition. It will be an advisory body made up of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians who represent their communities. They will give advice to government on issues that affect them and their communities. The Voice will not have a veto power; it will be an advisory group. It will deliver practical change on the ground in areas like health, education and housing, allowing government to shape those policies, but it will not be responsible for delivering those sorts of programs. The Voice is the best chance we have had in this country to address the injustices of the past and to create a change that will deliver a better future.This comes in a context where we know there is a lot of work to be done to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. There are areas where we have encouraging progress—areas like babies now being born with a healthier birth weight, and the number of children enrolled in preschool. Those are big achievements, but its not enough. We have a disappointing lack of progress in other areas, including in out-of-home care and in adults in prison. So it is clear that something needs to change. We cant expect things to change if we just keep doing them the same old way.We do know that local communities know the solutions to local problems, and that is one of the reasons the Voice to Parliament is so important, and it is one of the reasons why it is important that we hear the voice of local communities in the work that is underway to close the gap. And here I do want to acknowledge the work of Pat Turner AM and the Coalition of Peaks for all that they are already doing to elevate the voices of 80 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community controlled peak and member organisations across Australia. That is such important input that they are providing to that work.I also want to acknowledge that this month we mark 15 years since the Rudd government made the National Apology to the Stolen Generations. That was a unifying moment for our country. It was a chance to say sorry, to reflect on the pain and the injustice inflicted on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, and to resolve that the injustices of the past must never happen again.We have the opportunity for another unifying moment this year. We have the opportunity to deliver not only a new unifying moment for Australia but a critically important reform that gives Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians a say in the matters affecting them, a voice that will help to ensure that better policies are made in this place. I want to thank all those people in my community who have asked me about the Voice, who have told me they are supportive of the Voice, who have told me they want to help work to achieve a voice in this country. It is really heartening to be able to have those conversations in the community, and I know there are many more of them to come, and I know there are many people who want to work with us to make sure that this year we have a successful referendum and we establish a voice to parliament.","Aboriginal And Torres Strait Islander Australians","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms THWAITES (Jagajaga) ","(12:52):"

The Uluru Statement from the Heart is a generous invitation by the First Peoples of Australia. It calls for constitutional recognition of the First Peoples of Australia through the establishment of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voice to government and to parliament. By amending our Constitution in this way, we no longer leave it to chance but ensure that First Nations Australians can give recommendations on policies and laws that impact them. Its an invitation I accept. I commit to walk with our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and to encourage people all over our nation to vote yes at the forthcoming referendum.When I speak to people in my electorate about this, theyre often surprised by how modest the request for a voice is. It is a simple but meaningful and, make no mistake, substantial change that will enshrine a way forward on the structural barriers that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders face every day—barriers in the most fundamental areas of housing, education, employment, justice and health. A voice to parliament is a crucial step towards addressing these challenges, led by the people who know best how to do so—Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.They are Aboriginal women like Judy Ahmet from my community of Indi who has supported me, taught me and led me since I put up my hand to run for Indi in 2019. Judy speaks about the national apology, a day I remember so well as I stopped a class I was teaching to listen to Prime Minister Rudd on a day that really was a turning point for non-Indigenous people across this nation, and this one is another turning point for us. A voice to parliament enshrined in the constitution is backed by cultural authority. Politicians didnt come up with a voice. Over 250 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander representatives issued the Statement from the Heart, calling for a voice to parliament. Years of work and consultation by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people led to the Uluru statement, and continued consultation has followed from it. The Voice is the next step on our road to reconciliation. The Uluru statement calls too for treaty as a process of agreement-making and truth-telling—and I support that too—and a voice will enable that process to follow.I commend the Victorian government for their leadership on treaty. Ive met with our Victorian treaty commissioners who have helped me in understanding that process too. Ive been speaking to First Nations leaders across Indi and will continue to seek their views on the upcoming referendum. Importantly, in my conversations I hear support for the Voice. I also hear, though, that its not up to First Nations Australians to secure a yes vote; its up to us. Its up to non-Indigenous Australians to listen—to listen carefully—and to bring this to life. Ben, from TVN On-Country, a construction company in Wodonga, told me this, and he is right. This is not a question for politicians; its a question for the people. Its up to our communities to get behind this, and thats exactly whats happening.Last week 30 community members from many walks of life joined me in my office to share ideas about how they can host respectful, fact based, kitchen table conversations to bring forward a strong yes vote. On Saturday, by the banks of the Seven Creeks in Euroa, on Taungurung country, a yes picnic was held. I was proud to stand by Aunty Jill Gallagher AO and the Hon. Dr Barry Jones AC to address the 200-strong crowd who came to listen and came to learn. The people of neighbouring little Violet Town know that the ask is a crucial but simple one. Theyre not complicating it. Theyve set up a humble card table and a couple of chairs in the main street with a simple message: Lets talk about the Voice. They know that this is an historic event, a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and they want to be part of it.I call on all Australians to think deeply about what were being asked to consider. When it comes to our moment at the ballot box later this year, a moment when were alone with our conscience, with our head and with our heart, remember: you have the chance to be part of history. I am confident—I am very confident—that, come the referendum, we will think about the question with our heart and our head and we will proudly vote yes.","Aboriginal And Torres Strait Islander Australians","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr HAINES (Indi) ","(12:57):"

I begin by again paying my respects to the traditional custodians of the land on which our parliament meets, the Ngunnawal and Ngambri people. We open this parliament each day by acknowledging their traditional ownership of these lands. I acknowledge that this land was never ceded and I pay my respects to their elders past and present and those yet to come.Fifteen years ago Prime Minister Rudd, as one of his first acts in government, stood in the Parliament of Australia and apologised for the wrongs committed against Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. Prime Minister Rudd apologised for the laws and policies of successive parliaments and governments that have inflicted profound grief, suffering and loss on our fellow Australians. At that time the Rudd government also took concrete steps to ensure that those injustices didnt happen again and pledged that we all, Indigenous and non-Indigenous, would work to close the gap—the gap of life expectancy, of educational achievement and of economic opportunity—that stubbornly exists between us. Closing the gap is a core focus of our government. We want every Australian to have the same opportunities in life. While we have seen promising progress in areas such as babies born with a healthy birth weight, children enrolled in preschool and other areas, we have not seen progress in other areas. We need to do better on out-of-home care, rates of imprisonment and the life expectancy gap of almost a decade between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. To say we need to do better is a gross understatement. It is not enough, and clearly we need a change of approach.We know that better policies are made when the people who are affected by them have their voices heard, and thats why the referendum this year is so important. When Australians go to the polls this year, it will be a unique experience for many. For anyone born after 1981 it will be the first time theyve ever voted in a referendum. When Australians go to the polls they will be asked to change the Constitution, to establish an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice to Parliament. The Voice is about two things: recognition and consultation. Recognition of Australias First Peoples in the nations birth certificate, our Constitution—something promised by successive governments over decades; and consultation, giving First Nations Australians a say in the policies that impact them. These are simple things but theyre a huge step for our nation, and one that we really have such a great opportunity to take together this year at this referendum.If this referendum is successful it will improve the lives of Indigenous Australians. It will deliver practical change on the ground in areas like health, housing and education. It will be an important step on the journey of reconciliation because the Voice referendum could be a unifying moment for Australia. Its about taking this country forward for everyone.Ive heard from a number of my constituents who are already worried by the tone of this debate, and I urge everyone to conduct this debate respectfully, maturely and truthfully. This should be an issue above the daily political point-scoring, and I remind all members of this House where the idea of the Voice comes from. This isnt Labors plan or any politicians plan. It is the request of First Nations Australians themselves. The Uluru Statement from the Heart was a generous invitation from First Nations Australians, formed after a long, involved and deliberative process of consultation. It calls for three things: voice, treaty and truth. This Labor government is committed to all three of these elements, and I call on all members of this House, and all Australians, to join together on this path of reconciliation.I encourage all of you, in the coming months, to talk to your friends, family and colleagues about how the Voice will help us of recognise Australias First Peoples and make a practical difference to the lives and communities of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. A Voice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians is an opportunity to address the injustices of the past and create change that will deliver a better future.

"0","0","0","1","2","Spender, Allegra MP","286042","Wentworth","IND","N/A","157"," I rise in support of this motion and, in doing so, would like to start by acknowledging the traditional owners of the land on which we stand, and pay my respect to elders past, present and emerging.Next Monday, 13 February, marks the 15th anniversary of the national apology. This was a sombre, moving and historic day for our country. It acknowledged the profound grief, suffering and loss that the laws and policies of successive Australian parliaments and governments had inflicted on their fellow Australians, particularly the removal of First Nations children from their families.The apology was perhaps the starkest of reminders that for many years laws have been made that affect Indigenous Australians but which were not in their best interests and would not have had their support. The simple truth is that our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples voices have been ignored too long. If they had been listened to we would not have denied them the vote for so long, we would not have excluded them from the census and we would not have had the stolen generations.This year we have a historic opportunity to change things by enshrining the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice to Parliament in the Constitution. And the case for the Voice is strong. It was put forward by Indigenous Australians after a process of regional dialogues held across the country, which led to the Uluru national dialogue in 2017. It has the overwhelming support of Indigenous Australians, and there is no doubt in my mind that the laws and policies will be improved by listening to a representative body of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, because you need to listen first if youre going to make effective policy. People in community know what will make a real difference. At the same time, it is an opportunity to recognise that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples were the first custodians of the land of Australia, and that is equally important to me.The Uluru Statement from the Heart is one of the most beautiful pieces of Australian language. Id like to read a statement from it—the last paragraph, which says:In 1967 we were counted, in 2017 we seek to be heard. We leave base camp and start our trek across this vast country. We invite you to walk with us in a movement of the Australian people for a better future.I commit to walk with them for a better future of this country.In seizing this opportunity, we must make sure that our national conversation is positive and respectful, because this is a hopeful opportunity. This is a path of the future of Australia. It should be about informing and empowering Australian citizens. It should be about understanding how the Voice will improve the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, which is so important to people, and it should be about bringing people together, not shaming them. In this conversation, we must appreciate that people will have legitimate questions. These questions need to be listened to, and, to the greatest possible extent, they need to be addressed. But, again, weve got to come back to the fact that this is a hopeful opportunity for this country and one that Im so excited about. It is not about political pointscoring, and, frankly, its not about politicians at all. The push for a voice did not come from politicians. It came from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and the people who will decide on the fate of this referendum are the people of Australia. So that is the most important thing—working with community.Im super excited, to be honest, on that part, because already I know the Wentworth community is so excited about supporting the Voice to Parliament. A couple of weeks ago, I had the pleasure of chairing the first meeting of Wentworth for the Voice, a volunteer effort that will work with our community, councils, businesses and other stakeholder groups to make the positive case for a yes vote in my electorate and at the same time make sure that the electorate is really informed about legitimate questions on a referendum. Weve met with local members of our First Nations community, as well as those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people working nationally on the Voice, and our project management team is up and running. Were already planning a wide range of community events. Wentworth for the Voice will aim to speak with every one of our people in our community to engage them and inform them about the Voice to Parliament and this enormous historic opportunity for this country.I want to pay tribute to Wentworth for the Voices project management team—Margot, Rod, Sigrid, Desiree, Miranda and Kath—for their efforts so far. Thank you, as well, to other volunteers who are already getting involved, particularly Gene, who was the first member of our project team from an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander background—but not the last at all—as well as Ian, Margot, Martin, Susie, Mehera, Helita, Margie, Nicole, Michele, Sally, Jane, Amy, Jack, Neroli, Annette and Ruby, and Im sure I have left somebody off. This list will grow over time, and I cant wait to get started.","Aboriginal And Torres Strait Islander Australians","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms SPENDER (Wentworth) ","(13:08):"
"0","0","0","1","2","Georganas, Steve MP","DZY","Adelaide","ALP","N/A","158"," Words are important. We know that science has confirmed that the words that we use can shape us, shape our communities and shape our world. Thats why it was so powerful when the Rudd Labor government had the courage to say sorry. This month marks 15 years since the Rudd government made the National Apology to the Stolen Generations. I am immensely proud to have been part of that government and to have been in the chamber when then Prime Minister Rudd gave that very important and well overdue speech 15 years ago.Its estimated that one in three Indigenous children were taken from their families between 1910 and the 1970s. Many people affected by the stolen generation are still alive today, and they were present for that apology. Those of us that were here on that day can remember looking up at the gallery and seeing the faces of these people and the emotion on peoples faces, in the chamber, in the gallery and all around and surrounding Parliament House, where big screens had been set up. You only have to look at the faces of the people present on that day to understand how powerful a word can be. Sorry may seem like a simple word to say, yet it proved so difficult for many governments that came before. Successive governments refusing to say sorry sent a different message to all Australians. We were able to acknowledge past wrongs and recognise the pain and the injustice inflicted upon our First Nations people. The apology united the country to reflect on our shared history. Did it solve all the problems? Of course it didnt. But it was a starting point to work on solving the problems.While this government is firmly committed to Closing the Gap and taking practical action, we also acknowledge that we are still falling short in many areas. Weve seen progress in areas like the birth weight of babies and the number of children enrolled in preschool, but weve also seen a lack of progress in areas such as out-of-home care and adult imprisonment. This is one of the reasons we need to do better. We need to do more, and this is one of the reasons why were enshrining an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice in the Constitution and why we feel it is so important. We want to empower more First Nations people to be engaged and have a say on the matters that affect them. We know that, when people who are affected are heard, the result is better overall.This year, Australians will be asked to vote in a referendum to enshrine an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice in the Constitution. Australians will be asked to choose a word, and that word will determine the country we aspire to be. I will choose to say yes. Ill say yes because I want to improve the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, and Ill say yes because I want First Nations people to have a say in the matters that affect them so better policies can be made in this place. Ill say yes because I want Australias First Peoples recognised in our Constitution.Yes is a powerful word. It says its time to do things differently. It says we will listen to what the people and the communities have to say about the policies that affect them. Saying yes can provide another powerful unifying moment for Australian history. It is also the best chance we have to address the injustices of the past and create change—change that will deliver a better future. We all stand to benefit by saying yes.","Aboriginal And Torres Strait Islander Australians","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr GEORGANAS (Adelaide) ","(13:13):"
"0","0","0","1","2","Ryan, Monique MP","297660","Kooyong","IND","N/A","159"," Our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander tribes were the first sovereign nations of the Australian continent and its adjacent islands. They possessed this land under their own laws and customs. Their sovereignty has never been ceded or extinguished, and it co-exists with the sovereignty of the Crown.For more than 30 years, all sides of politics in Australia have accepted the need for a credible Indigenous voice to the federal government and for constitutional reforms to empower our Indigenous people to take a rightful place in their own country. In the Uluru Statement from the Heart, our First Nations people asked us to create for them a voice to this parliament. It is a beautiful document. It is an invitation and a gift to our nation from the Aboriginal people. Most Australians have not yet read it.The concept of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice to parliament is simple but powerful. It will be a body of Indigenous people with the rights and means to be formally consulted on policy and legislation which affects their communities. Essentially, representative Indigenous Australians who know their communities will be able to speak directly to parliamentarians in Canberra. They will offer us practical and effective solutions to their unique challenges—jobs, health, education and justice. The Voice will be purely advisory in construct and effect. It will not have the power of veto over legislation.A voice could be established by legislation without a constitutional amendment. We know this because its been attempted before, numerous times. Previous representative bodies were poorly designed and underfunded and were ultimately abolished. Weve learned from those experiences. This constitutional model results from extensive dialogue in Indigenous communities around the country. The existence of a voice, but not its form, will entrenched in our Constitution. The details of the Voice will—they should—be delineated by parliament. The details of the Voice will be mutable. They can change over time as we need them to change. The details do not need to be in the Constitution; they should not be in the Constitution. We need our Voice to be able to change and to mature as we, as a nation, change and mature. We need it to be adaptable and flexible as we, as a nation, are adaptable and flexible.The need for constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people has been supported by prime ministers of all persuasions since John Howard in 2007. Recognition is a simple statement of fact that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were the first people here. A voice to parliament is a simple and practical way to achieve this recognition in the Australian Constitution.Australians are fair and generous people. I know that my constituents in Kooyong are fair and generous people. In 1897, Mark Twain said that Australian history does not read like history but like the most beautiful lies. Its time for us to tell the truth. Its only fair that our 122-year-old Constitution recognises Indigenous people as the First People of Australia. In 1967, they were counted. In 2017, they sought to be heard. Theyre still waiting. This is a chance to unite our nation, a healing gesture. Its a chance to right wrongs by writing yes. This is for us, as a nation, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.A successful referendum will be a source of pride for the Australian nation and a unifying moment for us all. And so, as the Uluru Statement says, its time to leave base camp and to trek across this vast country, to walk together with Indigenous Australians, as we walk together with those born from the early settlers and with our recent immigrants. Its time to give our First Australians a voice and for us to listen to that voice.","Aboriginal And Torres Strait Islander Australians","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr RYAN (Kooyong) ","(13:17):"
"0","0","0","1","2","Perrett, Graham Douglas MP","HVP","Moreton","ALP","N/A","160"," Fifteen years ago this month I sat in this House as Prime Minister Kevin Rudd delivered the National Apology to the Stolen Generations on behalf of the Labor government and of all Australia. It was my first day in parliament, one of the most significant days in the history of this nation, and still my best day in this place. For all those politicians and everyday Australians who, before the apology, opposed it—the sky didnt fall in. In fact, we were a better nation because of it, both domestically and with regard to our international standing. Later this year, Australians will again have an opportunity to be a part of history by supporting a change to this nations Constitution. The people will decide. The referendum will be an opportunity to vote on the establishment of a First Peoples voice to parliament, a process then enshrined in our Constitution, a document that is modern Australias birth certificate and also our driving licence.Unfortunately, today, there is only one party that unequivocally supports the First Peoples Voice to Parliament and the full implementation of the Uluru Statement from the Heart. We had the Nationals out of the gate early saying they were supporting a no vote. They did so because theyre almost as scared of the future as they are of truth in the past. We have the Greens political party in disarray, with former Greens Senator Thorpe backing the Nationals alongside Senator Price, while, sadly, in Queensland, we hear nothing but crickets from the Greens representatives. Thankfully, Senator Hanson-Young had the courage to support her community and came out in support of a yes vote. The One Nation business model entails being on the wrong side of history always—quite a skill considering they dont study history and refuse to learn from it. And, of course, the Liberals cant make up their minds about what to do. The member for Berowra might inform me after Ive finished. Theyre neither Arthur nor Martha under their current band leader—a little bit of dog whistle here, a little bit of dog trumpet there, while they slowly slip towards supporting the no campaign.It was great to see every first minister in Australia, including Liberals, sign a commitment to support the First Peoples Voice to Parliament on Friday. I thank them for their leadership. I also note that Australias first federal First Nations cabinet minister, Ken Wyatt, is urging his old party, the Liberals, to back a yes vote. Unfortunately, it seems Ken, just like me, cant see this happening. At the very least, the bloke I watched walk out on the apology 15 years ago this month should at least allow his MPs and senators to campaign for the yes campaign, because I know there are people of goodwill in the Liberal Party—present company included.Another leading First Nations voice, Professor Marcia Langton, wrote a telling piece about the Voice recently in the Saturday Paper. Ms Langton had some great insights into the no campaign:Theres something the No camp doesnt understand—or if they do, they are worse than I think. We will never get this opportunity again. This referendum is a once-in-many-lifetimes event. That is why it is more important than the cynicism and redneck opportunism with which they have tried to frame it.For them, this isnt about anything but dog whistling and appealing to those who dont care or understand the issues facing First Nations people and their communities. They will try anything to make sure the referendum fails. Professor Langton also pointed to the fact there have been three lengthy reports commissioned on the Voice, including the 272-page Indigenous Voice codesign process, a final report led by her and Professor Tom Calma. Ken Wyatt also said that on two occasions he brought that report to cabinet when he was minister—a cabinet of which the current Nationals leader was a member and a report that Senator Hume said she hadnt even bothered to read. Its a report that has plenty of detail; you just have to read it.Eminent constitutional lawyer Professor Anne Twomey weighed in on the argument of there not being enough detail. Professor Twomey said all that is important at the referendum is to know the scope of the power being enshrined, thus leaving the function in the hands of the parliament—the democratically elected people—with the oversight of our tried and true democratic process. This is not unprecedented. When it came into effect on 1 January 1901, the Constitution outlined in section 71 the establishment of the High Court of Australia. However, it wasnt until after the passage of the Judiciary Act in 1903 that the final bench could sit.There are no hurdles here to stop a successful referendum except for those—many of whom were in government for the last decade—bemoaning that it wont help close the gap. We certainly aint got it right, right now. Many governments havent. Do you want to know the difference between good intention policies and bad intention policies? There is none. It doesnt matter. There are just bad policies. So Ill go back and quote Professor Langton again:It is the duty of Australians who want to build a nation that recognises 65,000 years of human history …","Aboriginal And Torres Strait Islander Australians","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr PERRETT (Moreton) ","(13:22):"

Hes one of my favourite members on the other side too, although hes wrong on most things.I want to thank the member for Jagajaga for reminding us about the 15th anniversary of the apology to Australias Indigenous people, which we commemorate more formally next week. Like the 1967 referendum, delivered successfully by the Holt government, the apology endures as a landmark in our Australian story. Kevin Rudd realised that the apology had to mark the start of a change, rather than to be an end of itself. As he said:… symbolism is important but, unless the great symbolism of reconciliation is accompanied by an even greater substance, it is little more than a clanging gong.From the apology, the Closing the Gap process was born and eventually revamped. It was revamped because of the realisation that progress was not possible until progress was a true partnership with Indigenous Australians. And I pay tribute to the former minister Ken Wyatt and the Coalition of Peaks for this work.Under the new process delivered by the previous government, its not only the Commonwealth reporting on progress against our goals. Every state and territory and the Coalition of Peaks are all reporting on their shared goals. Buy-in has grown; responsibility is now shared across the country. More people now feel the weight of that responsibility—a weight of responsibility that must be felt if were to close the gap.Symbolic change and practical outcomes go hand in hand. Its a reason why Im a supporter of the idea of a voice. But from todays poll, we know the debate hangs in the balance. The idea has majority support, but half of that support is considered soft. As a supporter of the idea of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice, Im deeply concerned by where the debate is at. The government is tripping over itself through lack of detail. The government is mucking this up. The lack of detail is actually damaging support for the Voice. Yesterday it was questions about advising both the parliament and the executive; today it was questions about the Voice being a voice to National Cabinet; and who knows what tomorrows questions will bring.Were seeing proponents stumbling over how the Voice might or might not work. The lack of detail is actually hurting the Voice. This was predicted years ago. In 2018 Senator Dodson and I co-chaired the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition Relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. Some prominent Aboriginal leaders and legal experts were quoted in our final report. Mick Gooda said:… if Australians dont understand what they are voting for in a referendum they will vote no. …… If we went to a referendum now … without any detail about how its going to be formed and constructed, its a guarantee of failure. Were committed to a voice, but we think theres a process weve got to go through.Professor Tom Calma said:… nobody knows what the Voice might look like and how it might operate. Once thats determined or recommended, if theres broad support for it, then we should go into another round of campaigns.Cathryn Eatock, the co-chair of the Indigenous Peoples Organisation, told the committee:We believe that a governance body should be established through legislation before the issues around a constitutional referendum are addressed, and that that also requires a period of bedding down. Weve seen fear campaigns before …She went on to say:Its actually the governments responsibility to educate the Australian population and … bring them with us so its a joint journey of healing for the Australian community.Indeed, the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council, in arguing for a constitutionally enshrined voice said, A Voice to Parliament established through legislation may provide a practical interim first step. As the report noted:Mr Mick Gooda, Professor Tom Calma AO and Ms June Oscar AO argued that a constitutional change would only be successful if it was accompanied by clearly articulated legislation, defining and road-testing the implementation of The Voice, after a co-design process.Professor George Williams also warned us of the necessary preconditions for successful referenda—namely:bipartisan support;popular ownership of the proposal by voters;education; anda modern referendum process.Theres that word again: process. That is the thing thats lacking now under this government and why this is so important. As Dr Jackie Huggins, the then co-chair of Congress put it in 2018, a failed referendum would be another blow to Indigenous Australians.A referendum requires a serious act of persuasion. We owe it to the First Nations peoples of this country, and to our shared national story, to give this referendum every chance of success. The governments strategy must be: details first, referendum second. Thats how to make the idea of a voice a reality. Detail creates confidence; detail creates the scope for debate. Detail will stop the daily sloppy interviews were seeing from this government in the debate, from the Prime Minister down. Noel Pearson anticipated this a year ago when he said in an address:Let us complete the legislative design of the Voice, and produce an exposure draft of the Bill so that all parliamentarians and the members of the Australian public can see exactly what the Voice entails.Im drawing the Chambers attention to these statements because they demonstrate that, when we call for more detail before a referendum, we are not alone. In fact, prominent Indigenous leaders, lawyers and people who are now advising the government have previously made the same argument. So my plea to those opposite is to adjust course. Please, please, please, please adjust course.Debated adjourned.Sitting suspended from 13:32 to 16:00","Aboriginal And Torres Strait Islander Australians","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr LEESER (Berowra) ","(13:27):"

Val Dempsey was the 2022 Senior Australian of the Year, an accolade she earned for decades of service as a St John Ambulance volunteer. Her tenure as Senior Australian of the Year was marked by some significant events, particularly the death of Queen Elizabeth II. Val accompanied our Prime Minister to the funeral service of Her Majesty and ably represented all of us there.Val has taken her time as Senior Australian of the Year very seriously and has worked hard to achieve a legacy of improvement. In particular, Val has been campaigning to get more young people trained in first aid skills. The criticality of the application of first aid during accidents is clear. An injured person is much more likely to recover and survive if first aid is applied while medical assistance is en route. Given the number of our young people who are, sadly, caught up in motor vehicle accidents, its essential that more of them have the skills to help save a life. Vals vision is that first aid courses be mandatory for all learner drivers in the course of obtaining their permits. Data from other jurisdictions suggests that this could be life saving. I believe this is a sensible proposal to embed an important life skill in our community.

Affordable access to Opicapone will give John such a quality of life, and now it is on PBS. It will deliver a saving of around $1,800 a year for John and for so many others. The Albanese governments cheaper medicines policy, launched last month, means Opicapone will now cost just $30 per prescription or $7.30 with a concession card.Last week I also visited Cottage Pharmacy in Grovedale with the Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care, Ged Kearney, to meet with pharmacists and families. We explained that our governments cheaper medicines policy means savings are $150 per year for one monthly script, or between $300 and $450 for two-to-three monthly scripts. Since last July, extra funding has also been approved for 65 new and amended medicines listed on the PBS.

Twelve-year-old Aidan Really raises funds and donates the money as petrol vouchers to the Grafton Base Hospital oncology unit. In 2021 Aidan sadly lost his dad to bowel cancer. Ever since, he and his mum, Veronica, have donated petrol vouchers to ensure families have the resources to drive and see their loved ones in care at the Grafton Base Hospital. Aidan witnessed the difficulty families face with the cost of travelling in some cases long distance to see family and friends in hospital. This motivated him to raise $5,000 in early 2022. The accomplishment inspired Aidan to do it again, and he raised another $5,000 for Christmas.

When asked why he does this, he said, Making a difference is the only reward I need.

Wendy published poetry and fiction, including crime novels and childrens books. She worked at Fremantle Press for 43 years, during which time she assessed more than 10,000 manuscripts. Without doubt, Wendys intelligence, generosity and work ethic helped hundreds of Australian writers into print. One of those books was Albert Faceys AFortunate Life. It became an unlikely but irresistible Australian classic. My wife, Georgia, worked with Wendy at Fremantle Press, and, for anyone hearing this who would like to reflect more deeply on Wendys life and art, Georgias eulogy is a beautiful thing and easy to find through the presss website.On behalf of the Fremantle community, I would like to remember the powerful contribution that Wendy and other poets played in the battle to protect the Beeliar Wetlands six years ago. On a personal note, I was buoyed by the fact that Wendy, who really valued her own time and space, was prepared to don the red Labor T-shirt and campaign with me in Fremantle. The final words, though, must go to Georgia:There was nobody else in this world like Wendy Jenkins. I so hope that for this brilliant, questing spirit there is a pen and a notepad waiting on the other side for her.","Jenkins, Ms Wendy Elizabeth","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[8]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr JOSH WILSON (Fremantle) ","(16:10):"

Its a fantastic school, and it was good to catch up recently with Jade Toofohe, the president of the P&C. The P&C has a lot of plans for this year, coming off the strength of that great centenary year. There are a number of proposals for various building works and other activities.

The Goldstein medal recognises young leaders who demonstrate Vida Goldsteins values of leadership, service to community and respect of peers. These are traits that Bianca Adler, a year 9 student, demonstrated when becoming one of the youngest people ever to climb Mount Aconcagua over summer. At a height of 6,961 metres, its the highest mountain in the Andes and the highest mountain outside of the Himalayas. To achieve this, Bianca trained for over a year, including by climbing the almost 6,000-metre Pokalde Peak in Nepal in September and Mont Blanc in July. For reference, Australias highest peak, Mount Kosciuszko, is 2,228 metres. To prepare for the summit, Bianca spent three weeks in a small tent to gradually climb the mountain and acclimatise. The summit involved 13 hours of climbing in minus-35-degree temperatures, facing the real threat of frostbite. Bianca made it to the summit and back down safely, much to the relief of her parents. When I met Bianca to discuss her remarkable achievement, we talked about how pushing boundaries can inspire others, especially other girls and women.

Fast forward to today and St John the Baptist is a thriving primary school with 508 students, offering classes from kindergarten all the way to year 6 with an emphasis on Catholicism and Christianity, although not on the original site. It has now moved to a much larger location in south Woy Woy, boasting modern classrooms with flexible learning arrangements and the latest technology to give those young minds on the Central Coast and on the peninsula where I grew up the best start in life for their education. I wish to commend the diocese of Broken Bay, principal Nicole Davies, teachers, students and the wider Catholic community on the Central Coast for this celebratory occasion. Best wishes to the school for many more years ahead.","Robertson Electorate: St John the Baptist Catholic Primary School","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[26]/speech/talk.text/body/p","Dr REID (Robertson) ","(16:37):"

One of the reasons cited for the closures is the Albanese governments changes to distribution priority areas, which now make it easier to recruit doctors in metropolitan areas but much harder to bring them to regional communities. Another reason is the indexation of Medicare rebates, which havent kept pace with rising cost pressures and dont adequately compensate GPs.Imbils medical centre has served the Mary Valley for 20 years. Its a growing community, but the medical centres closure has triggered Imbils pathology to close, and we risk losing other health services in the town. With no other GP practice, nor any public transport to get to one, Imbils elderly, infirmed and ill are unable to travel the 30 kilometres to Gympie to get to a GP. Pomonas medical clinic closure leaves its 3,000 patients with no doctor, and they have to travel to Cooroy for GP access.Every election, Labor promise to save Medicare, but theyre letting bulk-billing rates drop and vital GP clinics close. We need immediate action to ensure people can access a local doctor when they need it.

When the modern constitution in Iran was enacted in 1906, it promised equal rights before the law, but Iranian women were denied the right to vote and treated as second-class citizens. But they did not go quietly into the night. Iranian women and men protested; they took to the streets and marched. Eventually women were given the right to vote, six decades later. Those hard-won freedoms and rights were snatched away after 1979, but, again, they did not go silently into the night.Iranian women today carry the fighting spirit of generations of Iranian women before them, continuing to fight for their human rights, continuing to demand their right to live freely as equal citizens. It was the death of Mahsa Amini in September last year that brought on this new civil rights movement, led by women and supported by men. Iranian women have had to live in a world where freedoms are granted inch by inch, after decades of fighting, but then brutally and quickly snatched away. Yet, throughout it all, their spirit remains unbroken. They continue to fight just as they always have, and we stand willing to support them.","Iran: Human Rights","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[28]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms SITOU (Reid) ","(16:41):"

What I mean is, when it comes to our mental health, our schooling and our community, we often get spoken over or spoken to rather than letting us into the conversation.We would like people to ask us what we want.I believe that we need more community organisations like Tribe Monbulk Youth, with better funding. Easier access and more services to help with young people experiencing issues with mental health.We want to be involved and together we can really change the way young people seek support and services from health to social services to financial and to wellbeing services.When a Government listens and asks us what we want to see regarding issues that affect us, we feel heard and supported and there are better outcomes for young people. We would like open and honest conversations.We would like the new parliament to consider young voices when forming legislation around issues that affect youth in 2022 and beyond.(Time expired)","Youth Voice in Parliament Week","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[29]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr VI OLI (Casey) ","(16:42):"

"0","0","0","1","2","Hastie, Andrew MP","260805","Canning","LP","N/A","170"," I move:That this House:(1) notes that:(a) the Government has committed to the former Governments objective of growing the Australian Defence Force (ADF) by 18,500 people by 2040;(b) to meet the objective, there must be net growth of 1,000 people per year; and(c) the ADF recruitment numbers currently sit at a net growth of approximately 300 people per year; and(2) calls on all Members to:(a) recognise that our regional security environment is deteriorating;(b) acknowledge that Australia must build a strong and capable ADF;(c) focus on how we find, recruit and retain young men and women we need to build the ADF into the future; and(d) build a strong values based narrative of service, duty and country in appealing to our next generation of ADF recruits.It is now the consensus view that our strategic environment is the most challenging and complex it has been since the Second World War, something we on this side of the House have been talking about for some time, and the Deputy Prime Minister and the Prime Minister both acknowledged this very recently. If you look back over the last year, there are plenty of indicators: Russias illegal invasion of Ukraine; the no-limits partnership struck between President Xi and President Putin; and, of course, the Chinese surveillance balloons over the continental US these past few days. Things are dangerous and dynamic, and the risk of miscalculation is much larger than it was five years ago.The opposition will be watching the outcomes of the Defence Strategic Review closely, and we welcome the Prime Ministers comments in The Weekend Australian Magazinelast November that the government will spend whatever is necessary to produce the Defence Force that could defend Australia. This is particularly appreciated following the October budget, as the message it sent did not inspire confidence. The government of the day has a moral obligation to the Australian people to build and maintain a strong deterrent to any aggressor. Given the stakes, the coalition will always work constructively with the government to build a strong and capable Australian Defence Force over the next two decades. The Albanese government has committed to the former coalition governments objective of growing the ADF by 18,500 people by 2040. That is a net growth of 1,000 people per year, noting that in recent years recruitment has only managed net growth of 300 people. This is a huge task. We must focus on how we find, recruit and retain young men and women for our future Defence Force.There are a few things I want to make clear today. Firstly, we need a message that appeals to young hearts and minds, emphasising the ethos of service, duty, honour and country. They are Anzac values and they are timeless, but if you watch a recruitment ad today, or over the last few years, you might think joining the ADF was simply a vehicle for self-actualisation. Yes, there are benefits to service, but we need something more than self-interest if were going to grow the Defence Force by a thousand people per year in a tight labour market. Even an article by the Australian Army Research Centre recently recognised the need for a new narrative around military service. The next generation is waiting to be inspired and challenged by traditional values of service to country and to fellow Australians.Secondly, we must make onboarding faster. It currently takes 292 days, from first contact to recruit training. This is not good enough. The Australian Public Service is achieving the same milestone in around 140 days, which is still a long time.Thirdly, we must remove barriers to service, often bureaucratic ones. As Assistant Minister for Defence last parliament and now shadow minister for defence, I hear from too many young Australians who get turned away because theyve had a shoulder injury from rugby or football, a food allergy or, in one case, were medicate for ADHD in their childhood—all talented, motivated kids, turned away because of risk culture. We need to move beyond the one-size-fits-all model and select kids who might not tick all the boxes but who can get the job done, and then some.Fourthly, we need to do a better job of keeping people in the ADF—retention. That could mean allowing them to study at a civilian university mid-career or taking a posting in the private sector, where they might gain critical skills in a different setting. I think incentives for homeownership are also important, especially for a generation that feels locked out of the housing market. We need more pathways to return to uniform, not just pathways out.Finally, we need to think about how we look after our serving families. Operations, career courses and exercises take time away from the family. COVID demonstrated that we can achieve a lot through online learning, which may well save on travel and time away, particularly for ADF career courses. I remember, about 10 years ago, speaking to an Army psychologist who was talking about the tempo and the impact it was having on families. A lot of us were doing six months away, coming back for a brief time and then moving on to a career course on the east coast or elsewhere. He said its the equivalent of running a marathon and then, at the end of the race, having someone hand you a kettlebell and say, Here, swing this for 30 minutes. Weve got to learn how to rest people so that theyre fit to fight, train and do their job in the Defence Force. We must balance the benefits of bringing people together with managing the risks of keeping families apart.Its going to be a busy decade ahead, and I hope this can be part of an ongoing conversation. The opposition stands ready to support the government in growing the ADF. It is simply responsible national security, and it is what Australians expect.","Defence Recruitment","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr HASTIE (Canning) ","(16:45):"

"0","0","0","1","2","Hill, Julian MP","86256","Bruce","ALP","N/A","171"," I want to thank the shadow minister for bringing the motion for debate, and I acknowledge his service and genuine and abiding interest in defence and defence personnel issues. Although I havent served, we know each other and I trust hed acknowledge my genuine and longstanding interest, since I was elected, in defence personnel issues and now as chair of the defence subcommittee.The motion is correct: the former government did indeed announce plans to grow Defence by 18,500 people from 2024 to 2040. I want to be very clear: I do support such significant growth in the ADF. It is necessary given our deteriorating strategic circumstances, and its essential if were going to operate new stuff. Theres not much point investing hundreds of billions of dollars in new capability and kit and all the money that goes into sustainment if you dont have the skilled people to operate it. You cant just recruit them; it takes years, or in some cases decades, to get senior technicians and senior officers baked, skilled and ready.But its important also to understand the context. The previous government grew the ADF by 2,000 people in 10 years. The previous governments announcement of the increase was just that: an announcement. None of it was funded. The billions of dollars you need to recruit 18,500 people over that time span were not in the budget. Indeed, there was no plan for delivery. It wasnt only a lack of funding; there was no actual plan for delivery. The motion is right: in recent years, the average net gain, instead of the 1,000 we need, has been about 300. Its a serious issue and a big problem, but, sadly, it is another example of the former Prime Ministers penchant for making announcements, with lots of flags behind him in this case, but not actually delivering or taking it seriously. It wasnt just the vaccines. He was making announcements with no delivery plan in the critical realm of national security and defence, in the dying days of a dying government.The current government didnt create the problem, but we will take responsibility for addressing it, and all ideas are welcome. I appreciate many of the thoughts and contributions of the shadow minister. To be fair, its a tough recruiting environment, as they say. Over the last year, Ive chatted to senior officers and junior officers about exactly this issue. When the economy is going well, Defence struggles. When the economys not going well, Defence finds it easier to recruit, because its competing with private sector salaries. In the case of technicians, the people who, frankly, we should have on red alert right now—cyber specialists and grease monkeys, as one of them called themselves—these are people who can earn vastly larger sums in the private sector. Defence is competing with mining, oil, gas, resources, construction and so on, but its not just a now issue. As I said, the pipeline has a 10-year impact.The motion appeals for the values based narrative of service, duty and country in appealing to our next generation of ADF recruits. These are worthy and noble values—Anzac values, as was said. They sound great, and theyll no doubt play well in the party room, but we need to be far more focused, forensic, deliberate and serious if were going to actually fix this problem.The first point is that we need to focus most urgently on retention, not recruitment. I put this to the Chief of the Defence Force directly—Im not breaking any state secrets—to say its an in-and-out equation. The quickest, most urgent thing we can do is to slow the rate of people moving, stabilise the situation and focus our efforts on that while we do that work and wait for the economy to change. Thats just a mathematical fact. We need to not get swayed about values and ads on TV; we need to look at the here and now and what we do to persuade, convince, cajole and reward people to stay in the service. That, indeed, is what the Chief of the Defence Force said.The government is awaiting the recommendations of the Defence Strategic Review, announced by the Prime Minister, and the Force Posture Review, because its not just about numbers of course; its about where you want people. You cant really shape a recruitment strategy until you have some clue about where youre trying to recruit people and ask them to serve and stay.The government has a new recruiting services contract to enable Defence to update its recruitment system. Its a range of marketing, IT systems, medical and psychological testing—all that kind of stuff, as youd expect. And we should be market testing, frankly. I hate to say it, but we really need evidence, not assertions, as to what the best recruiting methods will be. I wouldnt suggest the former Prime Minister, the marketing guy, be let anywhere near this, but he could do redemption, I suppose, with a bit of free advice. But one of the key aspects of the new contract is to drive down the time it takes to recruit someone—","Defence Recruitment","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr HILL (Bruce) ","(16:50):"

Thats not something any of us want. It is something all of us want to do everything we can to avoid. Whether or not this general is correct only time will tell, but one thing is for sure: we are definitely well within the 10-year window of warning.All of us here will agree, and I have said before, that we are facing the most geopolitically uncertain times since World War II. That, of course, means we must do absolutely everything we can to be battle ready. We dont seek war, but we must be prepared for it. We dont want to fight, but we must have the ability to do so.In talking about recruitment and retention, I think it needs to be flipped on its head. Why do our brave young men and women want to join the Australian Defence Force? Why did they enlist, and what will keep them employed? I think its good that our Defence Force has helped out through natural disasters—fires, floods and cyclones—and through Operation COVID-19 Assist, but its not the primary role of our ADF. The primary role of our ADF is to fight and win our wars, to protect this country. Weve seen all governments use our ADF as first responders. We are too small and too busy to have the Australian Defence Force as any governments first responders, and its not why they signed up. Its not why they joined their profession. To keep people and to recruit people, you need to allow our soldiers, our sailors and our aviators to do their job, whether its on deployment, whether its in a training team, whether its overseas in a training capacity, in a non-kinetic or non-warlike kind of place, whether its in the States or in the UK. We have a lot of US soldiers and marines come to Australia and up into the Top End, into Darwin, but we dont have a lot of our soldiers going over there.I dont think we need, as was highlighted, to get more officers into more degrees; I think we need to get soldiers doing their jobs. That is, if theres a long peacetime—so theyre not deploying to Afghanistan and theyre not deploying on combat operations—then lets get our people overseas into the UK. If you take a section or a platoon over to the UK, to Japan or to the States, those soldiers will stay forever and they will teach and train younger soldiers. We have a recruitment and retention issue with the enlisted soldier. We know what appeals to people—well, my generation—to get them to enlist. It was to protect and serve our nation and, at some stage, to deploy and fight, which happened, but we dont do that at the moment. Thats not happening, so we need to have other tools to help our soldiers want to enlist and then to keep them. There are some things like that that we can do, but there are also things that we shouldnt do. We cant just focus on the recruitment; we must also focus on the retention.You must be able to have the kit to fight in. You must be able to have the stuff that you can train in and that you can deploy in, and you must be up-front with the soldiers, aviators and sailors. In Townsville, the announcement to remove the MRH-90 helicopter out of our region without talking, without telling and without bringing the community along will cost jobs and will see families leave a place where they wanted to grow their family. It will see people leaving the beautiful place of Townsville. Thats not what you do. If you want to refocus an asset, you talk with the community about why. We must protect our soldiers, aviators and sailors with secure jobs.","Defence Recruitment","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr THOMPSON (Herbert) ","(16:56):"

I thank him for his service to our nation.The Albanese Labor government has committed to ensuring that our Defence Force continues to recruit and keep ADF personnel to meet our current and future defence needs. We have a target to expand our ADF by 18,500 personnel by 2040. Unfortunately, the previous government left us to start from behind the eight ball. Im excited to see how my friend the Minister for Defence Personnel, whose electorate neighbours both my electorate and the member for Cannings electorate, will address the recruitment objectives that this government has committed to. Im confident in the minister.I want to address one of the points in the member for Cannings motion. The previous government was reckless and only made progress to weaken and worsen the relationships that Australia has with its closest neighbours, its biggest trading partners and even an ally that was going to build a submarine for us. The previous government didnt just put its foot in it; it looked at the relationships that are so vital for peace and prosperity in our region and treated them like a kicked-in bickie tin. The previous government did more harm than good for our nation and for our regional security environment. Everyone in our nation has seen how quickly the Albanese Labor government has worked to rebuild relationships with our neighbours, greeting them as our brothers and sisters and working with them to build bridges.Soon we will know the outcome of the Defence Strategic Review. We will have a greater insight into how our country can be a greater leader in this region and work together with our neighbours, near and far, to continue to propagate peace and rise to challenges, in cooperation with one another. Our greatest challenge will not be one another but our failure to see our neighbour as our neighbour. In this pursuit we must take great care to not lose sight of our ability to do good for others. Every day there is an opportunity for Australia to work in our region to remove trade barriers, develop industry and improve the provision of and opportunity for prosperity and cooperation within our world. If we were to measure the first few months of this governments time in office, again and again we would see this government embracing its neighbour and moving towards old friendships the previous government had let sour. I have a hope. Please allow me to speak in my mother tongue: hua gange weiyubo. In Bahasa Malaysia: Menukarkan Senjata kepada sutera jed. In English it means to work for peace.Im proud of the actions of this government and confident our government will continue to repair the relationships that had been so badly damaged by the previous government.

The ADF is extremely important to Australians. Knowing we have a strong and capable defence force makes Australians feel safe and secure. It ensures our freedom, which, as Australians, we are proud of and thankful for. The previous coalition government had foresight and committed to growing the Australian Defence Force to ensure Australians readiness for our ever-changing world. To meet this commitment there must be a net growth of 1,000 new recruits per year. Currently, we are sitting at a rate of just 300.With these stats in mind, it makes me wonder: why is it that more young people arent considering employment in the Australian Defence Force? It isnt because patriotism is lost. Just look at the youth attendance at our Anzac Day, Remembrance Day and Vietnam Veterans Day services, with crowd numbers increasing year on year. Every Australian has a connection with a veteran in some way. But we must look after our dedicated men and women once they return home. Anyone who is considering joining the Australian Defence Force knows that their life will change. They know that they might see or have to do something unthinkable. They know its a high-risk industry and there is a possibility of injury, emotional scarring and even death. But what these men and women dont know is this: will they and their families have the support and services they need upon returning home?Before the 2022 election, the coalition committed to much needed funding for veterans in my region, with $5 million secured for an RSL facility in Mackay and a wellness centre at Kinchant Dam. This was cut in Labors October budget. These vital services are a must-have for my people and the surrounding region. We have too many veterans feeling the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder with no support whatsoever.Local legend Keith Payne VC, AM, who fought in the Vietnam War, explained: Its either suicide or going crook at the family. Somethings got to give. Keith has dedicated his whole life to our nation. He was posted to the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, back in 1951. Since then he has served our country with dignity and honour. In the Vietnam War he spent three hours searching for wounded troops, all while defending them from incoming Vietnamese soldiers. When asked whether he was afraid, he said: My God, yes! Yes, I was!People like Keith and his family need support services available to them, no matter where they choose to live. There are almost 4,000 vets like Keith in the Mackay region alone. How can we stand here and expect the next generation to serve when they can clearly see that our veterans are not even granted basic support services? And this is after they have put their bodies on the line for our country. If we want to see more young guns joining the ranks—and we do—we need to show them that we treat our past service men and women with respect and honour and look after them when they return home.At the end of the day, our vets are the heart and soul of our nation. They are the reason we are the lucky country, the reason we enjoy our freedom and the reason we sit back, have a beer, fire up the barbie on Saturday and enjoy our Aussie way of life. To build our ADF, the next generation need to know that we will support them and that support will be available to them when they return to our shores when their service is done. Without the support and the services, some veterans may feel suicide is the only way out of their trauma and suffering. We cannot wait any longer. I urge the Labor government to get the vets of Dawson the support that they deserve. They have fought for our country.","Defence Recruitment","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr WILLCOX (Dawson) ","(17:05):"
"0","0","0","1","2","Gosling, Luke MP","245392","Solomon","ALP","N/A","174"," I welcome the member for Cannings motion on growing the ADF by 18,500 people by 2040. This, of course, is of burning national interest, and both sides of the House and the Senate should support it with more than words. But Ill give it a crack with words.The member for Canning started his contribution by talking about how those in opposition, who were in government for 10 years before belatedly announcing an increase to troops, understood the changing geostrategic circumstances. Id just point out to him—hes not here, unfortunately, but I would say it to his face—that understanding geostrategic circumstances is more than joining a group like the Wolverines. It is important that were mature. It is important that we attack the issues that we have, like recruitment and retention, in a constructive and bipartisan way.Defence currently employs 77,000 uniformed personnel, which is 5.4 per cent, or 4,000 Australians, below the minimum that we require. The defence minister pointed to what he called a personnel crisis driven by a growing inability to retain ADF members. The Labor Party, in government, has committed to boosting the force by 18,500 out to 2040, reaching around 101,000, including Defence civilians. So far, the Department of Defence has planned growth of 12,500 people, of whom 10,450-odd will be uniformed Australian Defence members and 2,000-odd will be Australian public servants.We are awaiting the recommendations of the Defence Strategic Review announced by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in August last year, but there are things that we can do and there are things that we are doing right now. Defence has already started making changes to drive recruitment and retention and to grow its workforce, including but not limited to expanding the ADF family health benefit, which increases the reimbursable services and allowances for the dependants of ADF members. This came into effect in December last year under our government. The changes include changing remote locality leave travel, which includes an additional trip home per year for those working in remote locations. This came into effect in November 2022. As a former member of the ADF who did work in different places around Australia and overseas, I know that being reunited and getting home is important for morale and will help with retention. The changes include changing defence travel policy to make allowances more accessible. This came into effect in October 2022 and has received significant positive feedback from defence personnel, so the opposition defence spokesman should speak to them about that. Wed welcome further ideas. The changes include expanding the Defence Assisted Study Scheme and StudyBank programs, aimed at improving and increasing access to educational opportunities. This came into effect in late January 2023, with benefits realised from the new 2023 academic year onwards. Assisting ADF members with pathways for their future will help with retention and recruiting. The revised ADF higher duties allowance policy, which comes into effect in early 2023, will properly compensate ADF members when they conduct higher duties, which is appropriate, overdue and very much needed.The motion of the member for Canning rightly points to the need to build a strong values based narrative of service, duty and country to appeal to new ADF recruits, and I agree this is a critical factor. In an insightful piece from the Australian Army Research Centre, Tingting Luo, an Army officer who worked in the 6th Brigade and 7th Brigade, pointed to three limitations. She calls for recruitment campaigns as a lifestyle choice—we need to change that; more flexibility; and, finally, a new recruitment and retention taskforce. They are all good ideas, and I welcome them. As we grow the force, we will need all sorts of ideas. Our government is getting on with the task of growing our ADF for the challenges that we will face in the near future.","Defence Recruitment","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr GOSLING (Solomon) ","(17:10):"
"0","0","0","1","2","Tink, Kylea MP","300124","North Sydney","IND","N/A","175"," According to Sun Tzu, the art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy not coming but on our own readiness to receive him, not on the chance of him not attacking but rather on the fact we have made our position unassailable. This wisdom was offered over 2,500 years ago, yet it appears Australia is still grappling with the lesson. Rather, our defence strategy to date has been largely based on the key assumption that our key ally, America, is the pre-eminent power in the Asia-Pacific region—therefore it is unlikely that Australia would face a military threat from a major power, because America would prevent that kind of threat from emerging and, if for some reason we were threatened, America would come to our defence. That may have been a fine assumption over the course of the last 80 years, but, with the shifting geopolitical environment, we must consider more seriously than ever before whether Australia can defend itself independently and, if so, how.The motion moved by the member for Canning is very timely. I agree with him. There are new threats and, I agree, we need to prioritise not just developing new capabilities but also building a strong values-based narrative of service, duty and country. However, I would add to his argument that, for our approach to be most effective, we must also be willing to divest from strategies that no longer serve us or that provide a less than optimal return.There are just over 26 million people in Australia, and population growth has been stable at one per cent a year. My understanding is that the size of our current ADF has also remained relatively stable in recent times, with just over 58,500 defence personnel, including a much smaller number of frontline combat personnel currently in service. Nearly 22,000 reserve personnel are also enlisted, which means just 0.3 per cent of our community could be mobilised relatively quickly should we come under direct attack. This is a fraction of the size of the forces of neighbouring middle-power countries such as South Korea and Indonesia, with each dwarfing Australias military capability, with nearly 600,000 and 340,000 troops respectively. China boasts the largest military in the world, with more than two million troops and a naval force that has more than tripled in size over the past two decades.Looking at our circumstance, Greg Moriarty, the Secretary of the Department of Defence, noted in the 2021-22 Australian government Defence annual report that the ADF remains focused on continuing to build a diverse and inclusive culture for our people. However, he did not specifically address the challenge of increasing its numbers. He did, though, reference the ADFs focus on achieving range and survivability. In the same report, General Angus J Campbell AO, DSC, Chief of the Defence Force, said:People are the most important component of military capability … The success of the Australian Defence Force, like a nation, lies in the character of its people and the culture of our teams.Again, he did not specifically address how we build a force that can defend our continent independently from a direct attack.In a world where there is no imminent threat to our nation, how do we encourage every Australian to consider what role they can play in ensuring our long-term strategic independence without simply fear mongering? According to 2022 Lowy Institute poll, Australians sense of safety has been up and down in recent years. Russias invasion of Ukraine and instability closer to home appears to have affected public opinion, with just over half of Australians reporting they felt safe or very safe. This is down from 70 per cent in 2021. Three in five Australians also reported theyre concerned about a potential conflict in the Taiwan Strait, up from 36 per cent in 2017. Australians also expressed high levels of concern about non-traditional security threats, with two-thirds citing cyberattacks from other countries and a similar number citing climate change as posing critical threats. Yet, if enlistment numbers are anything to go by, the sense of increasing risk is not translating into action.We do not have the compulsory military training of Scandinavian and some EU countries to ensure an ever-ready sizable force can be stood up quickly if required, nor do we have the patriotic fever that comes with Americas military service. Its hard to see this changing, but, unless the Australian population is inspired to think and care about defence, we have little chance of meaningful change. This will require our government to develop and communicate clear priorities to both defence forces and our wider community, which sounds pretty straightforward but is likely to be anything but, as the ADF is a large and complex bureaucracy with many factions competing for limited resources. We must accept we cant protect ourselves from every conceivable threat and instead clearly articulate where we are going to take the risk and why. Success is far from guaranteed, and we all have an important role to play.","Defence Recruitment","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms TINK (North Sydney) ","(17:15):"

"0","0","0","1","2","Ananda-Rajah, Michelle MP","290544","Higgins","ALP","N/A","176"," I move:That this House:(1) acknowledges:(a) that the Government introduced legislation ten years ago to allow Australia to become the first country in the world to implement tobacco plain packaging in December 2012;(b) that the successful landmark tobacco plain packaging policy has saved countless lives;(c) that tobacco smoking remains the leading cause of preventable death and disability;(d) that in both health and economic terms of tobacco use, disadvantaged groups are hit more than three times harder than others in the community; and(e) the tireless support and dedication of many in the public health sector, including health workers and the former Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, who fought for the changes to introduce plain packaging; and(2) notes the comprehensive tobacco plain packaging strategy was multi layered to include:(a) tobacco plain packaging and graphic health warnings;(b) rolling tobacco excise increases;(c) advertising restrictions; and(d) public health campaigns and quit smoking support.Ten years on from the introduction of plain package for cigarettes, the impact of this historic and world-leading legislation is clear. The legislation, which came into effect in December 2012, was championed by Nicola Roxon as Minister for Health and Ageing in the Rudd government. It was the first of its kind in the world. The legacy of this reform stretches far beyond Australia as it has been adopted by 26 other nations, including peer countries like the UK, France and New Zealand.As a clinician I have seen the full range of effects of cigarette smoking on the body. Tobacco smoke is a toxic brew of at least 69 known carcinogens with equally toxic effects on every organ of the body. Lung cancer is the most well known, but there are well over 50 other deadly conditions that smoking increases your chance of acquiring. Long-term smokers die 10 years earlier than nonsmokers, and those deaths are not merciful. The number of patients I have treated whose condition has been caused or exacerbated by cigarette smoking is beyond counting: amputees in wheelchairs outside hospital still smoking, cardiac transplant patients with the telltale aroma at a clinic visit, the contrite diabetic who knows cigarettes and high sugars make toxic bedfellows. So alarmed was the Alfred Hospital, where I worked, that it set up a smoking cessation clinic to help patients stop before the op. A range of services were provided, from an initial consultation with a pharmacist to nicotine replacement therapies like gums, sprays and patches, and follow-up phone consultation.While we focus on the physical effects of smoking, little attention is paid to the tyranny of psychological addiction. In hospital it manifests as occupational violence towards healthcare workers, as nicotine withdrawal in patients can lead to delirium and irritability that, if not managed or recognised, escalate to violence, something I have researched and experienced firsthand. As a practising clinician at the time of these reforms, I was proud to be in a country that was spearheading this initiative, and Australians should be proud of these reforms. Before this legislation was passed, 16 per cent of Australians smoked. This number is now less than 11 per cent and falling. There are now one million fewer smokers than there were back in 2012, and the attendant health savings are immeasurable in value.The scourge of cigarettes is one that disproportionately affects First Nations and culturally diverse communities. It is believed that 23 per cent of the gap in health outcomes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people is driven by smoking. Softer strategies, like educational programs and quit lines, are less effective in these communities. We need better health promotion that is tailored to specific groups, but, as far as a population-level public health intervention goes, plain packaging was a winner. Plain packaging is at the centre of a comprehensive government strategy on smoking that includes rolling excise increases, restrictions on advertising, public health campaigns and greater accessibility to quit lines.Despite this multifaceted approach, we have much to do. The market has evolved, but government action, after a wasted decade under the Liberals, has lagged. The plain packaging legislation was the last major piece of legislation on tobacco control, and inaction on electronic cigarettes has left Australians lacking education and clear guidelines on the new wave of tobacco products. E-cigarettes no longer represent a new frontier in tobacco products, having been around in Australia since the early 2000s. However, messaging from the previous government had been unclear and confusing, leaving consumers unsure about the safety and even legality of these products. Despite the TGAs decision to ban the sale of nicotine vaping products, they remain easy to acquire throughout the country, to the extent that our children in schools are regularly being caught with these products. We recognise that clearer guidelines around vaping are required, and that is why we tasked the TGA to undertake a public consultation process to better understand what the gaps in the regulatory framework are—so that we in government can plug them.As a parliamentarian and a former clinician, I welcome the new measures announced by the health minister. These include making individual cigarettes with antismoking messages; making cigarettes in unattractive colours; preventing the addition of flavours and menthols to cigarettes; limiting that warm, fuzzy language like organic or light; and introducing new health promotion inserts into every single pack and pouch of tobacco. The plain packaging laws have been effective, but, after 10 years, new measures like this will provide a new and stark reminder to smokers about how harmful nicotine actually is. On vaping, there are new border controls to curb the unlawful supply of these products; pre-market TGA assessment of nicotine vapes to create a regulated source of products for doctors to prescribe and pharmacies to supply; and stronger product standards to make nicotine vaping products less attractive to children and adolescents through methods like branding and flavours.Reflecting on the historic plain package legislation 10 years on, we celebrate the courage of the Rudd government and Nicola Roxon to take on big tobacco, and we appreciate the value of public health—the quiet achiever in health care—in driving behaviour change across an entire nation.","Tobacco Plain Packaging","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr ANANDA-RAJAH (Higgins) ","(17:21):"

"0","0","0","1","2","Tink, Kylea MP","300124","North Sydney","IND","N/A","177"," In the 1980s it felt like everyone smoked. Indeed, at the time, 40 per cent of men and 29 per cent of women over 18 in Australia were smokers. In the years that followed, a dramatic picture of rapidly decreasing rates of smoking across the community emerged, as concerted, consistent and collaborative public health campaigns took effect. As the 1990s rolled around, Professor Mike Daube, then deputy chair of the Australian governments Preventative Health Taskforce, said, without prevarication, that public health campaigns had had a direct effect on the declining smoking rates and that this drop in smoking rates had been matched by a decrease in lung cancer deaths. The trend Professor Daube noted coincided with a period of new, well-funded quit campaigns and an upsurge in debate about tobacco control issues in the media.Its through this frame that I look at the motion moved by the member for Higgins today. At the time, I was working as part of that preventive health community, robustly discussing how we might reduce the number of people smoking whilst working to ensure the most vulnerable were not left to pay the highest price. It was an exciting time. The Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion had been developed in 1986 at the first international conference on health promotion. A first of its kind, the charter recognised the many determinants of health and provided those working across the community with a framework which identified five action areas to be used for effective health promotion. This was not about lecturing people about what was not good for them. Instead, we got smart and looked broadly across the environment to find ways we could help people make better decisions, better choices, simply by making the unhealthy ones harder to do. While I wasnt there when the charter was developed, its principles have fundamentally driven the majority of the work I have done in my lifetime. Today they continue to inform public health strategy universally and are also taught to students as part of the personal development, health and physical education program in high schools nationally.Fast forward to 2022, and the most recent ABS report shows three out of every five Australians over 18 have never smoked, and daily smokers have reduced to one in 10. Alarmingly, though, as smoking of tobacco has declined, we have seen the emergence of e-cigarettes and vaping devices. One in five people aged 18 to 24 now report that they have used one of these devices at least once. While e-cigarettes may represent potential pathways to quitting a nicotine habit, there are undeniable health risks associated with vaping. Coupled with the environmental impact of discarded canisters, there is little to like about vaping, from a public point of view. It seems we must yet again fight to create a healthy society as tobacco companies pivot their product offering.With all of this said, there is no doubt that the introduction of plain packaging of tobacco was a milestone moment in Australia. I certainly remember the courage that the then health minister, Nicola Roxon, showed as she worked to shepherd that reform through our parliament, but we must also never forget all of those who worked with her to make that possible—people like Professor Simon Chapman, an emeritus professor at Sydney University, who has worked for more than three decades as a researcher, commentator and activist in the areas of tobacco control, media coverage and health and illness risk communications; Anne Jones OAM, the former CEO of Action on Smoking and Health Australia; John Bevins, the former advertising director who developed the concept of a sponge ad for the New South Wales health apartment—his agency was one of the first to refuse tobacco accounts; Steve Woodward, who led the campaign for no less than seven private member and government bills in both federal and state parliaments to ban tobacco advertising; Hon Arthur Chesterfield-Evans, who, while serving as a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council, used his voice to advocate for more ambitious targets; anyone who ever worked in any of the health promotion units or NGOs, such as the Cancer Council, ASH, the quit campaigns or a cancer society; and, at the very least, the 200-odd people identified in the end notes in the landmark report The development of tobacco control: Australias role.Minister Roxon has this piece of legislation credited to her name, but it took cooperation across party lines and persistent advocacy from people outside government for this reform to eventuate. We must heed the lessons of that advocacy as we face the new trend of vaping. We cannot afford a lull in legislative activity concerning the supply of nicotine products, nor should there be any lessening of restrictions around where and when a person can vape. We must also ensure we continue to provide appropriate funding for public education, and, finally, we must be ever vigilant as to the distribution mechanisms of these products. Corner stores parading as candy convenience outlets whilst also selling non-nicotine vapes, and the opening of tobacco retailers close to schools must not be allowed. We must come together again as a committee to hold our ground.","Tobacco Plain Packaging","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms TINK (North Sydney) ","(17:27):"

Actually, it has been reported that three of the actors who appeared in that advertising campaign, one of the most successful of all time, died from cancer. One of those actors was Wayne McLaren. He contracted lung cancer in the early 1990s. Hed been smoker for 25 years and died in 1992 at the age of 51. The company, Philip Morris, initially denied that hed appeared in the ads but later admitted he had. McLaren spent his last few years testifying in favour of antismoking legislation and trying to convince the company to limit tobacco advertising. It is said that some of his last words were:Take care of the children. Tobacco will kill you, and I am living proof of it.This should be a bipartisan approach, and I commend the member for Higgins for moving this motion. Last year Australia marked the 10th anniversary of Labors world-leading tobacco plain packaging laws, an anniversary worth celebrating. It ranks as one of the greatest legacies of the former Labor government, along with achievements like the National Disability Insurance Scheme, needs-based funding for education, and the National Broadband Network. The introduction of plain packaging by the Gillard government in December 2012 was a historic world first and a significant public health policy. Its something that has been emulated by at least 26 countries around the world.Thanks to that landmark legislation, Australia now has some of the toughest and most comprehensive antismoking measures in the world. These laws remove tobacco company logos and include new and larger graphic health warnings. Taking a preventative health approach, we made it easier for Australians to kick the habit, with a range of initiatives that included graphic health warnings, rolling out tobacco excise increases, advertising restrictions, public health campaigns and quit-smoking support. Smoking rates in Australia have declined from 16 per cent to 11 per cent. As the member for Higgins rightly pointed out, a million fewer Australians now smoke. She is an eminent scientist and clinician, and I commend her for the work she does.Tobacco use has a disproportionate impact on the health and economic outcomes of disadvantaged groups, people with mental health issues, First Nations people and working class people. In my experience growing up, it was so common for people to smoke, and Im so fortunate that I didnt take it up. In terms of our First Nations people, nearly a quarter of adverse health outcomes can be attributed to the Indigenous people of this country smoking in too large a number.This should be a bipartisan approach, but, can I say, where are the Liberal and National party members here? Where are they? I well remember when we introduced this hard-fought vision because during that Gillard era I was the assistant minister for health and aging. I remember it. The Labor government stared down fierce opposition from an unholy alliance between the coalition and tobacco companies. The then opposition leader Tony Abbott claimed that plain packaging was tax policy, not health policy! Of course we had $300,000 of donations from tobacco companies to the Liberal and National parties in 2009, with $430,000 of donations since plain packaging came into effect.Indeed, I remember when the current Leader of the Opposition was shadow health minister. I remember it really well. He described world-leading and life-saving reforms as a bridge to far. I remember the vitriol and the hyperbole we had from those opposite, and they havent even got the grace to come in here and talk about it. Where are they? I commend the crossbenchers for doing so. Well done. It goes to show they are interested in this policy as well. The reality on so many issues is the Liberal and National parties go missing—missing on workplace relations, action on climate change and integrity issues in terms of transparency and accountability and governance—and theyve gone missing today as they did 10 years ago. They were completely out of touch on this issue. They are on the wrong side of history when it comes to plain packaging and tobacco control.I want to commend Nicola Roxon. She was a feisty individual. She was tough. She took them on, and she got this achieved. There were many people, including public servants, health groups around the country, the AMA and a whole bunch of organisations, all backing us. The secretary of the department was terrific, and there were so many great people. I want to thank Nicola Roxon for her courage and conviction in tackling tobacco smoking. And I want to thank the member for Higgins for doing the right thing, not only caring for people in her clinical practice but now also caring for people in her parliamentary practice and for bringing this motion before the chamber.","Tobacco Plain Packaging","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr NEUMANN (Blair) ","(17:32):"

But now, as a doctor, I am alarmed at the prospect of Australia once again having the wool pulled over our eyes by the tobacco industry as they prey on our children by the portal of e-cigarettes.Before I address the threat of e-cigarettes, however, Id like to take this opportunity to reflect on the many public health initiatives that Australian health professionals fought for so tenaciously in order to reduce smoking related harms to Australians, harms such as cancer and emphysema. A multiplicity of health professionals campaigned doggedly for decades helping Australia to join the front line of global tobacco control. Ill just mention a couple today, but Professor Simon Chapman, renowned tobacco control academic and advocate, deserves a special mention. As does Professor Melanie Wakefield and her team at the Cancer Council, whose work established the vital negative link between plain packaging and cigarette smoking.The approach to cut smoking rates in this country was multifaceted and grew in momentum over time. In 1976 a ban on the advertising of tobacco products on TV and radio was implemented. Later ads were also banned at sporting events. Then, tobacco companies sponsorship of sport was proscribed and smoking in workplaces, restaurants and on planes forbidden. Taxes on tobacco products were gradually increased, and graphic warnings on packets mandated. Then, as we have heard, in December 2012, Australia became the first country in the world to implement plain packaging laws. Within three years of this legislation being introduced, an estimated 100,000 fewer Australians smoked. By 2019, 16 countries had followed Australias lead, adopting plain packaging rules. In the last three decades, smoking rates have gone from 24 per cent to 11 per cent. Yet here we are, 10 years on from that success, readying ourselves for another battle—the battle against e-cigarettes, Tobacco 2.0. This time it is our children who are the targets of the industrys predatory behaviour, with brightly coloured packaging and lolly-like flavours.I choose to use the term e-cigarettes deliberately, rather than the softer, more common sounding vaping, which positions e-cigarettes as less harmful, less addictive and less worrying. In fact, scientists do not consider them to be safe. On the contrary, the WHO has confirmed that e-cigarette emissions typically contain nicotine and other toxic substances that are harmful to both users and non-users who are exposed to those aerosols second hand. Dont be fooled by the sweet smell of emissions. E-cigarettes can contain as many as 200 toxic chemicals. A single disposable product can contain as much nicotine as 50 traditional cigarettes and cost as little as $5. Not infrequently, they contain nicotine even if they are labelled nicotine free. Nicotine is one of the most addictive substances in existence, comparable to opioids and cocaine—not quite the cookies and cream or the strawberry kisses that the packaging promises.Research published as recently as December 2022 concluded that vaping is the strongest risk factor for smoking, and a recent study of adolescents in New South Wales reported that half of the children who regularly consumed e-cigarettes had never smoked previously. Media, school and community reports suggest that the use of e-cigarettes among young people in New South Wales has exploded in recent years. We also know that major international tobacco companies have invested heavily in e-cigarettes in recent years and now own many of the top e-cigarette brands. It seems like e-cigarettes are being used as a gateway drug to smoking, getting our young people addicted to nicotine. Data from New South Wales Ministry of Health shows that in 2021 the number— (Time expired)","Tobacco Plain Packaging","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr SCAMPS (Mackellar) ","(17:37):"

It is a triumph of public health policy. It is an achievement that occurred under a Labor government. Thats true for most of the significant health policies and programs that Australia has seen. We on this side of the House know, and they know in the Liberal-National coalition, that that is the case. They know it deep down, but they do know it. This is because the health of our nation is front and centre in what we all must achieve.Cigarette smoking is one of the leading preventable causes of mortality and continues to be responsible for countless deaths. When we examine the major causes of smoking related mortality, there are three major causes for me that stand out, and I know other clinicians in the room will have the same opinion. Those include atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. They include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which some of you may know as emphysema and chronic bronchitis. I remember the first patient that I ever saw in an emergency department, at Wyong Public Hospital. It was a patient lying in their bed in the acute section—I remember I was standing on the flight deck just across the other way—unable to speak because they were so breathless. Their breathlessness was severe, and on further evaluation and assessment it would be noted that that patient was having an exacerbation of their emphysema and of their chronic bronchitis. This patient also had a significant smoking history, which we know is a major risk factor for COPD.It is known that those who stop smoking reduce their risk of developing and dying from these tobacco related illnesses, and it is public policy such as tobacco plain packaging which involves a comprehensive multilayered strategy, including the graphic health warnings that we have seen, rolling tobacco excise increases, advertising restrictions, public health campaigns and quit smoking support, which helps reduce smoking in our community and saves the lives of many throughout our community.The consequences of tobacco smoking are extensive. Ill go into a few, but one example that I do want to expand on is the harmful effects of tobacco smoke on our cardiovascular health—that is, the health of the heart, the health of the blood and the health of the blood vessels. These harmful effects can include: coronary vasospasm—the blood vessels around the heart constrict leading to the heart muscle having less oxygen; increased hypercoagulability—the blood is thicker and that predisposes patients to blood clots; dyslipidaemia—the amount of fat in a patients blood becomes significantly dysregulated leading to things like heart attack and stroke; and myocardial infarction heart attack; sudden death; and stroke. This is the shortened list. This is the simplified list of only two organ systems that are affected. I know the member for Higgins and the member for Mackellar have spoken about some of the dangers of tobacco smoking and cigarette smoking but it can literally affect every organ in the human body. As the member for Higgins rightly said, in both health and economic terms of tobacco use, disadvantaged groups are hit harder, especially our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander brothers and sisters right across the country in every electorate.I want to finish not only by commending the incredible work of many in the public health sector and many in the research and the university sectors but also by making special mention of the former health minister, Nicola Roxon, in the former Rudd government, who fought tirelessly to ensure that this public health measure that not only saves lives but saves money in our economy—it helps our hospital system—became a reality.","Tobacco Plain Packaging","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr REID (Robertson) ","(17:42):"
"0","0","0","1","2","Perrett, Graham Douglas MP","HVP","Moreton","ALP","N/A","180"," Its been a little over 10 years since the introduction of Nicola Roxons plain packaging laws in Australia. I didnt hear all the speeches from the doctors on this side or from the speakers on that side. My understanding is, if the question is Did it work?, the answer is a very emphatic Yes. Plain packaging has helped reduce smoking and passive smoking right across the country. Not only that, but Australias world-leading approach has now been adopted by countries right across the globe. France, United Kingdom, New Zealand, Norway, Ireland, Thailand, Uruguay, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, Turkey, Israel, Canada, Singapore, Belgium, Netherlands, Hungary, Denmark, Guernsey and Jersey all have it in law. Myanmar, Finland, Armenia and Georgia will very soon follow in Nicola Roxons giant footsteps.I was in this House 10 years ago when this ground-breaking and world-leading legislation was introduced and, of course, as you would have expected, big tobacco and its supporters, such as the IPA, were bleating the loudest about how horrible this was and that it would not work. The Liberals, led by Tony Abbott, a former health minister, and the shadow health minister Peter Dutton, who later went on to be voted the worst health minister ever, initially refused to support this measure until they faced dissension in their ranks. I rarely saw eye to eye with the former member for Bowman, Andrew Laming—for many reasons—but he was one of the biggest supporters of the plain packaging legislation and his strident support forced the Liberals to eventually support it. It is interesting that there are no speakers from the Liberal Party on this topic today, which may explain why the seats of North Sydney, Mackellar and Higgins have changed. Of course, the Nationals werent fans either, but that is to be expected considering they were still taking money from Phillip Morris in 2020, so thats why the LNP were so hesitant to support this world-leading measure. But, when you go back to the record, its easy to see that back then they were repeating the speaking points of big tobacco. They said it would breach trademark law, international trade agreements and intellectual property rights. They said plain packaging was paternalistic and a nanny-state measure and it would reduce its goal of reducing smoking rates.There were some memorable contributions provided by the LNP during the debate. The former member for Dawson, George Christensen, said that smoking was fun—yes, thats right! Forget that smoking increases your chances of cancer, lung disease, heart disease and almost anything that will kill you: hey, kids, its fun! What a joke. Another lowlight was the member for Mitchell, who said:I have got news for the minister for health and the government: life kills people. Life is a dangerous activity. There are no laws that we can pass to prevent that.The member for Mitchell is still in the parliament. The rest of the LNP MPs and senators, who in 2012 were still taking tobacco money, lined up to promote big tobaccos talking points in parliament. They talked about big tobacco suing the Australian government and threw around numbers provided by those same companies, including Senator John Williams, who said:… Philip Morris Asia has lodged a claim for compensation of some $67.5 billion. … Tobacco companies are wealthy, which means they can employ good solicitors … it will cost Australian taxpayers billions and billions.Senators Cash and Birmingham, as well as the member for Mitchell, joined the conga line, channelling Chicken Little and claiming the sky was falling. Ultimately, big tobacco did get their day in court and lost.The other big tobacco talking points were about taking away peoples freedoms as part of a nanny state. George Christensen and the members for Riverina and Leichhardt all bemoaned how plain packaging was the start of the slippery slope to removing peoples choice. I think this was some of the same rubbish being spouted during the same-sex marriage debate—not by the member for Leichhardt; I will point that out. Again they leaned on the IPA to support their case. As we know, there isnt a bigger supporter of big tobacco than the IPA. At the time its poster boy was Tim Wilson—do you remember him?—who eventually briefly became the member for Goldstein, leading the charge for the IPA and big tobacco.Thankfully, the Labor government stood strong, and a big thankyou does need to go out to Nicola Roxon, former health minister and former Attorney-General, who stayed the path and got this important health measure through at the time. Australia is a healthier place for it. Judging by that list of countries, the world is a healthier place because of the work of Nicola Roxon and that adventurous Labor government that challenged big tobacco and won.Debate adjourned.","Tobacco Plain Packaging","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr PERRETT (Moreton) ","(17:47):"
"0","0","0","1","2","Pasin, Tony MP","240756","Barker","LP","N/A","181"," I move:That this House:(1) recognises that the:(a) fuel excise levied by the Commonwealth will raise $13.7 billion in 2022-23, and is expected to increase up to $15.8 billion in 2025-26; and(b) revenue raised by the fuel excise makes a significant contribution toward the costs of the development and maintenance, safety and efficiency of our road transport network;(2) notes that:(a) the budget shows 91 per cent of the fuel excise is being reinvested in land transport infrastructure in 2022-23 but is decreasing to 88 per cent by 2025-26; and(b) between the March and October 2022 budgets, land transport infrastructure spending decreased over the forward estimates by $4.33 billion; and(3) calls for the Government to allocate 100 per cent of fuel excise revenue for investment in road transport infrastructure.Fuel excise is an important contributor to the state and nature of our roads in Australia. You might ask: why is it important to have funds expended on our road network? Well, put simply, theres a safety requirement; theres also a productivity and efficiency requirement. In terms of the safety requirement, can I tell you that 1,200 people lost their lives last year on Australian roads and 40,000 people were seriously injured. I think that makes that case. In terms of productivity and efficiency, can I tell you that revenue raised by fuel excise cannot be underestimated in terms of the significant contribution it makes to the development and maintenance and safety and efficiency of our road network. Its trite to say, but I will say it, that building and maintaining a safe and efficient transport system is central to Australias continued economic prosperity. Land transport is an essential enabler of Australias economic growth, and a greater level of investment needs to be maintained.Fuel excise, which is collected at 47.7c in the litre, will deliver to the Australian general revenue some $13.71 billion in the 2022-23 financial year. Its projected to increase to $14.74 billion in 2023-24, $15.82 billion in 2024-25 and $15.87 billion in 2025-26. Its fair to say thats a gargantuan amount of money that Australian motorists will pay via taxes at the bowser.What Im concerned about, and what this motion alerts the parliament to, is that currently 91 per cent of the excise collected is expended on our land transport routes. Sadly, thats expected to decrease to 88 per cent by 2025-26. In the year just passed we had two budgets, which, of course, is unusual. We had the coalition budget in March and the Labor budget in October. Its my responsibility to highlight to this place, and to all of us more generally, that land transport infrastructure spending decreased by $4.33 billion between those two budgets—that is, between the March coalition budget and the October Labor budget. With respect, thats more money than you can fly a rocket ship over. Its money that is well and truly needed by our road network as it is burdened under the pressure of a lack of maintenance, made worse by the recent prolonged wet period.The coalition government presented the budget in March 2022, and it was packed with infrastructure investment. In fact, everybody knew that there was a $120 billion infrastructure pipeline. The coalition legacy included important programs to improve road safety, including upgrading key regional road corridors through the Roads of Strategic Importance initiative, safer local roads and bridges through the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program, the Roads to Recovery Program, the Black Spot Program, the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program and the Bridges Renewal Program. I could continue on and on, but I wont.What I want to do is extend a call. Its a call that the Australian Automobile Association, AAA, the peak motorist body in Australia, has also been making. And that is that 100 per cent of Australias fuel excise collected from motorists be expended on our road network, hypothecated for that purpose. At the end of the day, the average Australian family contributes approximately $1,188 a year in fuel excise. This is at a time when cost-of-living pressures have never been greater. I respectfully suggest to you they pay that money begrudgingly, at an opportunity cost to other things in their lives. The very least we can do is ensure that every single cent of that $1,188 is invested in the road network to make it safer, more efficient and more productive. Its my call and its the AAAs call. Its the only call that needs to be made in this space, and its one that Labor need to stand up for, even if some of you stand up too early.","Fuel","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr PASIN (Barker) ","(17:52):"

"0","0","0","1","2","Rae, Sam MP","300122","Hawke","ALP","N/A","182"," Thank you to the member for Barker for moving this motion about the contrast in approach between the former Liberal government and the Albanese Labor governments investment in transport infrastructure. The former Liberal government left a terrible economic legacy: a trillion dollars of debt with no meaningful economic dividend to show for it. For almost a decade, those opposite were making up infrastructure announcements and promises without thinking about how or when they could reasonably be delivered. They spent more time printing gloss than pouring concrete or asphalt. As a result, they left a catalogue of undercosted projects, many without a feasible plan for delivery. In the lead-up to the 2019 election there were imaginary commuter car parks promised in marginal seats without consideration for or consultation with local or state governments. Even the former Treasurer, the former member for Kooyong, promised four car parks in his electorate before later abandoning every single one of them.Despite the decade of waste under the former Liberal government, the Albanese Labor government is taking responsibility for infrastructure investment. We are delivering on our election commitments and ensuring that government infrastructure spending is responsible and sustainable. We have rid the federal infrastructure budget of the waste and rorts we inherited and have begun the rollout of a $123 billion infrastructure pipeline.Were restoring the role of Infrastructure Australia in this process and working closely with state and territory governments to ensure projects will deliver a boost to productivity and, importantly, deliver an economic dividend for the Australian people. These measures are not just about fairness and integrity but also about ensuring our infrastructure agenda makes economic sense. Investment in infrastructure should drive economic growth and create opportunity for people and industry alike. Through this growth and opportunity, public infrastructure investment should provide a strong return for increased individual and collective productivity.After coming to government last year, we put all existing infrastructure spending through a rigorous review. All Infrastructure Investment Program projects were considered through the audit of wasteful spending, a review of March budget measures and a review of the timing of existing investments. This repositioning of projects was a reflection of our commitment to transparent and economically responsible infrastructure investment. This process ensured that, unlike the former Liberal government, funding allocated by the Albanese Labor government will go to where it is needed most.My electorate of Hawke is home to one of the fastest growing populations in the country. I understand the need for serious investment in our transport infrastructure, as does my community. The Western Highway is one of the main arterial roads through Hawke, with 77,000 vehicles travelling the stretch between Melton and Caroline Springs every day. Although Melton is one of the fastest growing areas in Australia, the last time this crucial road was upgraded was under the last Labor government and then Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, a bloke named Anthony Albanese. Since then our community has suffered nine long years of neglect under the former Liberal government as their infrastructure priorities were dictated by electoral margins rather than need. Now a further upgrade is long overdue, and thats why the Albanese Labor government is kickstarting the Western Highway upgrade with a $10 million business case required to get things moving. Secured in Octobers budget this business case is the critical first step in ensuring the safety and efficiency of this crucial road link.Ahead of the Victorian state election the Andrews Labor government, the Victorian state government, matched our commitment. They understood the value of it, and they laid the foundation for a collaborative approach to delivering this upgrade. The state and federal Labor governments are working closely together to ensure the project is delivered efficiently and with future growth along the corridor in mind. The contrast could not be more clear. The former Liberal government wasted and rorted their way through nine long years to the detriment of our country and in particular to communities like mine. Now the Albanese government is taking a considered approach to ensuring infrastructure investment is directed where it is needed most. It is absolutely clear that only Labor governments can be relied upon to deliver the infrastructure that our communities need the most.","Fuel","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr RAE (Hawke) ","(17:57):"
"0","0","0","1","2","OBrien, Llew MP","265991","Wide Bay","LNP","N/A","183"," If a charity raised funds for sick kids but didnt give them the money, there would be an uproar. But somehow its appropriate for the Albanese government to hit motorists with a user charge and not spend the funds raised on building better roads. For every litre motorists pump into their car, they pay a fuel excise of 47.7c, giving the Commonwealth $15 billion per year. I agree with the Australian Automobile Association that the entire $15 billion, and not a cent less, should go directly back into road infrastructure. Anything less and the Labor government is robbing the drivers of more affordable second-hand fuel cars who cant afford a brand-new EV in the showroom. Instead the Albanese government is projected to withhold billions of dollars raised from the fuel excise for road upgrades, as communities in Wide Bay bury friends and family members who were taken too soon on our roads, particularly in Queensland where weve had a major spike in the road toll. Thirty-seven people were killed in 2022 on roads in the region of Wide Bay. Across Queensland, more motorists died last year than in any other state, tragically with a road toll of 299 fatalities recorded. Only four weeks into this year, our road toll has again spiked. Yet where is the fuel excise, the money extracted from motorists and originally designed for the upkeep of roads? Where is it being spent?Compared with the coalitions March 2022 budget, land transport infrastructure spending has been slashed by billions of dollars over the forward estimates under Labor. In Queensland they have slashed $3.2 million from the Black Spot Program over four years; theyve cut $62 million from the Roads of Strategic Importance over four years; and it now appears that Labor has kicked the much-needed Tiaro Bypass into the long grass. I think its plain wrong to use the fuel excise for anything but its first intended purpose: safe road building to stop our devastating road deaths. If the government intends to keep the fuel excise, it must give the funds raised back to the roads they belong to. The latest funding profile indicated that the timing for the Tiaro Bypass, a nine-kilometre corridor, has been delayed at least a year, and major construction has not even started. The Queensland government wont seek more than $150 million for the four-lane Tiaro Bypass until 2026-27 or later, a full year or more later than previously indicated by the Queensland government.Queensland Minister for Transport and Main Roads, Mark Bailey, has a shocking track record when it comes to delivering projects on time, as we saw with the Tinana overtaking lanes and the Bells Bridge intersection in Gympie, where funding was announced in January 2019 and construction is still underway some four years later. The Tiaro Bypass seems destined to suffer a similar prolonged delay because of Minister Baileys inability to share the communitys ambition to drive this road project forward as quickly as possible.The former Deputy Prime Minister and minister for infrastructure Barnaby Joyce confirmed that the Australian governments share of funding for the project was available and ready to flow to the Queensland government. After Labors budget, the office of the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, Catherine King, provided information which Mark Bailey said was inaccurate, with state Labor contradicting federal Labor and creating confusion about whether Tiaro was being funded or not. Who is actually telling the truth when it comes to this road? We know that Tiaro is the four-lane bypass Minister Bailey never wanted and said wasnt needed, and this funding report shows that motorists will continue to be put in danger for another four years or more. Now, with state Labor delaying projects and federal Labor cutting funding to road infrastructure, the deadly section between Gympie and Maryborough may not be four lanes for decades to come.When the Commonwealth introduced a petrol tax more than a century ago, it told the motoring public that it would be entirely spent on roads, and I believe this should continue to happen.","Fuel","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr LLEW OBRIEN (Wide Bay) ","(18:03):"
"0","0","0","1","2","Burnell, Matt MP","300129","Spence","ALP","N/A","184"," I rise to speak to the motion moved by one of my South Australian parliamentary colleagues and electorate neighbours, the member for Barker. I take note that the notice for this motion was given in late November last year. Given that this is the first sitting day for the year, it gives me a bit of pause to think about the passage of time generally and about contemporary history.Admittedly, this, the 47th Parliament, marks my first term in this place, and the same can be said of my colleague the member for Hawke, who has also contributed to this debate today, However, we, like millions of Australians out there in the community at the time, saw just what the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments record was when it came to infrastructure funding and a swathe of other policy areas that are just as vital to our country. So, like the member for Hawke earlier, I too will be ensuring that we do not allow any historical revisionists to come into this place and pretend that the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments approach to infrastructure was anything short of disjointed, visionless and short-sighted. This is by no means an attempt to stifle or discourage debate in this place on infrastructure, but it is certainly important to outline the plain and simple fact that the Albanese government has been elected to not just implement its vision for Australia but also clean up the mess, the policy quagmire and the malaise left by the previous government, the ATM government.Ive also noticed that, during the brief life of this current parliament, those opposite have often come into the chamber and made reference to our government making a bad situation worse. It is at least some evidence, and cold comfort, that those opposite are slowly but surely approaching the point that the previous government got it so dreadfully wrong on so many areas of public policy that even those who were part of it call it out for what they left us: a bad situation. Im not entirely sure they intended to highlight this by using that phrase, but, if it is the case, I certainly do appreciate their candour.And what a bad situation it was. But, upon its election, the Albanese Labor government took a much closer look at a number of schemes and projects that were green-lit under the previous government—a line-by-line, root-and-branch look. One of the main mechanisms for doing this was the waste and rorts audit. This is in addition to the many investigations conducted by the Australian National Audit Office, which uncovered a number of startling revelations as to a number of schemes and projects under the previous government. What was found was that many projects were recommended by a ministerial or prime ministerial office, rather than by a department on its merits.And what does that leave us with? Imaginary car parks, and projects that were under-costed and over-egged and increasingly difficult to complete in a time of rising inflationary pressures and supply chain issues.The Albanese government is taking responsibility to correct the course of the nations infrastructure vision and to put Australia back on the right course after nearly a decade of reckless mismanagement by those opposite. Thankfully, we are now led by a prime minister who intimately understands infrastructure and the importance of getting it right, not just in the here and now but for generations to come. Having been an infrastructure minister himself for close to six years certainly helps with this.As we all know, under the last government, we had the former member for Wide Bay, Warren Truss, and then the member for Gippsland, the member for New England, the member for Riverina and then back again to the member for New England. That is a startling turnover—seldom a recipe for success—in a portfolio area that desperately requires stewardship and long-term vision. I remember former prime minister Tony Abbott touting himself as the infrastructure prime minister. As history has shown us, this could not have been further from the case.But we certainly have one now—a prime minister who also knows the difference between Yeppen and Yeppoon; a prime minister who, in his governments last budget, delivered a $123 billion infrastructure pipeline to be delivered over the next 10 years.Lastly, I take the member for Barkers sincerity at face value. But, as the shadow assistant minister for infrastructure and transport, he should take stock of his former governments inglorious legacy on infrastructure—perhaps in one or two of his many media releases—because, unlike the member for Hawke and me, the member for Barker has been in this place since the 44th parliament. Perhaps the land transport he is looking for is a DeLorean. Hopefully, he has found the flux capacitor so he can travel back in time to blame the real culprits for this mess—the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government.","Fuel","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BURNELL (Spence) ","(18:08):"
"0","0","0","1","2","Willcox, Andrew MP","286535","Dawson","LNP","N/A","185"," I thank the member for Barker for moving this motion. This motion hits home the difference between regional Australia and metro Australia, and that is in road infrastructure.The fuel excise levy, which raised $13.7 billion between 2022 and 2023, helps to fund the development and maintenance of our roads. Under Labor, the fuel excise levy is set to increase to $15.8 billion by 2025 to 2026. But do you know whats strange? Even though Labor is quite happy to rip more money out of our back pocket through the fuel levy, theyre going to be reducing how much of the levy goes to our road transport infrastructure.In regional Australia, our roads are the arteries to the heart. We dont have 20 buses stopping every minute. We dont have the light rail networks of the big cities. For us, roads arent a want; theyre a necessity. For many in Dawson, to get to work we use the Bruce Highway, which is one lane in and one lane out. For the people living in the regions, road funding isnt some airy-fairy wish; its the difference between getting to work, receiving food supplies and having access to emergency services and not. I recently asked my electorate what are their top concerns around the cost of living, and 80 per cent of the participants said that the cost of fuel was on the top of their list. The tax on fuel is hurting regional Australias back pocket—so much so that the previous coalition government provided a six-month 22c-per-litre relief for Australians last year.Now lets talk about the state of our roads in my neck of the woods. We recently had a rain event, where the Bruce Highway in the north was cut in 12 different spots, and it wasnt cut for an hour or two; it was cut for two whole days. Thats two days when, if you hurt yourself, theres no ambulance on the way and when theres no way youll be able to buy essential supplies or get home to your loved ones. In my home town of Bowen, there are roadworks that have been deserted for 12 months, and the work that was started has just washed away. The Queensland state Minister for Transport and Main Roads then thought it was a good idea to come up to my region and have a spruik about how well our roads have held up. According to Queensland Labor, when the Bruce Highway falls apart, they reckon its held up well. This is what happens when youre not putting money where money is needed. Ive always called for more funding for the Bruce, and after the last rain event, which saw families stuck in the middle of nowhere for days on end, Im at it again.Moving forward, we need the Bruce Highway to be more than maintained; it needs to be improved and upgraded. The region should be treated like the south-east corner when it comes to investment in road infrastructure. When I say upgraded, I dont mean roadworks that sit stagnant for years; I mean flood mitigation all the way between Mackay and Townsville. We are tired of seeing the Bruce Highway cut in places such as Goorganga Plains, south of Proserpine, or Peters Flats, just north of Bowen. My people work so hard for this country, and they deserve a road that works for them.In the October 2022 budget, the Labor government cut funding to the Black Spot Program by $69 million and made several decisions to cut funding to the Bruce Highway upgrade projects over the forward estimates. These funds have been re-profiled to years beyond the forward estimates. By investing less funds in our regional roads, the standard only falls further behind those of the city, and that is just unacceptable. One hundred per cent of the income from the fuel excise must go to improving our regional and rural road infrastructure. Lets compensate our fuel users when they call an ambulance so the ambulance will arrive. Lets compensate the mums and dads of the region so they can feel confident, knowing theyll get home safely. Lets build an Australia ready for tomorrow.","Fuel","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr WILLCOX (Dawson) ","(18:13):"
"0","0","0","1","2","Wilson, Rick MP","198084","OConnor","LP","N/A","185"," It gives me great pleasure to rise today to support this motion by the member for Barker and also the call by the Australian Automobile Association that 100 per cent of the fuel levy collected be reinvested in the road network. Just to put some context around this, every motorist who fills their vehicle at the petrol bowser pays 47.7c per litre in fuel excise, which adds up to close to $15 billion per year. That is a road user charge, and Ill come back to the road user charge in a moment. But what I want to emphasise here is that under the coalition, by 2021-22, 98 per cent of that money was being reinvested in the road network, moving up to 100 per cent by 2022-23. When the new government, the Albanese government, handed down its budget in October, it was revealed that this investment of the fuel excise would decrease to 88 per cent by 2025-26. As a member for a regional electorate covering 1.1 million square kilometres with a massive road network, this is completely unacceptable.I want to put on the record the achievement of my grain growers this year in producing a second consecutive record grain crop of 26 million tonnes—and growing as those last truck loads arrive at the bins. That harvest will need to be transported to the port predominantly by road, and the road network is not up to the job. Unfortunately, were seeing a high number of accidents, including fatal accidents, on our road network. Just last week, owners of the two major trucking companies that haul the states grain were out in the media calling for an immediate upgrade of both the Albany Highway and the South Coast Highway where a lot of that grain travels into the Albany port or across to the Esperance port.Shire president of Plantagenet, Chris Pavlovich, made the point that the Albany Highway needs an upgrade investment of 15 kilometres per year. A well-constructed road lasts about 30 years, so a 400-kilometre road needs an upgrade of around 15 kilometres every year to keep that road up to scratch. At the moment were not going anywhere near that. Were putting bandaids on the problem and its not getting any better. In fact, at this point in time its getting worse.I just want to touch on some of the initiatives of the previous government across my electorate that Im very proud of. Theres the $120 million road safety improvement program. Constituents of mine driving around the very large electorate of OConnor will have noticed the extra metre of seal on probably thousands of kilometres of roads. This dramatically increases the safety of those roads. When cars leave the centre strip, theyre not going into gravel and getting into a swerve and ending up rolling into the gutter or, even worse, hitting a tree. They are still on bitumen and they can correct and get back on the road. Thats a really important road safety improvement that we funded.The $160 million agriculture supply chain infrastructure program will go some way to restoring and improving the road network to get that grain crop into the bins and into the port over the next 12 months. Theres also the $170 million ring road at Albany, which is a major investment to improve the efficiency of the road freight into the Albany port. Its a project Im very proud of.In the last minute that I have I want to bring the conversation back to the fuel excise and the fact that it is a road user charge. We had the Grattan Institute in the Fin Review today, no doubt with the blessing of the Treasurer, floating the idea of removing the rebate which off-road fuel users receive. That would be the miners of my electorate and the farmers of my electorate. This country rides on the back of the WA mining industry, and if that industry is hit with this particular cost it will impact on new investment in projects and it will certainly impact on the profitability of current projects which pay the bills. This will lead to less output for this country.

"0","0","0","1","2","Byrnes, Alison MP","299145","Cunningham","ALP","N/A","186"," I move:That this House:(1) notes:(a) the importance of manufacturing for our nation, particularly our regional areas; and(b) that Australia has suffered nearly a decade of policy-drift, ranking last in the OECD when it comes to manufacturing self-sufficiency;(2) recognises the Government is delivering on its commitment to establish the National Reconstruction Fund, which will:(a) create secure, well-paid jobs;(b) diversify Australian industry to drive sustainable growth to create future prosperity;(c) build our capability to manufacture high-value products for the world; and(d) drive economic development in our regions and outer suburbs;(3) acknowledges that the Government is rebuilding Australias manufacturing capacity to build a stronger and more resilient future; and(4) further notes that the Government is delivering its plan to:(a) create a better future for Australians by investing to support and stimulate regional manufacturing; and(b) implement a National Rail Manufacturing Plan to support the rail industry and create more skilled manufacturing jobs.I want to talk about why Australia needs to boost its performance in manufacturing and what the Albanese Labor government is doing to achieve that goal. Over the last decade Australias manufacturing sector has been allowed to deteriorate. This is despite its vital importance to our economy and to the current and future living standards of our community. Three trends illustrate our decline and the challenges facing Australia. Firstly, a 2020 report by the OECD ranked Australia last among member economies for manufacturing self-sufficiency. Secondly, and more recently, Harvard Universitys economic complexity index has tracked Australias decline between the years 2000 and 2020 from ranking 55th to 91st. And, thirdly, between 2013 and May 2022 the number of manufacturing jobs fell by nearly 70,000, despite a growing economy and workforce. Labor wants to build a stronger and more resilient future. That requires a modern, growing and diverse manufacturing industry that delivers secure, high-skill, high-wage jobs. The Albanese government is committed to driving the transformation of Australian industry and reviving our ability to make world-class products in Australia for domestic consumption and for exporting. We are acting to create high-value jobs across the economy and to help Australians learn the skills needed for the jobs of the future.One example is Labors National Reconstruction Fund. The $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund is one of Australias biggest government investments in manufacturing in living memory. This fund is exactly what Australia needs now. It will drive economic development in our regions and outer suburbs and boost our sovereign capability, diversify the nations economy and help create secure jobs. This is just one Albanese-government policy to rebuild and modernise Australian manufacturing. Others include 180,000 fee-free TAFE and VET places to build our skills base; more affordable child care; grants to stimulate regional manufacturing; a national strategy to create a local battery industry as we move towards more renewable energy; a national rail manufacturing strategy; and 20,000 extra university places, including 936 additional places for the University of Wollongong, to train more teachers, nurses and engineers. These additional places represent an injection of $29 million into our Illawarra economy and community. My own electorate of Cunningham and the broader Illawarra already have a strong manufacturing base, but theres plenty of room to expand and diversify our base.As I said in my first speech in this place, the Illawarra has the people, workers, resources, public and private sector organisations, schools, TAFEs and universities to be a growing manufacturing resource for the country. Already, the Albanese government has invested in our manufacturing future, including by recognising our role in moving to sustainable, renewable energy supplies. These federal investments include a $10 million energy futures skills centre for the University of Wollongong; a renewable energy training centre for Wollongong TAFE, supported by a $2.5 million investment; and $8.98 million to Hysata to work with Germanys Fraunhofer IPT to develop new facilities to deliver low-cost hydrogen in Port Kembla, a development about which Paul Barrett, the CEO of Hysata, observed:Australia has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to be a global leader in green hydrogen and we are delighted to see the Government backing Australian innovators. Our technology will enhance sovereign manufacturing capabilities, create high skilled jobs and position Australia as a green hydrogen powerhouse …There is also $800,000 to ATCO Australia, in partnership with Fraunhofer, for a feasibility study into deploying an electrolyser and ammonia facility to make advancements in hydrogen technologies and storage in the Illawarra. These recent initiatives followed Labors announcement last August that the Illawarra is one of six proposed offshore wind energy regions. This investment in wind energy will underwrite the Illawarras manufacturing future.The Illawarra has long been a place of steel, mining and heavy industry. That and our deepwater port, great training and education facilities, skilled workers, large and small businesses and a growing services sector are a perfect base for expanding our manufacturing performance. Combining our strengths with an ambitious and supportive Albanese federal government and, hopefully, an incoming Labor state government in New South Wales means that the Illawarra will be part of the urgent regrowth and expansion of Australias manufacturing sector.","Manufacturing Industry","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms BYRNES (Cunningham) ","(18:23):"

"0","0","0","1","2","Landry, Michelle MP","249764","Capricornia","LNP","N/A","187"," I rise to respond to the motion put forward by the member for Cunningham, and I would like to use this opportunity to formally correct the record when it comes to those opposite and their track record on manufacturing. It may be too long ago for some of the government to recall, but lets, for a moment, take a trip down memory lane as I remind those opposite of their track record on manufacturing.Under Labors manufacturing, the contribution to GDP fell by $7 billion and 6,800 manufacturing businesses closed, and employees all of the country were forced out of jobs as a result. Electricity prices also doubled last time Labor was in government. Sound familiar? Since being appointed as the shadow assistant minister for manufacturing, I have heard from plenty of businesses already that they are very concerned about the prospects for the sector going forward under this government. Australian manufacturers and their workers remember all too well what happened last time this mob was in government.In contrast, I am incredibly proud of the work of the former coalition government and our efforts to support manufacturing organisations of all shapes and sizes in regional electorates, like mine in Central Queensland, and around the entire country. We know how important the manufacturing sector is for increased employment and growth to the nations economy. Under the Modern Manufacturing Strategy, the coalition invested more than $2.5 billion to drive growth and innovation across the Australian manufacturing sector, funding more than 200 projects to boost our regions and national sovereign capability.Under the coalitions modern manufacturing initiative program I was able to secure over $750,000 in funding for two manufacturers, Cirrus Ag and CQ Fibreglass Direct Ops. Cirrus Ag, based in Orange, recognised the potential of being based in the beef capital of Australia and constructed a pallet manufacturing facility in Rockhampton to service the agriculture industry. They accessed the grant to assist in the creation of an efficient granular manufacturing operation, improving the plants operation. A family owned and operated business, CQ Fibreglass Direct Ops are one of only a few businesses in Queensland able to produce filament wound composite ventilation tubes and fittings. The coalitions modern manufacturing initiative assisted this business to invest in automated filament winding production for their goods. These grants benefit the region, its workers and grow our manufacturing sector and sovereign abilities. This funding makes a real difference to Australian businesses, but unfortunately the Albanese government seems to have no interest in the concept of supporting our regions or the manufacturing sector.Under the coalition, more than 3,300 additional manufacturing businesses were created and manufacturing business turnover was at its highest level since Labor was last in government in 2010. But, despite the track record of the coalitions manufacturing strategy, Labor thought it best to ignore the facts, ignore the need to support industry and businesses to tackle rising costs, ignore supporting our regional manufacturers and of course ignore addressing workforce shortages in favour of doing their own thing, also known as giving in to their union overlords. If you could be bothered to follow this governments abysmal actions to date, you could be forgiven for thinking that Labor and Prime Minister Albanese are intent on ruining our strong manufacturing sector.While manufacturers are struggling across the country to deal with rising power prices, almost 12 months on Labors focus has been to forge ahead with radical industrial relations legislation, legislation which has seen a rise in the number of industrial disputes and give way to thousands of job losses, which will have a devastating impact on the industry. Need I state the obvious? It seems Labors priorities are all wrong. Instead of easing costs for manufacturers and dealing with rising electricity prices, Labors focus has been to make it more difficult for manufacturers to hire staff and grow their businesses.In the 2022 budget, Labor actively stamped out key features of the coalitions successful industry policies and has been promising a National Reconstruction Fund, which we, in here, and manufacturers across the country are yet to see. Labors only focus was to get rid of successful coalition policy, doing so without even having an alternative ready, leaving our nations manufacturers in the lurch when they need it most.Even worse, Labor is playing politics with funds already committed to businesses under the coalitions Modern Manufacturing Initiative. These funds have already been independently assessed by experts and the department, funds which Australian manufacturing businesses are currently waiting for. These are real businesses with real employees that Labor is purposely playing politics with.It is time this government deliver on their promises and actually stand up for our countrys manufacturing sector instead of hanging them out to dry. Ill be doing everything in my power to make sure that the manufacturing industry is heard and that this incompetent government is held to account.","Manufacturing Industry","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms LANDRY (Capricornia) ","(18:29):"
"0","0","0","1","2","Mascarenhas, Zaneta MP","298800","Swan","ALP","N/A","188"," The Labor Party has a great track record on manufacturing, and one of the aspects of this motion that I think resonates most with the Western Australian community is building a stronger and more resilient future through manufacturing. This clearly did not happen in the decade under the last Liberal government. The manufacturing industry is something that the Labor Party fundamentally understands. My father was a metalworker in Kambalda. He inspired me to become an engineer in the industrial and resource sector. This experience taught me that Australians cannot rely on digging up our backyard forever. Because our resources are limited, our economy must become more sophisticated, which brings me to a great example in WA.The town of Collie is 150 kilometres south of my electorate and has an economy centred around coalmining and coal-fired power generation. But power generation in WA is changing. Renewables and gas are rapidly overtaking coal as the source of power in WA. One in three homes in WA have rooftop solar. The output from base-load generation from coal cannot easily be turned up and turned down, as gas generators can and batteries can. There is an end date for coal-fired power generation in WA, and that is 2030. To complement this, there is a transition plan. The town of Collie has been united for over a decade in its transition plan where community, the state government and unions have been working together to reskill and reorientate the local community.It has been a steady process, one that requires community buy-in and funding and, most importantly, action. This is why the McGowan state Labor government committed over $660 million in funding to the Collie transition plan. To quote Australian Manufacturing Workers Union state secretary Steve McCartney, If youre going to take an industry out of a town, youve got to replace it with another industry. In Collie, WA, state government grants have attracted major investment to the region. Last year we saw a company called International Graphite open a pilot-scale processing plant locally. This is an important component in solar panels. We also saw Magnum Australia receive a grant for a feasibility study for a carbon neutral magnesium refinery right in Collie. Should that project get off the ground, it will create 350 permanent jobs in critical minerals. These are stable, well-paid jobs, jobs that build community and increase resilience, which also creates economic resilience. Its why people from Collie to Kewdale, in my electorate, are excited about the Albanese Labor governments $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund.The pandemic taught us that we need to make more things here and build our resilience. Collie demonstrates that when government backs manufacturers and their workers there are huge downstream benefits for the community and the economy. The National Reconstruction Fund will drive economic development across the nation by creating stable jobs, jobs that can insulate our economy against the boom-bust cycles of the resources sector. There are great examples of government support that can build capacity and support new industrial growth. The common user facility for shipbuilding in Henderson was started thanks to funding from the state Labor government. This has helped create infrastructure thats required for shipbuilding in WA at unprecedented levels. We now have the opportunity to build precincts that add value to existing commodities while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.In the South West there are massive expansions of rare earth mineral mining and processing, which will play an important role in batteries. Imagine an old coalmining town being at the forefront of decarbonisation which, for example, could be manufacturing batteries or green steel. To quote Daniel Graham, a scaffolding supervisor at the Muja Power Station in Collie, who would like to see green steel manufacturing get off the ground: Weve got great facilities here. Weve got a railway line, our highway is in great shape, and we have the skilled labour to build things. For my community of Swan, downstream servicing of the resource sector and construction are major employers. As we develop the diversity of our economy in WA, including in the South West, the local economy will also grow in my community. My community is excited about the Albanese governments plan for manufacturing. This is really a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I thank the member for Cunningham for bringing forward this motion.","Manufacturing Industry","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms MASCARENHAS (Swan) ","(18:34):"
"0","0","0","1","2","Broadbent, Russell MP","MT4","Monash","LP","N/A","189"," Deputy Speaker, Ive been here since the Button plan and many other plans before it, and I wouldnt be so enthusiastic about Labors plan for manufacturing in this country, from what Ive seen before. I put to you that Australia is running away from its cheap and amazing fossil fuel reserves to run into renewable energy. Do you realise that, with renewable energy coming forth to support our manufacturing industry, the cost of power to those manufacturers has gone through the roof?All you have to do is stand back and observe exactly what has happened over a long period of time with Australias manufacturing being virtually shipped offshore to China. In the process of shipping it offshore to China, Chinas emissions have gone through the roof, although they collapsed a bit around the COVID exercise when they closed down a lot of their manufacturing. Now weve got major supply chain issues that are affecting Australia directly. Youll be feeling them in every area of your activity. Just go to the shortages in prescription medicines right across this country at the moment and what the TGA are saying about paracetamol. Theyre going to reduce the number of pills because there are supply chain issues. They are everywhere. This is because we have become a country that is not self-sufficient in manufacturing, because we have closed our coal-fired power stations, to the point where we havent got that base load of cheap power.Victoria was built on the Latrobe Valley—I represent the Latrobe Valley—and it was built on the fact that we had that cheap energy that was able to fire up our manufacturing industries. What we have done now is moved the whole lot to another country. You say, But were reducing our emissions. Yes, but weve moved the manufacturing to another country where emissions are exploding—where they are opening coal-fired power stations by the dozen. Were moving our manufacturing to Vietnam, and were moving our manufacturing to India.The best example was the other day in the UK. One of their motor vehicle manufacturers is dropping 800 of their 1,600 employees so they can move their manufacturing to America, because America now has green subsidies. As for renewable energy in this country, if there were no subsidies, there would be no wind farms—not one. There wouldnt be one wind turbine in this country if there were no subsidies. If there had been no subsidies originally, there wouldnt have been the rooftop solar panels that were talking about in this country. All renewable energy relies on government funding—in other words, your and my money. I look at the bigger picture. There was a very good article in theAustralian today on electric vehicles and the truth around them right across the world, and Ill be speaking to that a bit later on in the House.Weve gone through, time and again and time and again, closures of power stations in the Latrobe Valley when a restructure plan comes in—governments put in billions of dollars each time, and it seems to go nowhere. We finally get a manufacturing company thats going to come to the Latrobe Valley, and theyre going to rebuild motor vehicles to have electric motors in Australia. Were going to have our own manufacturing plant right there in the Latrobe Valley. Its really exciting. The member that just spoke talked about the town of Collie and a whole lot of ideas which are perhaps good ideas but they are yet to come to fruition. We get this manufacturer down there, they get the subsidies, they get the support from the state government, they get the support from the local council, they get all the offers in the world, and they decide because of logistics its probably better to do it in Dandenong, not the Latrobe Valley. So Latrobe Valley misses out again on that manufacturing opportunity.","Manufacturing Industry","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BROADBENT (Monash) ","(18:39):"

"0","0","0","1","2","Garland, Carina MP","295588","Chisholm","ALP","N/A","190"," When I speak to people in my community about Australias future, Im really optimistic, because Im really ambitious for our country. One of the reasons for this is that, in the Albanese government, we at last have a federal government that cares about good, secure jobs here in Australia and about ensuring we make things here, both for our own sovereign capability and to trade with the world. The unfortunate fact is that we have suffered from a coalition government with a lack of ambition for Australia, and manufacturing has declined. But under the Albanese Labor government manufacturing is back because were backing manufacturing. When the Liberals came to government, there were 927,000 manufacturing jobs. That was in November 2013. When they left government last year, there were only 855,000 manufacturing jobs. But in December 2022 there were 872,000 manufacturing workers. So we are starting to see, under our government, these good, secure jobs in really key industries coming back.Despite what we might have heard here this afternoon, those opposite are part of a party that dared automakers to leave the country, so it is really difficult for me to be anything but cynical about their capacity to support Australian manufacturing. They simply cant be trusted. On this side, in government, we want to build a stronger and more resilient future, and that requires a modern, growing and diverse manufacturing industry that delivers secure, high-skill, high-wage jobs. Our government is committed to driving the transformation of Australian industry and reviving our ability to make world-class products in Australia. Were taking action to create high-value jobs across the economy and to help Australians skill up for the jobs of the future.One of the ways were doing that is through the $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund, which is one of Australias biggest government investments in manufacturing in living memory. It will drive economic development in our regions and outer suburbs, boost our sovereign capability, diversify the nations economy and help create secure jobs. It will create jobs in communities right across our country, including my community of Chisholm. We want Australians to think globally and make locally. When we as a government spend through the National Reconstruction Fund, there wont be any colour coded spreadsheets in sight. Therell be no sports rorts and no car park rorts. Investment decisions will be free from political interference.We saw very clearly the impacts of not having local capabilities in manufacturing when borders were shut and supply chains were disrupted during the worst part of the pandemic. We all saw that across our communities. People in my community were shocked by the extent to which the previous government had not just neglected but destroyed manufacturing in this country. It has been made very clear to me that—certainly in my community in Chisholm—there is an expectation that we have a responsible government with sensible strategies to stimulate industry and the economy so we can grow our wealth; create good, secure jobs for now and the future; and lead the world in advanced manufacturing technology.Something that has really held us back has been a real lack of investment in and support for skills and training. I was delighted to spend time at the Box Hill Institute with Minister OConnor and Victorian minister Gayle Tierney to hear from students and staff last week. Were doing a lot in the skills space. Of course, the Prime Ministers very first visit to Victoria after the election was to my electorate of Chisholm, to the magnificent Victorian Tunnelling Centre at the Drummond Street campus of Holmesglen TAFE. We are delivering 180,000 fee-free TAFE and VET places for Australians in 2023. Were delivering on our commitment to build a stronger economy and help give more Australians the skills and training they need today and to harness the jobs and opportunities of the future. Were investing in our greatest resource, our people, honouring our key election commitment to provide fee-free TAFE and vocational education places. Whether its in the care sector or in manufacturing, we need to deliver these skills at a time of acute skills shortages. Manufacturing is a great industry to get work in, and our government is backing that industry for a better future for all.","Manufacturing Industry","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr GARLAND (Chisholm) ","(18:44):"

But it is also the home of the Bushmaster, and what a great Australian manufacturing success story the Bushmaster is. Indeed, how many troops has that saved—not just Australians, but across the world. That is something that we should be very proud of. I was pleased to hear the member for Chisholm be optimistic and enthusiastic, and I hope that is infectious in her side, in the government. I hope it runs through to the Treasury and particularly to the Treasurer, the member for Rankin, because I think all too often he has been guilty of talking down our economy, and we need to talk up what we do here in Australia, certainly when it comes to manufacturing.Im interested in the member for Cunninghams private members motion, where she talks about implementing a national rail manufacturing plan. Well, youve come to the right person here because, as Deputy Prime Minister, I was the one who signed the intergovernmental agreements with the three state ministers to get Inland Rail up, off the laptop and onto the track. Indeed, the first one was with Jacinta Allan—you would know her well, Deputy Speaker Chesters—and that was a great meeting. I had a good relationship with her, and I still do. She wanted to get on with the job of inland rail; so did Mark Bailey in Queensland and the then minister in New South Wales. We signed those three intergovernmental agreements. As I say, two of them were with Labor states. We got on with the job because we cooperated, and people wanted to see that cooperation.This motion, and some of what Ive heard from those opposite, reminds me a bit of the Yes Minister episode where they were talking about the success of the health system, the episode in which they were praising the best-performing hospital in England. Indeed it was, and it had 500 administrative staff yet no patients. They were saying, Its a great hospital; its so efficient. Yes, but it had no patients! They were trying to convince the minister that it wasnt such a success story, because it had no people receiving treatment.What we dont want to see is this Labor government talking up manufacturing, having sent all the manufacturing overseas because of reckless energy policies making it too costly to do business here. That is my great fear—that it will be too costly to make things here in Australia.I want to see more Bushmasters built. I want to see more processing plants in agriculture and in all sorts of things. I know the RDA estimates the manufacturing industry in my own electorate of Riverina supports 7,988 jobs. I want to see more jobs. I know there are 80,000 vacancies in regional Australia at the moment. I want to see them filled. Many of those nearly 8,000 jobs are in manufacturing. We grow the worlds best food and fibre. We have so much opportunity with the inland rail, with those special activation precincts that have been put in place, particularly by the New South Wales coalition government. I want to see those fully explored, exploited, enhanced and worked upon such that we can have more manufacturing jobs.The challenge is there, the opportunity is there and the obligation is there for those opposite to make sure that they do everything they can to bring energy costs down. If they dont, its going to be like the hospital in England which had no patients and was written up as such a success story in the ministers office. Were going to have members opposite talking about the success story of manufacturing: Its such a success story, but weve got nobody working in there, because weve sent it all overseas.This is a huge thing. Energy is going to play a big part in the future success or otherwise of our manufacturing industry, with businesses such as Flipscreen in Wagga. I know we gave generously as a coalition government. The coalition provided $2.5 billion to create the Modern Manufacturing Strategy. Those opposite need to not only talk that up; they also need to enhance it. Most importantly, they need to bring energy costs down so that we can help manufacturing create opportunities and create more employment, particularly in regional Australia.","Manufacturing Industry","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[3]","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","2","Lawrence, Tania MP","299150","Hasluck","ALP","N/A","191"," It would be easy to fall to an assumption that the beautiful, historic and well-forested electorate of Hasluck is a stranger to manufacturing. Not so. We boast rail manufacturing in Bellevue. The McGowan government has not just carried on the fine Labor tradition of building rail in Perth as part of the METRONET network; it has also brought rail manufacturing back after a 27-year hiatus, with the first cars rolling off production in Hasluck last year. More than 15 WA companies are producing components for these rail cars.We also boast cutting-edge companies like Connect Source in Midvale, BGC in Midland and Fortescue Future Industries in Hazelmere. Connect Source specialises in electronic control, producing products like module harnesses and driver monitoring systems. BGC are innovating the manufacturing processes for building and construction materials to be a leader in energy efficiency. Fortescue Future Industries is focusing on green hydrogen to support sectors such as shipping, transport and agriculture. Midland itself is a hive of activity, and the Swan Chamber of Commerce gathers the local heads of business regularly, bringing them together to discuss their ideas to take their sectors forward. Their next chamber meeting is on 24 February at Bailey Brewing Co. in Henley Brook. They are one of the biggest manufacturers as a brewer and a value-adding industry in Western Australia.What do such dynamic businesspeople require from government? One thing: a clear vision. Its needed in order for them to grow, invest and employ more people and have the confidence to do so. Vision, like the first National Battery Strategy, launched by Minister Husic last week. Australia will now make its own lithium batteries. Vision, like setting emissions reduction targets in legislation, as the government did last year, backed up by the legislation introduced by Minister Bowen for the improvement of the safeguard mechanism. Australia will have a safeguard mechanism that does the job and provides a clear lead to industry. Vision, like the request by the government for the Joint Standing Committee on Trade and Investment Growth, which I am a proud member of, to inquire into how Australia can transition to being a green energy superpower. This inquiry has received over 100 submissions from manufacturers and community groups alike.Vision is required in a busy, moving space where much is yet to be developed or well understood. The stakes are high. Governments can and must play a role in derisking ventures at crucial stages of development by stating clear intentions and setting ambitious targets. If the government sets the vision, businesses will then apply their experience, their innovation and their enterprise to deliver. We are not alone in the world in trying to lead in this space. Indeed, we are starting from behind due to the past decades wilderness of denial. Countries like Germany, Korea, Japan, Saudi Arabia and Chile are setting clear targets and therefore attracting capital investment. The US Inflation Reduction Act is already having an effect on investment flows and boardroom decisions. We have competition.Nevertheless, I am optimistic, because the $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund is one of Australias biggest government investments in manufacturing in living memory. The National Rail Manufacturing Plan, following the example of Western Australia, will bring jobs and skills back home. To build things in Australia we need to ensure we have workers with the skills necessary to do so. As my learned colleague the member for Parramatta presciently stated in his book Ozonomics back in 2007: we have no alternative but to work smarter and stay ahead of the game. If young Australians aspire to well-paid jobs in secure industries, they must move up the value chain. For government, these lessons are clear: educate, train and empower, and then educate some more.Our government understands this and has invested in 180,000 free TAFE and VET places to give more Australians the skills and training they need today and to harness the jobs and opportunities of the future. We are investing in TAFE at Midland in my electorate. We are delivering $3.34 million to equip the campus with the appropriate resources to train Australians in wind turbine maintenance. In manufacturing, there are many opportunities present in this time of change, and this government has the vision to carry the nation forward. I commend the motion to the House.","Manufacturing Industry","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms LAWRENCE (Hasluck) ","(18:54):"
"0","0","0","1","2","van Manen, Bert MP","188315","Forde","LNP","N/A","192"," It is always a pleasure to rise and speak on matters of economics, business and manufacturing. As the member for Blair, who is in the chamber, would well know, our electorates mirror each other greatly. The member for Hasluck and I serve on the Economics Committee together and I like the idea of a clear vision. However, I disagree with her on the notion that the government is actually providing it. One of the things we know that business needs is cheap, reliable energy. As the member for Riverina quite clearly pointed out in his contribution, that is one thing were not getting from this government.Ill say this: its wonderful that the Labor government, through this motion, has finally decided to recognise the importance of local manufacturing and that it is a vital component of the Australian economy. As with many things with this government, it is important we dont just hear the words but we see the deeds. Last years budget was the right time to address these spiralling costs, workforce shortages, ongoing supply chain issues and rising energy costs yet they did nothing in that budget to address these issues. Labors budget failed to properly establish their vision for industry. All it did, really, was redirect funds from programs that the previous government had set up.This failure to provide substantial support to our manufacturers is in stark contrast to the real measurable actions that the previous coalition government took to support industry in Australia. The coalition provided some $2.5 billion to create the Modern Manufacturing Strategy. This support bolstered our sovereign manufacturing capability and empowered over 200 projects across Australia. In addition, we reduced the small business tax rate to 25 per cent and expanded the instant asset write off, which significantly improved cash flow by allowing businesses to write off assets more quickly—in a cash flow manner rather than depreciated over time.Additionally, through JobKeeper and other measures, the coalition government helped businesses keep their doors open through COVID. These measures allowed businesses to focus on their core competencies of growing their business, developing services and products for the Australian community and, importantly, bringing manufacturing capacity back on shore that was previously offshore. I know one of the issues businesses now face is a workforce shortage, but that is something that will resolve itself over time as we focus on building a skilled workforce.I have said to the business community that one of things that has lacked in the past 20 or 30 years is the willingness of our business community to engage with our schools and our TAFEs to build an experienced, dedicated, trained workforce. There has been enormous focus on sending our school leavers to university, which is fantastic for those who wish to pursue that career path—terrific. But we also need boilermakers, welders, electricians, carpenters, mechanics, diesel fitters, all of those skilled jobs that we need to develop and maintain a manufacturing industry. We need to ensure that we encourage those at school, who have the skills and talent in the area, to pursue those career opportunities.As a result of the Manufacturing Modernisation Fund, looking across the electorate of Forde at the great local companies that benefited from that fund, Merino Country in Shailer Park received over $400,000 to adopt new technologies for sewing machine and garment production to support international expansion of their wool clothing business. ATP Science and its new factory at Meadowbrook received over $1 million to build and expand their production line of high-quality protein products. Under our Sovereign Industrial Capability Priority grants, Holmwood Highgate at Loganholme received over $1 million to enhance their manufacturing capability for high-quality liquid storage and transport vessels for aviation and defence industries. Frontline Manufacturing at Meadowbrook received over $700,000 to purchase equipment that allows them to manufacture metal plates for armoured fighting vehicles. These are just some of the examples of the support we provided.

"0","0","0","1","2","Chandler-Mather, Max MP","300121","Griffith","AG","N/A","193"," I move:That this House:(1) notes that:(a) Vanuatus Minister of Climate Change, Ralph Regenvanu, would only back Australias bid to host the 2026 COP if Australia does not commit to any new coal or gas handouts; and(b) the Governments first budget has over $40 billion in fossil fuel subsidies including $1.9 billion to open up a new LNG terminal and petrochemical hub in Darwin Harbour; and(2) calls on the Government to end fossil fuel subsidies.If we want to tackle climate change then we need a plan to phase out of coal, oil and gas. But right now not only is this Labor government actively supporting opening up over 100 new coal and gas mines but its using public money to make it happen.Australia is the worlds third-biggest exporter of coal, oil and gas—behind only Saudi Arabia and Russia. Australia alone is responsible for 20 per cent of the OECDs fossil fuel exports. Lets be very clear about who Labor represents in this parliament: its the coal, oil and gas corporations who are not only making record war profits while paying next nothing in tax but are receiving billions of dollars in government cash handouts. Frankly, this special treatment has come pretty cheap. Of the $2 million donated by fossil fuel corporations, including from Santos, Woodside, APPEA, Chevron and the Minerals Council, $1.4 million went to Labor. In return, those fossil fuel corporations will get $40 billion of government subsidies over the next four years.Six of the 10 biggest recipients of the fuel credits tax, which is the biggest of those subsidies, are coalmining corporations. But really the biggest subsidy fossil fuel corporations like Santos get is a tax regime that sees a cleaner pay more tax in dollar terms than some of the worlds biggest multinational coal, oil and gas corporations. In the last reportable tax year, the top 20 coal, oil and gas companies made $150 billion of revenue and paid only $30—not $30 billion, but $30—in tax. Its a sick joke. Labor claims to care about climate change, but Labors policy is crystal clear: keep mining and exporting coal and gas past 2050 regardless of the consequences.","Mining Industry","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[5]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr CHANDLER-MATHER (Griffith) ","(19:04):"

"0","0","0","1","2","Bates, Stephen MP","300246","Brisbane","AG","N/A","193"," I second the motion. Forty billion dollars: that is the dollar value the government has set aside for the fossil fuel industry. Forty billion dollars. This corporate gift comes at a time when fossil fuel companies are raking in hundreds of billions of dollars in profit off the backs of struggling households and families. As these companies continue to make record profits we continue to live through the effects of the climate crisis. Were living through times where heavier and more frequent rainfall causes floods, and hotter, drier periods cause bushfires. The time between respective La Nina and El Nino extremes is becoming shorter and shorter, and island nations like Vanuatu are sinking below ever-rising sea levels. My electorate of Brisbane has still not fully recovered from the floods that devastated our communities not even a year ago.That $40 billion in subsidies also comes at a cost to our public and social services. We are repeatedly told that all of us have to make sacrifices during this cost-of-living crisis, but thats not exactly true because BHP dont have to give up their subsidies. Woodside dont have to give up their tax breaks. Santos get to keep their part of the $40 billion. Meanwhile the rest of Australia is told by this government that we cannot get dental into Medicare, we cant make uni free again and we cant build the number of social homes that our country actually needs. The truth is that we can do those things, its just that the government has chosen to help the fossil fuel industry over you.","Mining Industry","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[5]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BATES (Brisbane) ","(19:06):"
"0","0","0","1","2","Ryan, Monique MP","297660","Kooyong","IND","N/A","194"," We are in a climate emergency. Legislation on climate change amelioration is fundamental to cementing our progression to net zero by 2050. It should also set interim goals to ensure that we act now, goals which should be transparent, adaptable and progressive. We cannot deny, delay or dissemble. We cannot procrastinate or pretend. Every ton of emissions produced now and pumped into our shared and collective atmosphere makes the job harder for us and harder for the next generation.All of us in this place, if weve looked, have seen the science. We know that a more ambitious emissions target will free our economy from its reliance on volatile markets. We know that, globally, more ambitious targets are the only way to limiting the global temperature rise to the 1.5 degrees Celsius forecast by the IPCC, which, on most measures, we are on track to exceed.How do we achieve more ambitious targets? By transitioning our energy supply to renewables; by building a cleaner, more efficient electricity network; by increasing availability and decreasing the cost of low-emissions vehicles; by supporting the domestic manufacture of electric heavy vehicles and commuter transport; by investing in new technologies and battery manufacturing; and by improving the efficiency of existing and new Australian homes—not by opening new gas facilities and new coalmines.Any additional supply of gas and coal will keep fossil fuel energy generation competitive. It will delay the worlds transition to renewables. Weve seen extraordinary progress in our transition to renewable energy in recent years. We can continue to build on that without taking backward steps—without building assets destined to be stranded as our international trading partners make their own progress towards net zero emissions.In 2021 the International Energy Agency told us very clearly that the energy sector is the source of about three-quarters of greenhouse gas emissions today and that it holds the key to averting the worst effects of climate change. The IEA mapped out a pathway to net zero by 2050. This required no new oil and gas fields and no new coalmines or mine extensions. How? By an unwavering policy focus on climate change and the development of renewables and by ensuring that the focus for oil and gas producers switches entirely to output and emissions reduction from the operation of existing assets—not by supporting a gas led recovery and not by providing more money for ever-failing technologies like carbon capture and storage.We can support coal and gas workers and communities by creating publicly funded transition authorities to help communities to diversify local industries and to create new jobs. Fossil fuel subsidies cost us $11.6 billion in 2021-22 across all federal, state and territory governments, equivalent to $22,000 a minute. It is perverse that our government continues to subsidise fossil fuel production and consumption while communities across the country bear the cost of disasters exacerbated by fossil fuel use.Australias actions count globally. A more ambitious emissions reduction target will signal this countrys commitment to a global effort to act on climate change. The Albanese government needs to provide credible step-by-step plans to achieve its net zero goals, building confidence amongst investors, industry, citizens and other countries. Our long-term national low-emissions strategy needs to be linked to measurable short-term targets and policies with defined sectoral and technology milestones. We dont need, we dont deserve and we dont want new developments at Kurri Kurri or in the Beetaloo, North Bowen or Galilee basins. We dont want Middle Arm and we dont want PEP-11. Our Indigenous people have told us that they dont want the offshore Barossa project. We want our government to show vision and leadership, and we want no new fossil fuel projects.Debate adjourned.Federation Chamber adjourned at 19:1 4","Mining Industry","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[5]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr RYAN (Kooyong) ","(19:08):"
