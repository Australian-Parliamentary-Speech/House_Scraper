Riley, Mr. Gardner, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Thompson, Mr. Watson, and the mover, five to form a quorum ; with power to send for persons and papers and records and examine judgments in connexion therewith, to adjourn from place to place; and have leave to report from time to time its proceedings and the evidence taken ; and that such committee do report this day three months. I submitted this motion in the last Parliament, but it was not brought to finality. I have reintroduced it in the hope that the Government will not again resort to whipping its supporters to vote against a private members motion, and thus deny to a citizen the right to appeal to the highest court in the land the Parliament of the Commonwealth.For the benefit of honorable members who are new to this House, I shall briefly recapitulate the circumstances of the case, and I hope that honorable members will base their opinions upon the moral aspects of the claim rather than upon legal intricacies. The firm of Henry Dean and Sons was established as manufacturers of pipes and bricks in the Newcastle electorate, and was requested by the War Service Homes Commission to discontinue pipe making and enter into a contract to supply the whole of its output of bricks to the Government. Mr. Henry Dean demurred, and stated that he had private contracts for the supply of a portion of his output of bricks. The correspondence shows that at no time was he desirous of making a contract with the Government, but the departmental officers, who apparently were very well satisfied with the quality of his bricks, repeatedly urged him to make an agreement with the commission. The proof of that is supplied by the following letter:","Claim of H.

In answer to your verbal request for the result of interview with Mr. Dean, of Henry Dean & Sons, on the 20th inst., I wish to inform you as follows: Mr. Dean was very much against making a contract at the present time, his reasons being (a)Uncertainty of output. (b)Requires every second kiln to carry on with construction of new kilns. (c)Necessity to complete various outside orders in hand. (d)His main reason is the necessity of a guarantee on our part to empty a kiln of 80,000 in four (4) days. I explained personally that the quantity of output did not effect the making of a contract, as I am assured this firm is aiming at an output of 200,000 per week within twelve (12) months. It was finally agreed that a contract be made on basis, as follows: 1.War Service Homes Commission to take the whole output of H. Dean & Sons brickworks from date of signing contract for a period of five (5) years. 2.Henry Dean & Sons agree to erect additional open kilns and one Hoffman pattern with all possible dispatch. Open kilns are now in course of construction. 3.When the output reaches 130,000 weekly, Henry Dean & Sons to have right to disburse all excess outside of contract. 4.The commission guarantees to empty each kiln of 80,000 bricks within five (5) days after twentyfour (24) hours notice of opening has been given to Newcastle office of commission. 5.If commission be not in a position to take delivery of any particular quantity of bricks District Works Officer, Newcastle, to authorize Deans to disburse outside of contract. This clause not to prejudice commissions liability to take output to 130,000 weekly. 6.The price for goodquality common brick, equal to submitted sample, to be 63s. per 1,000. 7.The delivery to be taken by War Service Homes Commission at kiln. 8.Henry Dean & Sons agree to load all lorries or drays at kiln with all dispatch. 9.Price as aforesaid to be varied only by (a)Increase or decrease in award rates of labour in brickyards. (b)Increase or decrease in cost of coal. 10.Delivery to be subject to climatic conditions. We would be glad if you would have this legally phrased in the form of a contract, inserting any additional matter which may be necessary, but not drastically altering the general conditions, and return to this office to be submitted to Mr. Dean for approval and signature.

The firm was induced to discard the whole of its pipemaking machinery, and to instal patent brickmaking kilns. But, after it had incurred considerable expense, and had become somewhat heavily involved, as most business firms do in transactions of this kind, the department intimated that owing to an alteration in policy no further action . was to betaken. Although the agreement was in the office merely awaiting legal drafting, the department adopted this unusual attitude, and the whole responsibility for the expenditure had to be borne by the firm. In consequence the pipemaking trade of the firm has been lost, and it has been found impracticable to reestablish the plant on the basis upon which it was operating prior to the intervention of the department. It ill becomes a government to treat in this way private citizens with whom it has entered into an agreement. Business men usually honour their moral obligations even if contracts have not actually been signed. Mr. Dean was told by the department that it recognized its moral obligation, but that he had no legal claim upon it. He endeavoured to arrive at an amicable settleiment, and for some time did not go to law. In a last resort he approached the Court, and a ; judge and jury, which consisted of business men, gave a verdict in his favour, as it was held that a contract was in fact in operation. Not satisfied with that decision the department appealed to the Full Court, not upon the facts of the case as submitted in the first instance, but upon a point of law. The appeal was upheld owing to the fact that the contract had not been actually signed. If private individuals or commercial firms were to act in such a way they would be disgraced commercially throughout the Commonwealth; but it appears that a Government department can . act in this way with impunity, merely taking shelter under legal technicalities. Not only the officer at Newcastle, but the Deputy Commissioner of War Service Homes for New South Wales was responsible for inducing the firm to undertake this contract. The only redress which the firm now has is to appeal to this House for an inquiry into the whole of the facts. On the last occasion when I submitted a similar motion I selected as members of the proposed select committee members from both sides of the House possessing business ability, who I felt sure would be prepared to assist in an investigation. also asked the Minister to allow the matter to be inquired into by the Public Accounts; Committee. The whole position is so unsatisfactory that I have again brought the subject forward in the hope that thisParliament will approve of the Government honoring its moral obligation to reputable citizens. During the last Parliament I was amazed to. find that the appointment of a committee which Isuggested, and also one which the honorable member for Warringah (Sir Granville Ryrie) advocated,which concerned thousands of people in the City of Sydney, were opposed by the Government. I submit the motion to the House in the hope that this Parliament will recognize the claims of the firm of H. Dean and Sons, and agree to the appointment of a committee such as I have suggested. I do not care how the committee may be composed, as I believe that if an impartial investigation is made it will be found that the claim of the firm is fully justified. ","Claim of H.

The matter for the consideration of honorable members is, therefore, whether in all the circumstances of the case, the claim of Messrs.HenryDean and Sons deserves, on moral grounds, some recognition. It is important to remember, however, that the claim has already been considered in our law courts, and honorable : members ought to know precisely what has taken place there. The mover of the. motion, has, no doubt inadvertently, not stated quite accurately the facts in relation to the court proceedings. This claim was first investigated by a judge and jury in the Supreme Court of New South Wales. It was submitted in an alternative form, and £26,500 damages were asked. The firm alleged, in the first place, that a contact had been made with it by the War Service Homes Commissioner, under which the Commissioner had undertaken to purchase the whole of. the firms supply of bricks for five years. Alternatively it said that the Commissioner had undertaken to buy 520,000 bricks per month for three years. The first thing that strikes one is that the company itself was not at all sure of the exact nature of its claim. It was, as a matter of fact, so doubtful of its position, that it. felt obliged to submit its claim in this alternative form. The verdict of the jury was most remarkable in that it was given in favour of the plaintiffs, without mentioning any amount of damages. It was, therefore, impossible for the judge to say which of the alternative contracts had really been made. The War Service Homes Commissioner subsequently appealed to the Full Court of New South Wales, but the grounds of appeal were not confined to what the honorable member for Newcastle has described as the technical point whether a written record of the contract was actually signed or not. I have the papers in connexion with the case before me, and I find that there were eighteen grounds of appeal, which challenged every element in the case. The court, which consisted of three judges, decided in favour of the Commissioner, and set. aside the decision of the court below. Messrs. Henry Dean and Sons, in their turn; appealed to the High Court, and the bench of five judges which heard the case, decided in favour of the Commissioner, without calling upon his counsel. That case was,I admit, decided on a pure matter of law. Of the nine judges who have considered the claim, eight have decided that Messrs. Dean and Sons had no legal claim. ","Claim of H.

I do not suggest that there are no cases in which a moral claim outside of the four corners of the law should not be recognized by Parliament, but I think that very careful consideration should be given to any claim that is made here after having been prosecuted unsuccessfully by the claimant in the law courts. Parliament should be thoroughly satisfied that there were moral obligations before it appoints committees to review decisions of thecourts.I propose now to examine on moral grounds the decision that has been given by the court on legal grounds. The basis of the claim, which I wish to state quite fairly, is that the War Service Homes Commissioner contemplated, and had announced publicly that He contemplated, undertaking an extensive building programme. The carrying out of that programme would undoubtedly have involved the obtaining of a very large quantity of bricks Messrs. Henry Dean and Sons, who were brickmakers, naturally desired to obtain a contract to supply the bricks which the War Service Homes Commissioner needed, if they could get a price profitable to themselves.","Claim of H.

That, I think is a fair way of stating the case It raises, first, the question off principle, and, secondly, a question of fact.

If a person, relying upon an announcement of policy and the continuance of that policy, spends money, is it to be conceded that he has a moral claim in the event of that policy being reversed subsequently? To admit that would involve very grave considerations of a general character. Let us, for a moment, consider the effect of the application of that principle to tariff matters. Undoubtedly, tariff proposals affect the actions of business men; but, so far, it has not been considered proper to make any compensation to any citizen who has acted on his faith in a statement of the Governments policy in tariff matters. This House not only is concerned with the collection of public moneys; it is also the guardian of those moneys when collected, and there are wellrecognized methods under which alone liability in relation to public moneys can be imposed. Speaking generally, no liability can be created under which the expenditure of public moneys would take place unless it is done in accordance with the authority conferred by this Parliament, and, in the case of a business transaction, unless a contract is entered into. If this House accepted the responsibility of making compensation to people who proved that they had lost money by reason of a change of policy, a principle would be laid down which might have very farreaching results. I ask the House to consider that principle in relation to this case. ","Claim of H.

If you enter into such an agreement, you can extend your works upon a basis of certainty, because we shall buy your bricks. The Commissioners letter makes it perfectly plain that only by entering into a contract would Dean and Sons be assured of a demand for their bricks on the part of the Commission. In presenting these facts to the House, I propose to rely upon the evidence of Mr. Dean himself and his own correspondence; I shall not refer to anything said by any one else. In his evidence, before the Supreme Court of New South Wales, Mr. Dean stated that he was interviewed after the 20th July, 1920, the date of the letter to which I have referred ; that an officer of the Commission, Mr. Cook, then spoke to him about bricks, and that he, Mr. Dean, said he was not prepared at that time to make a contract for any specified quantity of bricks, his reason being that he had a large number of orders from private customers outstanding, and that probably there were other orders to which his firm was committed and which it would have to honour. He was, however, willing to accept orders for the supply of bricks. After having received the letter which stated that he should enter into an agreement if he wanted a permanent market for his bricks, Mr. Dean refused to do so. It has not been suggested that on the 11th September, 1920, any contract between the two parties had been entered into. At that time, as I have stated, the Commissioner was urging Messrs. Dean and Sons to enter into an agreement. That the firm was not agreeable to do. On that date Messrs. Dean and Sons wrote ","Claim of H.

The principle of the referendum, initiative, and recall comes primarily from Switzerland, but in some of the States of America it certainly did appear a little earlier. It was known in the Italian republics, and also in the ancient history of Greece and Rome. It made Switzerland a country whose borders were inviolate during the last war. Germany, Austria, Italy, and Prance were fighting amongst themselves, yet Switzerland kept its borders inviolate because of the justice of its laws, which are based upon the referendum, initiative, and recall. There is, in Hansard, an epitome of the reasons for this motion made by me on the 25th March, 1920, when this House honoured me by carrying a similar resolution unanimously. It mentions the various times this subject was brought before most of the American States. Again, on the 17th August, 1923, my proposal was unfortunately strongly opposed by the Prime Minister, and although it was taken at a difficult stage on the motion for the adjournment of the House it was defeated only by six votes.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","None","KZO","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","I look forward to the time when the position of a member of Parliament will not be so precarious as perhaps it is now. When an honorable member has proved to his constituents that he is doing his work satisfactorily, he should remain in Parliament as their representative. As an instance, I may state that for 37 years now I have given the majority of my electors the right to recall me by petitioning me to resign. In 1889 I was elected by a small majority of 222. My total votes were over 700, and if a petition signed by 360 of my electors asking for my resignation had been presented to me, I should have resigned the next day. That is the pledge that I have always given to my electors, except when I was elected unopposed. I have with me an interesting leaflet containing the strongest arguments that I have been able to formulate in favour of the referendum, initiative, and recall. The time may come when an honorable member will be elected to Parliament contingent upon good behaviour, and only his constituents will have the right to recall him. Judge Isaacs, assisted by Judge Higgins, made a notable fight in the Federal Convention for the referendum, but unfortunately it was not adopted in the Constitution. A Government with a large majority in both Houses would be able, if it dared, to take away the voting right of every man and woman in Australia. But if that right were safeguarded in the Constitution, it could not be taken away without the permission of the people. That is the reason why I desire to see the referendum, initiative, and recall enacted. At one time the Bulletin was a firm supporter of those principles ; whether or not it has been influenced by the large advertisements which now appear in its columns, I cannot say, but it is no longer as staunch a believer in the referendum, initiative, and recall as it was. The Australian Natives Association has adopted this reform, and advocates it through its many fine branches. The Labour party, too, has adopted it, but the recall has been excluded from the partys Federal platform. Honorable members who have studied this question know, however, that soon after the referendum and initiative become law, the recall, the coping stone of this splendid edifice of political economy, will be added. Some of the highest officers of . the Nationalist party have been supporters of these principles, and one is a vicepresident of the Referendum, Initiative, and Recall League in Victoria. Nationalists, however, have been diffident about including this plank in their platform. Various municipalities have adopted it, so that money cannot be borrowed or expended until the will of the ratepayers has been ascertained by a poll. Both Gladstone and Lord Salisbury, men of opposite political parties, supported the referendum, which at one time was the third plank in the platform of the Conservative party in England. The last constitution evolved by the genius of the British race, thanks to the sympathy of the late King Edward and the support of the House of Commons, namely the constitution of Ireland, includes the initiative and referendum, and that, in my opinion, makes it the finest constitution enjoyed by any people living under the British flag. In the splendid little island of Tasmania, a bill providing for the referendum and initiative has been passed by the Legislative Assembly, and I hope that the Legislative Council, too, will have the good sense to adopt it. If it does not, I hope that the Government of that State will follow the example of Labour Governments in Queensland and New South Wales, and abolish the House of Fossils. In New South Wales, Mr. Lang, who appears to be the strongest Premier who has ever controlled the destinies of that State, has said definitely that if Sir Joseph Carruthers attempts,, as he has said he will, to insert in. the bill for the amendment of the constitution an amendment to provide for the adoption of. the referendum, and initiative, the Government will accept it. I. hope that Sir. Joseph Carruthers is acting sincerely; but I. cannot recollect any previous proposal by him during, the last 30 years to trust the people entirely, as this principle implies.. However, I. have a high regard for him personally, and I endorse his scheme, to settle 1,000,000 settlers on 1,000,000 farms, and if he is now a true believer, in the referendum, initiative, and recall, I. welcome him into the fold, even as an eleventhhour recruit. These principles might have been part of Australias Constitution today but for that accursed  murder of human, beings which we call war. Mr. Andrew Fisher, who never lied and was trusted, by all,, pledged himself during the election, which gave his party a majority in this Parliament, to introduce the referendum and initiative, and to provide pensions for widows. But the war absorbed all our finances, changed, the ideals of men and women, and left the world poorer not only by the murder and mutilation of millions of soldiers, but also by the death, through starvation and. disease, of a very much greater number of innocent men, women, and children. What stronger preventive of such horrors: could there be than a law requiring a referendum to precede any declaration of war ? No finer deterrent of legalized, murder has ever been evolved by. the brain of man. At the present time there is: a difference of opinion between some States of. the Commonwealth in. regard to the 44hours working week. In. South. Africa, that, is already the law of the. land.. Thanks to the wise advice given by the late. Alfred Deakin > to a South African royal commission, thai; visited Australia, a law promulgated, by the South African Parliament operates throughout the : Union, and from the 1st December, 1924, it became the law of: the land that every skilled worker in the building, trades should. receive at least 2s; 9d. per hour for a week of* 44 hours: . The avowed .purpose of that is to discourage overtime, the opinion, being held that continuous employment, is: more beneficial to a country than a system of overtime, which connotes, tha alternation of ab> normal earnings and unemployment. The. maximum penalty for, am offence against this law. is a fine of £500, or> imprisonment for two years, or both. When I was in Capetown I. ascertained that, its white, population pf 112,000 persons did not include one  plasterer. I was told that there were two bricklayers in the community, but I could not find them. When Senator Whiteside, of the South African Parliament, . who had been a worker on the? tramways in Victoria, and is now Commissioner for Railways in South Africa, came to Australia, I said to him, Do I understand this law to mean that if any man, white, coloured or black, works at those skilled trades he must be paid at least 2s. 9d. per, hour.? He answered that that was the law, and, to their credit, the employers in South Africa formed a council, upon which the workers in the building trades had representation, and raised the wage in some parts of South Africa from 2s. 9d. to 3s: 6d. per bour: Honorable members will understand that there must have been some reason for the slow development of South Africa, in comparison with that of Australia. Prior to the opening of  the Suez Canal, only one of every four ships that, went to the Cape came to Australia. Why have not more white people settled in that great country? Because they had to compete in employment with the blacks and halfcastes. Today a Britisher holding an appointment in South Africa receives, a higher wage than is paid in any part of Australia other than Fords motor works at Geelong. If Australia adopted the referendum, . initiative, and recall,, the standardization of hours; wages, and other, working conditions throughout Australia could be easily effected. Today there are in the Commonwealth six. different arbitration laws, and different systems, of industrial tribunals, awarding different rates of pay and working hours. I come now to the strongest argument I can adduce in favour of the principle of the referendum, initiative, and recall. A clergyman quoted against the principle of the referendum, the demand of the populace of. Jerusalem for the release of Bar abbas and the crucifixion of Christ. I said  Having regard to the fact that Christs opponents had used money and persuasion to inflame the minds of the populace against Him; it was little1 wonder that they demanded that He be sacrificed.  I have never permitted my brain to formulate or my lips to utter a word against any religion. Sometimes I may have cause to criticise ministers of the Gospel; and adherents of a religion, but I never. assail any mans faith. So I said, in all sincerity, to my clerical friend,  God never created anything His equal or His superior. Why, then, should the electors, who are the creators of Parliament, once in every three years, make an institution more powerful than themselves? The referendum, initiative, and recall will give to the people control of Parliament at all times. No country, however richly endowed by nature, can contain a happy, contented race of healthy human beings if the laws governing it are unjust or are badly administered. History shows clearly that countries poorly endowed with natural resources can contain healthy, happy, contented people if the laws are just and founded upon democratic principles. The true foundation of any democracy must be the initiative referendum and recall. Switzerland is not so favorably situated as is Scotland in this regard, but a genius to whom I .have already referred has compared Scotland, with all its advantages, with Switzerland, though he gives the palm to Switzerland. On one occasion I listened to a speech in this Chamber which lasted for nine hours. What would happen in Switzerland that school house of Europe if a speech which lasted for nine hours were delivered, say, by a German? Switzerland is a trilingual country, and in such a case a French member would have the right to say,  This is not my vernacular. I desire the speech to be translated. Any one who has experience in the translation of speeches as Mr Speaker must have had when representing Australia at the Assembly of the League of Nations knows that the translation of a speech takes longer than its delivery in .the first instance. Therefore, another nine hours would be required to complete the work of translation, making eighteen hours, before the speech was available in German and French. An Italian representative would then have the right to say, .I wish the speech to be translated into Italian. This would involve .another nine .hours work, or 27 hours in all. In Switzerland they dis pose of burning questions by appealing to the people. If this Government wished to settle a difficult question, especially if an election were pending, it could be left  to the arbitrament of the people. I have much pleasure in submitting the motion for the favorable consideration of the House.

The bill, as has been explained by the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr. Hill), is to ratify an agreement entered into between the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth (Mr. Bruce) and the Premier of South Australia (Mr. Gunn). It is also proposed to carry out an agreement entered into by the Commonwealth and the State of South Australia in 1910, which is embodied in the Northern Territory Acceptance Act and which provides that the Commonwealth shall construct, or cause to be constructed, as part of the transcontinental railway, a railway from a point on the Port Augusta railway to connect with the other part of the transcontinental railway at a point on the northern boundary of South Australia proper. Since that agreement was entered into by the late .Mr. Alfred Deakin on behalf of the Commonwealth, and the late Hon. Thomas Price on behalf of the South Australian Government, various interpretations have been placed upon its provisions, generally by persons endeavouring to gain some advantage f ot the  States which they represented. It was an honorable agreement entered into by the respective parties, and one to which effect should have been given at an earlier date. Time after time the construction of the northsouth railway, as it is now known, has been before the people, particularly at election time for propaganda purposes, and party leaders have said that immediate action would be taken in the building of the line if they were returned with a majority. I congratulate the Government Upon the action it, has taken in bringing the bill before the House so early in the session. I also wish to commend the Premier of South Australia (Mr. Gunn) for the active interest he has taken in the subject, and for the efforts made in bringing the agreement to fruition. From time to time this proposal has been the stalking horse of those contesting elections, and I heard a candidate for a seat in another place state that the Premier of South Australia was responsible for holding up the present agreement. The Minister will, I am sure, agree that that gentleman is largely responsible for the satisfactory position which has now been reached. In moving the second reading of the bill the Minister said a good deal concerning the potentialities of the Northern Territory, which have been discussed in this chamber on many occasions. Having had the privilege of travelling through the Northern Territory since I last spoke on this subject, I realize that a good deal of what I have heard and read in the past has been said or written by people unacquainted with the actual conditions in that large tract of country. Last year I accompanied the party of which the Minister was a member, who, last night, gave the House his impressions of the country. His statement concerning the potentialities of the Northern Territory is not in any way exaggerated, because at the time the trip was made, the conditions generally were most unfavorable. State officers who had visited the country before stated on several occasions, when one days journey ended, that tha country to be traversed on the following day would be better; but, owing to the drought which prevailed, they were disappointed to find that the conditions were not as they expected. I travelled over country which had not had any rain for three and a half years, and in these circumstances the Minister saw some of the country at its worst. Notwithstanding this, he was able to give the House a satisfactory report, and to express the opinion that a line should have been built years ago. The construction of the pro posed line has been delayed, I believe, owing to the fact that the existing railway terminates .at Oodnadatta, a township which is surrounded by some of the worst country in Central Australia. All the stock which travels from the north, of course, comes to Oodnadatta, so that the surrounding country is always in an eatenout condition. Travellers, therefore, invariably see it in the worst of conditions. The party of which the Minister for Works and Railways was a member went SO miles beyond Alice Springs, and they found that although there were patches on the road, the farther north they went from Oodnadatta the better the country became. Beyond Alice Springs it was extraordinarily good. The area known as Burt Plains was so good that some of the settlers there had already gone in for sheep, and were doing well. The greatest difficulty in the way of development is the lack of transportation facilities. Practically every visitor to the Territory returns south with the opinion that the NorthSouth railway should have been built before now. It is a great satisfaction to South Australians, myself among them, that at last the agreement of fifteen years ago is to be honoured. I wish to take this opportunity of expressing the hope that the Minister will try to do something to improve the cattle transportation facilities on the Oodnadatta line. On the 27th August last I asked him in this chamber the following questions :  1.Whether it is a fact that cattle trucks of a large size are being constructed at Port Augusta, for use on the railway from Quorn to Oodnadatta? 2.If so, in view of the fact that the stockowners definitely state that cattle travelled on large trucks are more susceptible to damage and bruising, which thus involves cruelty, will he give consideration to the matter, and to the objection of the stockowners, and, if satisfied that the objection is valid, have the smaller sized truck constructed? His replies were 1.Under contract let in April, 1924, 32 bogie cattle wagons are being constructed in Adelaide for traffic on the Oodnadatta railway. 2.The wagons were designed after long experience in the transport of very large numbers of cattle over long distances in hot climates. The wagons are being constructed in such manner as will facilitate the handling of cattle and land them at destination in good condition, and with a minimum of bruising. In the Northern Territory, and in other parts of Australia, similar types of wagons are carrying to freezing works thousands of cattle from consignors, who are most particular as to the manner in which the cattle are handled, and who insist that bruising of the stock must be avoided. The fact is, however, that the cattle raisers are very dissatisfied with the treatment their stock receives in these big trucks during transit from Oodnadatta. On this matter the South Australian Stockowners Association wrote to the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner on the 15th September, 1925, as follows:","Second Reading","RAILWAYS (SOUTH AUSTRALIA) AGREEMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The large trucks are not suitable for the conditions that prevail in these far northern areas. These stockowners are men of considerable experience, who would not complain without just cause. I trust that the Minister will give earnest consideration to their suggestions. Only last year I met a gentleman at Port Augusta who uses these trucks a good deal. He told me that on one occasion he purchased, in the north, a number of horses for Indian remount purposes, and had them sent from Oodnadatta to Port Augusta in one of these big trucks, but they arrived in such a shocking condition that they were of no use whatever for remount work. Some of them, as a matter of fact, had to be shot. If the present conditions are allowed to continue, stockowners will cease to use the railway. It is well known that, when feed is to be had en route, they prefer to send their stock by road. If the railways into the interior are to pay, the transportation conditions must be greatly improved. I was glad to hear the Minister mention last night the possibility of mineral developments in Central Australia. He did not, by any means, exaggerate the prospects. North of Alice Springs there are many mining shows that are likely to yield splendid results. The Home of Bullion mine, to which the Minister referred, is, I am informed on good authority, only one of many similar mines. The evidence that the last parliamentary party to visit this country obtained from unbiased persons was that Central Australia was rich in minerals, but that their development was altogether dependent upon the provision of railway facilities. The railway which it is now proposed to build will not go near the Home of Bullion mine, which is about 150 miles from Alice Springs, but I hope that very soon it will be continued further north, until eventually it reaches right to Darwin. Many honorable members yesterday discussed at length the value of the mining industry to the Commonwealth. I hope, therefore, that there will be no unnecessary delay in making it possible to develop the mineral resources of Central Australia. Included in the proposal before us is the building of a line from Red Hill to Port Augusta. Red Hill, which may not be very well known to honorable members, is the terminus of a 5ft. 3in. gauge railway 106 miles from Adelaide. It is only 30 miles south by southwest from the important industrial centre of Port Pirie. From Red Hill to Adelaide it is proposed to lay a third rail, in order to provide a 4ft. 8in. gauge line from Port Augusta to Adelaide. With the standard gauge line extended from Red Hill to Port Augusta, the distance between Adelaide and Port Augusta by rail would be 193 miles, as against 260 miles by the existing route via Terowie. Moreover, there would be no break of gauge as at present. The Minister said last night that the construction of a railway from Red Hill to Port Augusta would be the subject of inquiry by the PublicWorks Committee. Personally, I am glad that that will be so, as the route tentatively fixed by the surveys which have been made is not, in my opinion, the best one for the railway. It is not proposed to extend the 5ft. 3in. railway to Port Pirie, and it is intended that the 4ft. 8½in. line shall be not nearer than 1 mile 50 chains to that town. Last year, in reply to a question, the Minister informed me that it was intended . that the newline should not enter Port _ Germein, but that the railway station was to be threequarters of a mile from that town. Another survey left the railway 4 miles from Port Pirie, and about l£ miles from Port Germein.  Those two towns should be on the new standard gauge railway. Instead of that railway being used only for the conveyance of passengers between Adelaide and Port Augusta, it should be1 made to serve that .portion of South Australia which at present does not enjoy proper railway facilities. Port Germein is a shallow seaport 18 miles north of Port Pirie. Communication with Adelaide is obtained by means of .a small boat fortnightly. If the railway between Adelaide and Port Augusta were to pass through Port Pirie, the distance by rail between that place and Port Augusta would be about 60 miles. At present, to travel by rail between those two towns necessitates a journey of 1S2 miles. To make a deviation from the route suggested to enable the railway to pass through Port Pirie would prevent the subdivision of fifteen farms, whereas if the line were taken further west that would not be necessary. Moreover, the construction of the railway in a more westerly position would mean that less sanddrift would be encountered. Last year I presented a petition, signed by thousands of ratepayers in that portion of South Australia, in connexion with this matter. Apparently, the idea of both the State and Federal Railways Commissioners is to .prevent overlapping .in railway matters, but it should not be difficult to make the necessary adjustments in the accounts. Any commissioner who was incapable of doing so would not be fit to retain his position. Last night the Minister for Works and Railways referred to the .possibility of a big silverlead mine being opened up in the Northern Territory. As it would be impracticable to convey .the coal, coke, limestone, and other materials necessary for smelting to the mine because of their bulky nature and necessary high freights, any ore obtained from it would have to be transported to a seaport in South Australia for smelting. It has been suggested that in that event smelters would be erected at Port Augusta, but at Port  Pirie the Broken Hill Associated Smelters Proprietary  Company Limited has now the largest smelting works in the world, and it is not likely that while that plant remains there another will be erected at Port Augusta. With the improved machinery and .appliances at the existing , plant at Port Pirie that plant would be capable of dealing with five times the .quantity of ore it now .treats. In view of the .possibility .1 ;hav.e mentioned, it is extremely desirable that the standard .gauge railway should pass through Port Pirie. With a railway station 1 mile 50 chains .from the town, transhipment .of the. ore would be necessary, to say nothing Of the other disadvantages of a breakofgauge station.","Second Reading","RAILWAYS (SOUTH AUSTRALIA) AGREEMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/para[3]","N/A","N/A"

From my knowledge of the country I feel sure that for the proper development of the north, apart from the construction of a railway from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs, it would be better if a railway were constructed from either Derby or Broome, in Western Australia, easterly through Halls Creek to Camooweal, in Queensland.

But, before this Parliament commits itself to the construction of a railway, honorable members should have full information before them. In this bill we are making a promise to South Australia that we will build this railway, though we have no information about it. The agreement makes provision for the laying of a third rail between Port Augusta and Adelaide. There has been a good deal of investigation by railway engineers and others into the safety and practicability of a third fail, but I. do not know that it can be stated authoritatively that a third rail can be introduced into a railway system without grave danger. If it can, the adoption of such a course might overcome the difficulty of the breaks of gauge in our railway systems generally. The matter is one about which we should be very careful. The Minister should give us some assurance that by passing this bill, Parliament will not be binding itself to the construction of a new railway. Once this bill is passed, it will be contended that a pledge has been given to South Australia, and that we ought to carry it out. Are we going to pledge ourselves to this without information which, in my opinion, is essential before we can decide upon the construction of such a line? I have made no personal investigations with regard to the use of the third rail, but I know that some trials of its use were made in New South Wales, close to the Victorian border. I understand that the experiments were considered fairly successful. I am, however, doubtful, if a third rail could be used on a main line, on which there are many points and crossings, without danger to passenger traffic.

I believe that if we had a direct line on the 4ft. 8^in. gauge from Adelaide to Port Augusta, the transcontinental railway would have a far better prospect of being a financial success. I am not indulging in criticism with a view to prevent the construction of such a line. But it is questionable whether we are being asked to commit ourselves to a fair agreement between the Commonwealth and the South Australian Government. Honorable members will remember that in the case of the construction of the railway from Kyogle to South Brisbane the Commonwealth undertakes to bear a certain proportion of the cost, and the New South Wales and Queensland Governments undertake to share in the cost. Under the agreement now before us, the Commonwealth is to pay the whole cost of the construction of the proposed line. I agree that the construction of the line would be of great advantage to passengers to and from Western Australia, and in connexion with the carriage of mails between Fremantle and Adelaide. It would help to make the transcontinental railway a financial success ; but I repeat that we should have more specific information as to what the proposed line will cost, and reports of engineers in support of the route proposed.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","YATES, George","L1T","Adelaide","N/A","N/A","276",". I wish to compliment those responsible for the introduction of this measure, and especially the Premier of South Australia, who has evinced so much concern about the longpromised development of the Northern Territory, and has, I think, brought its accomplishment within measurable distance. I am reminded of the statements which used to be made about the Murray Valley, and what might be done with it. It was due to the practical mind of the late Tom Price, of South Australia, that operations are now being carried, on in locking the Murray, and making it the asset which it should be to the Commonwealth. I think that the action provided for under this bill has been much too long delayed. The honorable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory) has suggested the construction of a line from Derby across to Camooweal, but I cannot believe that such a line would have the same effect in the rapid development of the Northern Territory as would a line giving us direct communication between Port Darwin and the south. The line bisecting the Commonwealth north and south should be carried out as quickly as possible. All the plans submitted to us show that the valuable parts of the Northern Territory are the Victoria Downs country, the Barkly Tableland, and the mineral country of the centre, and if the Northern Territory is to be properly developed it will be by a line from Port Darwin to Adelaide via Oodnadatta. When such a line is constructed there may be branch lines running to Derby and to the Pellew Islands. I believe that Mr. Hobler reported in favour of such a scheme. I personally do not mind so long as the best route and that which will give the best results to the Commonwealth is adopted. It is pleasant to note that the agreement which has existed for go long between the Commonwealth and South Australia is at last being honoured. It has always appeared to me that the use of a third rail ought to be possible to overcome the difficulty of a break of gauge. Its use through big stations with much interlocking gear might be found difficult, but it should be possible to use it over long distances to overcome the difficulties experienced from breaks of gauge. The honorable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory) takes some exception to the proposal for the laying of a third rail, and I direct his attention to paragraph c of clause 6 of the schedule, in which provision for an alternative is made. That paragraph states that if the use of a third rail is considered impracticable or dangerous, a railway on a 4ft. 8^in. gauge should be constructed, so that always there will be a. continuous railway on that gauge from Port Augusta to the central railway station in Adelaide. I hope, with the honorable member for Grey (Mr. Lacey), with whom I have had several conversations on this matter, that when inquiring into this work the Minister and the Public Works Committee will carefully consider the claims of towns to which railway communication means so much. I have been led to believe that some of the surveys take the railway to within 1£ miles of places like Port Pirie and Port Germein, without actually running into those centres. I am unable to dogmatize as to the route which should be followed, but I hope no mistakes will be made which would prevent the line offering the greatest facilities possible for development. I trust that the best brains will be devoted to its construction. It may be suggested that I do not know what I am talking about; but I have in mind the fact that somewhere back in the 80s, when the line was constructed to the hills near Adelaide, provision was made for two tunnels and for a Yankee bridge, over which a great many people were afraid to travel. Though the contour of the country and engineering principles have not altered in the meantime, only about two years ago the line was altered in such a way that one tunnel and the skeleton bridge were done away with. I presume that with the advice of the South Australian Railways Commissioner, whose qualifications induced the Premier of that State to appoint him to his position, Mr. Bell, and the Public Works Committee, we may look for the adoption of a line which will give the best results. I compliment the Government, the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr, Hill), and the Premier of South Australia, upon this measure to deal with the NorthSouth railway. I hope that before this Parliament dissolves the railway will be completed, because I am sure that it will be an asset to the Commonwealth and turn what is now a white elephant into something of value to the Commonwealth.

Although I am pleased that something is at last being done to construct a railway from the north to the south of Australia, this agreement does not quite meet with my approval. I object to the route agreed upon by the Federal and South Australian Parliaments. I do not take a parochial view of this matter. The speeches delivered by honorable members representing South Australian constituencies naturally favour the route proposed by the Government; but I would remind honorable members that the loss on the railway, as outlined by the Minister last night, will, of course, have to be met by the people of Australia. When the Northern Territory transfer was being effected, Messrs. Deakin, Lyne and Forrest represented the Commonwealth, and Messrs. OLoughlinPeake and Price represented South Australia. I have been given to understand that Mr. Deakin would not agree to the stipulation desired by South Australia that the line should run direct from the Northern Territory to South Australia. He insisted that the matter of the route should be left open. . To comply with the agreement the railway must pass through the northern border of South Australia, but it is possible for the line to take a more easterly route than is now proposed bv the Government. It could pass into Queensland somewhere in the neighbourhood of Birdsville, and even west of it, and yet comply with the agreement.

Queensland west of Birdsville would go through what was considered to be much better country.  Mr.Foster The original agreement especially excludes that proposal. The Hon. R. Butler was also of the opinion that the line should be constructed west of Birdsville. He is reported in the South Australian Hansard as follows: He disapproved of. the, proposal to hand over any of our railways to the Commonwealth. He would not oppose the eastern route. (The Commissioner of Crown Lands.  The agreement provides that the railway must come through South;. Australian territory.) Certainly touched the territory of this State, but only, a corner of it, and then it passed threequarters of the way through Queensland territory...... If the eastern route were agreed upon, there must be some definite stipulation concerning the construction of the railway from Oodnadatta. Thatspeechshowsthatthe time of making the transfer of the Northern Territory from South Australia, to the Commonwealth; the eastern route was favoured. The Hon. R. Butler is furtherreported He would be prepared to start from the presentendiftheCommonwealthstartedfrom Pine Creek, and. agreed to meet the South. Australian line at. a point to be. arranged. If that were done, they would know what South Australia was to get. Under the agreement they would not know what South. Australia would get out of the arrangement. The Federal line would enter Queensland; and it. would be years before South Australia got a through line. From those speeches we must conclude that when the Territory was transferred the eastern route was favoured.I cannot understand the present change of opinion, in view of the geographical positions of the two lines. If a line is constructed from Hergott, now called Marree, in a direct, northerly direction, it will pass through the northern border of South Australia, and will still comply, with the original agreement if it enters Queensland. The boundary line between the Northern Territory and South Australia is the 26th parallel of latitude, and from the point at which it meets the Queensland border it: runs easterly for a considerable distance to the 141st meridian of longitude. Mr. OLoughlin is also reported in the South AustralianHansard as follows : Subject to the provisions of this act, and the agreement, and of the acts incorporated with this act, the Commonwealth (1) For the purpose of carrying out, in accordance with the agreement, its undertaking to construct, or cause to be constructed, the transcontinental railway line from PortDarwin southwards to a point on the Port Augusta railway, may construct, or cause to be constructed, as part of such transcontinental railway, a railway in South Australia proper from a point on the Port Augusta railway, to connect at a point on the northern boundary of South Australia proper with the part of such transcontinental railway to be constructed from Port Darwin southwards to such point with all proper stations...... That is the relevant portion of. the original agreement, made between the CommonwealthandSouthAustraliato connect the railway at a point on the northern boundary of South Australia proper.","Second Reading","RAILWAYS (SOUTH AUSTRALIA) AGREEMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

The proposed route from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs is 297 miles long. A line from Marree to Birdsville would be 280 miles in length, or, roughly, the same distance as from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs. The Minister for Works and Railways(Mr. Hill) admitted last night that the western route will pass through , poor country. Those of us who have travelled over the present line as far as Oodnadatta know that it passes through poor country.

But the railway would traverse country having a rainfall that would permit of successful settlement. I could not help thinking last night that the whole of the arguments which the Minister adduced against the Kingoonya to Alice Springs route were equally applicable to the area : between Oodnadatta and Alice Springs. He spoke of the difficulty of obtaining water by sinking, and said that at Todmorden station no rain had fallen for two and a half years. Through such country Parliament is asked to build a railway. I ask honorable members to consider this proposition on its merits and to free their minds of bias.I admit that if the railway followed the eastern deviation it would pass through very poor country for the first 200 miles north of Marree.

On the Birdsville route the line will ran into country having an assured rainfall, will adequately serve theNorthern Territory, and will honour the agreement made with South Australia. The Barkly Tableland is said to be the only part of Australia that has never experienced a drought. The line I am advocating will traverse that tableland, and connect with the existing railway fromDarwin to Pine Creek. If a railway on the eastern route will tap country with an assured rainfall, and traverse only 200 miles of poor country, instead of the 550 miles through which the line proposed by the Government will run, the House must agree that the eastern route is the better. Much emphasis has been laid upon the alleged mineral wealth in the Macdonnell ranges. Kalgoorlie and Coolgardie were at one time enormously rich, and still have large quantities of lowgrade ore, but notwithstanding railway facilities, water supplies, and other aids to development, Coolgardie is almost extinct, and Kalgoorlie is on the decline. I cannot understand why honorable members should expect the future of the Macdonnell range mineral areas to be any brighter than the record of the eastern goldfields of Western Australia. The declared policy of the Commonwealth Government includes the unification of railway gauges;yet the Government proposes to make an arrangement with a State Government for the construction of a railway on the 3ft.6in. gauge, thus helping to continue and aggravate the break of gauge evil. The very fact of building so many more miles of railway on the 3ft. 6in. gauge will make more difficult and costly the task of standardization. The Government seems to be entering into an agreement to break down its own policy.

I therefore hope that the agreement will be returned to the Government of South Australia, with an intimation that this Parliament insists that a railway shall be built on the standard gauge along the route which will best serve the interests of Australia asa whole. A railway constructed on the 4ft. 8½in. gauge from Marree to Birdsville, and thence to Camooweal, would be a continuation of the line from Adelaide to Marree, which will eventually be converted to the 4ft.8½in. gauge, thus providing a railway of the one gauge from Central Australia to Adelaide, and avoiding the inconvenience and expense necessitated at breaks of gauge. It seems ridiculous that this proposal should be submitted to the House when the Government is considering laying down a third rail on the existing 5ft. 3in. gauge between Red Hill and Adelaide.

I am endeavouring to look at this subject from a truly Australian point of view, and am suggesting a route which, I sincerely believe to be preferable to that proposed. I do not think that a railway from Oodnadatta northwards is the best that could be constructed; a line in an easterly direction would be more advantageous owing to the fact that it would traverse only a comparatively small area of poor country, arid serve territory with an assured rainfall. In introducing a bill in 1907 to provide for the transfer of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth, the Commissioner of Crown Lands in South Australia expressed the opinion that a railway to the north would probably be constructed along the Queensland border. Another member of the South Australian Parliament, the late Sir Richard Butler, who spoke later on, expressed similar views, but said that he was opposed to transfer because the time within which the railway was to be constructed was not stipulated. He said, however, that he was not opposed to the eastern route, which is the one I favour.

It is my intention at this stage not to go over the whole of the ground covered by previous speakers, but to answer the criticisms of some speakers and to confirm the statements of others. A good deal has been said by the honorable member for Richmond (Mr. R. Green) concerning the most desirable route for the proposed railway. I do not know whether my schooling differed from his, but I remember learning that the four cardinal points of the compass are north, south, east and west, and this leads me to think that a line known as the NorthSouth railway should be built from the north to the south, or vice versa. Yet, according to the arguments of the honorable member for Richmond, a northsouth line should be built in an easterly direction. The history of the proposed line extends further back than 1911, when the agreement between the Commonwealth and South Australia for the transfer of the Northern Territory was entered into, as a transcontinental line was first mentioned 55 years ago when the South Australian Government undertook the construction of the overland telegraph line through, the centre of the continent. In 1882 my late father, the Hon. J. Langdon Parsons, who was the Minister controlling the Northern Territory in the Bray Government, visited the Northern Territory in charge of a parliamentary party. On his return to South Australia so impressed was he with the wonderful potentialities of the Territory that, after having piloted a bill through Parliament to provide for the construction of a line to Oodnadatta and one from Darwin, which was then known as Palmerston, to Pine Creek a distance of 346 miles he resigned his portfolio as Minister controlling the Northern Territory and Minister of Education, and accepted the position of Government Resident in the Northern Territory, so that he could represent the Government in connexion with the construction of that line. Notwithstanding my fathers urgent representations to the Government that the work should be done by southern Europeans, who were to be granted land on the completion of the construction, the Government in its wisdom or otherwise, employed Chinese coolies who, when the work was completed, placed their money in their pockets and returned to their own country. No settlement whatever followed. South Australia completed these two sections of railway; but owing to the frequent changes of government, the Northern Territory was practically forgotten. There were other gentlemen who believed in the possibilities of the Territory, including the late Mr. Simpson Newland, who, irrespective of what was said concerning the Territory, was always one of the keenest advocates of a northsouth railway. The South Australian people, who had almost despaired of seeing . a railway constructed, finally agreed, through their Parliament, to the construction of a line under the land grant system, the merits or demerits of which I do not propose to discuss at this juncture. If one has the slightest doubt as to what South Australia meant, and what the Commonwealth knew that South Australia desired, when she stipulated in the agreement under which she handed over the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth, one has only to refer to the plan attached to the bill embodying the agreement, on which is shown, a line running directly northwards. South Australia was prepared to trust the Commonwealth and the other  States to do a fair thing. Certainly no period in which the work was to be undertaken was specified, but South Australia showed that she trusted the Commonwealth to honour its obligation. Opinions have been given on the question by some of the most learned Kings Counsel in the Commonwealth, all of whom agree that there is not the slightest doubt that the railway provided for in the agreement is a direct north south line. It would be undesirable, if not impossible, in such an agreement, to define the exact course that the line must take.","Second Reading","RAILWAYS (SOUTH AUSTRALIA) AGREEMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","PARSONS, Walter","KXR","N/A","N/A","N/A","281","Some persons might have talked of another route, but I cannot remember that a single South Australian advocated it. I must remind the honorable member for Richmond that sentences in speeches may be taken from their context and used to support almost any argument. In Holy Writ there is the statement,  There is no God. That sounds, very strange, taken apart from its context; but when one reads the complete verse, he finds that it is,  The fool hath said in his heart there is no God. The honorable member had a good deal to say about that wonderful place Birdsville. I have been informed that at one time children of five years of age were living there who had never seen rain. I have also been informed, and I have no reason whatever to doubt the veracity of my informant, that the average annual rainfall in Birdsville is 7 inches, and not 15 inches as stated by the honorable member. If his statements on other points are as inaccurate as that of the average annual rainfall, we cannot safely place reliance upon them. I agree with the honorable member for Grey (Mr. Lacey) that, it would be a serious mistake to allow the line from Port Augusta to Red Hill to pass within . 2 miles of Port Pirie without actually entering the town. I have not examined the survey, but I know that a 3*chain road runs almost all the way from Red Hill to Port Pirie. If the line could he taken down that road into the town a good deal Of money might be saved in the purchase of land. In view of the speech just delivered by the honorable member for Richmond (Mr. R. Green), and also because of the attempts that have been made from time to time to filch from South Australia her fights in regard to the Territory, I should like a definite assurance from the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr. Hill) that the agreement in the schedule of this bill does not in any way abrogate the undertakings in the original agreement to transfer, the Territory. I must confess that I, in common with a good many other South Australians, have been suspicious of the intentions of the Commonwealth in regard to the building of the .NorthSouth railway. For many years I conducted an extensive correspondence in the press on this subject, and I always urged that South Australia should .hold fast to every right that she had under the transfer agreement. Referring for a moment to the route of the .railway, the question in the last analysis .is not whether this, .that, or the other route, is the better one, but whether South .Australia transferred the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth for certain definite considerations. I contend she did so, and that one of the principal considerations in the mind of the .Parliament at that time was that the NorthSouth railway .should be ; constructed by the Commonwealth within a .reasonable time. In my judgment, it as improper for any group of persons, or for individuals, to attempt to interfere with the fulfilment of the agreement that was made. South Australia should not be robbed of .her rights. There is a much more important consideration in this matter, .however, than the honouring .of the agreement made with the South Australian Government. The building of the NorthSouth railway is absolutely essential to the welfare of the Commonwealth, and the continuance of our White .Australia policy, for it will make possible the populating and development of the Northern Territory. If that is done, we shall be able should war occur here in the future i and we know the quarter from which trouble may come to do something, at least, in our own defence. If we make even an honest attempt to populate the Northern Territory and the unsettled parts of northwestern Australia, we shall be able, in the event of another nation attempting to dispossess us of our country, to appeal confidently to our friends abroad for assistance. If, on the other hand, we allow this great territory to remain undeveloped for years in the hands of a meagre population of 2,000 people, we shall, in my opinion, have no right, in the event of war occurring, to expect assistance from outside. For these reasons, I sincerely trust that the NorthSouth line will shortly be an accomplished fact.

I do not intend to delay honorable members .long, and I regret that it is necessary to speak so soon after the introduction of this bill late last night; but I understand that the Minister desires that it shall be pushed through. The long and elaborate agreement in the schedule of the bill would need close consideration before one could follow the whole .of its ramifications. As I .understand it, although . it does not definitely fix the route of the line, it is . a .step forward, in that it provides that the work shall be  completed within a given time. That: is something on which I heartily congratulate the Government ..and the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr. Sill). T am specially pleased that the bill has .been introduced, because it confirms , the view expressed by honorable members on this side of ..the Chamber when the bill for the construction of the Mataranka to Daly Waters railway was before the House three years .ago. The then honorable member for Angas (Mr. Gabb) moved an amendment to that measure which, had it been carried, would have had the effect of referring the whole matter to the Public Works Committee for consideration. The attitude adopted by honorable members on this side of the Chamber was that, although they would prefer work on any instalment of the NorthSouth railway to begin from the southern end, they were willing, in consequence of a verbal statement by the Prime Minister that the Government proposed to honour the agreement made with South Australia in 1907, that work should be commenced from the northern end I am glad that our confidence in the Prime Ministers promise has been justified. So far as I can see the rights of South Australia in the original agreement are not in any way curtailed by the provisions of the agreement in the schedule of this bill. The very fact that the Government proposes to introduce a measure for the com structionof this railway as a portion of the transcontinental railway to be constructed pursuant to the agreement in the schedule to the Northern Territory Acceptance Act 1910, makes it clear to me that it intends to press on with the completion of the through line. If I required additional evidence of that, it is supplied by the speech delivered by the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr. Hill) last night, in which he gave the total mileage that had been constructed from the north and from the south, the length that the Government proposed to build immediately, and the distance that would still remain to be constructed before the two ends were connected. One of my main objects in rising to speak was to make it perfectly clean that, so far as I am concerned personally and I believe my view is held by all the South Australian members of this Parliament regard the construction of the line to Alice Springs as being only an instalment of the through route. I make that statement for the reason that the Public Works Committee some time ago suggested that, if a line were constructed to Alice Springs from the south and to Newcastle Waters from the north, the situation would be met for very many years to come. I totally disagree with that view. Personally, I. am glad that the Government has decided to adopt the Oodnadatta route, but that matter can be discussed when the bill to provide for the construction of the railway is before us.I am also pleased that it is proposed to build a standard gauge line direct from Port Augusta to Adelaide, assuming that the three rails on the Red Hill to Adelaide section can, in the opinion of the experts as one assumes is the case be used satisfactorily. But this also may be discussed later. I felt that I could not allow the introduction of this important bill to pass without congratulating the Government on at last undertaking a project which the South Australian people have for so long struggled to see put in hand.  Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time; and reported without amendment; report adopted. Bill, by leave, read a third time.","Second Reading","RAILWAYS (SOUTH AUSTRALIA) AGREEMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I have pleasure in supporting this bill, concerning which the same arguments that applied to the measure with which we have just dealt are to a great extent applicable. The question of the route of this railway has been raised, but I feel that the Government is adopting the right attitude in that matter. While I should like to see a railway of 4ft.8½in. gauge constructed across Australia from north to south,I believe that the Government, in this proposal, is doing as much as can reasonably be expected. The conversion to the standard gauge of the Oodnadatta to Darwin railway, will be quite as simple a matter as the conversion of any other railway in Australia. The railway with which this bill deals will be purely developmental. The problem of the development of the Northern Territory has not yet been grappled with, nor will it be until we get into closer contact with the people there. Nothing helps so much in that direction as. the construction of railways. I agree with the honorable member for Angas (Mr. Parsons) that if South Australia had retained the Northern Territory a railway from north to south would have been constructed before this. While the bill is not all that I desire, it is an honest attempt to honour the existing agreement; and to develop the Northern Territory. It will at least give those who now live there some chance of reaching civilization more frequently and more quickly than is possible at present. In that respect alone the construction of this railway is more than justified. The Northern Territory must be developed, and we must pay for that development. The pioneers there must no longer be overlooked. South Australian members are pleased to know that something is being done to honour the compact entered into so many years ago, and we all hope that it will not be long before the railway is extended to Darwin.

It is further a business proposition that we should endeavour so far as we can to make those Territories selfsupporting, which they are not now. Their soil and climatic conditions make them specially suited to the production of tropical products which are very largely used in Australia. As the population of the Territories numbers about 500,000 natives and about 3,000 whites, it is evident that their products must nearly all be exported. Australia by reason of her geographical position is the natural market for such products, but two factors have militated against the development of our trade with these Territories. One of these factors has been the coasting sections of the Navigation Act, and the other has been the Australian Customs Tariff, which has treated the products of even our own Territories as being of foreign origin. The Government considers that it devolves upon us to have a fixed and definite policy for the development of tropical agriculture in these Territories.It is proposed to give effect to this by means of this comparatively small preferential tariff, and by a further proposal that will follow, providing for bounties on other commodities. To remove any disabilities suffered by the Territories because of the coasting provisions of the Navigation Act those provisions were in part suspended by proclamation on the 1st September last. The commodities covered by the tariff resolution which I am submitting, and by the Bounties Bill to follow, are not commercially produced in Australia, and do not come into competition with any of our primary or secondary industries. It is of great importance to Australia to develop the cultivation of tropical products practically at our own back door, because if we do we shall be to some extent, and I hope to a large extent, independent of foreign countries for such commodities. In addition to those referred to in this tariff resolution and the bounty proposals to be submitted, there are other commodities produced in the Territories, such as copra and rubber. These are very largely used in our manufacturing industries, but it is not proposed to give any assistance for their production, because those engaged in it have been afforded considerable relief by the suspension of the coasting provisions of the Navigation Act, and because a great proportion of the copra produced finds its way to the worlds markets whilst there is a comparatively small consumption of it in Australia: and by reason of the very much improved condition of the rubber market. The action taken by the Government with regard to Papua and the Mandated Territories of New Guinea has two objects. One, and the major object, is to benefit the producers of tropical products in the Territories, and the other object which will be directly accomplished will be the granting of relief, through the Customs tariff, to the users of the commodities specified, to the extent, if developments progress as we hope, of an average of about £25,000 a year. Although Papua has been a Territory of the Commonwealth since September, 1906, we have, as I have already said, treated it throughout by our tariff as a foreign territory, and as if we had no responsibilities in respect of it. Tariff preference has not been given to Papua, and the comparatively recently acquired Mandated Territory of New Guinea, notwithstanding the fact that the planters, plantation managers, officials, tradesmen, and missionaries, as well as the monetary investments in the Territory, are nearly all Australian. The backward state of tropical production in the Territories is something which I am sure we all regret. The cultivation of tropical products which flourish in Java, in the Federated Malay States, Ceylon, and other parts, has, as yet, been practically untried in either Papua or New Guinea. Both Territories have their eggs in one basket, or rather their basket has only one egg in it, and that is the coconut. The economic structure of the Territories has its sole foundation in the production of copra. That is a position which must be viewed with some concern when one visualizes their future development, particularly because the consumption of copra in Australia is comparatively small. It only amounts to about 9,000 tons a year, whilst the total production of Papua and New Guinea in 19245 exceeded 45,000 tons. It is proposed to attempt to overcome the uncertain economic position of these Territories by encouraging the cultivation of a greater diversity of products, and this tariff resolution is a part of the scheme to that end. The . tropical products selected by the Government, after most exhaustive inquiry, for the application of bounties and a preferential tariff, are those specially adapted to the climatic conditions of the Territories, and for which an established market already exists in the Commonwealth, representing a value at the present time of nearly £2,000,000. Products such as bananas, citrus fruits, maize, peanuts, and sugar, which can be readily produced in the Territories, have been omitted from the Government preference and bounty proposals for the reason that they are commercially grown within the Commonwealth. A few figures relating to these Territories, and covering the last five years, may be interesting. The imports into the Commonwealth from Papua in 19201 amounted in value to £325,773; in 19212, to £163,232; in 19223, to £209,193; in 19234, to £471,953; and in the last financial year, 19245, to £295,199. The value of our exports to Papua I am speaking now only of Papua, and not of New Guinea was, over the five years, respectively, £292,851, £172,419, £219,225, £214,839, and £259,302. The exports from Australia to Papua include goods not of Australian origin. The value of goods of Australian production exported to Papua over the five years was, respectively £163,449, £88,643, £111,442, £116,954, and £141,309. The value of the import and export trade of Papua over the five years was, respectively Imports. £484,770, £305,705, £315,423, £354,965, £459,080; and exports, £172,672, £220,236, £179,452, £239,408, and £367,629. The exports from Papua in order of value are Copra, rubber, pearls, bechedemer, pearl shell e.id trochus shell. In 19245 the exports from Papua were valued as follow: Copra, £172,905; rubber, £68,507: copper, £41,674; pearls, £19,300; bechedemer, £10,351; pearl shell, £8,773: gold, £14,980; osmiridium, £3,630; and sisal hemp, £13,141. These figures show that the commodities to be affected by the proposals of the Government are produced in Papua in minor quantities only. The territory of New Guinea has reached a higher state of productiveness than the territory of Papua, as the figures of the import and export trade clearly show. In the last five financial years the value of goods imported into the territory of New Guinea was, respectively £661,441, £468,711, £516,855, £485,634, and £537,940. The value of the exports was, respectively £673,992, £499,197, £630,892, £718,535, and £858,990. The exports are similar in value and variety to the Papuan exports, with the exception of pearls; and the export of copra and rubber comprises from threequarters to seveneighths of the total exports of those territories. The value of the Australian import and export trade with the territory of New Guinea for the year 19245 wasImports into Australia,£470,574; and exports from Australia, £268,664.The Australian exports to the territory of New Guinea include a considerable proportion of oversea products, as is also the case respecting Papua. The balance of the imports into these territories over and above Australian exports to them are made up largely of direct importations of petrol, kerosene, cotton goods and machinery. The Papuan Legislative Council can, and I understand will, give a preference to Australian imports in reciprocation of our effort to help the development of plantations in the territory.Under the terms of the Mandate given to the Commonwealth by the League of Nations, the Customs tariff of the territory of New Guinea permits of no preference to any country; but with the development of trade under the bounties scheme and the preferential tariff proposals of the Government, a closer alliance of trade interests between the Commonwealth and the territory can be confidently expected.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF (PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA PREFERENCE) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/speech/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

Later,I shall draw the attention of theTariff Board to the possibility of the growth in Papua of special cigar leaf. I believe that we can grow in our tropical possessions cigar leaf equal to the best leaf grown in other countries, but tobacco and cigar leaf have deliberately been omit tedfrom these proposals, because the inquiry concerning them has not yet begun. It is intended to admit into the Commonwealth,free of duty, coffee grown in the territories, and to place a charge of 3d. a pound on coffee from other countries. At one time a considerable quantity of coffee was grown in Queensland, and for many years it had the protection of a duty of 3d. a pound.ButI regret to say that the quantity of coffee now produced in Queensland is almost negligible. Fourteen years ago151,050 lb. of coffee were grown in that State. Last year only 6,160 lb. were grown there, valued at £231.

"0","0","0","0","0","1","0","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","That the bill be now read a second time.  I stated in previous remarks that it was a responsibility of the Government to help reasonably to develop the tropical productions of the Territories of Papua , and New. Guinea. While it: is believed that the suspension of the coasting provisions of the Navigation Act will help the big industry of. copra producing, and the very much smaller industry of rubber producing, and while it is. believed that the proposed preferential tariff will give further, help to the development of the Territories,, it is still felt that it. is essential to take further action to get the diversification of tropical agriculture to which I have referred. Honorable members know, that the Commonwealth has. at different times granted to the Territory of Papua loans amounting to £100,897j and that the amount to be. repaid to the Commonwealth is at present £93,302: This money. has, been made available for the construction of reservoirs, wharfs, and roads, for general development, and. for the settlement of returned soldiers on the. land ;: but, in addition to that), the Commonwealth has granted an annual subsidy,. which started ait.. £20,000 a year,, and was increased at various, times, until it now stands at £50,000 a. year. On the 1st July,, 19.01, we subsidized the Territory, of Papua at the rate of £20,000 a year. That continued for eight, years, and on the lat July, 19.09, we raised the subsidy to £25,000 a. year, at which amount it remained for three years. On the 1st July, 1912; it was further increased1 to £30,000, where it remained for about eight and a half years, until the 1st January, 1921,. when it was.. increased to £50,000 a i year. The total subsidies, therefore, that the Territory ofl Papua alone has had from the Commonwealthsince we took it over have amounted to the large . sum i of £752,000, on threequarters of a million. In addition to these subsidies to enable Papua. to carry on the services of government) the Papuan portion of the shipping subsidy for: the Pacific Islands amounts to £12,000 a year. To the Territory of: New Guinea, the Commonwealth grants an annual1 subsidy of £10,000 for the benefit of the natives, and that is spent on agriculture, and health matters.. The Commonwealth grant of £10,000 for medi cai services in the Territory of New Guinea was made in , 1922. A Common wealth loan was also granted of £67,000 for the construction of wharfs: andi for drainage ; and the proportion of the mail subsidy I have referred! to in connexion with the Pacific Island services amounts,, so far as the territorial share of New Guinea is concerned, to a sumof £16,000. From these particulars it will be seen that the development of the natural resources of the Territories is very vital :to the wellbeing of the Commonwealth, and that it is good1 business for us to make these Territories as selfsupporting as we can, as quickly as we can. There is no question that, if the proposals of the Government are accepted by this House, the Territories should be largely selfsupporting at a not very distant date; and1 there will be the further advantage that the Territories, will provide Australia with some, if not all, of her tropical importations. To obtain these tropical productions from our, own Territories, will make us; at. least partially, independent of foreign sources of supply. Honorable members will notice that the bill provides: a maximum sum of £25,0.00 a year for a, period often years,, and that a carryover can be made from year to year;, but not more than the amount appropriated,, namely,. £250,000 in all, can, be spent in a> period, of ten years. A very careful calculation has .been. made, regarding the developments that are expected to follow the application of this, proposal. It is calculated that the appropriation of an average sum of, £25,000 a year. for. ten years, will reasonably cover the developments, expected. If there is a greater and more rapid development than, we have calculated upon, then the bounty is fixed, and power is given to the Minister to pay it pro rata to the limit of the appropriation, available at the time. The trade that: can be further developed between the Territories of Papua and. of New Guinea is of much importance to Australia.. It may be stated with every assurance that most of Australias requirements of kapok,, coir,, sisal and manila hemp, rubber; , cacao beans,, bamboo and rattan, coffee; coconuts, desiccated, coconut,, vanilla beans, spices; and sago can, be eventually produced in the great island territories: of the: Commonwealth. I mentioned iii, a previous speech. that the importations of tropical products into Australia every year were worth nearly £2,000,000. The details of these importations for the year 19234 are, approximately: kapok, £350,000; coir, £13,000; sisal and manila hemp, £300,000; rubber, £456,000; cacao beans, £231,000; bamboo and rattan, £45,000; coffee, £130,000; coconuts, £3,000; coconut, desiccated, £98,000; vanilla beans, £18,600; spices, £135,000; and sago, £3,500; making a total of £1,783,100.","Second Reading","PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1/quote/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

The Governments desire is to promote tropical production in Commonwealth Territories in order to increase the sources of our supplies of raw materials. The Commonwealth Analyst (Mr. Wilkinson), whose knowledge of tropical production is most extensive, has made a special study of the economic conditions of Papua and the Territory of New Guinea, and having visited all parts of the Territories on a special mission before these proposals were finalized, he is most favorably impressed with the possibilities of the successful production on a large scale of kapok, coir, desiccated coconut, cacao beans, coffee, sisal and manila hemp, vanilla, and all kinds of spices. With the granting of the bounties and the passing of the Papuan tariff, I am convinced that considerably more interest will be taken in the purchase of the expropriated properties, and the indirect benefits from this source are likely to be substantial. Those already interested in the development of the Territory confirm this view, and are optimistic concerning the added value which will accrue to the Government properties there as a result of the legislation now proposed.  All the representations that have been made by the administrators of both Territories, the Port Moresby Chamber of Commerce, the Samarai Chamber of Commerce, and leading planters, and others who are financially interested in the Territories have been very carefully considered. With regard to the individual items, some points concerning them are of special interest. A very important aspect of kapok cultivation is that the tree is the natural nesting ground of the red ant generally known throughout the Territory as the kurakum. This red ant is one of the most active controlling agencies of the leaf destruction caused by the coconut beetle. This insect is widespread in New Britain, and also occurs at Manus and the Solomon Islands, and has already caused considerable havoc and financial loss in numerous coconut plantations. The beetle causes the palms to look as though a plague of locusts had passed through them. The planting of occasional rows of kapok, followed by the introduction of the red ant, is regarded by competent entomologists as one of the most effective methods of combating this destructive pest. I am sure that all honorable members desire to do everything possible to assist the industries of the Territory. These proposals have been most carefully considered by the Government, and will, I am sure, be ft great stimulus to the planters, who for a long time have been struggling under adverse conditions. The bounty proposals are spread over a period of ten. years; a fairly long term of encouragement must be given, because some of the developments for which we hope can come only a number of years after planting. For instance, cocoa plants, although sometimes yielding at four years of age, do not give a full crop of beans until they are seven or eight years old. Manilla and sisal hemp are usually cut four years after planting. The vanilla vine and the kapok tree begin to bear in about the third year. Bamboo and rattan are usually cut in the fourth year after planting, but a full crop of coffee beans . is not obtained until from seven to ten years after planting, although the tree begins to bear in the second or third year. I have furnished the House with all the particulars at my disposal, but in committee I shall be prepared to answer any questions which honorable members may care to address to me. In the first few years the bounty payments will probably be small, and there will be a large carryover, I estimate sufficient to meet all developments which can be reasonably expected as a result of these proposals within the tenyear period.

The answer is that the distinction between a State and a Territory is made, not by the administration, but by the Constitution. But for section 99 of the Constitution, which has proved a lion in the path of Tasmanias desires, there is little doubt that that State would have received some special consideration long before this in respect of the tourist traffic with the mainland.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","PRATTEN, Herbert","K1J","N/A","NAT","N/A","289","That is so; but the circumstances must be equal before it is applied to them. The amendment will give relief to Tasmania to the extent that the limitations of the Constitution will allow. At the same time, it will create no discrimination against, nor do injustice to, any State to which it does not apply. It will particularly apply to Tasmania, because the bona fide tourist traffic for which it provides is of very much greater volume to that State than it is to any other. It is persistently urged that the accommodation provided by vessels belonging to the Peninsular and Oriental Company, the Orient Company, the Aberdeen and White Star lines and other overseas British companies that call during the apple season at Hobart, and which, prior to the proclamation of the coasting trade provisions of the Navigation Act, regularly carried passengers from the mainland to Hobart during the tourist season, is very much better than that which is provided on the local steamers trading between the mainland and the island. It is claimed, also, that because the passenger accommodation on those overseas vessels is not now available for the voyage to Hobart, Tasmania has been considerably prejudiced, because, although those vessels went to Hobart primarily to lift cargoes of apples, advantage was taken by many tourists of the opportunity to make the round trip from Sydney to Hobart and Melbourne. That the tourist traffic contributes a very important, part of the islands revenue is shown by the statement of the Tasmanian Commissioner of Railways, in his last annual report, that the total loss sustained by the State during the last seamens strike, which lasted for eleven days only, was about £250,000. Each season, since the Navigation Act has been in force, the Commonwealth. Government has been asked to allow the big, comfortable overseas vessels to take passengers to Hobart, but the only, provision in the Navigation Act under which these vessels could be exempted from the coasting trade provisions of the act is section 286, which provides, in effect, that where it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Minister in regard to the coasting trade with any part or between any ports in the Commonwealth (a) that no licensed ship is available for the service, or (b) the service carried out by a licensed ship or ships is. inadequate to the needs of such port or ports; and if the Minister is satisfied that it is desirable in the public interests that unlicensed ships be allowed to engage in that trade, he may grant permits to unlicensedBritish ships to do so, and thereupon the carriage by such ships of passengers on cargo to or from the port or between the ports specified in the permit is not deemed to be engaging in the coasting trade. Under this provision no relief has been given to the tourist traffic to the island, for the reason that inquiry on every occasion has shown that the shipping service maintained by licensed vessels trading between. Sydney and Hobart was adequate in the sense that sufficient accommodation of sorts was available, except during the rush periods immediately preceding holiday times, for all persons who desired to travel to the island. It has long been recognized that, especially by reason of its isolated position and its dependence on shipping for transport and means of communication with the mainland, Tasmania suffers, as compared with other parts of the Commonwealth, a distinct disability, which is mainly brought about by the restrictions imposed by the Navigation Act upon its passenger traffic. Although each successive year shows a small increase in the number of tourists visiting Tasmania, there is no doubt that the withdrawal of the privilege of being able to travel on the large overseas vessels has resulted in a loss to the State, and particularly to Hobart and the southern portion of the island, of a very desirable type of tourist. Tasmania is the smallest State in size and population, and it is possibly, suffering financial stress. Therefore, anything reasonable that the Commonwealth Government can do to help it ought, I think, to be done. The Governments proposal is perfectly reasonable. With the object of overcoming the handicap suffered by the State, and particularly Hobart, in respect of its tourist traffic, the Prime Minister in his policy speech announced his intention to introduce legislation which would permit the better class of overseas vessels to engage in the tourist traffic to Tasmania during the appleexport season. This measure has been brought down to redeem that promise. I think the people of the Commonwealth will find that the Government is prepared to redeem all its promises as soon as it possibly can. The bill proposes to amend section 286 of the Navigation Act by adding thereto two subsections as set out in the bill. It is not thought that this concession to the Tasmanian passenger traffic will do any injury to the interests of the licensed steamers now running to the island. It is probable that, as was the case prior to the coming: into operation of the Navigation Act; the fares charged by the owners of the overseas vessels will be higher than those charged by the local companies. It is also very probable that, because of the extra facilities made available, one result of the new arrangement will be an increase upon the number of tourists that now visit Tasmania. Thus Tasmanias interests should be materially helped without hurting any one. Another point to be kept in mind is that, as1 the .apple trips do not commence .until about the .middle of February, the Christmas and summer traffic will still remain with the licensed vessels. I cannot see that this is a party question. During the past two or three years parliamentary representatives from Tasmania of all shades of opinion, and also, I think, the Labour Premier of the State, have been urging the Parliament of the Commonwealth to do something in the direction now proposed. I therefore submit the bill to the House in order that Parliament may remove an injustice and aid Tasmania without injuring any other state, thus redeeming as soon as, possible the promise made by the Prime Minister on behalf of the Government.

This measure is of great importance, as it involves the expenditure of a large sum of money, and the carrying . out of a long standing and much debated obligation to the State of South .Australia.. It vitally affects the development of the Northern Territory, which has an important bearing upon out White Australia policy. The .defence of the Commonwealth, and the question of a uniform gauge are also involved. Numerous speeches have been made in an endeavour .to interpret the agreement entered in to between the Commonwealth and South Australia when the Territory was taken over by the Commonwealth, but whatever is provided in the .agreement it was always understood that a railway should be constructed from the south to the north without any deviation to benefit other States. That was the spirit of the agreement. Figures have been submitted in relation to two routes, which differ vitally, inasmuch as one is an extension of the existing line from .Oodnadatta to Alice Springs on the 3ft. oin. gauge, whilst the other is a take ofl from the eastwest line at Kingoonya on the uniform gauge of 4ft. 8½ in. Listening very carefully to the speech of the Minister .for Works and Railways (Mr. Hill) in moving the second reading of the bill, I gathered that the Government bad carefully considered the .respective merits .of these routes, and had come to the conclusion that the Oodnadatta to Alice Springs route was the better one to adopt. I also gathered that the question. of eos I influenced the Government in coming to that decision. In the figures given in the very comprehensive table supplied to honorable members it is shown that the total estimated .cost of constructing a line from Kingoonya to Alice Springs .is £4,500,000, and that of a line from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs £1,700,0:00, a difference of £2,800,000. The Minister .gave some reasons why in the opinion of the ; Government the Oodnadatta to Alice Springs route should :be adopted. He admitted that the country for a distance of 200 miles north of Kingoonya is better pastoral country with a higher rainfall than that on the Oodnadatta route.

It has been said that this country is poor in appearance because it is on the stock route, and that if the country on the Kingoonya route were used by travelling stock it would not appear better than the Oodnadatta country. I deny that. The rainfall, for instance, on the Kingoonya route is better than on the Oodnadatta route. The Minister gave many reasons in favour of the Oodnadatta route as against the Kingoonya route, but I propose to give a few in favour of the latter. I ask honorable members, irrespective of party, to impartially analyze the position before coming to a decision. If a line were constructed from Kingoonya to Alice Springs, stock could be trucked at the latter station and landed in Adelaide without transhipment. That is very important. There would be no breaks of gauge, and, in consequence, transport would be more rapid, and, on the broader gauge, more comfortable. Stock travelling over the Kingoonya route would, with the exception of a short mileage near Adelaide, be travelling over Commonwealth railways, thus reducing the losses upon our own line. We have also to consider the advantages of a uniform gauge, under which rollingstock will be standardized and made interchangeable with that on the eastwest line, which will mean economy in . the rollingstock required and efficiency in the matter of repairs and operating costs. Passengers could join a train in Adelaide and travel to Alice Springs without transhipping. If the proposed route is adopted, all the disadvantages which at present exist between Port Augusta and Adelaide will be perpetuated. The Kingoonya route provides all the advantages to be derived from a uniform gauge, which is the railway policy definitely laid down and accepted by the Government.

Let us, however, accept the view that has been put forward by those honorable members who have interjected. What is the reason for Incurring this extra expense upon bridges and culverts if. as the Minister stated last night, the proposed line is to do service for 100 years? The Commonwealth cannot afford to set this example to the States. At conference after conference the Commonwealth has deplored the lack of uniformity in the railway gauges of Australia, yet it now proposes to do the very thing that it has hitherto deplored ! We should anchor very firmly to the policy of a 4ft. 8^in. gauge. If wo accept the proposal in the bill we shall be dragging our anchor pretty badly. It is estimated that the extra cost will be £2,800,000. It is false economy to construct the line on the narrow gauge. . The eastwest line was planted between two other lines that were built on the 3ft. 6in. gauge. So determined was the Commonwealth Government of the day to build to nothing but. the 4ft. 8^in. gauge that it actually incurred an unproductive expenditure, that is not yet returning a profit ! If in the present instance we stand by the 4ft. 8$in. gauge we shall ultimately have a standard trunk railway from Adelaide via Kingoonya to Alice Springs, and thence to Darwin. That should be the objective of this Parliament. If the country is worth a railway it is worth a trunk line, built to a standard gauge. I have every faith in the future of the Northern Territory. I believe that there are great possibilities ahead of it, and that it can be developed. While it may not be everything that some of the rosy optimists claim for it, I believe that ultimately history will repeat itself. What has been the history of this and of every other country in the opening up. of new areas? It is said   The country is no good ; there is no water, no conveniences, nothing. When the hand of man gets to work, what is the result? In America, in Canada, in Australia, in every country in the world, .the pessimists have always been confounded, and the prophecies of the optimists fulfilled. The experience of the older countries will be the experience of Australia. Eyre blazed the track. A telegraph line was afterwards erected along that route, for no other reason than that it followed Eyres track, which was easy to trace. Later, a railway was built to follow the telegraph line. Now, at this late hour, the Government proposes to push along the same old track.

I. congratulate the Government upon having at last brought forward this measure, which was forecast in the speech of the GovernorGeneral, at the opening of the first Parliament of the Commonwealth 25 years ago. The State of South Australia has had to wait a long time since the undertaking to construct the NorthSouth line was given by the Commonwealth Parliament as far back as 1910 or 1911. Several arguments have been advanced against this proposal. The honorable member for Richmond (Mr. R. Green) advocated the construction of a line through South Australia to Queensland, over what has been called by Professor Gregory  the dead heart of Australia. I do not agree with the contention of the honorable member for Wimmera (Mr. Stewart) that that country is worthless. It is not. But I do agree that it is almost the poorest, if not the poorest, land in Australia. I well remember passing through that country in 1921 with the sectional committee of the Public Works Committee. Mr. Crombie, a settler who held 365 square miles of land and who had reared a very fine family, said in his evidence that that country did not warrant a railway. I have before me the evidence that was given by Sir Sidney Kidman, who, perhaps, knows that country better than any other pastoralist in Australia. For very many years he travelled over it with cattle. He owns and controls stations not only there, but also in Queensland and in other parts of the Northern Territory. He said that there was only one route for a railway to the Northern Territory, and that that was the direct northsouth route. He stated very emphatically that that railway should not go to Marree or Birdsville. The Minister (Mr. Hill) last night argued that not less than 500 square miles were necessary to enable a man to make a living in the Northern Territory. He went further and said,  I believe that nothing less than 1,000 miles would be any good. I do not intend to advance in opposition to that view the opinions of a surveyor who travelled through in a motor car, nor shall I give the impressions which I gained in a similar way. I shall, however, quote from the evidence of settlers who have made a very good living there. First of all I shall quote the views of Robert Henry Harris, grazier, in July, 1921.

I have a complaint against the South Australian Government. Some time ago I suggested to it that it should make a stretch of road from Oodnadatta to Charlotte Waters, but it could not seo its way clear to do so. The Macdonnell range country covers about the same area as the State of Tasmania between 25,000 and 30,000 square miles and is 2,000 feet above sea level. I feel certain that, given railway facilities, it will in the future become a health sanatorium during the winter, provided the Government will see that fares are reasonable. The honorable member for Wimmera (Mr. Stewart) has presented the case in favour of a 4ft. 8Jin gauge railway. I should be quite willing to support him possibility that the Government would undertake the construction of such a line, but the report of the Public Works Committee on this matter stated that only a light 3ft. 6in. gauge railway to Alice Springs was justified. I consider that the Government has acted wisely in accepting the advice of the Committee.

To build a broadgauge line would involve an annual interest expenditure of £250,000 more than a narrow gauge line, and there would be an annual loss in working expenses of more than £62,000 a year in excess of that of the 3ft. 6in. proposal. We shall be acting on economically sound lines if we adopt the 3ft. 6in. gauge. Other countries have built light developmental railways, and afterwards converted them into heavier lines. If the optimism of the honorable member for Wimmera, is warranted and he says that the optimists are nearly always right this country, in the near future, will develop to such a great extent that the Government will be well able to afford to build a 4ft. 8^in. gauge railway provided that in building the 3ft. 6in. gauge line it makes the bridges and culverts strong enough to carry the heavier lines. Queensland has long stretches of light railway on which very good travelling time is made. South Africa also has excellent light railway lines. The railway gauge in Java is 3 ft. 3 in. and a fraction, and the carriages are 10 ft. 6 in. wide. When I was there some time ago the trains averaged 33 miles an hour, including stops. An effort has been made by those who are opposed to this line to make capital out of the stock transportation arrangements in the far north. Rut after all it is not a very long journey from Oodnadatta to Port Augusta or Adelaide. Sir Sidney Kidman informed me that on one occasion a mob of his cattle which were driven from the Macdonnell Ranges to Oodnadatta and . then sent through Adelaide to Melbourne by train, topped the market at the saleyards here. These beasts were driven 300 miles overland, and then carried well over 1,000 miles by rail to Melbourne. The evidence given to the Public Works Committee by a number of pastoralists indicated that cattle would always be carried by rail from Alice Springs in preference to droving them overland, because the country between a point south of Alice Springs and Oodnadatta over which they would have to travel was poor. The general opinion was that stock sent by train all the way would reach the saleyards in better condition than if they came by road, and so would bring better prices. Although I am a strong advocate of standard gauge railways, I believe that the 3ft. 6in. gauge will meet requirements in the Northern Territory for. a long while, for there will not be a tremendous amount of traffic. I do not, however, agree with the Ministers statement that the line will meet the needs for the next 50 or 100 years. My opinion is that it will be suitable for the requirements of the next 20 or 25 years. By that time it ought to be an economically sound proposition for us to convert it to the standard gauge. It is probably within the memory of many Australians that there was a tremendous outcry in America when the transcontinental railways, there were being constructed. It was said that they would not pay axlegrease because they would have to traverse so much desert and useless country. The same sort of thing is being said today in Australia. As a matter of fact, there is practically no desert country between Oodnadatta and Darwin. I admit that there is some poor country in South Australia and in the southerly part of the Territory, but none of it could be called desert. The building of a line from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs, and the extension of the line from the north to Newcastle Waters or Powells Creek, and then across to Queensland, would provide adequate railway facilities for the development of the Northern Territory for the next 20 or 25 years. If the optimists are right, and I hope the honorable member for Wimmera includes me among them, the development in the Macdonnell Ranges and the Barkly Tablelands will soon force . the Government to complete the NorthSouth line. I hope that I may live to see that day. The possibility of mining development in the Northern Territory has certainly not been overstressed. In the eastern portions of the Macdonnell Range almost every known mineral has been found, and mica can be traced there for more than 100 miles. The great strides that have been made in the development of wireless have caused such an increase in the consumption of mica that, if a railway were constructed to within 70 or 80 miles of the Macdonnell Range, deposits, which are so extensive, would become very valuable. Yesterday honorable members had under consideration a bill for the provision of £40,000 for the encouragement of prospecting for minerals, and, by way of interjection, I remarked that the proposed railway to Alice Springs would do infinitely more than the £15,000 allotted to the Northern Territory under that bill. The Minister said that the two measures would go hand in hand, but I maintain that there will be no need for offering inducement to prospectors if the mineral belts in the Macdonnell Ranges country are made accessible. An area from 300 to 350 miles in length by almost 100 miles in width reaching from Alice Springs to Tennants Creek is highly mineralized, and it contains almost all minerals, the notable exception being tin. I welcome the present proposal because of the fillip it will give to the mining industry, in addition to .the benefit that the pastoral industry will derive from it. I could quote extensively from the Public Works Committees report, which I commend to the attention of honorable members if they desire to know the facts in regard to the stockcarrying capacity of the Northern Territory, according to men who have made their living there. I have not previously commented on the agreement made between South Australia and the Commonwealth with respect to the transfer of the Northern Territory, but I have said that the. country in the neighbourhood of the Macdonnell Ranges thoroughly justifies the construction of the line. If South Australia has such a good case as it thinks it has under its agreement, the argument is all the stronger for the construction of the railway. I confidently believe that the line will lead to a rapid development of the Territory, and, therefore, 1 welcome the bill.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","DUNCANHUGHES, John","JY7","Boothby","N/A","N/A","297",". For three reasons, which I shall briefly set out, I personally favour the route that the Government has decided upon. In the first place, I consider that it is the route which it was originally intended the line should follow. The honorable member for Wimmera (Mr. Stewart) stated that in his opinion and I was glad to hear it what was intended under the original agreement with South Australia was a railway running through that State, and through the Northern Territory. I put it to the honorable member that he should go a little further, and then he will probably agree that what was intended in the first place was a line from Oodnadatta on the 3ft. 6in. gauge. At that time Kingoonya was almost, unknown, for no railway passed through it. My second reason for supporting the bill is that it provides for a line that will be very much cheaper to construct than the alternative proposal, since it will cost £1,700,000 as against £4,500,000. It will necessitate the construction of only 297 miles of new line as against 530 miles, which is a considerable difference. In the third place there will be considerably less loss in the working expenses than if the other proposal were adopted. It seems to me that the only sound argument against the Oodnadatta route assuming that the country is substantially similar in each case, or even assuming that the country about Kingoonya is ft little better is the fact that the line is not proposed to be built on the standard gauge. I am in full agreement theoretically with those who do not desire to support the construction of any railway on a gauge other than 4 ft. 8£ in. But in this matter one has n good deal more than theory to consider. It must be remembered that a railway has already been constructed by South Australia for a great distance northward from Port Augusta on the 3ft. 6in. gauge. The 3ft. 6in. gauge runs as far as Oodnadatta in the south, while in the Northern Territory a line on the same gauge has been authorized as far southward as Daly Waters. This matter was fully discussed in the House in 1923 when Parliament decided that,, all things considered, the northsouth line was so different in nature from other railway systems, and so disconnected with the other great lines, that the extra expense of adopting the standard gauge would not be justified. I happened to be looking through Hansard, when the honorable member for Wimmera was speaking tonight and I propose to quote what he said on the 25th July, 1923, when the Northern Territory Railway Extension Bill was under consideration. I do this in no spirit of hostility to the honorable member; in fact, I think that the House is under a debt of gratitude to him for the interest lie took in this question when he was Minister for Works and Railways, and for the journey he undertook into the interior of Australia at a time when he was not in good health. The honorable member for Hindmarsh (Mr. Makin) at that time took exception to the proposal of the Government to perpetuate and extend the difficulty which he said had arisen in Australia as a result of the adoption in different States of varying railway gauges. The honorable member for Wimmera interjected, We must build this extension on the same gauge as the existing line. If that was his opinion then, there is all the more reason for it now, since the construction of the further section of railway which was then under discussion has been authorized.

The estimate provides for bridges and culverts including the large bridge over the Katherine River, which will cost £95,000 capable of carrying a 4ft. 8£in. gauge line. The reason that sleepers suitable for a 4ft. 8jin. gauge line were not included in the estimate was because the Dost of conversion will not be great if the bridges and culverts do not require alteration. On the other hand, the initial cost of providing the longer sleepers would be approximately £160,000. The House has already passed an appropriation for £1,545,000 which will provide tor bridges and culverts large enough, and strong enough, to carry a 4ft. 8£in. gauge line.
