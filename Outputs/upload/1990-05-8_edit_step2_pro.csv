Dr Sadik failed to advise that this March 1985 USAID review was careful to note that it had not included audits of UNFPA accounts or site visits of UNFPA field activities, and failed to advise the Committee that by September 1985 USAID itself had rejected the statement in that review relied upon by Dr Sadik; and(b) calls on the Australian Government to immediately cease allocating aid money to UNFPA which, despite its lip service to high-sounding principles, continues to be involved with the population control program of the Government of the PRC which is responsible for gross and continuing violations of human rights and repeatedly holds the PRCs population control program up as a model for developing countries to emulate.No. 5-That the Senate, noting that-(a) the Governor of Victoria (Dr Davis McCaughey) deliberately chose as the subject for the 23rd Tracy Maud Memorial Lecture the title ``Medical Ethics: Who decides what and how? which in his speech he describes as ``one of public controversy;(b) when referring to the question of human embyro experimentation, the Governor in his speech said: ``Even if legislation of a restrictive kind were to receive a majority vote, say in the Senate, or were to reflect public opinion as expressed in a public opinion poll, it would still be questionable whether it would be good democracy to impose it;(c) Dr Davis McCaughey, in conjunction with another member of the National Health and Medical Research Councils Medical Research Ethics Committee (Dr Robert Jansen, now a director of an IVF clinic in New South Wales) drew up the pro-experimentation guidelines in 1982 which have given rise to so much public concern; and(d) these guidelines were subjected to the scrutiny of the Senate Select Committee on the Human Embyro Experimentation Bill 1985 which found that the marker event contained in the guidelines before which experimentation on human embyros could take place lacked inherent ethical validity and that the concept contained in those guidelines that the human embyro could be regarded as property, should be rejected,declares that:(i) the statement by the appointed Governor of Victoria, His Excellency Dr Davis McCaughey, which questions whether it would be good for democracy in effect for executive governments to enforce laws passed by elected Parliaments restricting experiments on human embyros strikes at the heart of our system of Parliamentary democracy and raises fundamental questions as to the role of Her Majestys representatives in Australia,(ii) the question of experiments on human embyros is a major matter of public importance which cannot be confined to and determined by selected scientists and ethics committees,(iii) insofar as the Governors statement seeks to undermine an Act of the Victorian Parliament which restricts experiments on human embyros, that is a question for the people of Victoria to determine, and(iv) insofar as the Governors statement relates to Federal legislation to restrict experiments on human em- byros, as indeed has been recom-mended by a Senate Select Committee and the Family Law Council whose reports are now under consideration by the Federal Government, the statement of the Governor of Victoria might understandably be interpreted to be a reflection upon and an attempt to unduly influence the democratic processes of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia.No. 6-That the Senate take note of the Ministerial Statement of 18 December 1987 on the Select Committee on Human Embyro Experimentation Bill 1985-``Human Embyro Experimentation in Australia and the Family Law Council Report, tabled in the Senate on 8 October 1986.","N/A","NOTICES OF MOTION","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We do so in the expectation that this chamber will sit for a four-week period and the hope that in fact there will not be a fifth week. Our decision in the party room that we would cooperate with the Government by not moving to have the Wednesdays not set aside for committees, and not have the process of the automatic referral of Bills to committees through the selection committee process, was made on the basis of the advice received that this chamber would sit for a four-week period. I say in my capacity as Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate that if in fact it turns out at the end of the four-week period that this chamber is to sit for a fifth week or subsequent weeks, we will regard ourselves as having been, in effect, inadvertently or deliberately misled as a result of having taken the Government on trust as to the four-week sitting period.Our understanding of the argument for not introducing the Wednesday arrangements and not introducing the selection of Bills procedures during this period is essentially that the four-week period would be too short for all those procedures to be put into effect, and would cause some problem with the Governments legislative requirement for passage of Bills by a certain date. It was put to us that, with the House of Representatives sitting for only seven days in the first seven months of the new decade and with all of the considerable problems that the Government and the nation face, it was proper that the Senate should sit for a longer period. We have taken at face value the distributed list indicating a four-week sitting period.On that basis we have come to the conclusion that in fact it would not be unreasonable to suspend until August the orders made in December in relation to the Wednesday committee day and the automatic consideration of the reference of Bills to committees. All I can say is that we hope that the Senate will be able to proceed in good order to complete within that four-week period the program which has been notified to us and that a fifth week or subsequent weeks will not be necessary. If we had been notified that a fifth or subsequent week was contemplated, then in fact we would not have been so ready in our assent to the suspension of the December arrangements both in relation to Wednesdays and in relation to consideration of the automatic reference of Bills to committees.It is on the basis of a four-week sitting that we support Senator Rays motion, and we hope that orderly processes can be followed during this period. If they are not, we may have cause to view with jaundiced eyes this whole exercise of postponing these arrangements until August. I trust that that will not happen.","N/A","SITTINGS OF THE SENATE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We are. We are also proceeding with the rest of the changes. The only change we are not proceeding with at this stage is the one for Wednesday committee sittings.On the second matter raised by Senator Puplick: no guarantee has been given to anyone, certainly not by me, that we will sit for only four weeks. However, it is my fervent hope that we will sit for only four weeks. I have said that the list of Bills circulated this afternoon will not be added to. If anything is added to it, something of equal substance will have to come off. It is as simple as that. The two Bills that have been added most recently can proceed only at Thursday lunchtime, and that really depends on the integrity of the Minister saying that agreement has been reached on them and that there is no controversy about them. Otherwise they will get thrown off.I do not think there is a desire by anyone to sit for five weeks. I know Senator Puplick did not say that there was any desire to sit that long. There is no plan to sit for five weeks, but there is a tight program and it will need the cooperation of everyone in the chamber to get through the program. No one can blame me if the sitting goes into the fifth week simply because we spend three weeks debating the Estimates in the Committee of the Whole. That is something beyond my control. At the moment we intend to sit four weeks, and the only effect of this motion is to suspend Wednesday as the committee day. The rest of what we agreed to on 5 December is still in operation.Question resolved in the affirmative.","N/A","SITTINGS OF THE SENATE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/speech[2]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

Sir Reginald Charles Wright, senator for Tasmania from 1950 to 1978 and a Minister of the Crown from 1968 to 1972, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and members of his family in their bereavement.Reg Wright was a senator for 28 years. He was born on 10 July 1905 at Central Castra, Tasmania, educated at Devonport State High School and the University of Tasmania. He was admitted to the Bar in 1928 and lectured in law at the University of Tasmania for 15 years. He enlisted in the 2nd Australian Imperial Force in 1941, was appointed a lieutenant in the 6th Australian Field Regiment and was promoted to captain in 1943.Prior to entering Federal Parliament Reg Wright was the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party in the Tasmanian House of Assembly from 1946 to 1949 and was the inaugural State president of the Liberal Party in Tasmania. He was elected to the Federal Parliament as a senator for Tasmania in 1950 and served in that position until his retirement in 1978. He was appointed Minister for Works and had that portfolio from 1968 to 1972. Reg Wright was a member of numerous parliamentary Senate committees and delegations. I seek leave to have that portion of my speech which sets out those committees incorporated in Hansard.Leave granted.The speech read as follows-He served on various parliamentary committees including the Senate Standing Committee on Standing Orders from 1956 to 1962 and from 1965 to 1971 and the Senate Legislative and General Purpose Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs from 1973 to 1975 and the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances where he served for a total of 17 years between 1956 and 1978. He was a leader of the parliamentary delegation to East Asia in 1969 as well as serving on other delegations.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HON.

I interjected at some stage saying he resembled a bollard such that ships are tied to, and in his speech Reg Wright said, `Not only does this man insult my intelligence; tonight he has insulted my trunk. I have never forgotten that. He really was a very formidable, great debater and a great wit.I say this: in those days I was an Opposition senator, of course; he was one of the greats of the Senate and it was a pleasure to be here with him even when being mercilessly done over by him. So I would like to pay that personal tribute to him and also to say that since he left the Senate I have always enjoyed his company albeit briefly when he has visited Canberra.Reg Wright, of course, was also well known for his habit of singing around Parliament House. When he retired he was presented with a book entitled the `Reg Wright Records Office Choir Book. There are many other aspects of his character which other senators may well wish to touch on. I very much regret his passing although it was a long and distinguished life and career. On behalf of the Government I extend to his family our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HON.

248,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator HILL","BH4","(South Australia-","LP","Leader of the Opposition)",27,"â€”On behalf of the Opposition I support the motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) and extend our condolences to the family of the late Sir Reginald Wright. I will not repeat the statistics of the late Sir Reginald Wrights record, which have just been stated by the Leader of the Government, but one will have to recognise that 29 years of service to the Parliament-firstly to the Parliament of Tasmania and then to this Senate-is an incredible record of service. Looking through the achievements of Sir Reginald and what has been written about him, I must say that although I commenced my term in this place a few years after he retired, he clearly was one of the great characters of the Senate and, fairly I think, can be talked of in legendary terms with regard to this place.I found it interesting to read his maiden speech. In it he talked about his commitment to the Constitution, his commitment to federalism and to this Senate, and the very strong belief that he had in the Senate as a States House. I think it might be said that by the time of his retirement he may not have achieved all he wished in further developing this place as a States House, but what he did as an alternative was to play a considerable part in helping contribute to the development of the committee system within this place. So he looked in addition for other ways in which the Senate could continue to play a worthwhile and productive role within Australian politics.It was interesting also to read, in his final speech in this place, his comments again on the importance of this place and how he felt that it had developed during his long period of service. As I said, I came into the Senate after Sir Reginald left but it was interesting to note what Senator Withers said upon his retirement in 1978, Senator Withers being a person who is not unduly generous in his praise of others. He said:I have always admired Senator Wright as a robust man, forthright in his views and determined in his convictions. There are few, if any, who can equal his capacity to fight strongly for those things in which he believes. I have also respected him for his fairness and honesty.I think that that is a form of tribute which all of us would like to be paid upon completing service in parliamentary life. I guess Sir Reginald Wright will be remembered by many because I think he holds the record for the number of times he crossed the floor in this place. I gather it was in excess of 150 times. Those of us who have done it once or twice know it is not necessarily an easy thing to do. But what was important about it was that he refuted the tag of rebel as applying to himself. Rather he saw it as the proper recognition of the independent role that senators should play in this place and it reflected his concern about the fact that party politics was reducing that independence.I think that independent spirit is something which we should recognise and admire. I noted that in 1969 when he was speaking of this place-and it reflects what Senator Button said a few moments ago-he said:My purpose is to make Parliament a living, vital forum.I do not think there was any doubt that he contributed to making the Senate in the Parliament simply that. On behalf of the Opposition I extend to his widow and to his family our sincere sympathy in their bereavement.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HON.

250,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator DURACK","8G4","(Western Australia)","LP","N/A",28,"-I also rise to associate myself with the condolence motion moved by the Leader of the Government on the death of Sir Reginald Wright, extending my own sympathy to his widow and members of his family on their very great loss. The record of Reg Wright as a senator has been well covered by the three previous speakers and I do not want to go over that ground again. Perhaps I should start by indicating my own first personal experience of Reg Wright. It was not when I came into the Senate; it was a few years before I did so. Reg was then still a backbencher in the Senate, where he had been for 17 or 18 years. I was asked to look after him for a couple of days after the law conference that he came to Perth to attend. I took him down to a small town in the south-west of Western Australia where I had a case in the local magistrates court. Not only did he tell me how to win that case-which, incidentally, I lost-but he gave me a remarkable insight into his view of the Senate from the magnificent experience of all those years that he had spent here, in the process of which he had crossed the floor on many occasions. So I got a different view of the then Menzies Government front bench of the Senate from that which I probably should have had.On this trip we spent the evening with Reg Withers, who was then living in Bunbury, and I saw another aspect of Reg Wright. It was a great opportunity, as he was encouraged by Reg Withers, to learn something about Regs wit and pleasure in life. The thing that I would like to emphasise most about Reg Wright was his great commitment to various causes and his strong belief in those that he adopted. He was, of course, a founder of the Liberal Party of Australia and, as has been mentioned, he was its inaugural President in Tasmania. Despite the many times that he voted against a Liberal Government, he never wavered in his deep commitment to the philosophy of liberalism, in which he so passionately believed and which he expounded with such eloquence, not only in this chamber but also in other places. He was undoubtedly a great parliamentarian, with a special devotion to the Senate and its particular role under our constitution.In the years that he was on the back bench in the Senate he continued to practise law with a great deal of success. I am sure that if he had not adopted a career in politics, he would have proved to be one of Australias most distinguished advocates. As it was, he had a flourishing practice in the High Court. He got his opportunity when John Gorton-who had know his worth in the Senate and I suppose had felt it more keenly than many other members of the Menzies Government-became Prime Minister, for he made him Minister for Works in the years from 1968 until 1972. When I came into the Senate Reg Wright was on the front bench and there was never a stronger believer in teamwork and the need for everybody to get behind the ministry, the front bench and the party line, whatever it might be. Reg showed the same fervour that he demonstrated when expounding his views on many subjects from the back bench when insisting on the rights at all times of the front bench of which he was then a member.I think the best example of Regs contribution to the work of this place that I can think of is the fact that when he left it we saw the need to establish a committee to do the work he had done. He was, of course, a great reader of Bills. I think he probably did read every Bill that came into this place. Admittedly for most of his career here there were many fewer Bills and less complicated Bills than we now are faced with, nevertheless he was a great reader of Bills. He went through them, of course, to see particularly how they affected the liberty of the individual. He was, I see, a member of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee for 17 years and he no doubt found in that committee a great challenge concerning his particular interests.But it was his work on Bills and his attention to the details of Bills which was the most impressive aspect of his work as I saw it in this place. As I said, when he left the Senate a number of senators who were aware of this felt that we needed to have a committee to scrutinise Bills for the same reasons that Senator Reg Wright had scrutinised them. He was a notable character, a great mind, a great parliamentarian, and he was, of course, a great Tasmanian. Another one of his great passions was representing the people of his State and there will not be many others the like of him to sit in this place again.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HON.

251,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator TATE","NJ4","(Tasmania-","ALP","Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs)",30,"â€”Mr President, I wish to associate myself with the motion of condolence moved by Senator Button. I do so because I knew Sir Reginald Wright for some 30 years in Tasmania. I believe that I first met him back in 1963 when I was a law student and visited his home in Newtown, in Mortimer Street, with Phillip Wright, who was a fellow student of mine and a son of Reg Wright. I did so with some trepidation because I can tell you Reg Wright was a very gruff and intimidating figure as he stomped around that house and, as a young law student, being confronted with such an eminent reputation in law filled me with awe.I last met Sir Reginald at the centenary celebrations of the University of Tasmania down in Hobart and I believe there, even though perhaps I did not view him with trepidation, I certainly still felt that I was moving into a presence which filled me with respect. There was something about the man which I think conveyed the sense that he was somebody extraordinary and yet certainly in his later, more mellow years there was a gentleness and a happiness about his personality which was, as I say, at variance with that early impression of being so gruff and intimidating.Mr President, Reg Wright was born in Central Castra on the north-west coast of Tasmania, and in his later years in retirement he returned from Hobart to the very same farmhouse where he was brought up as a child. I think in the symbolism of his birth and death in Central Castra we have an indication of his very strong link with Tasmanian soil. He felt he was first and last, and had proved to be first and last, a son of the Tasmanian soil, particularly that lovely red soil of the north-west coast of Tasmania. I am sure that he intended, in a way, that when he died it should be in that farmhouse which he so lovingly restored in his retirement.Senator Durack has spoken of Sir Reginalds considerable skills as an advocate. As a student I used to visit the courts in Tasmania, including the Supreme Court, where Sir Reginald would be defending an accused person in a trial before a judge at that level. Equally, however, during the next week he may have argued a section 92 case before the High Court when it used to visit Tasmania more regularly. In both instances one was aware that here was a great mastery of the law wedded to a great theatrical presence. He no doubt brought the sense of theatre which he displayed in his skills as an advocate in the courts to this chamber. Unfortunately, I never saw him speak in the chamber, but I believe that that sense of theatre, which was one of his great attributes, was used in devastating fashion and to great effect both before judges at all levels and in this chamber. No doubt it was similarly used in party rooms.He was always prepared to stand up for the values in which he believed and he would never retreat from them. That was certainly a characteristic of his. Some would call it stubborness; others would say that it was a firm adherence to principles and values which he treasured. To his widow, his children, his grandchildren and his great-grandchildren, I express my sympathy on the loss of a revered patriarch.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HON.

Since I succeeded Sir Reginald in the Senate in 1978, I rise with special purpose to pay tribute to this remarkable man and fine parliamentarian. Sir Reginalds career in the Senate lasted for 29 years and was often turbulent and forthright, but he never once went against his true liberal principles and never forgot that his primary role here was as a senator for Tasmania.Reg Wright was educated at Devonport High School and the University of Tasmania. At the university, he took degrees in both the arts and law. He was admitted to the Tasmanian Bar in 1928 and then lectured in law, while practising, for 15 years. From 1941 to 1944 Reg Wright was a captain in the field of artillery, 2nd AIF and then, in 1946, he was elected as member for Franklin in the Tasmanian House of Assembly. A mark of his colleagues regard was that he was immediately elected Deputy Leader of the Opposition to the late Neil Campbell and was President of the Tasmanian Division of the Liberal Party. In 1949 he resigned from State Parliament to successfully contest the Senate election.Reg Wright was a founding member of the Liberal Party in 1945. He devoted the whole of his parliamentary career to attacking encroachments of the Executive on the parliamentary arena. This attitude engendered several notable and public disagreements with Sir Robert Menzies, Harold Holt and Malcolm Fraser. He voted against his Party about 160 times. However, these comments that he made in 1978 show his attitude to the party system in general and the Liberal Party in particular:No man can achieve anything in politics just as an individual. In order to gather support, youve got to be associated with others in a common cause.Sir Reginald Wright was created a Knight Bachelor in the Queens Birthday Honours List in 1978 for his distinguished public and parliamentary service-a recognition that was acclaimed throughout Tasmania. At his testimonial dinner in July 1978 more than 800 members of the Party paid tribute to his State and Federal career of service. After leaving politics, Reg Wright moved to his Central Castra farm, next door to the farm on which he was born. His name was occasionally to be found in the coastal reports of magistrates cases-always, of course, on the defence side. His brother, Sir Douglas Wright, also brought up in Central Castra, achieved international renown as a physician and Chancellor at Melbourne University.When I stood at the 1977 Senate election, Senator Wright took me around many parts of Tasmania and introduced me to various groups. He was always greeted with affection, even in staunch Labor areas, simply because all Tasmanians knew that Senator Wright stood up very strongly for his beliefs. I think that it is a mark of the greatness of the Liberal Party that a parliamentarian can cross the floor on matters of conscience and hold no fears of losing preselection or even of being expelled. Reg Wright frequently joined former Senator Ian Wood from Queensland in disputing the party line. Both had notable victories in the Menzies years when they fiercely rejected an increase in the sales tax on cars and succeeded in changing some Cabinet decisions.John Gorton had experienced Reg Wrights formidable skills as a debater when he was Leader of the Government in the Senate and decided that Reg Wright would be an asset to the Ministry. Reg was appointed Minister for Works and Minister-in-charge of Tourist Activities in 1968 and served until 1972. It was a belated recognition of his first class intellect and analytical skills.Reg Wright never wrote a speech for delivery in the Senate. His speeches were always of an impromptu nature and delivered with rolling cadences and the beautifully crafted sentences of a barrister.Reg Wright was a true politician-a man who served his constituents, his beliefs and his ideals faithfully. At this time I would like to convey my condolences to his wife, Lady Wright, his children and their families. He is a man who will be greatly missed by all.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HON.

253,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator WALTERS","UJ4","(Tasmania)","LP","N/A",31,"â€”I rise to join my colleagues in expressing my deep sorrow at the sudden death in March of Sir Reginald Wright. Reg was considered by his colleagues as the ultimate politician of the highest ideals and principles. His greatest love was his home State of Tasmania and that was one of the reasons he made the Senate his political career. It was during that period of his life that I knew Reg so well. I firmly believe that he was one of the greatest Tasmanians ever to represent that State in this Parliament.He loved the Senate and the Australian Constitution. Indeed, in 1977 he led just a handful of Liberal Party senators-I think there was one from Western Australia, one from South Australia, three from Queensland and the five Tasmanian senators-in opposing the constitutional referendum for simultaneous elections. This was done without any finances at all. It was against the might of the two major parties, the Liberal Party and the Australian Labor Party which were supporting the referendum proposal, that we fought and won that referendum. I will never forget Reg on that night as we gathered at his home waiting for the last figures to come in from Western Australia. When the figures finally came through his joy knew no bounds and he kept repeating, `We have won, my girl. We have saved the Senate and the Constitution. He believed that and I believe it.Reg Wright, right from his very first year, pointed out his complete independence. He said that the Senate should be a House of review, answerable only to the Parliament, that there should not be Ministers in the Senate, and yet he regretted very strongly-and I think he thought it was his greatest mistake-his short sojourn on the front bench.We are told that he crossed the floor 150 times, each time on issues that he believed were terribly important. My father was Leader of the House during Regs early days, and I remember his commenting that if there was ever any living proof that the Tasmanian tiger was still alive and well it was because Reg Wright proved such a problem. He used to say, `It will never be extinct while Reg is alive.My office was next to his for the last three years of his term in the Senate, and I can assure honourable senators that there was never a dull moment. As everybody had indicated, he was fiercely Tasmanian, and he kept the rest of his Tasmanian colleagues well aware of their responsibilities in that regard.He was the most generous man I have known, helping the disadvantaged in every way possible, not only financially but also with his great knowledge. I join with my colleagues in sending my deep condolences to Lady Wright and his family.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HON.

254,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator PUPLICK","TI4","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A",32,"-Mr President, it is perhaps unusual for a Senator from New South Wales, one who has been here only since Sir Reginald Wright left the chamber, to associate himself with this condolence motion, but the first job that I had when I left university was as an officer on the staff of the then Minister for Social Services and Aboriginal Affairs, as he was then called, William Charles Wentworth. The first job that I was given in that capacity was to be sent up to the Senate to be told that each day prior to Question Time I had to brief the Ministers representing my Minister. The portfolios that Mr Wentworth held were respectively represented in the chamber by Dame Annabelle Rankin and by Senator Wright. It was my responsibility each sitting day to front Senator Wright in his office and to brief him on matters that were likely to arise at Question Time, either spontaneously or with some degree of anticipation.On the first occasion that I had the temerity to go to his office with my sheaf of papers and the instructions from my Minister, I recall finding a Rumpolian character sitting behind his desk. He then proceeded to put me through the sort of experience which I suspect that unsuspecting witnesses in the Hobart Magistrates Court may have got used to from time to time. I recall simply retreating into saying to him, when he asked me why, as he would put it, `mollions and mollians of dollars were to be spent on particular social welfare programs, that I could not really say but it was Government policy. I was told that despite the fact that he was Minister for Works, it was not a policy that he particularly approved of, but nevertheless he would do his best to give an answer to the extent that he thought that he was able to give an answer on Government policy without unduly compromising his own conscience on the matter.For the period that he was Minister for Works this was my daily task, and one which initially I looked forward to with great fear and trepidation, but eventually came to considerably enjoy, as I enjoyed my responsibility in briefing Dame Annabelle Rankin, who also represented us at that stage, and whom one could always rely upon to be far more gentle. Indeed, if the buttons on ones coat were not exactly fixed properly, they were fixed while she was listening to ones dissertation of the day.The second great experience I had of Sir Reginald was that I was invited as part of the ministerial staff on the inaugural trip of the Indian Pacific train, leaving Central Station in Sydney and travelling to Perth. On the first night, finding the bar car largely unoccupied, but nevertheless occupied by Senator Wright and a piano, I was told by Senator Wright that one of the great qualities of senators was their capacity to sing, which he proceeded to prove with some degree of expertise, and all I can say is that I do not actually remember the next two days of the trip.The third point that I want to make is that Senator Wright achieved one of those things that a lot of us dream about with some degree of envy: He took Richard Carleton and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation for a large sum of money for having approached with cavalier disregard the truth of particular matters in a way in which a lot of us are used to seeing journalists operate, in the ABC in particular. Sir Reginald Wright was not one to allow an opportunity to pass to put the record straight, and to do it properly.The final point that I make is that Senator Durack has rightly referred to the establishment of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. It was perhaps the greatest of tributes to Sir Reginald Wright-and I say it with the greatest of affection for colleagues on this side who might have been members of the then Ministry-that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee was in fact established only because a large number of Liberal and National Party senators crossed the floor in the teeth of the opposition of the then Executive of the day to have that Committee established. Just as Sir Reginald as Minister for Works may have then or at a later stage had some view about the value of Party discipline, so have I always been interested to hear members of the Executive of the day, who opposed the establishment of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and forced their colleagues to cross the floor, now saying what a wonderful institution it is and how it has improved the operations of the Senate.So I do in fact remember Sir Reginald quite well in a number of different capacities. I do agree with comments which have been made by honourable senators that he was in fact a unique character in the best sense of that term and I join with my colleagues in this place in extending my sympathy to the members of his family.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HON.

255,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ARCHER","IE4","(Tasmania)","LP","N/A",33,"â€”I, too, last saw Sir Reginald Wright on 12 February at the University of Tasmania centenary, where he was, as usual, enjoying himself and preparing to go away on a fortnights holiday. I first met him in about 1950 and I had various associations with him, both in our roles hovering around the courts and at political associations.A lot of people in Australia probably have not heard of Central Castra, but I can inform honourable senators that it became a most outstanding place as a result of the Wright family. It was quite a big family and every single member of that family was outstanding in his or her own area and on his or her own merits. The whole of the north-western coast became involved with various members of that family. It really was an outstanding group. It did not matter where Sir Reginald was or how long he had been there; he would always come back to talking about Central Castra on the north-western coast.I do not think I have ever seen anybody who had a greater loyalty to his friends, family, State and ideals than Reg Wright. If you were not amongst his friends, very often you got short shrift. And he seldom relented. But he was one of the greatest speakers I have ever heard. He had a great voice, he was a great parliamentarian. I would say that, since I have been in this place, I have heard four really brilliant speeches. Two of them were by Reg Wright, and I think that is a pretty good average.He loved a good fight. He did not really mind who was involved or what it was about-if there was a good fight, he would be there. He was feared in the courts and outside. One has only to remember some of the committee work he was involved in and some of the debates that went on here. Those who remember him debating things like the tree pull scheme, the shipping question and the wharves, or his setting up the inquiry into the Mount Lyell mine, which of course he won, will remember that he proved that the points of view he was putting were correct. He read Bills from cover to cover. Not many people can really read a Bill and work it out, or spend the time and the effort he did. He was terribly thorough, and he was like this with his court work also.I had been here I suppose only about a month when one day I bumped into him in the passage. I made some comment. He said, `My boy, never impugn the motives of your colleagues. I thought that was a silly thing for that man to say, but I am still here, and I still remember it every day. I doubt that I can give any better advice to any senator in this chamber or any member in the other chamber, or to the people who will come over the next many years. If I could be so bold, I would say I would offer the same advice myself now. He was never an easy colleague, but he was certainly a brilliant one. He was highly motivated by his own strong personal convictions, and I certainly remember the way that he looked after us when I started here at the end of 1975. Both Senator Walters and I knew at the time that never would a day go by when he would not offer some advice or ask us how we were going.An outstanding quality of Reg Wright was that-as somebody else has said-no matter where he was, his presence was always there. It was just impossible to have Reg Wright at a function, in a court, at a party or conference, or in the chamber without knowing and feeling he was there. Whether he was speaking, singing or sharing some of his stories and experiences, Reg was always at the centre of things.Right up to the time of his death he was still running his farm and still involved in legal work. One of the records that Reg claimed was that he had children at the Friends School in Hobart longer than any other parent had ever had. It was one of those records that one could readily associate with our old senator friend.I certainly would like to extend my sympathy to Lady Wright and the family of Reg Wright. Having attended the funeral, I can say it was a huge funeral, but it was not a sad one in any way because all the people there had various things to remember him by. They all had happy memories. The afternoon tea that was put on after the funeral was a very happy affair for all the people that congregated there.Please be assured there will never be another Reg Wright. There will never be another one like him in this place, and I doubt whether there will ever be another one like him in any of the parliaments of Australia. The passing of Sir Reginald is the end of an era. Australia benefited greatly from his participation in both politics and the law and will be the worse off for his passing.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HON.

256,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CALVERT","5F4","(Tasmania)","LP","N/A",34,"â€”I too wish to associate myself with the motion of condolence moved by Senator Button. Might I say, as a fourth generation Tasmanian, I am very well aware of the contribution that Sir Reginald Wright made, not just to the Senate but to the legal profession and to Tasmania. My association with Sir Reginald was of a social nature. I had the pleasure of attending the Friends School, to which Senator Archer alluded, with some of the late Sir Reginalds sons. It is interesting to note that his son Christopher is following in his fathers footsteps and is currently a judge of the Supreme Court of Tasmania, having previously been the Solicitor-General for that State. His other son, Philip, is a magistrate in Tasmania.My association with Sir Reginald began when I visited his seaside cottage at Opossum Bay. Work load permitting, he used to spend many happy hours there. In particular, on Saturday nights he would put in an hour or two at the local RSL club. That is where I first met Sir Reginald and, like many others, I looked forward to meeting him and hearing his anecdotes about Parliament and the characters he met. Of course, he was obviously one of the greatest characters one would want to listen to and speak with.I always remember him saying that he probably crossed the floor more times than he had crossed Bass Strait. Some friends of mine in Tasmania affectionately called him Tasmanias version of Rumpole of the Bailey. I agree with Senator Tate that, in later life in retirement, Sir Reginalds greatest love was his farm-Wallys Farm, as he affectionately called it. Anybody who visited Reg at Wallys Farm could not help being impressed by his love of the land and his love of nature-his cattle, his ducks and his garden.I also remember very well when the Tall Ships left the Derwent River in January 1988. Sir Reginald was staying at his seaside cottage. He armed himself with a small rucksack, filled with the appropriate refreshments, and a stick, walked from Opossum Bay to Fort Direction, which is about 6 miles away, so he could view the ships going out and then returned. I did not think that that was a bad effort for a person of 84 years. It is typical of the determination that Sir Reginald had. The tributes that have been paid to him today testify not only to his dogged determination but also to what a great man he was.Might I conclude by saying that I too pass on my sincere condolences to Lady Wright and the members of the the family. Like Senator Archer, I did attend the funeral. Probably one of the best speeches I have ever heard was made by the Hon. Michael Hodgman, QC, in a eulogy which I believe summed up the life and times of Sir Reginald Wright in a very fine manner.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HON.

257,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator PETER BAUME","ME4","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A",35,"â€”It is proper that we record the passing of great senators and even at this hour and on this day we should not avoid saying the things about a senator such as Sir Reginald Wright that we wish to say. It is good that his political opponent, Senator Tate, has said the generous things that he has said and it is proper that senators from other States should join our Tasmanian colleagues in fleshing out this story of Reginald Wright. He died in the same week as his brother, Sir Douglas Wright, who was the Chancellor of Melbourne University and was known affectionately throughout Australia as `Pansy Wright. For those who do not know, Mr President, Pansy is short for chimpanzee.The Chancellor of Melbourne University was, as was the honourable senator, a very formidable character. He was a teacher in my profession. He taught physiology. If you were ever unfortunate enough to attend a tutorial conducted by Sir Douglas Wright, you would know that he had a voice not unlike Regs. He would say, `Tell me, boy, what you know about swallowing. Anything you ever had known about swallowing you forgot immediately. It was in fact a family tragedy that both these great Australians died so close to each other.Honourable senators who were not here may not have really understood how Reg Wright dominated the chamber. Senator Button said in his contribution that Senator Wright moved around a little. He did not move around a little. He would start in one place and move to another; he would then move out to the next bay and anyone listening on the radio would wonder why the sound was rising and falling. He was the most mobile orator this chamber has ever seen-a peripatetic senator. He moved within about a six or eight-foot radius when he spoke, but at all times he commanded the chamber. People come into the chamber to hear him speak-the ultimate test of a senator. Those who heard John Wheeldon in his last days in this place would know--Senator Archer interjecting-","N/A","DEATH OF THE HON.

258,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator PETER BAUME","ME4","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A",35,"â€”That is one of Senator Archers speeches. When Senator Wheeldon spoke the chamber filled. Reg Wright was also one of those people who could bring people into the chamber. I remember an Irish politician telling me in Strasbourg once that he had observed of politicians that very few would come into parliament to listen to another person speak. But we would come in to listen to Reg Wright.There was something else about Reg to which I think Senator Watson has referred. We have our new Standing Orders. I am going to be the first to quote from them. What is now standing order 187 was standing order 406 in our previous volume. It is a very simple standing order. It says:No Senator shall read his speech.Equally, of course, no senator shall read her speech. I commend that standing order to certain senators. Senator Vallentine, for example, might care to read it.Senator Wright did not read his speeches and to see him speak was an experience. He would come in, staggering under the weight of law books and Senate documents on all kinds of references. He would spread these reference books out, having asked the colleague seated beside him to move, and then conduct his speech from them as if he were conducting a law case, in a manner that was impeccable. The speeches were beautifully crafted, beautifully documented with the various records he had brought in and beautifully rounded. He was a master of the Senate. He was also, Mr President, an institutional senator.We have in this chamber good party senators and we have a few people who are institutional senators. Their commitment is to the institution of Parliament and they devote themselves to advancing the institution of Parliament. For those who were not here with Reg Wright I point out that he was a master institutional senator. Not that he could not do other things.In my early days here we used to have tribal wars every so often. I remember that when the Chowilla Dam was being built we had South Australians conducting tribal wars late into the night, and when the tree pull scheme was on, we had Tasmanians conducting tribal wars, and Reg Wright would do his bit. If the tribal wars are less these days, well, that is partly because senators like Wright have gone. He left in 1978 and with his leaving, I suppose, there was a principle that was demonstrated, and it applies also to the other great long-serving senators I have known. Senator Justin OByrne was here for 33 years.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HON. SIR REGINALD WRIGHT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/speech[11]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

261,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator SHEIL","BJ4","(Queensland)","NP","N/A",36,"â€”I rise to associate the National Party of Australia with this motion of condolence about Senator Sir Reginald Wright. I happen to be one of the fortunate ones who shared some time in this chamber with him. I am thrilled to hear the glowing tributes that are being paid to him now, and I can almost see the smile on his cherubic face, if he could hear the things that are being said here. As one who realises that time in this place can be as but a moment, I appreciate Senator Peter Baumes last comments too. They add to the glowing tribute to Reg Wright.He was a dominant figure, he was peripatetic, and I can remember him with his coat open, sticking out his corporation, wandering around the aisles, waving his hand, and with his stentorian voice putting forth the most impeccable arguments that swayed the Senate.Just on that subject, I remember the time when Mr Jim Odgers retired as Clerk of the Senate. We had a function for him. He was speaking of great moments in the Senate. One of the great moments he remembered was a time when Reg Wright stood up against the Government and the Opposition, and he argued. He argued such a forceful and well presented case, that eventually the Government and the Opposition turned around and agreed with Reg Wright. Jim Odgers thought, `Well, now there is the Senate operating in a proper way at last. However, it went back to a normal practice after that. But he was much appreciated by Jim Odgers.My first association with Reg as a committee member was when Mr Whitlam was Prime Minister. We had a deluge of revolutionary-type legislation coming through and there was an Opposition Attorney-Generals committee. I had to go on that. I suppose I was the nearest thing to a lawyer that the National Party had, and I was on it with a whole lot of other lawyers. I remember Reg Wright himself, and Reg Withers. Also there was Ivor Greenwood, Alan Missen, all those people.The anti-discrimination Bill was coming in and they were talking about getting rid of discrimination in clubs. The argument wafted backwards and forwards and it was way above my head. After about an hour and a half, they suddenly said, `Oh, Glen, you havent said anything about discrimination in clubs. What do you think about this?. I said, `Well, I think the whole idea of having a club is to discriminate. That logic seemed to be lost on most of them and they thought I had missed the point. But Reg Wright considered I had a certain rustic charm and took up the cudgels with me. I enjoyed his time. I loved the way he could use words and wrap his tongue around meretricious and millions. He made a contribution to this place that we should be proud of forever.I was aware that he really read every Bill. I sincerely believe he did. His office was awash with papers. He came in and made speeches exactly as Senator Peter Baume said, and he presented them with distinction. That is all one can say. So on behalf of the National Party I express my condolences to his widow and his family. I am sure that everyone who knew him, and this Senate in particular, is the richer for having had an association with Sir Reginald Wright.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HON.

Though I have yet to make my first speech, I would like to make a brief contribution to and to be associated with this motion of condolence. I knew Sir Reginald Wright as most Tasmanians knew him-as a Tasmanian first and politician second. We Tasmanians sent him over here to represent us, and that he did with a passion. He was our representative, our champion, in the way that you send champions forth to do all sorts of duties. At his funeral I heard him referred to most accurately as a statesman-a States man. He entered this place in the year that I was born. Throughout my early years his influence was such that I thought all senators were like Sir Reginald Wright, or Senator Wright as he was then. I have lived to learn that that is not so, and I wonder how Senator Button and his colleagues might cope with several clones of Reggie Wright. I think that Senator Archers assurance that there will never be another was probably a most welcome assurance.In this States House Reggie Wright championed my State in his own peculiar way, and I say `peculiar on good advice. I use the word to reflect Sir Reginalds individuality. He was an individual who loved words. He gloried in his individual, particular and effective use of words. He prepared words. He savoured words. And when he presented them for our edification they were almost like a meal. They were something to chew on and to enjoy-something to sustain you for the rest of the day. The walls of the old Senate chamber echo innumerable anecdotes about Sir Reginald and I shall not attempt to add to that store for we have already heard enough to sustain us for some days.My island State has Reggie Wright stories embedded within its fabric. He is part of our folklore and the particular individual world perspective that we Tasmanians enjoy. Those of us who heard him speak-which was a unique experience-will for ever treasure his skills in spreading words and images across our memories. I still carry my personal memory of Sir Reginald insisting that it was always important to consider the effect of legislation on Tasmania. I will not lose that memory and I hope it will give me guidance in the future. I join with the previous speakers in offering my condolences to his relatives.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HON.

Already this evening we have heard a great deal of his qualities. I do not think it appropriate to repeat what has already been said. I did not know Senator Wright very well personally. However, he was a colleague of my husbands during the Fraser Ministry years and my husband and I both attended his funeral service. As has already been said, it was a very happy funeral. I have never previously been to a funeral where people laughed so consistently throughout the service. For those of us who were present, it was a very good reminder of how a life lived to the full can be a matter for celebration at the end.I simply want to join with my colleagues in sending my sympathy and that of my husband to Lady Wright and to his family. He was a patriarch at the end and I hope that his genes will be long and strong in Tasmania political life. He was an orator of whom we were very proud, as we were of course of that other orator, Dame Enid Lyons. Certainly we who follow in the Liberal tradition in Tasmania have a lot to live up to. I would like to think that we will continue to strive for some of the qualities of courage, independence and intelligence for which we remember Sir Reginald.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HON.

As Senator Bell said, not every senator is like Senator Wright-and I might add that this Senate is not the same place now as it was when Senator Wright was here. Soon after his retirement, he said:If you only knew the spirit of apathy in the Senate 20 years ago and see the spirit today, why, the contrast is enormous.I would suggest that if one knew the spirit in the Senate 12 years ago, and then saw the spirit today, one would also say, `Why, the contrast is enormous. I think it is very important for us, whilst supporting this condolence motion, to reflect on where this institution is going. I was here for only two or three years before Senator Wright retired-he retired in 1978-but I recall seeing him in the old chamber. I think he sat in the middle row, sort of a centre half-back position, and, as Senator Peter Baume said, whilst he was making a speech he was often out in the centre of the aisle or over here, as Senator Baume said, picking up a legal treatise and quoting from it. It is true, as Senator Baume said, that people came into the chamber to hear his contributions to a debate. I think probably the only one who did not come into the chamber was the person sitting sharing the bench with him, because he could not get into his seat.

Of course, as Senator Bell said, not every one of us senators is like Senator Wright was. He was a truly independently minded person. He said of the Senate that it should be the check on unbridled power-the unbridled power, of course, of the Executive. Why was it that he took such a leading role, as Senator Walters quite rightly said, in that 1977 referendum campaign? Because had that proposal been adopted, in his view-and it was my view, as it was of a handful of others who opposed that proposition-it would reduce the power of the Senate as a check on the unbridled power of executive government and particularly of the Prime Minister of the day.Mr President, in view of the time I should like simply to associate myself with this condolence motion and convey my sympathy to the widow and family of the late Sir Reginald Wright.Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable senators standing in their places.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HON.

268,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BUTTON","4F4","(Victoria-","ALP","Leader of the Government in the Senate)",39,"â€”by leave-I move:That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death, on Sunday, 18 March 1990, of Robert Cummin Katter, member of the House of Representatives for the seat of Kennedy from 1966 until his retirement earlier this year, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.Bob Katter was born on 5 September 1918 at Brisbane, Queensland. He grew up in Cloncurry, where his family ran the general store. He attended school in Charters Towers where he was an athletics and football champion and active in local theatre and public speaking. He studied law at the University of Queensland and served as an infantry captain in World War II.Before entering Federal Parliament, Bob Katter was a councillor for the Cloncurry Shire from 1946 to 1967, including two periods as Chairman. He served as a member of the executive of the Queensland Local Government Association and was Chairman of that Associations Canberra Committee on Local Government. He was one of the Federal Parliaments longest serving National Party members. He was Minister for the Army in the McMahon Government in 1972. He served on various Commonwealth delegations and parliamentary committees, including the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Road Safety, on which he served as Chairman from 1976 to 1983; the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade; and the Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act from 1978 to 1980.Throughout his long public life Mr Katter represented the people of north Queensland with dedication and energy. I must say that I did not know Bob Katter well, but on at least two occasions I visited Mount Isa-I think as a Minister on each occasion. Bob Katter, as the member for that area, with the proprietorial air which National Party members for big electorates tend to have, extended considerable hospitality to me, although I suppose I was there to try to get rid of him. On each of those occasions when I was in his electorate I appreciated his kindness and hospitality to me.There are, of course, many occasions when we express sorrow at the passing of former members. On this occasion the sadness is keen, in part because he was so recently a colleague in the House of Representatives. The memories are fresh and we think of him with respect. On behalf of the Government I extend to Mr Katters family our sincere sympathy on their bereavement.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HON.

269,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator HILL","BH4","(South Australia-","LP","Leader of the Opposition)",39,"â€”On behalf of the Opposition I join the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) in support of the motion and in expressing our sympathy to the family of the late Bob Katter. I will not reiterate the details of his career as they have just been outlined by the Leader of the Government, but I will repeat his record in public life-that is, 20 years as a councillor for the Cloncurry Shire and 24 years as a National Party member of this Parliament. That, in anyones language, is an enormous contribution in public service and one for which we should all be grateful.He pursued many interests in this place, some of which should be particularly remembered. Firstly, I refer to his representation of the interests of northerners. This always seemed to be his first priority. He was a co-founder of the Longreach Stockmans Hall of Fame. After the change of government in 1972 he was coalition spokesman for northern development and the Northern Territory. Secondly, he served on many committees and was particularly interested in foreign affairs and defence. You will remember, Mr President, his contribution to a document headed Threats to Australias Security which became known as the Katter report, which was put down in 1981 by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. It was recommended by one reviewer as `required reading for anyone who seeks a well-informed, clearly written and bipartisan document-and I will come back to that committee contribution in a moment.Thirdly, I think he will be remembered for his service over 11 years on the House of Representatives Select Committee on Road Safety. He was deeply concerned about the road toll and argued strenuously for the introduction of random breath testing on a national basis.In this strange business of politics, there are some with whom one comes into contact rarely and some whom one meets often. I actually had a lot of contact with Bob Katter over the nine years that I have been in this place through our mutual interest in foreign affairs and defence and our mutual involvement on the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. I will remember certain aspects of his contribution. I will always remember his enthusiasm. He had great pride in Australia. He was always an optimist and, I think felt that there were too many pessimists within our community.His pride extended particularly to his view of the Australian armed forces. When we travelled together visiting military establishments and when he saw military personnel in this place, he was constantly putting to them how important he regarded their work and their commitment. Also, I will always remember his attitude to foreign visitors, which was a lesson to us all. The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence receives many foreign visitors. Bob Katter was always present, and was not only courteous but also genuinely warm in welcoming these visitors to our shores, and in that way- which may not be known to many senators-was, in my view, a great ambassador for Australia.On behalf of the Opposition, I extend to his widow and children our sincere sympathy in their bereavement.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HON.

270,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BOSWELL","YE4","(Queensland-","NP","Leader of the National Party of Australia)",40,"â€”I support the motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button). Bob Katter was well known to many of us both in the Senate and in the House of Representatives. As Senator Button has said, he was a person who would go out and welcome people into his electorate. I well recall him on one occasion turning up to welcome the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to his electorate at Mount Isa. When visiting Mount Isa during the last campaign, the Prime Minister offered to go and see Bob Katter in hospital.Bob Katter was born in 1918 in Brisbane and grew up in north Queensland. He was the proprietor of the local drapery business, menswear store and picture theatre. He won the seat of Kennedy in 1966 and held it until six days before the election. Kennedy had been an Australian Labor Party electorate held by the Riordan family for two generations. Bob Katter won that seat because he had the ability to mix with the mighty and the humble and would give each the same time and consideration. He was just as much at home with the leader of the grazing community or the captain of the mining industry as he was with the ringers, fencers, fettlers, kangaroo shooters and the Aboriginals. In fact, he had a special affinity with the Aboriginal people and was extremely kind and generous to them.Before television came to the bush, one of the main sources of entertainment in country Queensland was a night at the pictures, and it was customary at that time for Aboriginal people to sit on the hard benches either in the back or front of the theatre and the Europeans to sit in the canvas chairs. Bob Katter would not tolerate that segregation. In fact, he removed the hard chairs so that everyone was forced to share the canvas seats.Those attributes were passed on to his son, young Bob. Bob junior played with the Cloncurry Tigers, which was an all-black team. The reason he played with the all-blacks is that he did not like racism or segregation. Bob Katter champ- ioned the causes of north Queensland and his beloved seat of Kennedy. In his maiden speech he called for the development of the north. He saw the tremendous job potential, the job opportunities and the wealth creation that were in north Queensland-the timber industry, cattle industry, mining, wool growing-and he continually fought for people in the bush to have the same facilities as were taken for granted in the cities. In his maiden speech he called for television for remote areas, and he lived to see three television stations servicing north Queensland, including his electorate. He successfully pushed for decent communication, and at present very few people in western Queensland do not have a telephone or some decent form of communication. That is a tribute to him. I can remember probably less than 12 months ago being at a meeting with him in the town of Blackall, where he continued to fight for people to get off party lines and to have some form of communication comparable to that of the cities. Bob always said that he thought everyone was entitled to know who won the last on Saturday.Bob Katter worked hard for a decent road system in north Queensland. When he was elected to the House of Representatives in 1966 it was a seven-hour drive between Cloncurry and Mount Isa, a distance of some 200 kilometres. It is now a comfortable one-hour journey because he achieved decent roads for the north. Bob was an achiever for his massive electorate of Kennedy, an electorate that is three times the size of Victoria. Both he and his wife, Joy, moved around the electorate, calling on the major centres but never neglecting little towns like Dajarra, five or six houses. He kept in communication with his electorate. He was also a great supporter of the underprivileged.Bob had a great many years in local Government, as Senator Button has said, as a councillor, deputy chairman and chairman of Cloncurry Shire Council. He was a man before his time in a lot of ways. As chairman of the Cloncurry Shire Council he was responsible for the installation of fridges and evaporative air conditioners by making bulk purchases and amortising them against the cost of the rates, because he knew that many of the people there could never afford those amenities that are so necessary in the heat and the dryness of western Queensland.While he was its chairman the local shire council provided small one-room cottages for retired station workers who were living in absolutely appalling conditions in Cloncurry and were unable to afford any accommodation. He was well respected and admired in the local government community right throughout Queensland and was a member of the Queensland Local Government Association and an executive of the western Queensland local government association. He continued that interest right up until his demise. I can recall going out and meeting Senator Reid and a number of other senators on a local government committee when he was taking them around and showing them north Queensland only a couple of years ago. He served in the Army between 1936 and 1942, rising to the rank of captain. I can recall him naming one of the Army helicopters after the Kalkadoons, who were the local Aboriginal people in Cloncurry. Mr Bob Katter was a legend in Kennedy and a legend in north Queensland. There are many Katter stories told about Bob right throughout the north.I believe that the people in Mount Isa said it all on the day of the funeral. Many thousands of people lined the streets from the church to the cemetery to pay their respects to their member of 24 years. He had won a great deal and done much for north Queensland. Bob lived by the maxim, `Work hard, play hard and pray hard. He is survived by his wife Joy, four sons-Bob, Norman, Carl, Richard-and two daughters-Geraldine and Bernadette. On behalf of the National Party of Australia, I extend our sympathy to them.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HON.

271,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MacGIBBON","YH4","(Queensland)","LP","N/A",41,"â€”I would like to add a brief personal tribute to the late Bob Katter. This afternoon the Senate is revering the passing of two really great characters of the Australian Parliament in Reg Wright and Bob Katter. They were very different people, although of somewhat similar build physically. Bob Katter was one of those really great Queensland personalities. He was known throughout the length and breadth of the State. It was my pleasure to meet him in 1977 when I was campaigning for the Senate, and he exhibited that generosity to me to which Senator Button referred. I think that in all the time I have been in the Senate Bob and I constantly shared membership on one committee or another.Reference has been made to Bob Katters great interest in defence. About six years ago I succeeded him as Deputy Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence but, as Senator Hill has said, Bobs interest in that committee was undimmed. Bob Katter was a man of very great generosity and very great enthusiasm-enthusiasm for life in all its many facets. He was also a man of great love for his family and for the community-not any one part of it and not with any narrow vision, but for the whole country, the whole of Australia. He was a very proud Australian. In my experience around Queensland he had absolutely no enemies at all, and that is a claim that very few of us in politics can make. Bob was genuinely liked and admired by all the people who knew him. I think that great admiration for Bob was shown by the community at his funeral service in Mount Isa where, sadly, since it was only a few days before the election, a large number of his colleagues who would otherwise have been there from this Parliament were not able to attend. But from all over Queensland, and particularly from Mount Isa and the Kennedy region, they turned up in their legions to pay their last respects. It was a privilege to know Bob, and his passing is a great loss for his family, for his friends and for Australia.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HON.

272,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MACKLIN","2I4","(Queensland-","AD","Leader of the Australian Democrats)",42,"â€”I would like to associate the Australian Democrats with the condolence motion moved by Senator Button. I think that Senator Hill put it very well when he said that one of the characteristics that Bob Katter exhibited to overseas guests was courtesy. It was an extraordinary strong type of courtesy that he exhibited; always very robust but never abrasive. It was, to me at least, an experience to see how he handled those two sides. Unfortunately, not many of us manage to get them right.I think that Bob Katter was one of the first House of Representatives people I met when I came to the Senate 10 years ago. Unfortunately, honourable senators have very little contact with honourable members of the House of Representatives, but one tends to meet ones colleagues on plane trips more than anywhere else. On many occasions going back to Queensland we drew corresponding seats. We talked about a lot of things, but I think the thing I remember most about him was his great love of his family. They were, despite his intensive public life, something that he cherished greatly. He had, of course, as all honourable senators know, a young family as well as his older children. He was always proud to talk about their school achievements. We spent a lot of time swapping stories about what our children were doing at various stages in school.That love of children, of course, extended to his work on the Parliamentary United Nations Childrens Fund committee as a member of the executive; it was not in fact simply limited to his own children. Bob Katter had a genuine human compassion for the plight of children around the world. Indeed, as I have found out over the years it is impossible to move anywhere in his electorate or to talk with any council in north-west Queensland without hearing Bob Katter stories, a lot of which are not able to be repeated here. One cannot go anywhere without hearing one of those stories, and they added up in number.During the last election campaign, I was in the Kennedy area. People knew that Bob Katter was then sick and, later, that he had died. A lot of them talked about him and about their memories of him. The comments were all of the type that Senator MacGibbon has referred to. I never ever met anyone anywhere who had anything bad to say about him. That is, as Senator MacGibbon has said, not something that is universal in this profession. Bob Katter was well loved throughout the entire area and will be sadly missed. It is indeed disappointing that he could not have had a long retirement after his extraordinarily vigorous and lengthy public life.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HON.

273,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BJELKE-PETERSEN","ND4","(Queens-","NP","land)",43,"â€”I wish to join with the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button), the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Hill), the National Party of Australia (Senator Boswell) and other honourable senators in paying tribute to the late Hon. Bob Katter, who for almost 25 years was a member of the Federal Parliament and who served the people of Kennedy, his electorate in north-west Queensland based on Mount Isa, faithfully and well.The late Bob Katter, as has been mentioned here by quite a number of speakers, was Minister for the Army in the McMahon Government for a short period and he was a loyal and hardworking member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. I believe that that was really one of the very important matters in his life as a member of parliament. He was certainly very involved in it and he regularly attended meetings. I suppose that came from the fact that he was a member of the Australian Army himself from 1936 until 1942, when he rose to the rank of captain.I was interested in what our Leader of the Opposition said about Bob Katters appreciation of the defence forces. That would have come, of course, as I said, from his having been in the Army. At his funeral I thought to myself how pleased Bob would have been to have known that an Army colonel and major were there representing the Governor-General and the Queensland Governor.Prior to becoming a member of parliament, Bob had been very active in local government, having served two terms as the chairman of the Cloncurry shire and through executive positions with the Queensland local government associations.I have been in and out of Mount Isa over many years, firstly as the wife of the Premier of Queensland and then latterly as a senator. The hospitality of the Katter home was extended to me on many occasions. Actually, I have often said that the best feed of barramundi that I have ever had was given to me by Joy Katter in the Katter home at Mount Isa. It was lovely fresh barramundi from the Gulf of Carpentaria and beautifully cooked by Joy.I often met Bob on the plane, especially if I had seat 1A. Bobs seat was always 1B. No-one ever got seat 1B if Bob Katter was travelling on the plane.At one time Bob represented part of South Burnett, my home district, when it was in his vast electorate of Kennedy which took in almost one-third of the State of Queensland. When I say that Queensland fits Victoria into it seven times you know just how great an area Bob had to look after. He travelled that whole area so often that it is a wonder that his children knew him, particularly the younger ones, because he was away from home so often. But that was his job and he put 100 per cent effort into it.It is no wonder that Mount Isa paid a tremendous tribute to him on the day of his funeral. People came not only from Mount Isa, but also, as Senator MacGibbon said, from far afield to pay a tribute to Bob Katter. The church was full to overflowing and the crowds lined the streets all the way to the cemetery. The tribute that his son, Bob junior, the member for Flinders, paid to his father that day brought tears to many peoples eyes; members of the Katter family took part in the service.The late Bob Katter was an executive member of our pro-life group in the Parliament and also an attending member of our parliamentary christian fellowship. His christian faith meant a lot to him. As a Queensland senator and as a friend I want to pay this tribute to him and extend to Joy and the children at home, Carl, Richard and Bernadette, and indeed to other members of the family, young Bob, Geraldine and Norman, my sincere sympathy and pray that God will be their comfort in their loss of a devoted husband and father.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HON.

274,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator SHEIL","BJ4","(Queensland)","NP","N/A",44,"â€”Bob Katter was known as Alligator Katter long before we ever got Crocodile Dundee and he was a very colourful denizen of the north. He drove around that gigantic electorate of Kennedy incessantly and visited every nook and cranny in it. If he did not know everybody in Kennedy, then everybody in Kennedy knew Bob. He was the consumate politician, as has been attested here. I do not want to go over all the tributes again, but I appreciate all the things that he did.As was said by Senator Macklin, everybody in the north of Queensland had a story about Bob Katter, he was so well known. He did not tell any of them, but I think that a couple are worth recalling. On one occasion he was driving along one of these long outback roads when he saw a plume of dust approaching from the other direction; it was another car. As he slowed down to pass he saw the other driver had the window down. The lady who was driving put her head out to say something to him as she went past. He put his window down and his head out and she said, `Pig. He just had time to stick his head out the window to say, `Bitch. He went on in the dust and hit the pig!I remember another story. After a meeting way out west a little group was having a cup of tea. All of a sudden a minibus full of Japanese spending a few days in the outback arrived. When they got out of the bus they were all chattering away and talking and laughing. Bob sent one of the chaps over to the interpreter to ask what they were all talking about. He came back laughing his head off. He said `You wont believe this. Theyve been on that bus on that road there for two hours and they havent passed another car. They wanted to know if it is a one-way street. I do not think any of them realised the vast distances we had to cover in those times.But Bob Katter enjoyed parliamentary life. The highlight for him was when he was Minister for the Army. I think he felt he made a solid contribution there; I am sure he did. He enjoyed his time as a parliamentary representative at the United Nations which was another highlight of his career. The foundation of the Stockmans Hall of Fame gave him enormous satisfaction. The Hall of Fame is a highlight of the trip from the Great Barrier Reef to Ayers Rock in the middle of Australia. I also mention his contribution to local government which is a subject he dearly loved to deal with and spent endless time on. He also made an enormous contribution to road safety in Australia.As has been said, he has had two families. His first wife died after a long and distressing illness. He then married Joy and they had another family, a lovely family whom he doted on. Just before he died I ran into him one day when he was going into the hospital. He knew the jig was up. He said `Oh, I just want to hang on a little. I want the grandchildren to be able to remember me. He was a family man right to his heart.As a matter of fact I think he would have liked to establish a dynasty in Kennedy if his son, young Bob, could have got the preselection. But, as he said, it seemed as though he had run into a great big fat bladder of lard. I do not know what that was but he had a colourful way of expressing everything. So that was one disappointment for him. But I have appreciated his career no end and I express my sympathy to Joy and the family and add what support I can to this motion of condolence.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HON.

275,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator TAMBLING","6E4","(Northern Territory)","NP","N/A",44,"â€”It is a great tribute to Bob Katter that so many honourable senators can speak of him with such great personal memory and identification. For a person to contribute to public life from the levels of local government to the General Assembly of the United Nations and then also incorporate in his term so many areas and fields of community endeavour is a very great plus and positive attribute. He was man who made a marvellous contribution.Bob Katter stood for election 10 times to this Federal Parliament and was successful on every occasion. Like many other members and senators I shared a great deal of interest in the area of northern Australia with the late Bob Katter. I shared a common electorate boundary both in the House of Representatives and in the Senate as a senator for the Northern Territory. I know that I am speaking for my party colleagues, Sam Calder, Bernie Kilgariff and Paul Everingham who also had a great deal to do with Bob in his parliamentary career in this particular place.My memories of Bob Katter go back to the period shortly after my election to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in late 1974. That was the period of the Whitlam administration and Bob Katter at that time was the Opposition spokesman for northern development and the Northern Territory. I have two very vivid memories of Bob in that particular period. One relates to the early moves and initiations for self-government for the Northern Territory. We certainly enjoyed the major support of Bob Katter in progressing the Northern Territorys case for further transfers of power and for what finally eventuated in self-government in 1978. He must have been so proud to have been a party to that.A month or so after I was elected, Cyclone Tracy hit Darwin. One of the first parliamentarians to visit Darwin on that occasion was Bob Katter. He was in there, I think, on the first or the second day and had a very personal and meaningful involvement in the negotiations that were so necessary with Dr Cairns and so many other people in the very early days.I know that there are thousands of my constituents in the Northern Territory who share in the great loss of Bobs passing. As other honourable senators have mentioned, these of course include thousands of Aboriginal territorians who also knew him so well through his operation in Mount Isa. I would like to express the condolences of my party, the Northern Territory Country Liberal Party. We remember the special endeavours that Bob made on behalf of the Northern Territory and I express sympathy to Joy and the family.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HON.

Ten times elected as the member for Kennedy and once to heaven, which is surely where he is now because he would be one of the people first elected to that area.If ever there was a member of this Parliament who could be called `Hail Fellow, Well Met, Bob Katter was that member. He was a tireless worker for his electorate and for the people of the Australian traditional outback. He played a formidable part in the establishment of the Australian Stockmens Hall of Fame. This man, a traditionalist for the outback, will be missed by this Parliament. We are all the poorer for his passing. I share with the family the loss they feel at this stage and extend the sympathy of all the National Party people in New South Wales to Joy and the family.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HON.

I have an immense professional and personal regard for Bob Katter-a professional regard because of the incredible example he gave to all members of Parliament, particularly in the matter of caring for his constituents. He faced 10 elections in 21 years during his 24 years of service-one almost every two years. He had three-quarters of a million square kilometres to look after. That is the size of the Kennedy electorate. The burden that imposed on him personally and physically was enormous. Yet, as other speakers have said, he was probably one of Australias best known members of parliament so far as his constituents were concerned. Any one of us who went to his electorate was greeted, as has been said, with incredible hospitality. His achievements, culminating in his period as a Minister of the Crown, speak for themselves, but his holding for 24 years of what was traditionally a Labor seat, which on his death was regained by Labor, is a further indication of the outstanding personal contribution he made on behalf of his constituents.The two people we have mourned so far today-Sir Reginald Wright and Bob Katter-both served their country in the Parliament and in the defence forces. Between them they served this Parliament for more than 50 years. They contributed immensely to our nation and we are certainly the poorer for their passing.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HON.
