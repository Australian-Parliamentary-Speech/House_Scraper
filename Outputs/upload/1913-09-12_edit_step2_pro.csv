Thousands of pounds have been spent in an endeavour to ventilate the chamber. Altogether six schemes have been tried so far, and that at present in use has proved the best. There is machinery for withdrawing about 3,000 or 4,000 cubic feet of air per minute from the chamber and letting in a similar quantity. But trouble arises in the winter months. When the air is let in members complain about the draught, and go to the Speaker or Clerk to ask that the machine be shut off. The result is that the scheme has failed owing to the action of honorable members themselves in not allowing it to be properly worked. I have been told that if we have the doors and windows open the scheme which we have now at work to ventilate the chamber will be a failure.That is where the difficulty arises. No doubt the air in the chamber is very bad, but I think it is better now than it has been in the past, though perhaps something additional might be done.

In the month of June, obviously, more money is expended than in any other month of the year, because a large number of accounts are paid in June which are not paid in any other month. The Treasurer sends out an intimation that all the accounts that have to be paid during the financial year must be paid before the end of June. He is naturally anxious that that should be done in order that on the 1st of .July he may be in a position to send all the statements .to the Auditor-General. Consequently, in June more money will be expended than in any other month. If, therefore, we specify that the amount paid in July shall not be greater than the expenditure in the previous June twelve months, we have no more control over the expenditure than to the extent of the expenditure of the month of the year when the largest amount of money is paid out of the Treasury. Suppose, for instance, that we provided in this Bill that this condition should apply to the previous June twelve months. A larger amount of money .could, under that provision, be spent by  the Treasurer than it is the intention of Parliament to grant.

I hope that his present demeanour will not be continued throughout the session. Honorable members upon this side of the chamber will have great difficulties in offering a suggestion of any description if he continues to display such heat, and to lose himself in his well worked-up indignation. The first provisions of this Bill are designed only to convenience the Treasury. It has never been suggested, even by the Ministry, that the Treasurer should be given a blank cheque for the month of July in any year. The measure is intended to prevent our public officials in particular from being subjected to inconvenience, and for that reason - if it be inconvenient to call Parliament together during the first week in July - it seeks to empower the Treasury to meet the ordinary current expenditure. There is no desire, I am sure, upon either side of the House that, under this Bill, the Government should be given a blank cheque for the month of July. I do not suggest that the Treasurer wishes to take undue advantage of the power which he will enjoy if the clause be passed in its present form. But we know that the opinions of Treasurers change. Different Governments may occupy the Treasury bench. I have a vivid recollection of the action of certain State Governments a month or two before this Parliament was inaugurated. Those Parliaments, to their everlasting disgrace, did something in a financial direction in the belief that they were imposing penalties on this Parliament, when, as a matter of fact, they were only inflicting injury on themselves. Similarly, we have instances of Governments in their dying moments having been guilty of political immorality of the deepest dye. The question therefore arises as to whether we are justified in giving to any Treasurer - not necessarily to the right honorable gentleman who now fills that office -a blank cheque for the month of July in any year, even though a general election may not have taken place, so that he may spend whatever he pleases. That is what the Bill amounts to. It is also intended to overcome a difficulty which presents itself in the July following a general election. That difficulty arises because our Electoral Act provides that new senators cannot take their seats until the 1st July following their election. In these circumstances, there is no justification for giving a blank cheque.","N/A","AUDIT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[5]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Bill, as it stands, will permit the Treasurer of the day to spend in the month of July an amount equal to that which was spent during the previous June. Now it may happen that the ordinary circumstances of government have justified an excessive expenditure in June. This may arise from the desire of the Ministry to clear up the accounts before the close of the financial year. That, however, is not the practice of the State Governments. They frequently say, in regard to many accounts, Oh ! let them stand over till next year. It depends entirely upon the state of their balance-sheet. We may congratulate ourselves that that is not the practice with Commonwealth Governments. They are accustomed to sending out special requests with a view to expediting the payment of all accounts due before the close of the financial year. The ordinary circumstances of government justify an excessive expenditure in the month of June.

In ordinary circumstances increases of salaries are detailed in the Estimates, and honorable members know precisely what is going on, but the inclusion of the word  aggregate  in the amendment - and it is not proposed at present to cut it out - will mean that in July the Treasurer, if he so desired, could increase salaries in various directions, and once they had been increased, it would be a very difficult matter for honorable members to fairly criticise them or to have any check upon what he was doing. The amendment will permit of the transposition of sums from one heading to another heading. Sums might have been voted in the Appropriation Act of the previous year for a specific purpose and not expended for that purpose. The amendment will permit of the Treasurer, in July, when there would be no criticism, of taking a sum from under one heading and expending it under another heading quite without the knowledge of Parliament. I do not think - quite apart from party politics - that that is the intention or even the desire. The object of the Bill is to tide over a temporary difficulty which might possibly arise after an election. We ought not in the circumstances to give any Treasurer such a wide power. It might be the good fortune of some honorable member on this side to be occupying the Treasury bench in the course of a year, or two years, or five, years. This measure will be on the statute-book for all time, and whoever is Treasurer may be able to take advantage of this provision.","N/A","AUDIT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[6]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I will give an instance. It might be that a Government was defeated at a general election. The standard of honour in Governments differs. Indeed, the circumstances in their opinion might really justify them in retaining their positions, even though defeated at the polls.

There is a difference between giving the Treasurer liberty to do a thing and giving him licence to do a thing. It is possible, I say, that a Government might be defeated at the polls. Ministers might retain their positions, as they would have the power to do, and under this Bill indulge in an increase of salaries, of which perhaps their successors might not approve. They might indulge in a form of expenditure which would not be acceptable to their successors, but which nevertheless they would be committed to by a defeated Government. Let us re tain the measure, as was the original intention. Let us put it in such a form as that any ordinary inconvenience because of the inability to spend one penny in July shall be met, so that the Treasurer, whoever he might be, could tide over the inconvenience. But do not let us, in this apparently simple measure, give a defeated Government the power to expend money.

183,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"ARCHIBALD, William","JM8","Hindmarsh","N/A","N/A",1197,". - There is a phase of this question which I think is lost sight of by the Committee. I want to make a strong appeal to honorable members on the other side, because the view I am about to put is not a party one. The position, V take it, is that under the amendment any Government would be entitled to tide over the financial requirements of the Commonwealth during July. There is no difference of opinion, I think, on the absolute necessity of an arrangement of this character being made in order to tide over the requirements of the Commonwealth during the month of July following a general election. That, I take it, is the reason why this Bill is introduced. I suggest the desirability of confining the provision to years in which a general election is held. I hope that the Treasurer will not think that in making this suggestion I reflect on him, or on the Government with which he is associated. I am sure that ho would act as honorably and straightforwardly as any Treasurer that we have had, or are likely to have, and no offence is intended. But what may happen if we allow the provision to apply to every year? Will it not, in effect, mean the deferring of the meeting of Parliament until August? I think it is not desirable to pass a law practically saying that Parliament shall not meet until August. There may be a great deal to be said in favour of the proposal in relation to ordinary circumstances, but we might have in power a Government which should be brought to book as early as possible. Such a Government might advise the Governor-General to prorogue Parliament in November, and if it could put off the calling together of Parliament again until August it would be free of control for eight months. Is that desirable? We should be careful not to fetter our successors. I may be told that a future Parliament could, if it chose, repeal the Act. That is so, but while we have the right to legislate to meet the requirements of the day, we ought not to fetter our successors. I see the need for a provision of this kind, so far as the July following a general election is concerned, but, as to other Julys, any difficulties could be provided for beforehand. For instance, two months Supply was granted in advance for the financial year 1911-12, because it was known that Ministers and members would not be able to return from England after the Coronation proceedings until late in the year, and it was thought desirable not to inconvenience the Treasury by the late assembling of Parliament which would be necessary. We hope that it may be many years before another Coronation takes place. Exigencies of State may require the presence of Ministers in London, or other circumstances may make it impossible to call Parliament together till late in the year. But these things will be known of in advance, and provision should be made in respect to them. Our present duty is to preserve the absolute freedom of honorable members in the criticism and control of finance, and we should not give up any of our powers. I understand that the Treasurer thinks that the provision would be useless if it were made to apply only to the July following a general election, but I should like to hear his reasons for that opinion. I do not say that the provision would be abused by this Government, and it would not have been abused by the last Government, but it might be abused by some future Government. Party feeling now runs high, and may run yet higher in the future, because parties are so evenly balanced, and the issues between them are of such vital importance. This makes it desirable that we should not give by Statute the power to defer the meeting of Parliament until August in each year. A six months recess is, in my opinion, ample, and, in many cases, too much. Parliament is the mouthpiece of the people, or, as Sir George Reid has said, the whispering gallery of the Commonwealth. Here every grievance can be voiced, and Ministers can be challenged on their every act. Possibly Governments do not like that, and the front Opposition bench may not always feel it convenient, but members generally should see that our powers of criticism are not curtailed. I do not think that it is necessary to make provision for the Julys following penal dissolutions and elections.","N/A","AUDIT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

After the discussion that took place, however, the Government have brought down an amendment. I do not know who is responsible, but that amendment is very badly constructed, and, as the exAttorneyGeneral has said, is not at all clear. We are unable to say whether the words  June preceding  mean June in the year when this Act is to be operative, or the previous June mentioned in the first line of the proposed amendment. Although the Treasurer declared the amendment to be perfectly clear, he realized, after hearing speakers on this side, that it was badly drawn. Is that the way in which a Government should do business? Where are the lawyers on the Government side that they cannot come together and draft a simple clause ? I am wondering whether the expressed desire on the part of the Government to have business done has anything in the nature of seriousness about it, or whether the Treasurer has not brought down the Bill in this imperfect form in order to give rise to prolonged discussion.","N/A","AUDIT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[8]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I do not like the idea of this proposal to give the Treasurer a free run of the Consolidated Revenue for a whole month without consulting the members of this House. Does the Treasurer desire a long recess? If not, I see no reason for this proposal. There is no disadvantage in the existing method of procedure, except that the debate on that important question, the Address-in-Reply, might be interrupted for an hour or two while the Government get a Supply Bill through. The Treasurer tells us he requires the time to ponder over the figures and prepare his Budget Speech. We know that, year after year, when in Opposition, the present Treasurer baited the Treasurer of the day with requests to be informed when the Budget would be brought down; it was a standing grievance with the right honorable gentleman; but we do not hear much about it now - months are passing by and the right honorable gentleman thinks his Budget will be delivered in a week or two. Probably the object of this amendment is to enable the Government to prorogue the House in November, and continue the recess until the following August.

Such a thing might happen at any time. I trust, however, that the Treasurer will see fit to strike out of this Bill all reference to a Tender Board.

Ordinarily, it would not advance us a solitary step towards a solution of the difficulty. At the time of a general election half the number of senators go to the country at the same time as the members of the House of Representatives. Suppose the election takes place in May, it would be unreasonable to expect that the meeting of Parliament should take place at a date which would enable the attendance of the retiring senators. After a general election Parliament cannot meet before the 1st July, and that is what makes it necessary to provide for Supply for an extra month. The point I wish to make is that we have no guarantee that after this Bill is passed the Government of the day will call Parliament together earlier than has been the practice in the past. Except in the case of the first meeting of a Parliament after a general election the difficulty might be overcome even without this Bill. if. Parliament were to adjourn in September, and meet about the middle of May. That would allow the debate on the Address-in-Reply to be got out of the way in three weeks, the time usually occupied by the debate in this Parliament, and the Government could bring down Supplies and their financial proposals in accordance with the ordinary procedure. The Treasurer now proposes that the expenditure for July shall be one-twelfth of the total appropriated for the previous financial year.","N/A","AUDIT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[4]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If a Treasurer has an ample revenue he will require all accounts to be paid up to the 30th June, because he will not know what may happen in the following year; but if he has not sufficient revenue to meet all expenditure he will delay all payments possible in order to make it appear to the country that the Government have closed the financial year with a surplus.

The only excuse offered for it is that last session and this year it was found necessary to bring down a Supply Bill during the course of the debate on the Address-in-Reply. There is a general impression that it is not respectable to interrupt the Address-in-Reply debate with other business. But the Bill, even as amended, will afford the Government of the day an excuse for not calling Parliament together until a month or six weeks after the termination of the financial year. There has been an idea amongst a number of honorable members since the Federal Parliament was established that our sittings have been too long, especially when they lasted from the beginning of June or the 1st July to the end of the year.

Of course, a number of us who come from distant parts of the Commonwealth desire to get back amongst our constituents as often as we can. It may, perhaps, be convenient to some to shorten the sessions in that way. It is probably the intention of the Government to get this Bill passed with the object of enabling that to be done.

To sit four days a week is too much, and tends to break up the health of honorable members who devote considerable attention to their political duties.

Indeed, that honorable member has been so much occupied up till the present moment that ha has not had time to express himself upon a single question that has been brought before the House. I think that the Treasurer has taken the right course in providing that power shall not be given to spend in the month of July more than one-twelfth of the appropriation of the previous financial year. That will give us a rough idea of the amount of money we are going to give permission for the Treasurer to spend. As the Bill was originally introduced, Parliament would not have had even a rough conception of the amount that was to be handed over to the Government to spend at discretion. One thing that I should like to know from the Treasurer is this: Has he had any fault to find with the Auditor-General regarding the method of auditing Commonwealthaccounts? Statements have from time to time been made that the accounts have not been properly audited. Can the Treasurer give us some assurance that they will be audited properly under this Bill ?

When the Attorney-General was making this statement I observed that, at first, he did not feel called upon to express an opinion, but afterwards he appeared to realize that it was only just to the Committee that he should give us his view of the matter, which was that under this provision the Government can create a Supply and Tender Board.","N/A","AUDIT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[4]/interjection[11]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I agree with this Bill in the main. I agree that the provision which is now taken exception to should be enacted, but I contend that this is not a measure in which to empower the Government by regulation to introduce legislation of a very doubtful kind.

The New Zealand Act which corresponds to our Audit Act is called the Public Revenues Act, and the English Act is called the Exchequer and Audit Act. Our Audit Act has far more to do with the way in which the Treasurer must manage the finances than with the Auditor-Generals powers. The Auditor-General has the fullest powers in regard to the examination of accounts and the reporting to Parliament on all matters in connexion with expenditure.

The honorable gentleman seems to think that we cannot establish Tender Boards under regulation, but if he looks up section 139 of the Victorian Act, No. 1133, he will find therein power to make regular tions in regard to stores and transport.That section provides that there shall be a Tender Board ; it says what officers shall constitute the Board, and gives instructions for controlling the ordering and supplying of stores. The only object of the clause under discussion is to give the Treasurer more power by law over the purchase and control of stores than he has at the present time. Every Department is now almost a law to itself in regard to this matter, or it can be. The Treasury may give directions and make requests, but it cannot legally bind the other Departments as to the methods of purchasing stores. The object of the clause is to enable us to frame regulations having the force of law, which will be binding on everybody in the Public Service. This is not a party matter, nor does it concern this Government more than any other. The proposal is made wholly in the public interest, and there is nothing in the clause inconsistent with the Audit Act.

The honorable member for Kalgoorlie has-, pointed out that the Treasurer may create an independent Department, with powers, a little less than those of the Inter-State--Commission. I do nob go as far as to say that, but I can conceive the building up of a Department with great powers and a staff disproportionately large to the functions it will have to perform. We should sanction the creation of some body that will be independent, and have the authority to determine the suitability of supplies and tenders for stores and material required by the Commonwealth, and if the Treasurer will only tell us exactly his intention as to the power he wishes to get, much misunderstanding will disappear.","N/A","AUDIT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[5]/interjection[65]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The object of obtaining the authority in clause 3 is to make regulations that will have the force of law, so that the Auditor-Generals powers under section 41 of the Audit Act will have full play, which I hesitate in saying they have at present. Purchases are made all over Australia by different Departments under instructions, but these instructions are not as binding as regulations. The practice has been to utilize the Tender Boards in the different States, and I do not think there is need to rush in to appoint other Tender Boards so soon as we get this power, because we can utilize the Boards that exist in the different States and their regulations. We owe a debt of gratitude to the different States for allowing the Commonwealth to use their machinery and regulations.

In this Bill we have two clauses, one of which cannot be availed of until next July, while the Treasurer hopes the other will not be put into operation for a long while; yet only the other day we were violently accused by the Prime Minister of obstructing necessary legislation. We learn now that there is to be not one Tender Board, but many. I can understand that one Tender Board would be of no service. If something is required in Perth we can conceive the utter inability of a Minister in Melbourne expressing a reasonable and measured opinion concerning it. The right honorable gentleman possibly contemplates boards being appointed in the various States. To that I have no objection, but I ask honorable members to consider for a moment that the door will thus be opened to all sorts of possibilities. Here are boards whose functions are extremely vague, and the sphere of whose operations is obscure and apparently unlimited. What they are to do, and why they are to do it, we are not told, but we are led to understand very clearly that the Treasurer does not want them to do anything at all for quite a long time. In the circumstances I think we might fairly ask him to withdraw this part of the Bill until the need should arise for the creation of a body of this kind. So much for that point. The other point, as to which I am afraid the right honorable gentleman did not permit himself that measure of perspicacious utterance which it certainly requires - the question as to where the persons who are to constitute these Tender Boards are to come from - we should have more information. The Treasurer says that they are not to come from the Auditor-Generals Department. Then from what Department are they to be selected, or are they to be persons now outside the Public Service ? As I said on a previous occasion, I have no objection to the right honorable gentleman constituting .a departmental board when and how he likes. All that we ask is that there shall be some responsible and independent authority to review the actions of these Tender Boards, just as the actions of all other officers are reviewed. That was the point made by the honorable member for East Sydney. The Treasurer knows that if he wishes to create such boards he does not require an Act of Parliament to enable Mm to .do so. I am utterly at a loss to understand why he is taking the power under this Bill to create a Supply and Tender Board, which he admits is not to be recruited from the .staff of the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General himself is not to .be the head of this Department, but is to have the power to review its actions. When we ask who are to constitute the board, whether they are to come from the Department of Home Affairs or from some other Department, we are not told.","N/A","AUDIT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

There has been hitherto an air of confusion, doubt, and difficulty about it, which is most regrettable, and the reason for which was not quite clear; but we now learn that the Victorian Government, wiser than ourselves, have provided that the Inspector-General for the Insane shall be one of the officers charged with the important duties in connexion with a Supply and Tender Board.","N/A","AUDIT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[7]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

There are on the Victorian Board a number of other gentlemen, Some of whose functions bear a very sinister appearance. One of these is the Inspector-General of Penal Establishments. This is introducing into the discussion a note against which I protest, and the Attorney-General, as the representative of the law, should be called upon to rise in his place, not as a matter of privilege, but by way of personal explanation. After all, returning to the point at issue, I should be perfectly satisfied if the right honorable gentleman would indicate more clearly than he has done exactly how he intends to apply this system to the requirements of the Commonwealth. Unless he does so I must vote against this clause, and I am comforted in my determination to do so by the admission of the Treasurer that the matter is not at all urgent.

Apparently, because of these references, theTreasurer submits in this Bill a clause under which it will be possible to establish a Supply and Tender Board. The Prime Minister, in discussing the preliminary stages of the measure, asserted that it was the intention of the Government to establish such a board. The Attorney-General yesterday, when unacquainted with what was in the mind of the Treasurer, also asserted that it was the intention to establish the board. A few moments ago, presumably after consultation with his colleagues, he stated that that is not intended. Before the Attorney-General spoke, the Treasurer informed the Committee that it was not the intention of the Government to establish such a board at present; that he did not want it; and that it was intended to continue the practice at present prevailing. Is it any wonder, in view of these differences of opinion, that honorable members on this side should display a little apprehension as to what really is the intention of the Ministry? Is this clause merely inserted to make good the bogy utterances from election platforms, or in order that the Government may take advantage .of it ? After listening to the Prime Minister, it would appear that the Government propose to take advantage of it; but, after listening to the Treasurer, it is clear that they do not intend to take advantage of it. The Attorney-General merely comes in to explain the legal position, according to the brief he holds at the moment.

Has the Auditor-General anything to do with the purchase of goods? The Auditor and the purchaser should be entirely separate persons, so that the auditor may be free to investigate and criticise the work of the purchaser. The protection and recovery of public property is also provided for in the principal Act. The clause under discussion relates to the control of public property.

If in the course of a month or two after a dissolution the Treasurer finds himself on this side of the House, what will he say if we take advantage of this clause? Of course, I know that the Prime Minister shrinks from the idea of a dissolution. I do not grudge him the promotion he has secured, but he knows perfectly well what the result of a dissolution will be. If as a consequence of an appeal to the country we change places in this House, and those who are now on this side take advantage of this particular clause to frame a regulation in respect of a Supply and Tender Board, and the purchase of stores, I am satisfied that the Treasurer, to the very utmost of his capacity, will denounce us as he has done in the past, and will say that we are practically making laws by regulation, and doing so when Parliament is not in session.Clause agreed to.Title agreed to.Bill reported with an amendment; report adopted.That the House do now adjourn.","N/A","AUDIT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[10]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

There are one or two provisions in the measure which we knew it would contain - for instance, there is the proposal to restore the postal vote.

This morning I received from the Prime Minister a reply to a question regarding the escapees from the quarantine station at Manly. I have to complain about the nature of the reply. It was to the effect that five men had escaped from the quarantine area ; that they were not in a highly contagious condition; in fact, that they were convalescent, and, therefore, there was no danger to the community. All authorities that I know of have laid it down that the most contagious stage of this disease is that of convalescence. For the gentleman who is at the head of a big Department of this kind, and who is responsible for the whole of the business in connexion with the scare in Sydney today, to send such a reply to this House, as though we were a lot of school children, is so much bluff, unworthy of an officer of a Department. Further, if his statement is correct, and these persons were wholly convalescent, they had no right te be in the quarantine area. They should have been discharged if they were what he calls wholly convalescent. On the other hand, the newspapers of Sydney, with scare headings, reported the escape of the men from the quarantine station, and stated that they were mixing with the people of Manly, and had the disease in a contagious form. That is absolutely contrary to the statement of Dr. Cumpston. The newspapers used the incident, as they have been doing from the beginning of the epidemic, to scare people into being vaccinated. It is a scandalous thing that every little point that can be taken with regard to the position of small-pox patients is used by the newspapers of this country to drive people into a worse condition than small-pox itself would bring about. In his reply to a question on a matter of great importance to the people of New SouthWales, Dr. Cumpston does not indicate that he has a comprehension of the responsibilities of his office, or, if that is not so, that he has the knowledge which should be possessed by a man who is administering a Department of that kind sufficiently to win the confidence of the people. I do not wish to further dwell on the matter, because I understand that the Prime Minister is prepared to give me an opportunity, as soon as he can, to discuss it. That being so, I do not want to sacrifice that liberality on his part. He realizes the importance of the matter. It is of primary importance to the people in this country that we should know whether the action of the Government is warranted by the experience of other countries, and by the knowledge of the highest authorities. In my judgment the Government are making a serious blunder, and spreading the disease day by day, as has been done in epidemic after epidemic, by vaccination. By scaring people day by day into being vaccinated the newspapers are doing nothing more or less than continuing the epidemic, which is practically the outcome of vaccination. We had evidence of that through the press when the Health Officer said that the disease was only attacking people in a very mild form, but that it was very probable that in a few days, or a week or two, it would appear in a malignant form. That statement has not been borne out by the course of events. The fact that weeks and weeks have gone by without any very serious cases having been reported, and without any deaths having occurred, only bears out my statement as to the experience of all other countries during an epidemic, and that is that it is suicidal to introduce wholesale vaccination, because it spreads the very disease it is intended to check. This is going on right along the line, and the Minister in charge of the Department evidently takes no notice of it. Where is he now? What cares he for the loss incurred by the people of to-day! What cares he for the ruin which is staring them in the face, in many cases by reason of the loss of business and the paralyzing of industry! What cares he about the lives which are being sacrificed day by day by vaccination and the effects of it!","Order of Business : Electoral Bill : Quarantine: Election Expenditure: Hours of Sitting","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

396,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"WEBSTER, William","KXK","N/A","N/A","N/A",1215,"- Yes, but he has not been in Sydney all the time. To a Minister who is in charge of a Department of State like this, when the lives of the people are at stake, which is the more important? The business interests of the community are also at stake. It is not his place to be away from the scene of action. He should be there, watching closely every move, to see if he can bring relief to these people who have been scared by the action of the Government, which had no warrant or justification, but must be regarded as a calamity such as I hope will never occur again in the administration of the affairs of this country. The newspapers are making capital out of the disease, and are doing more injury by what they publish in the city of Sydney than could be done in any other way. They have done everything to inculcate a haunting fear of small-pox, with a view to driving the people to vaccination. Everything that can be put forward to bring about wholesale vaccination has been published, but nothing to enlighten the people as to the folly of it is given publicity, although the newspapers profess to be the great public educators, and the guides of the people. For the information of these persons, who could sit, I presume, at the side of the grave laughing, in their ghoulish delight, at the tears shed by the relatives of those who have been called away by the effects of vaccination, I shall produce in this Chamber, not theory, but practical experience, and the judgment of men in every part of the world of far higher standing than Dr. Cumpston, proving that the action of the Government is suicidal, and destructive of the best interests of Australia, being calculated to spread the disease which it is asserted they are trying to stop. I suggest to the Prime Minister that when I again ask a question in this House, he will intimate to his officers that questions are asked seriously, with a view to getting information, and that members are not to be treated as children. We have no right to be told that a small-pox convalescent is not a contagious subject, because it is well known in connexion with all scrofulous diseases such as measles, scarlet fever, small-pox, and the like, that those who are in the convalescent stage are most likely to spread the disease.","Order of Business : Electoral Bill : Quarantine: Election Expenditure: Hours of Sitting","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
397,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"THOMAS, Josiah","K8L","Barrier","N/A","N/A",1216,".- I draw the attention of the Minister of Home Affairs to a matter that has already been brought before the House by me once or twice, and upon which I have asked questions, the giving for political purposes of £500 by Mr. Herbert Brookes to the honorable member for Perth. The honorable member for Perth has admitted that he received that money, and that it was received for political purposes; but he said that he did not know exactly the date when it was received. I should be glad if my banking account were in such a state that I could not remember exactly when I had received a sum like £500. However, the honorable member for Bourke stated in this House that it was on the 26th April that the cheque was given. I raise no objection to the giving of the cheque, because I think that persons should be allowed to devote money for political purposes in aid of whatever party they may be associated with. But I bring the matter under the attention of the Minister of Home Affairs because the Electoral Act provides that an account must be given of any money sent for political purposes to any organization. I have asked whether the Home Affairs Department has received an account of how this money was spent, and have been informed that the Department has no information about it. The honorable member for Perth was good enough to say that Mr. Brookes informed him that I could go to his office, and see a statement of how the money was spent, but that is not my business. The matter would have been no concern of mine, but for the fact that section 172 of the Electoral Act says that a statement showing how much money is spent must be sent to the Chief Electoral Officer. As the money left Melbourne on the 26th April, it was money spent in connexion with the elections, and I ask the Prime Minister to ascertain whether steps have been taken to see if the Act has been complied with. When I asked a similar question some time ago, the honorable gentleman said that he was not a detective. I do not ask him to be a detective, but it is his business to see that administration entrusted to him is properly performed. During the electoral campaign, we heard a great deal about the need for pure administration, and about the need for purity of elections. I ask, therefore, whether an attempt will be made by the Chief Electoral Officer to give effect to the provisions of the electoral law in respect to the donation to which I have referred.","Order of Business : Electoral Bill : Quarantine: Election Expenditure: Hours of Sitting","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

He expects to get through a programme of legislation, a considerable portion of which means the utter destruction of legislation for which we on this side have been fighting for all our lives. When his measures are introduced, they will meet with the keenest opposition. During this week, we have been kept here every night until nearly midnight, but I submit that, in the interests of the honorable gentlemans physical condition, as well as for the sake of the health of other honorable members, our proceedings should close by half-past ten. It is not merely the hours that we sit here that have to be taken into account; the time occupied in attending to our voluminous correspondence must also be reckoned in. I have to answer letters from all parts of a constituency which is larger than Victoria. The Prime Minister can do a fair thing to the country and to himself only by setting apart a certain number of hours each day for the discussion of public business. He should not try to wear down his opponents physically. Such attempts only meet with retaliation and reprisals, and that we do not want. We want a fair fight, and should be permitted to get to our homes at a reasonable hour at night. If the honorable gentleman will consult the lists of the first Parliament, he will find that there are about eight of the original senators and about a dozen or fifteen of the original members of the House of Representatives left. We have both had a long time in politics, and, apparently, the people do not wish us to retire. Possibly we would not retire if we were asked to, and there is no reason why our exit should be hurried by asking us to sit here until midnight.","Order of Business : Electoral Bill : Quarantine: Election Expenditure: Hours of Sitting","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
399,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FENTON, James","KEV","Maribyrnong","N/A","N/A",1216,".- In the Age of to-day there is a report of a speech delivered by Mr. Herbert Brookes last night at a social function tendered to the defeated candidate for Bourke. The report is as follows: -Mr. Herbert Brookes, president of the Peoples Liberal party, in the course of a brief address complimenting Mr. Robb on the splendid fight he had put up at the election, said he had a personal statement to make. On three occasions during last week it was said in the House of Representatives that he had been responsible for passing on a certain sum of money to a member in another State. He wished to say that this was absolutely true. He was proud of it, and hoped to be able to do it again. He hardly understood why such a disturbance had been raised in the House over the matter, when the secretary of the Political Labour League in Sydney admitted that a straight-out payment was made for political purposes. But how had Mr. Anstey received this information? Apparently the whole of Australia was ridden with a nefarious system of spies. This was not playing the game. At that social gathering a member of the Government, Senator McColl, was present; but I do not know whether or not, as the report of his speech is exceptionally brief, he complimented Mr. Brookes on the financial efforts he had made to assist his Liberal brethren. However that may be, Mr. Brookes made a very definite statement; and, as the honorable member for Barrier has said, the Electoral Act requires all persons and associations to send in returns as to political expenditure at election times. That section of the Act the Government do not propose to amend, and we may take it that they approve of it. The request made by the honorable member for Barrier is a very modest one, and Mr. Brookes practically invites investigation.","Order of Business : Electoral Bill : Quarantine: Election Expenditure: Hours of Sitting","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
