The first fact to which I desire to invite attention is that since the consummation of Federation three appeals have been made to the electors of Australia. Upon each occasion the question of Free-trade versus Protection has been submitted for their consideration. As the result of the first election it was found absolutely impossible to secure anything like an effective policy of protection because of the need for regard being paid to revenue considerations. Upon the second occasion the fiscal issue was made a more prominent question, and the electors were invited to declare whether they desired a revenue Tariff or whether they preferred a national policy of protection. The result of the second appeal to the people showed that the number of electors in favour of a protective system had largely increased. Upon the last occasion a deliberate attempt was made to cloud the fiscal issue, and to this end the champion of free-trade in Australia - the leader of the Opposition - abandoned his free-trade principles for the time being, and raised the flag of anti-Socialism. Many of his. followers in other parts of the Commonwealth ranged themselves under that banner.","Customs and Excise Tariffs","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I believe that he is one of the few real free-traders in this Chamber who desire to abolish the whole of the Customs and Excise duties, and to obtain whatever revenue may be necessary for the government of the Commonwealth by means of direct taxation. He has repeatedly declared himself in favour of that policy. But he is evidently determined to whittle down the duties imposed upon the various items in the Tariff schedule to the lowest possible point. I do not quarrel with him for the attitude which he takes up, because I recognise that he is a sincere free-trader who wishes to assert his principles upon every possible occasion.

Does not the Argus, the great free-trade journal of Melbourne, in compiling the returns of the New South Wales elections, not class the successful candidates as protectionist-liberals and free-trade-liberals? Under the circumstances, I ask in all seriousness what justification there is for the threats of the Opposition that they intend to try their utmost to reduce the duties below the protective line? The people have three times loudly demanded from us, as their representatives, a truly protective policy ; and the Opposition, if they take the action they have foreshadowed, will be acting treacherously towards the country. We are here to reflect the opinions of the people, since we claim to be a democracy ; and, therefore, no good ground can be shown for any effort that may be made to confine the Tariff to revenue duties.","Customs and Excise Tariffs","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[12]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I propose to put before the Committee the testimony of a free-trader who was a member of the first Parliament of the Commonwealth, and who was deservedly respected by all parties in the House. The gentleman in question, Sir William McMillan, who was deputy leader of the Opposition in this House, and has been at all times a free-trader, took part in the Federal referendum campaign, and is reported to have said : -Victoria has been under a protective tariff for many years, and the. result of that protective tariff is that thousands of pounds worth of articles which come in here through our ports never come in through Victorias ports at all, because they are either produced or manufactured in Victoria. Now supposing for one moment that when the Federal Parliament meets, the average tariff of Australia, which may be called the Victorian tariff, is adopted, you will see clearly that this colony (N.S.W.) having been for many years under a free trade system, must take years before it works out the result of a protective system. Even if you introduce a high tariff at once, you will not rush into existence manufactures of .all kinds, and you will not make people produce all kinds of articles which they have hitherto had imported.This expression of opinion on the part of a gentleman whose views are worthy of serious consideration fully corroborates my statement concerning the value of protection. I do not think that any honest politician would attempt to deny its accuracy. There is no reason why we should cavil at such a statement. I am as loyal to New South Wales as is any honorable member, and when I know what protection has done for Victoria I feel that the policy is one that should be applied, not only to New South Wales, but to the whole Commonwealth.

He boldly asserted that the white man could not do the work required in the plantations, and that the industry would be destroyed unless we abandoned the policy which we had initiated. Thereupon, I asked him what wages he paid weekly to white men engaged in the plantations. His reply was Twenty-five shillings. I then inquired,  How long do you employ them ? to which he replied Two or three months. I further asked him, What food do you give them? He gave me the information, and added that they complained of the quality of the food, and even wanted to be supplied with jam. I then asked, What employment do you give them during the remaining nine months of the year ? to which he replied,  No employment whatever. I informed him that there was not a farmer in the eastern and southern States who would not regard himself as a mean man if he offered an agricultural labourer less than 30s. a week with good food at harvest time.","Customs and Excise Tariffs","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[39]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Almost everybody professes to be in favour of the establishment of the iron and steel industry in Australia. Differences of opinion exist as to the means by which it should be established - as to whether it should be encouraged by the granting of a bonus or by the imposition of a protective duty, or as to whether it should be nationalized. But the feeling undoubtedly exists that it ought to Le established, and we know that an attempt has been made to establish it. The honorable member for Parkes is well aware that Lithgow is a place which offers special advantages for the establishment of the iron industry on account of the coal and lime deposits in the vicinity. He also knows that in the past large sums have been expended there in an attempt to establish the iron industry, and that those efforts have failed. . My own opinion is that their failure was due to the fact that a combination of importers had determined that the industry should not be established, and had so contrived to control prices as to crush it out of existence. At Mr. Sandfords works at the present time there is a large stock of pig-iron on hand. Only the other day South Australia wanted a few thousand tons of that class of iron. To secure the order the Sandford Proprietary reduced the cost of that iron to an amount which was only just sufficient to cover its actual production. But what did the importers do? They at once contrived to reduce the price of pig- iron below the cost of production. In order to kill the industry, they actually sold the iron for considerably less than they had sold it for previously, and for less than they have demanded for it since.","Customs and Excise Tariffs","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[55]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We ought to strive by every means in our power - I care not how, so long as the end is attained - to establish this industry within the Commonwealth, and we should not cavil at the amount of the duty. In a national work of this kind if 20 per cent, should not prove enough, we ought to impose 40 per cent., and if that should prove insufficient, then let us charge 100 per cent. ; we ought to impose a duty sufficiently high to give to the people the benefit of the establishment of this industry. I hope, and, indeed, I - am sure that I have been fair to the honorable member with whose remarks I am now dealing. The honorable member said that for the first year of the Tariff the revenue returned would be large, but that in the next year it would decrease, and in the following year would decrease still more, until it amounted to no more than £9,000,000 per annum. Under the Braddon section we are compelled to return to the States three-fourths of the revenue, which, with a total revenue of £9,000,000, would mean £6,750,000, retaining only something like £t. 750, 000 for Federal purposes. On this point, the honorable member absolutely recommended that, even with a revenue of £9,000,000, we should return to the States £7,250,000 or £1,000,000 more than they are at present receiving. His ground for this recommendation is that the present return is not enough to enable the States to meet their financial demands ; and he pointed out that £7,250,000 is the amount required to meet the interest on the debts.","Customs and Excise Tariffs","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[56]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is all very well to be generous, but the Commonwealth Parliament was established for the purpose of achieving a great national ideal. One great and important duty laid upon us is to defend the Commonwealth against aggression. The honorable member for Flinders recognised the necessity for effective defence, and also admitted that the time might come when there would have to be railway communication connecting all the States. But what did the honorable member propose in order that these great works may be carried out? Did he suggest that we should depend on our own resources? No. He suggested that we should follow the bad example of the States in the past_, and by resorting to the money market lay a further burden of interest on the people. The Commonwealth Parliament, at its very inception, rightly determined that the Commonwealth should live within its revenue - that the people of Australia, and those who import goods, should provide the necessary moneys for the carrying out of Commonwealth undertakings. In my opinion, the sentiments expressed on this point by the honorable member for Flinders were not patriotic; and I must say that I expected something better from him than a recommendation to adopt a borrowing policy. If his suggestion were carried out, it would mean that the Commonwealth would acknowledge itself as subordinate to the States ; and that is not what the Commonwealth was created for - it was created to be supreme. The people of Australia were dissatisfied with the States Parliaments, and they determined that the greater national undertakings and works should be under the control of a central authority.Colonel Foxton. - Only as to a limited number of subjects.","Customs and Excise Tariffs","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[57]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We should not be just to the people of Australia if we acted towards the States in the manner suggested by the honorable member for Flinders. If we were to return to the States even twice as much of the revenue as we return to them now, the result would not be economy within the States, but only greater extravagance than in the past. In connexion with this phase of the question I should like to give a few figures relating more particularly to New South Wales, with the public life of which State I have been connected for over a quarter oT a century. When Federation was initiated the indebtedness of theStates amounted to .£201,580,185, of which New South Wales was responsible for £63, 774,14$. The interest on the whole of the indebtedness amounted to £7,254,948 per annum, the amount, as I observed before, which the honorable member for Flinders urged should be returned to the States out of the prospective reduced revenue of ,£9,000,000. Since Federation the State of New South Wales has increased her indebtedness by £21,867,587, while the indebtedness of the rest of Australia has been increased by £20,000,000 odd, a total of £41,000,000 odd. The interest on the additional debt of the whole of Australia is practically £1,500,000, of which .£774,772 is borne by New South Wales. In pre-Federation days, when New South Wales had to bear the burden of the Post and Telegraphs, and other Departments which have since been transferred to the Commonwealth, she could live, and live well, with a revenue -of £9,000,000. That State, however, was continually borrowing,  and although, since Federation was established the revenue has increased by ,£2,000,000, her finances are still in the same condition as before, and no attempt whatever .is made in the direction of retrenchment. Why should the Commonwealth return more revenue to New South Wales, seeing that, while several costly Departments have been transferred, the revenue of the State is ;£i 1,000,000-?Colonel Foxton. - The position of New South Wales is not typical of the other States.","Customs and Excise Tariffs","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[60]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

But in this connexion it should be clearly recognised that we are dealing not with one subject, but with two very large questions. If a separate debate had taken place upon the Tariff, it would have terminated within a week. Personally. I dp not think that the time which has been spent in discussing the Budget and the Tariff has been altogether wasted. We must recognise that the financial proposals of the Government constitute the crux of the situation. I do not intend to deal at any length with those proposals, but I do think - notwithstanding the criticism which has been levelled against us in regard to the length of the debate - that every member should be prepared to state his position and to emphasize any points which require emphasis without being open to the accusation that he is wasting time. Before I deal with the Tariff proposals, I should like to refer to certain remarks of the honorable member for Riverina in regard to the Queensland sugar industry. I think that he has entirely misunderstood the position which I took up by means of interjections from this side of the Chamber. He distinctly led us to suppose that in Queensland there was a large number of people who were not only in favour of black labour, but who desired to revert to the old system of kidnapping - of unregulated black labour. I say that if representation in Parliament means anything, the people of Queensland have conclusively shown that they are opposed to black labour in any form. That State returned to this House, at the last election, a large majority of representatives belonging to the party which made the abolition of black labour its election cry. It is idle to deny it.Doubtless some of us thought that the industry could not be carried on by means of white labour, even if it were protected. But in holding that belief we were wrong. It has Been proved that white men - at any rate south of Mackay can perform the work required of them in the cane-fields. As long as the industry receives protection, and as long as it can hold our home market, all may be well. But I do not think that Queensland should feel under any particular obligation to the Commonwealth. I do not think that she should be taunted with having received a special benefit in the form of the sugar bounty. It must be recognised that the industry was of enormous importance to the State. It had been carried on for years. After Federation was accomplished the people of Australia, in the interests of the nation, said,  We must abolish the black labour which enables you to compete with the rest of the world. Surely under such circumstances it was only fair that the same people should say to Queensland,  We do not intend to destroy your industry, and therefore we propose to grant you special consideration. I admit that the Commonwealth has not treated Queensland ungenerously in this matter, but I object to certain honorable members taunting that State with- the special treatment which the sugar industry has received.","Customs and Excise Tariffs","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I have already told the Committee that I am pledged to a fiscal truce. But, personally, I am quite prepared to grant to industries such a measure of protection as will equalize the wages paid in foreign countries and those paid in Australia. It seems to me that, if we deal with dumping, the natural protection which our industries enjoy should be sufficient to adequately protect them. If we go further than that, it appears to me that for the sake of a few operatives and manufacturers we shall be taxing thousands. The honorable member for Riverina appears to be absolutely mad upon the question of protection. He declares that when once we initiate a system of protective duties it does not matter if we levy imposts amounting to hundreds per cent.

The country is indebted to those honorable members who took the trouble to go into the question very fully - the honorable member for. Flinders and the honorable member for Kooyong amongst others - and who raised the debate to what I consider a distinctly high plane. I do not agree with the accusation made against those honorable members, that they went out of their way to raise the feelings of the States against the Commonwealth. As to States rights, if an honorable member on this side ventures to say a word in their defence, he is immediately charged with disloyalty to the Federation.- I see no justification for any such accusation, because when we speak of States rights, we are not referring so much to. the Premier or Government of a particular State, as to the people of the State, who, it must be remembered, are also our electors. If by any action of the Commonwealth Parliament we make it imperative for a State Government to impose heavy burdens on their people, it is we who must be held responsible. At the time of the Premiers. .Conference at Brisbane* most of  the newspapers of Queensland took, perhaps, a rather narrow attitude in connexion with the relations of the Commonwealth and the States. But one particular newspaper, which has great influence in Queensland, took the view that, as the Federal Parliament necessarily had complete control of taxation, would it not be better, instead of making a fuss and raising ill-feeling to simply take the view that the State electors were also the electors of the Federal Parliament, and so throw the whole onus of the situation on that Parliament ; that if we were the cause of extra burdens on the people, we should be called to account. In my opinion, that was a good position to take up ; because, as I said before, when we on this side offer any criticism as to the attitude of the Commonwealth Government towards the States, we are not dealing with a State in its governmental aspect, but with the people of the State whom we represent, and who are also State electors. The honorable member for Riverina, speaking of the States debts, said he was perfectly satisfied that when the Constitution was framed it was intended that at the end of j910 the Commonwealth should take the whole of the Customs and Excise revenue. The honorable member contended that there was no intention that any portion of that revenue should then be returned to the States, or used for the payment of interest on the States debts; but that, on the other hand, the Commonwealth should take the whole of the money, and use it for Commonwealth purposes, leaving the States to do as best they could. When I heard that remark I procured some figures, in order to arrive at some idea as to what would be the financial position of the States if that idea of the honorable member for Riverina were carried out. I have not yet had time to look at the figures, and, therefore, do not know how they will bear on my argument; but I think they will be worth recording. Let us suppose that the ten years had expired in 1905-6, when the general revenue of Queensland, exclusive of the three-fourths of Customs and Excise from the Commonwealth, was £2,996,475. The threefourths which it received from the Commonwealth in that year amounted to £857,048. The expenditure on administration, &c, excluding interest on the debts, was £2,178,831, while the interest was ,£1,546.881. Excluding from the revenue the three-fourths of the Customs revenue returned, the figures show that Queensland would have been left with a deficit of .£729,237. The idea of the honorable member for Riverina in regard to the retention of the whole of the revenue by the Commonwealth may, for all I know, obtain pretty freely on the other side. I would impress upon the Committee that had the course indicated been followed in 1905-6, Queensland would have had a deficit of about three-quarters of a million. In making such suggestions, honorable members display an utter want of appreciation of our responsibilities to those who, after all, are Federal as well as States electors, and so give rise to the talk of secession which we are all so sorry to hear. They should be more guarded in their statements.","Customs and Excise Tariffs","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[21]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

When the honorable member for Flinders was discussing the transfer of the States debts the honorable member for South Sydney, whose views must certainly be taken into serious account, interjected in a way that indicated a belief on his part that if the Commonwealth took over the debts of the States it should also take over the assets representing those debts. The honorable member for Flinders said that it was intended that we should burden ourselves with the interest on the States debts as existing at the inception of the Commonwealth, and that this burden was to be taken on our shoulders as against the enormous revenue from Customs and Excise with which we were invested. The honorable member for South Sydney then interjected in the form of a question -We were to take all the liabilities, leaving the States all the assets?Later on, when the honorable member for Flinders said that the Commonwealth had been granted under the Constitution what this year represented a revenue of between £10,000,000 and ,£11,000,000, and inquired, Surely that is an asset? the honorable member for South Sydney interjected, If it is, it is a very secondary one. Apparently the honorable member does not consider that the power to impose Customs and Excise taxation is a very considerable asset. The honorable member for Flinders went on to say that if it were not a substantial asset he did not know what was, and the leader of the Labour Party replied -But the States, according to the honorable member, are to keep what the debts represent.The report continues -","Customs and Excise Tariffs","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[22]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

He would expect to have handed over to the Commonwealth railways, irrigation works, and also, in many cases, works undertaken by local authorities on which borrowed money had been spent. In other words, the honorable member appears to favour unification. It would be impossible for the Commonwealth to assume the control of all local works, as suggested by the leader of the Labour Party, without at the same time undertaking the whole management of the States. That, I think, is absolutely out of the question. It is not provided for in the Constitution. We are endowed with certain powers, and we cannot go beyond them. I fail to understand how the honorable member could take up such a position. Another point which ought to be remembered in this connexion is that, although a railway may originally have cost £1,000,000, its value to the State to-day is much in excess of that sum. I have here a table showing that, from 1901-2 to 1905-6, the return on capital invested in the State railways of Queensland, was as follows : - 1901-2, £1 8s. 8d. per cent..; i9°2-3> £1 i2S- per cent.; 1903-4, £2 is. id. per cent. ; 1904-5, £2 10s. 2d. per cent. ; and 1905-6, £2 16s. 5d. per cent. It will thus foe seen that the return is gradually increasing. What would be the position in regard to a Queensland State railway, constructed ten years ago at a. cost of £1,000,000, and the earnings of which had averaged 1½ per cent, below the rate which would pay interest and redemption? That deficit would have been made good from year to year out of the pockets of the people of Queensland, and would represent a total of £150,000 in respect of the ten years period. In other words, such a railway which the honorable member for South Sydney would take over as an asset, representing the original debt of £1,000,000, would have cost Queensland £1,150,000. Many of the railways of Queensland were constructed thirty years ago, and have shown a heavy deficit, although I am glad to say that that deficit is gradually becoming less. In the case of a railway constructed twenty years ago, at a cost of £1,000,000, and worked at an average loss of 2 per cent., Queensland would have had to pay £400,000 to make good that deficit.","Customs and Excise Tariffs","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/interjection[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

When the States went on the London money market to raise their loans the moneylenders did not know to what purpose the money was to be devoted. No mention was made of any special asset. The only asset that the money-lenders wanted was the taxable capacity of the people. That >s the only asset of value to those who lend money to a Government. What has happened from time to time in connexion with various republics in South America to whom money has been loaned by European countries? Whenever any difficulty has been experienced in securing the payment of interest or principal no attempt has been made to take possession of the defaulting country or its public works. The control of its Customs and Excise Department has simply been taken over, and in that way satisfaction has been secured. In the case of national debts the Customs and Excise revenues constitute the only asset. The arguments advanced! by the honorable member for South Sydney and others that, if .the Commonwealth took: over the debts of the States it should also take over the material assets representing those debts is, as I have said, a fallacious one, and seems to be simply a proposal that we should work towards unification.","Customs and Excise Tariffs","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I differ from that view, but cast no reproach upon him. The argument used by the Labour Party that we should take over the assets, as well as the debts of the States, would seem to show that the majority of that party are working towards unification. They have a perfect right to do so if they can induce the people to fall into line behind them, but they should make it clearly known that that is their Intention. The people as a whole do not realize that it is. As to the general financial question, I may say at once that there are many honorable members experienced in national- finance who are much better able to deal with it than I am, and therefore I do not propose to discuss it. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie said that the right honorable member for Swan, and others on his side of the House who claim to be in favour of old-age pensions, but refuse to vote for a Federal land tax, were hypocrites. I interjected at the time, because I felt that, if the whip cut the right honorable member for Swan, it also cut me. I realize that a system of old-age pensions, to be effective, must necessarily be a Federal one, in order that the disability in respect of state residential qualifications, under which many deserving men and women labour, may be removed. I am not prepared, however, to say that the Federal Parliament should resort, at the present time, at all events, to direct taxation. Whilst it was absolutely right that the national Parliament should be given every power of taxation, since upon it was thrust the whole responsibility of the nation, at the same time it was distinctly stated at the different Conventions, and understood by the people, that the Commonwealth was to rely upon the Customs and Excise duties for its revenue, leaving direct taxation to the States.","Customs and Excise Tariffs","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The States have already had to avail themselves of it. In Queensland we have an income tax, in addition to a land tax, imposed by the local governing authorities, and it seems to me that the State will yet have to resort more fully to that method of raising revenue. If the Commonwealth took over the debts of the States as at the inception of Federation, and had to pay the interest upon them out of the three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue now returned to the States, the States themselves would still have to contract further liabilities. It is all very well for the representatives of the smaller States, which are more densely populated than are the others, to talk of paying for new works out of revenue ; but they should not lose sight of the fact that the larger States have a vast and a rich territory to open up by means of railways and other works - railways which for a great many years will not pay interest. It is impossible to develop the country by the expenditure of revenue alone. Therefore, the States must borrow, and paying interest on the borrowed money and not having power to raise indirect taxation, must impose direct taxation.","Customs and Excise Tariffs","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If manufacturers are to be at the mercy of an irresponsible board, and to be interfered with at every turn, investors will put their money into industries in other countries where the conditions are more favorable to a profitable return.

I think that, perhaps, something might be done in the direction of cheapening the telegraph rates for press messages. In that way it may be possible to induce the newspapers, especially those in other States, to devote a little more space to the proceedings of this Parliament. To my mind, it is not a desirable thing that in all the States capitals the proceedings of the States Parliaments should occupy more space in the daily newspapers than is devoted to the proceedings of the national Parliament. But I rose chiefly to add my voice to the warning which has been sounded by the honorable member for Flinders in regard to the want of financial policy on the part of the Government. I am willing to admit, with the honorable member for Gippsland, that under ordinary circumstances the Opposition would not be justified in asking the Government to outline their financial policy two years in advance. But under the special circumstances which obtain - and knowing as we do the policy of honorable members who occupy the Labour corner - this Committee is warranted in asking the Government to give honorable members some indication of their position in regard to Federal and State finance. We must recollect that we have to face a steady increase in, Commonwealth expenditure. I do not say that there has been any extravagance on the part of the Commonwealth. But, irrespective of whether or not there has been extravagance, we cannot ignore the fact that we have to face a steady increase of expenditure, which the Government ought to tell us how they propose to finance. In every Department we find the same thing. In many instances I admit that this increased expenditure is necessary. Perhaps it is necessary in every case. Upon looking through the Budget, I confess that I cannot, at the moment, point to any instance in which I think the expenditure should be reduced. But the fact that the increased expenditure is necessary does not make the position less serious, and it certainly behoves the Government, who, I understand, are not in favour of direct taxation--","Customs and Excise Tariffs","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

At the end of 19 10 we shall be face to face with the problem of whether the Braddon section shall be discontinued, and, if not, what shall be substituted for it. As a matter of fact, we are face to face with that problem now, because we must find the solution of it within the next two years. So long as the expenditure of the Commonwealth Government means a reduction in the amounts which the States Treasurers have to spend, so long will captious criticism be levelled at our expenditure - criticism which is not in the best interests either of the States or of the Federation. The honorable member for Gippsland criticised the proposals of the honorable member for Flinders in regard to the reduction of our expenditure, but neglected to suggest anything better as a substitute. I do not agree with the suggestion that we should reduce the increments, which were practically promised by the Commonwealth, to the younger officers of our public service. The Commonwealth and the Departments under its control ought not to be conducted in the way that many mercantile and business enterprises are being conducted. We hear a good deal of talk about our declining birthrate, about the need which exists for increasing our population and for encouraging immigration, but, to my mind, there is a very serious state of affairs when we find that many of our financial institutions - instead of encouraging their employes to settle down in life - are doing all that they can to prevent it. As a matter of fact, many - if not all - of the banks carrying, on business in Australia have inserted in the agreements with their employes a clause which forbids them to marry until they are in receipt of a salary of at least £200 per annum.","Customs and Excise Tariffs","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

There is scarcely a bank carrying on business in Australia at the present time in which any employé in the ordinary course of events can get married before he has reached thirty years of age. Some employes are almost grey-haired men before they are in receipt of the salaries stipulated by their employers as the minimum. We do not want that condition of affairs to be reproduced in our Federal enterprises. We ought to see that young men in the Commonwealth service who serve us faithfully are in a position to look forward, within a reasonable time, to settling down in life and acquiring homes of their own. The honorable, member for Riverina made a very peculiar suggestion in regard to the adjustment of the future relations of the Commonwealth to the States. Of course it is very easy - if we look only at one side of the picture - to suggest a remedy for the difficulty. But the remedy suggested by the honorable member would land every State of the Commonwealth in hopeless bankruptcy so far as its own finances are concerned. His suggestion is that at the end of 1910 we shall quietly absorb the whole of the Customs and Excise revenue without returning any to the States. He has pointed out that New South Wales possesses a very big surplus, and that the Government of that State propose to reduce taxation. He adds that the New South Wales Parliament can impose a little more taxation to make up the deficiency which would be caused by theCommonwealth appropriating the whole of the Customs and Excise revenue. It might be possible, though I think it would be extremely difficult, for New South Wales, by a great stretch of her powers of taxation, to meet her financial necessities without any sum being returned to her by the Commonwealth. We must remember that, in 1906-7, the Commonwealth returned to New South Wales £3,022,351, and out of that money, if we like to put it so, the State had a surplus of £1,493,322. But the proposal of the honorable member for Riverina would mean that New South Wales, instead of having a surplus of about £1,500,000, would have a deficiency of about £500,000.. Last year, Victoria received from the Commonwealth £2,192,340, and that State had a surplus of £812,406, but the proposal of the honorable member would mean that Victoria would have a deficiency of over £1,250,000. In Queensland, where £942,569 was received from the Commonwealth, and where there was a surplus °f ;£396,5, the proposal would mean a deficiency of at least £546,000. In South Australia, where the amount received from the Commonwealth was £645,121, and where there was a surplus . of about £300,000 - I have not the exact figures - there would be, instead of a surplus, a deficiency of about £345,000. In Tasmania, where £262,293 were received from the Commonwealth, and there was a surplus of £70,060, there would be a deficiency of about £200,000 ; while in Western Australia, where £755,846 was received from the Federation, and where there was a deficiency of £88,728, the proposal would mean the still greater deficiency of over £840,000. A proposal of the kind needs only to be stated iri order to show its absolute impossibility. Another proposal is made by the Labour Party, who tell us straight out that they desire direct taxation- that if there be any deficiency it ought to be made up by resorting to that method of raising revenue. We can understand a proposal, of that sort, but what we wish to know is whether the proposal is indorsed by the Government. We desire to know, as I said before, whether the Government indorse the statement of the Acting Prime Minister -in favour of a land tax, or whether they indorse the statement. of the Prime Minister against a land tax, and, if the latter, what the Government propose to do with reference to the finances of the States and the Commonwealth.","Customs and Excise Tariffs","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Without going over the arguments so ably put forward by the honorable member for Illawarra, I agree with him that at the last election the fiscal question was not properly before the electors. In New South Wales, at any rate, the issue was distinctly as between the policy propounded by the leader of the Opposition and the policy outlined by the honorable member for South Sydney. In none of the New South Wales electorates, with the exception of the two represented by Ministers, were there Ministerial candidates. Except in the Cowper electorate the honorable member who now represents that constituency fought the election as a protectionist, and stated that he was for anti-Socialism, as did also the Minister nf Trade and Customs. Similar conditions prevailed in nearly every other State; the real issue throughout the Commonwealth was not as between Mr. Deakin and Mr. Watson, but between- Mr. Reid and Mr. Watson. That was so even in Victoria, or otherwise how can we account for the fact that so many Victorian members sit on this side, while the Government benches are so sparsely occupied? No one will, I think, deny that honorable members who dictate the policy of the Government were not elected on the fiscal issue. The honorable and learned member for West Sydney - shall I say the lonely member? - likened himself to Macaulays New Zealander ; and it is well sometimes to be able to choose ones own simile. I might have suggested, however, had the honorable and learned member been present, that, perhaps, a pelican in the wilderness might have been abetter illustration. At any rate, the honorable and learned member admit ted that he was not elected on the fiscal issue. It was, to my mind, very strange that the honorable and learned gentleman should be at such pains to object, and show such heat in objecting, to the conduct of the right honorable leader of the Opposition, when he ad,mittedly had pursued a similar course in his own electorate. He pointed out that so far as he was concerned he fought on the labour issue, and sunk his free-trade principles. The honorable and learned member, by some curious mental gymnastics, tried to show that the right honorable member for East Sydney was responsible for  the Tariff. However, it is still a fact that, so long as honorable members in the Labour corner vote to keep this Government in power, they must share the responsibility for the legislation introduced by Ministers.","Customs and Excise Tariffs","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I wish to remind honorable members that although we may protect the secondary producer - or, in » other words, the manufacturer - from the results and the products of cheap, labour we cannot protect the primary producer in the same manner. We may tax mining machinery, but we cannot alter the price of gold, silver, copper, tin, or even of iron - honorable members of the Labour Party seem to take a keen interest in iron - upon the markets of the world, and it is in the outside markets that our primary producers find their largest customers. We must remember also that there are many low grade ores- which are being worked on so small a margin of profit that the scale is likely to be turned by a very small additional outlay. The Government have shown an almost criminal negligence of the mining industry by imposing heavy taxation upon the machinery used in connexion with it. We cannot increase the price of coal upon the markets of the world, but the Government are trying, by means of taxation, to make it as difficult as .possible for our coal miners to carry on operations. All the miners requisites - the safety lamp, upon which his life depends; the powder and the tools which he uses ; as well as his food and clothing are taxed. After we have done all this we say to the miners, * You are at liberty to compete with others if you can. Our farmers have to compete with the wheat of Russia and America, and it is of immense importance to us as a nation that we should secure the markets before the Russians learn to apply modern methods and modern machinery to the great steppes which are part of the wheat producing areas of the world. Our farmers, by reason of their distance from the markets of the qld world, by reason of droughts and the expenses of haulage and freight, are at present severely handicapped, and the proposals of the Government to subject them to increased taxation, although within the last twelve months for the benefit of Hugh McKay and men of that ilk, they have increased the duty upon agricultural machinery, show an absolute want of consideration for them. The attitude of the Ministry towards other industries is the same.

That seems to be a very simple way out of the difficulty, and if I could go with the Labour Party in that direction, I should do so. But the proposal to pile on taxation merely for the purpose of depreciating the value of any ones property seems to me to savour of class legislation.","Customs and Excise Tariffs","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/continue[17]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

456,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BOWDEN, Eric","JRH","N/A","N/A","N/A",3203,"- As I have already stated, a graduated land tax would be an easy way of removing some of pur financial difficulties, if it were a fair way ; but the fact that it has been proposed, not to obtain revenue, but, as has been said, to burst up the big estates, shows that it is wrong in principle. Even if, as is contended, the State has created the values which it is proposed to tax, it must be remembered that the owners of the land paid for the properties in respect to which those values exist, and to set about to depreciate them in order that they might be resumed for less than their  true market value would be confiscation. The honorable thing to do is what the Governments of the States have done - resume at market values land needed for closer settlement, re-selling it to the people. The transactions of the New South Wales Government in connexion with the resumption and sub-division of four large estates have been very profitable, the profit running into a great . many pounds, and homes have been provided for a great many people. We must all admit that manufacturing adds to the wealth of a. community ; but the experience of other lands shows that the wealth thus created tends to accumulate in a few hands, and that the concentration of population in towns creates commercial crises and other difficulties. There are also the troubles connected with the introduction of laboursaving machinery. Machinery is every day becoming more important in connexion with manufactures, lessening the value of human brains, skill, and effort. Within the last fifty years it has in many industries enabled employers to dispense with skilled artizans, and to engage women and children for what have become merely mechanical occupations. These difficulties extend over a larger sphere than is embraced by the fiscal problem. But the point .which I wish to emphasize is that protection accentuates rather than diminishes them. While I am not attempting to depreciate the value of manufactures to a country, I feel bound to point out that it is becoming more and more recognised that a nations strength and stability, its prosperity and happiness, depend more largely upon its rural than upon its urban population. The effect of the Tariff will be to bolster up secondary at the expense of primary industries. The honorable member for South Sydney and his followers claim to particularly represent and have in charge the interest of the working classes. I deny that they have a monopoly of such workers. They are in no sense the mouthpiece of all workers, unless it be of such workers as are members of trades unions. The Tariff, instead of helping the working man, must injure him by decreasing the purchasing power of his money. Lists which have been published in the newspapers show that the Tariff has had the effect of considerably reducing the purchasing power of money, so that what formerly could be bought for j£i now costs 23s. The difference may not seem much to some honorable members, but it is considerable to those who have only a small margin to live on. In New South Wales we made a strong fight to secure a free breakfast table for the people, and having won the battle of free-trade, it was a. great sacrifice to forego the fruits of victory in order that Federation might be accomplished. In doing so, free-traders recognised that the fiscal contest must be fought again on a new battle field. According to the honorable member for South Sydney, the price list issued by Messrs. Anthony Hordern and Sons, Sydney, shows that since the new Tariff was brought in there has been little or no increase in the cost of what are necessaries to the working men. According to one statement which he made, there has been an increase only in regard, to treacle. He forgot to point out that that firm, and others whose lists he quoted, are honorably fulfilling their promise not to increase their prices until the stocks which they laid in prior to the imposition of the Tariff are exhausted. The other day the Civil Service Cooperative Society of New South Wales published a new price slip, on which this note appears -The new Federal Tariff, if passed in its present form, will have the effect of altering the majority of prices in the catalogue recently issued, but shareholders and customers are assured that prices will not be advanced until it is compulsory to do so.That note was placed at the head of a list which they issued to their shareholders. Under this new Tariff, almost every article which the working man has to buy - his food and his clothes, for example - are taxed ; consequently their price will be increased. Many industries which it is proposed to bolster up by increased duties were doing very well under the old Tariff. The woollen industry was in a flourishing condition. The Acting Prime Minister chanced to make a reference to the Parramatta Woollen Mills a few days ago. I happen to be a shareholder in those mills, and I am perfectly satisfied with their prospects - although I have not had a dividend for some time.","Customs and Excise Tariffs","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/continue[19]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Mr. Sparke one of the leaders of the protectionist movement in New South Wales, explained to the shareholders that the business had been absolutely mismanaged. As a matter of fact, the former manager was discharged, and Mr. Sparke was appointed in his stead on account of the mismanagement which had taken place. Mr. Sparke showed the shareholders very many instances in which goods had been sold by contract for actually less than the cost of producing them, without allowing anything for the ordinary warehouse charges. It was pointed out that one contract had been accepted for the supply of 5,000 rugs to the New South Wales Railways  Commissioners. Honorable members who travel backwards and forwards to Sydney each week are still enjoying the comfort of those rugs. They are very good articles indeed. They cost 23s. each to make, exclusive of the warehouse charges, and they were delivered to the Railways Commissioners for 17s. each.

There is one matter that we must not forget, namely, that while New South Wales has been a free-trade State for the past twenty-five or thirty years, Victoria has been a protectionist State during that time. Those who worshipped the fetish of high protection in Victoria predicted that this State would become the working-mans paradise and the hub of Australia.

I notice that in the Tariff there are several items which have been transferred from an ad valorem duty to a measurement duty - to a duty of so much per cubic foot, outside measurement. Not being very well acquainted with the way in which these articles are imported, I made it my business to find out how the proposed duties will affect some industries, and what they really represent. One item, which the women of Australia will require very shortly, is preserving jars. There are a few made in Australia, but the local supply is not equal to the demand, and, further, those that are made here are not satisfactory, because they are not absolutely air-tight. Under the old Tariff there was a duty of 20 per cent., whereas under the new Tariff the duty is is. id. per cubic foot. I have made inquiries, and I find that, whereas the old duty on a shipment which Cost £14 is. id. amounted to £2 14s. 8d., under the new rate of is. per. cubic foot the duty on a similar consignment is £7 4s. 8d., or nearly 70 per cent, increase. That is a very big increase in the duty on articles which are so much required. Then on patent tin-top jelly jars and similar glassware, which is brought principally from America, where it is made wholesale by machinery, the old duty of 20 per cent, on a consignment which cost £5 6s. 3d. was £1 5s. nd., whereas under the new rate of 2s. per cubic foot the duty amounts to £8, or about 1.15 per cent.","Customs and Excise Tariffs","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/continue[28]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

On stoneware, such as bread crocks, there was no duty in New South Wales before Federation, and the whole of the market was supplied by one local manufacturer. The Federal Parliament, in its wisdom, generously made that gentleman a present of a duty of 20 per cent. , and, although under free-trade he had so far succeeded as to crowd out all his competitors, he promptly raised the price. It is now proposed to increase the duty by 10 per cent., in order, I suppose, that he may add a little more to his profits.Four sets of soiled linen baskets were brought to Australia by the Empire, and the duty paid was 19s. id.","Customs and Excise Tariffs","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/continue[29]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I have already pointed out that the duty paid on these baskets is 19s. id., and that, added to the freight, makes a total impost of nearly 135 per cent. Then waste-paper baskets per set are charged duties which equal respectively 242 per cent, and 322 per cent. There is only one other item in the Tariff to which I desire to refer, and that is the inexplicable duty of 7s, 6d. each on chairs. We know that the local manufacture of Vienna chairs, and of the cheaper lines of American chairs, is impossible, since we have not supplies of wood suitable for the purpose. Chairs were already protected to the extent of between 35 per cent. and 50 per cent, by the duty, freight, and charges under the old Tariff. The impost of 7s. 6d. per chair is absolutely prohibitive. I do not like Austrian chairs, and have very few in my house, but they are largely used by the favorite friends of the Postmaster-General, the working people. As an example of the magnitude of this burden I propose to quote figures supplied to me by Messrs. W. W. Campbell and Co. Ltd.-, in reference to a certain shipment. They have now arriving 303 dozen of these chairs. When they were ordered, under the old rate of duty, the firm would have had to pay, and were prepared to pay, an impost of £108, but under the new Tariff they will have to pay a duty amounting to no less than £1,363. At the time of the declaration of the Tariff hundreds of cases were on the water. These will be forced into bond, and either, as in the case of a shipment of bicycles, will be reshipped to the port of origin, or, perhaps, as one firm has offered to do, will be burnt on the wharfs. This is protection run mad ; there is no other way in which to describe it. The proposal of the leader of the Labour Party, which he describes as the  new protection, is, to my mind, an absolute acknowledgment that so far, at all events, as the workers are concerned, protection in itself is a failure. It fails to benefit them or to- improve their conditions. It is a matter of common history that although protection as a rule increases the wealth of the community, it puts that increased wealth into the pockets of the few. We are told that such a state of affairs is not to continue ; But the proposal to regulate prices seems to me £0 be absolutely unworkable. It is by no means a new proposition. The experiment has been tried in different forms from almost the commencement of civilization. In the days of one of the Edwards - I think it was Edward I. - a. law -was passed to limit the charge for eggs to is. per dozen, and when we remember the difference between the purchasing power of money then and now, that was a fairly high rate to fix. The proposal put forward by the Labour Part}7, however, is not likely, in my opinion, to help the consumer. The honorable member for South Sydney, and the honorable member for Boothby, admitted that goods could not be followed until they reached the hands of the retailer with the object of insuring that the consumer should not be charged more than a reasonable rate for them. The honorable member for Boothby said he proposed to see that a fair charge was made for goods as they left the hands of the manufacturer. We can see at once how easy it would be to overcome such a scheme. It would be an easy matter to do what is done at the present time - to introduce a third party, or middleman, to whom the manufacturer would sell at a reasonable price. This third party might consist of a company run by the manufacturers themselves. They might sell at a reasonable price to the middleman, and take their chief profit from his sales instead of from the sales of the factory. So far as I can see the proposal will not work. We admit that protection, if high enough, will create a certain quantity of work for a certain number of people. I suppose pine apples could be grown at the South Pole if a demand could be created for them there, and a sufficiently high duty to bring up the prices could be imposed. The point that I wish to emphasize is that under a protective policy we take much from the pockets of the multitude - from the consuming classes - for the sake of benefiting the few. In an effort to bolster up a few industries we are taxing the whole of the general community. There is another matter to which I desire to refer. So much has been said upon the subject of the Federal Capital, from which it might be inferred that the Premier of New South Wales is responsible for the present position, that I thought it might be of interest to the Committee, as well as to the public generally, to show the action of the present Government since the Bill dealing with this question was passed. I find that on the 19th October, 1905, the honorable member for Parramatta asked the Prime Minister whether he was - in a position to give the House information concerning the recent conference between the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth and the Attorney-General of New South Wales in reference to the Federal Capital site ?He added -I should like to know generally what the Government propose to do in regard to this matter ?The Prime Minister replied -I have no memorandum to lay before theHouse, but the Attorney-General has prepared a letter in which is set forth our view of the legal questions raised during the conference between him and the Attorney-General of New South Wales. It will be posted this afternoon, and will be delivered to-morrow morning. The discussion narrowed the question at issue to such an extent that I think that this statement of our views, and the reply to it, will probably close the correspondence preparatory to the introduction of a Bill into this Chamber.On the 26th October, 1905, the honorable member for Parramatta again asked the Prime Minister if he were yet able to inform . the House of the course which the Government intended to take with regard to the Federal Capital Site question. The Prime Minister replied -The letter laid on the table on Tuesday was a communication arranged to be sent by the Attorney-General to the Attorney-General of New South Wales. We have received a telegram from the latter, saying that he has transferred the matter to the Premier, who will reply to our letter. His answer has not yet reached us. The probability is that we shall follow the procedure suggested . . . introducing a Bill to permit of the survey referred to.","Customs and Excise Tariffs","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/continue[35]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In order that we may keep faith with New South Wales, the selected site should be somewhere near to the 100-mile limit.

I would rather have that question settled, because I believe that it would do much to allay the irritation which is felt in New South Wales against this Government. The honorable member for Cook wanted to know my views upon the question of protecting the iron industry. I regard the iron industry from a stand-point quite other than that of a mere Tariff issue. The money we expend in establishing it will be spent, not for the advantage of any one individual, but as an insurance from a defence stand-point, in order that we may have in the time of need those things which are absolutely essential for our defence.","Customs and Excise Tariffs","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/continue[16]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

One is ready to admit a certain amount of unconscious bias, but I have looked at the matter fairly and squarely,- and the reasons I have given are those which have actuated me, and would still have actuated me if Lithgow had not been in the Nepean electorate. On the question of defence we are simply drifting we know not where. We are living over what may be described as a live volcano. After the expiration of seven years, when the Anglo-Japanese Treaty will have expired, we do not know at what moment we may be called upon to fight for our national existence. That is the aspect from which I view this industry. It is absolutely essential that we should have somewhere in Australia a means of turning our native ores into iron in order that we may have the necessary means of defence. I do not understand the attitude of the Government. They have proposed a duty for every other industry. But in this case they defer the duty pending the payment of a bounty. The only reason they could give for that attitude would be that they want to see the industry established first, but it has been already established, so much so that it is able, if it gets the orders, to turn out enough pig-iron to supply the whole of the Commonwealth. There is no question as to the quality of the iron, which is admitted to. be equal, if not superior, to the best that we can import. I noticed in the Herald of yesterday an account of an interview with Messrs. Dallimore Brothers, ironfounders, of South Melbourne, who were asked to express their opinion about the Australian iron that they are now using. They had nothing but praise for it. They said-  It is of first-class quality ; better than theEnglish iron, and at least equal to the Scotch, which is the best iron imported.And the price?  The Australian iron is cheaper than the English, which is cheaper again than the Scotch. But may I give you an instance of local appreciation of the Australian iron.?By all means.  Well, one of our clients, Mr. Taylor, the cement-pipe manufacturer, likes the Lithgow iron so well that hs has offered to pay £1 per ton more for his castings if we make them of Lithgow metal.That testimony comes from Victoria, which cannot be., regarded as . biased in favour, of any New South Wales industry. Recently the South Australian Government called for tenders for 5,000 tons of pig iron. Mr. Sandford tendered for the contract. . We are face to face with the fact that since the successful inauguration of the blast furnaces at Lithgow the price of pig iron by one means and another has been brought down on the Australian market. We can see that it is to the interests of the outside manufacturers that they should crush the local industry .","Customs and Excise Tariffs","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/continue[17]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We know that the Sydney market quite lately was flooded by a shipment of Bengal iron. I wish to point out, in connexion with this matter, that the successful tenderers for the South Australian iron were a firm who have to do largely with shipping and importing, and who, during a certain season of the year, are able to import pig iron as stiffening and ballast at a very low freight indeed. I am told, though I have not been able absolutely to verify the statement, that there is a clause in the agreement to the effect that if this Parliament imposes the 12½ per cent, duty that is proposed in the Tariff, the South Australian Government, and not the importer, will bear the expense of the duty. It works out in this way that if the 12½ per cent, duty is added to the price quoted by the successful tenderer for this iron, the Lithgow tender would be about 5s. per ton less than the tender of the other people.","Customs and Excise Tariffs","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/continue[18]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

But, since we have established the industry, and are within£100,000 of the limit of ourexpenditure, it seems to me that, in the circumstances, it might, perhaps, be better to impose the 12½ per cent, duty asked for in the first instance. In considering this matter, we must remember that, although in England a considerable number of women are employed at the lighter labour in iron works, in Australia we have not, and I hope never will have, any female labour employed in the industry. It is true that we employ a few youths at work of a very simple and light character, but the number is but a fraction of the 700 or 800 men employed in the industry. These are the principal things I wished to ask the Committee to remember in dealing with the iron duty. I repeat that it is the immediate and pressing nature of the question of defence which has forced the consideration of this question upon me, and which compels me to support a proposal which the Prime Minister himself described as worth a considerable national sacrifice.","Customs and Excise Tariffs","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/continue[20]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

That honorable member was prepared to sacrifice his constituents, and did forego their advantage on the altar of the general welfare. That was the position taken up by the honorable member for Parramatta, and I am pleased to be able to compliment him upon it. We can all remember that when the old Tariff was being framed, staunch free-traders voted for salt and other duties, while gentlemen having manufacturing ironworks in their electorates supported high duties on machinery.

In that regard the Premier of New South Wales has acted the part of a violent incendiary, who would put . a torch to the edifice of the Commonwealth in order to gratify his own political ambition. He has reached out after notoriety and brought home nothing but the contempt and execration of the whole of Australia. It is quite true, as the honorable member for Laanecoorie has said, that if the representatives of New South Wales in this House had made up their minds about a site for the Capital it would have been fixed long ago. Now, in all the divisions that have taken place on this question not once have I voted for Dalgety. I do not believe that it is a suitable site.

He knows quite well that the district set apart for the consideration of this Parliament was the Monaro district, which contains both Bombala and Dalgety, and in which all Crown lands were temporarily reserved. I desire, in passing, to say that, although I have so far voted against Dalgety, unless I can see - a more suitable site in the future I shall vote for Dalgety in the next division which is taken.

Passing from that matter, I am glad to acknowledge the suggestion of the honorable member for Capricornia as one of the few valuable ideas which have been revealed during this debate. He has noticed, as I think every one who represents remote portions of the Commonwealth has noticed, the small interest which the people of those parts take in Federal affairs. His discovery is not by any means original, nor is his suggested remedy new.

Very early in its history, on my motion, the House decided that the Victorian inland rate for press messages should prevail throughout Australia; but the use which was made of the privilege by the newspapers did not come up to the expectations of those who supported the motion. There is a germ of usefulness in this suggestion for a summarized official report. I think that the Government might well consider the question of issuing - not in substitution of, but as supplementary to, Hansard - at the end of or during each sitting, a summary of the debates and proceedings in both Houses, and offering it to the press correspondents to be despatched to the daily newspapers. I believe that a great many daily newspapers would be prepared to . take this summary of the proceedings in this Parliament if it were offered in that way.

Since this system was adopted bounties have cost the Commonwealth £1,371,513. The people of Australia would not have so much to complain of if the object for which the bounty is given had been attained.

Our policy, although so expensive, has not been successful in bringing about the production of sugar wholly by white labour. In 1902, in Queensland, 60.9 farmers employed white labour, and 39.1 black labour; while in 1907 89.1 employed white labour, and 10.9 black labour. In New South Wales in 1902 89.7 farmers employed white labour, and 10.3 black labour; and in 1907 88.2 employed white labour, and 11.8 black labour, showing an increase in the employers of black labour in five years. Although there is an impression that the bounty, which has increased by nearly £300,000 in one year, is bringing about the employment of white labour only, on the 31st December, 1905, there were employed in the sugar industry in Queensland 7,970 coloured persons, and in New South Wales 483, a total of 8,452 ; while on the 31st December, 1906, there were employed in Queensland 6,323 coloured persons, and in New South Wales 468, a total of 6,791. In addition 785 coloured persons were employed in the factories of Queensland, and 500 in the factories of New South Wales.I do not think that that is a satisfactory state of affairs, in view of the enormous sacrifice which the people of Australia are making to hand the industry over to white men. During the last Parliament I did think that the time had arrived when we ought to reconsider attempts to bolster up the Queensland sugar industry. I would also point out that the white workers in that industry experience the very greatest difficulty in exacting ah adequate wage from the planters. As the honorable member for Herbert showed the latter even sent their emissaries to the old world to engage Italian and other cheap European labour, notwithstanding that an abundance of labour was available in the southern States of the Commonwealth. Allied to the question of the sugar bounty is that of the cost incurred in repatriating the kanakas. As everybody is aware, about 7,000 or 8,000 kanakas have been returned to their islands. Originally they were brought from their homes by the Government of Queensland for the purpose of assisting the development of the sugar industry in that State. Under the system which then obtained, the planters were compelled to lodge with the Government a deposit of £5 per head in order to defray the expense of deporting the kanakas to the Pacific Islands upon the expiration of their agreements. But what did we find? That this fund had actually been absorbed in the Queensland revenue and expended for other purposes. Now, the Government of Queensland ask this Parliament, and the people of the southern States - who are not interested in sugar except to the extent that they have to pay a high price for it - to subscribe the necessary funds for the deportation of these kanakas. To my astonishment a sum of money for the purpose was placed upon the Estimates, a considerable portion of which has been expended. That this expenditure evoked protest from only a small section of the House is certainly surprising. I think that the Queensland Government should be required to pay the cost of deporting their own kanakas instead of asking the people of Australia - who are already paying over £1,000,000 a year to keep the industry going - for further contributions. Then there is another remarkable item of which this Committee ought to take notice. Whilst Parliament was in recess, the Government actually pledged the people of Australia to an expenditure of £10,000 for the purpose of repatriating a number of persons in South Africa.","Customs and Excise Tariffs","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/continue[31]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The arrival of these persons was coincident with a very remarkable outbreak of crime in this city. In open daylight a diamond merchant was murdered in an office in Collins-street, and a short time previous to that a most mysterious robbery was perpetrated at the Melbourne Mint, not to mention other crimes of minor importance. I do not say that these crimes were committed by persons who had been repatriated, or by any new arrival from South Africa, but it is significant that they were contemporaneous. I notice upon the Estimates an item of £20,000 for advertising Australia. I desire to know whether this money is to be expended in attracting people to our shores by false representations in the way. that has been suggested by Dr. Arthur? We are all familiar with the letter that he forwarded to his agent in Melbourne - a letter in which he stated that the conditions of Australian land tenure were to be  kept dark  from intending immigrants. I know, too, that miners are being attracted to the Commonwealth by false representations. I am satisfied that this Parliament does not intend to vote £20,000 to lure people to Australia by any such means. Before the item is agreed to, I hope we shall have a specific undertaking from the Government that the money will be expended in advertising our resources amongst the people of the United King dom, and not in an endeavour to attract workmen to compete in city trades.","Customs and Excise Tariffs","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/continue[33]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The honorable member will agree with me that it is not right to bring to Australia working men, such as miners, or others to compete in city trades and other occupations which are not too attractive at the present time to our own people. The honorable member for Fawkner was good enough to tell us that kerosene and tea ought to be taxed in order to pay old-age pensions, contending that in order to avoid the suspicion of pauperism the necessary funds should be raised by taxation paid by all. I say, in reply, that if there are not to be old-age pensions until the money is derived from taxes on the necessaries of life, I hope they will be postponed for some time. As I pointed out when the honorable member was speaking, there is very little kerosene used in Toorak ; and, in my opinion, any taxation necessary in order to pay old-age pensions ought to be taxation on land and wealth. A man who. has qualified for an old-age pension by long residence in the country, must have done much to advance the interests and welfare of the community. And who gets the benefit of the work of such men? No one, in the long run, but the landowner. What is the effect of accretions of population here ? Is it not to increase the value of the lands? Who has increased the value of the land in Melbourne and the other cities of Australia? Who made land in Collins-street worth from £300 to £500 a foot? It was not the owners - not the fortunate individuals who came here in the early days and happened to obtain possession of blocks for a mere song - but it was the accumulation of people who found the city convenient for business and required the land. Therefore, I say that the owners of those lands, and other wealthy people, ought to be taxed in order to pay old-age pensions. The honorable member also referred - and I thought his reference most unhappy - to the epoch of 1893, which he said marked the first appearance of the Labour Party in Parliament, and the beginning of the growth of class strife and other evils which he contended had followed the advent of that party. The honorable member could not have been more unfortunate in his selection of the date, because it was in 1893 that for the first time in Australia an Australian Parliament said to the banks,  You need not pay your debts. This was done by the Victorian Parliament, in this very Chamber ; and payment was suspended by the banks for a whole week. This I can regard as no other .than legalized robbery of the depositors - among whom were many widows and children. The year 1893 has been burned into the minds of the thrifty people of Australia, who were forced by law to leave their money with the banks for periods ranging from three to ten years. The public at that time were robbed by the class which the honorable member for Fawkner represents - bank directors and others.","Customs and Excise Tariffs","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/continue[35]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

607,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MAHON, Hugh","KLB","N/A","N/A","N/A",3216,"- I can quite believe the statement. Of course, the honorable member for Fawkner himself is a generous and kind-hearted man; he and others in the Opposition corner possibly have very kindly sentiments towards the working people of the country. I can quite believe that if the French aristocracy had shown, a similar willingness to recognise the rights of the masses when Tom Paine wrote The Age of Reason, the French Revolution, with all its horrors, might not have occurred. But, as everybody knows, the aristocracy disregarded the advice of Paine. They read the first edition of his work and threw it aside with the utmost contempt; but it is said that their skins went to bind the third edition. Nothing of that sort, I hope, will occur in Australia. I wish to say to honorable members in the Opposition corner that, while I have every respect for them personally, I shall view with some suspicion proposals emanating from them, especially in reference to the Tariff. I think it was Daniel OConnell who, on one occasion in the House of Commons, when asked what course he proposed to take in regard to a certain proposal, replied,  I shall wait until I see what the Times urges, and if I do the opposite I know I shall be right. The honorable member for Fawkner said that 93 per cent, of the lands of Australia were still unalienated, leaving it to be inferred that there is ample room and scope for all who choose to come to the country. Anybody who has been in the interior of Australia, and knows that over vast areas the rainfall is only 5 or 6 inches per annum, will readily understand the absurdity of the honorable members suggestion. The . real trouble is that the most fertile and the richest portions of Australia are already alienated and in the hands of a few ; and what is required to promote settlement and increase the population is a stiff land tax that will render it unprofitable for the present holders to continue their policy of keeping the lands locked up. It is expected, I presume, of every honorable member that he should at this stage make some declaration in regard to the Tariff. I recognise that, for good or ill, the people of Australia have declared for protection. So far as I am personally concerned, while I do not believe in overloading the primary industries from which Australia derives the bulk of its wealth, I intend to recognise the will of the people. Where it is possible I shall give my vote for duties, provided the interests of the workers are conserved, and that some scheme is devised for the protection of the consumers. The objectionable features of protection will be largely removed if we are able to provide, on the one hand, that the workers shall receive fair wages under good conditions, and that the consumers shall not be swindled. Subject to these reservations, I intend to consider every duty on its merits, and to vote in the direction which I think the people of Australia desire. I am sorry that the honorable member for Fremantle is not present, because I intended to indorse the remarks made by him as to the vast undeveloped wealth of the north-west portion of Western Australia. His speech was, on the whole, an excellent effort, though some of his arguments were scarcely consistent with his fiscal professions. Like that delivered by the honorable member for Nepean, it was the utterance of a freetrader rather than of a protectionist, in which guise the honorable member for Fremantle was returned. I failed to recognise orthodox protectionist principles in his contentions. He seems to think that the primary industries only require that their machinery and appliances shall be unburdened by Tariff taxation. If he has studied the question he ought to know that machinery is but one factor of an industry. If taxes be levied on the cost-of living and other factors of an industry, then that industry, from the honorable members point of view, is not receiving fair play. I do not wish to make any further reference to the honorable members speech, but I trust that the Committee will give some attention to the complaints coming from Western Australia.","Customs and Excise Tariffs","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/continue[36]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

609,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MAHON, Hugh","KLB","N/A","N/A","N/A",3217,"- Western Australia occupies a unique position. The honorable member for Parramatta knows full well that no other State in the Union has derived less than she has from Federation. She depends mainly on four industries - mining, agricultural, pastoral, and timber getting - and not one of them, so far as I can see, is likely to be benefited by the Tariff. The position of the other States is altogether different. New South Wales has vast deposits of coal and iron, as well as an abundance of cheap labour, and she must be the seat of many flourishing industries. Wages prevailing in Western Australia, on the other hand, are higher than those paid in any other part of the Union, and the industries of that State must necessarily come down before the competition of the longer established manufactures of the eastern States. Without expressing any sympathy with what is, after all, a foolish agitation for secession, I think this House might give attention to the special needs and requirements of Western Australia. I would remind honorable members that we shall have an opportunity, when the Navigation Bill is before us, to show some consideration for its well-being. It ought not to be forgotten that Western Australia is absolutely confined to sea communication with the east. Unlike the other States, she has no land communication with the rest of the Commonwealth. I hope, therefore, that we shall impose as few restrictions as possible on coastal vessels trading between the west and the east. I thought of referring to a number of special advantages which the other States have received from the Union as contra-distinguished from Western Australia, but since I desire to assist in bringing to a speedy termination what, after all, must have proved to the public a wearisome debate, I shall refrain from doing so. The Federal Government, to my mind, is not preserving its self-respect to a sufficient extent in its dealings with the States Premiers. Every year a Conference of the States Premiers meets in some Australian capital to discuss questions of Federal importance which this Parliament was created by the people to deal with. I am not singling out any one party for special censure. The present Prime Minister is as much to blame as is the leader of the Opposition. All have bent the knee to the States Premiers, with a view, apparently, of cultivating their good-will.

Before doing so, I wish to explain that during the six years 1899-1900 to 1905-6 the expenditure of the States, after deducting the cost of defence and all other Federal Departments, has increased by £4,242,435. Some people may say that this increase is due to an enormous increase in population. I would point out, however, that the population on the 31st March, 1900, was 3,775,355as against 4,119,480 on 31st December, 1906, so that for the six years there was an increase of only 344,125. The additional expenditure of the States in respect of the same period was equal to £12 3s. 7d. per head of the increased population. I shall now put before the Committee the detailed figures, in order to show in what Departments these increases have occurred -N/AI find, in die first place, that the Interest payments have increased from j£7, 26^287 to £8,560,193. I am glad to notice, however, that the States have increased their sinking funds, to provide for the redemption of the public, debt from £595,016 to £947;75I- The only State which has not added anything to its sinking fund is Queensland, though some of the other States have made very small contributions. Tasmania has added only ,£29,000 to its sinking fund, andSouth Australia only £181,000. The railway expenditure has increased from £6,600,000 to £8,000,000 odd. The expenditure on public works and buildings shows a decrease from £1,751,848 to £1,672,036 - a decrease of over ,£100,000. The expenditure on lands and survey has increased from £649,000 to £747,000; on mines from £278,000 to ,£419,000 ; on police from £1,058,823 to £1,167,422 ; on education from £2,044,000 to £2,409,000; on medical services, lunacy, and public health from £490,000 to £593,000. I am  not complaining of the increase on account of the last item, nor of that on account of education. Omitting Customs, Defence, and Post Office expenditure, we come to the expenditure upon the States Governors. In 1900 the various States spent upon their Governors ,£37,000. To-day, despite the additional paraphernalia connected with the Governor-General, the States are spending £28,735. A small reduction is shown on that account; but honorable members will remember that one of the attractions of Federation for the public was the prospect of an enormous saving in the expenditure on the States Governments and the States Parliaments. Will it be believed, however, that the States have only slightly reduced their annual outlay on their Parliaments? In 1900 the cost, of them was £255,000 ; last year they cost £224,000.","Customs and Excise Tariffs","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/continue[39]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

On their Agents-General the States in 1900 spent £25,958. Last year they spent £25,668. It was understood that the Agents-General would no longer be required as soon as the Commonwealth had an officer in London. The Commonwealth now has an officer in London, but the States have retained their Agents General, offices, and staffs. I see that quite recently the salary of the Victorian Agent-General was increased by a large amount. Evidently there is no intention to effect any real economy in that direction. I should have men,tioned, in connexion with this return, that the Treasury officials inform me that they had the greatest difficulty in getting the information that it contains. There is a line at the bottom of it which shows the difficulty experienced. As soon as it was ascertained -for what purpose the information was intended, obstacles were placed in the way of the Treasury officials obtaining it. Surely it is a most extraordinary thing, that the Federal Government, which returns to the States more than three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue to which they are entitled, does not receive proper courtesy when it applies for information about the expenditure of the States. Regarding the final item, which is put under the heading of all other expenditure,- in 1900 it amounted to £4,438.625, and in 1906 to £4,879,637. Probably a good many items in connexion with the States Parliaments and the Governors are concealed under this heading where is shown an increased expenditure of over ,£400,000 during the six years of Federation. I wish to summarize the result of this table for the benefit of honorable members. It should be remembered that it takes into account the fact that the cost of Customs and Excise, post and telegraphs, and defence - the defence of Australia costing nearly £1,000,000 per annum - has been deducted from the totals. When the expenditure on account of Customs and Excise, post and telegraphs and defence for 1899-1900 is deducted, there remains this fact - that the expenditure of the six States in 1900 was only £25,469,084, whilst to-day, with only about 300,000 people more to govern, it is ,£29,754,199, or an increase of £4,285,115 in six years.","Customs and Excise Tariffs","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/continue[41]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

621,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MAHON, Hugh","KLB","N/A","N/A","N/A",3220,"- I wish honorable members to understand that the figures which I have given do not represent the whole of the increased expenditure during the six. years. I find a note to the effect that the figures do not include such expenditure as repairs, maintenance of buildings, and so on. Of course, in Western Australia there has been a large expenditure on water supply and similar works. But the point which I wish to emphasize is that the increase in population during the period mentioned was only 344,000, and that the increased expenditure amounts to £12 3s. 7d. per head of that increase. At any rate these figures constitute a sufficient indictment for the States Premiers to answer, without their interfering in the purely Federal functions which this Parliament was created to look after. I am sorry that the right honorable member for Swan is not present, because I intended to refer in detail to the attitude of the right honorable member. My criticism is not intended to be unduly censorious, the right honorable gentleman possessing many qualities which extort our admiration; but even the most perfect character can receive a little benefit from an occasional chastening. The right honorable member has been very explicit and decisive in his condemnation of the Tariff submitted by the present Government. His remarks invite, if they do not compel, one to compare his professions of to-day with his performances a few years ago. When the Kingston Tariff was introduced in 1901-2 there was a great outcry against it in Western Australia, although somewhat less intense than the present protest. To silence dissatisfaction at that time, the right honorable member for Swan assured the people of Western Australia that the Kingston Tariff would take from that State only £708,000, or 28s. per head per annum less than the people had hitherto paid. The result of the Tariff completely falsified the right honorable members prediction and promise. In 1899, the year before Federation, the Western Australian Customs and Excise Tariff produced £833,000, or £4 17s. 5d. per head of the population. The result of the first year of the Kingston Tariff in Western Australia, despite the large reductions that were made by Parliament, reached £1,335,000 amounting to £6 17s.1d. per head, or just under £2 per head in excess of the Customs taxation imposed by the State of Western Australia in 1899.In the following year, the Kingston Tariff produced £1,396,000 in Western Australia, but as the population had meanwhile increased, the per capita tax fell to £6 9s. 9d. The Tariff introduced by the Acting Prime Minister, which the right honorable member for Swan regards as very oppressive, is estimated to produce annually in Western Australia £1,009,000, or only £3 15s. 7d. per head of the population. In other words, the new Tariff will be far less burdensome to Western Australia than was the Kingston Tariff, of which the right honorable member for Swan was an enthusiastic supporter. It will collect less from Western Australia by over £300,000 per annum, and will extract from the people £3 2s. per head less. The right honorable member may say that these figures do not represent the real taxation of the people under the Tariff. In fact, he has practically said so. He says that the people of Western Australia are now purchasing goods from the eastern States, and paying more than they would pay if the goods were obtained from abroad, and that the increase is going into the pockets of the merchants in those States instead of into the Treasury. I believe that to be a fact to some extent. If it were not so, why are the people of Western Australia holding monster meetings to express their sense of this peril to their interests, and why should the Parliament of the State almost unanimously pass a remonstrance against the new duties? The fact is that the right honorable member has floundered continuously in his calculations about the effect of Federation on Western Australia. As far back as 1899, he was a member of a Select Committee of both Houses of the local Parliament, which sat to consider the probable financial results if. Western Australia joined the Union. He then adopted the report of the State Actuary, whose figures, as I shall show, proved ludicrously wide of the mark. I refer to these calculations mainly because the same officer is now furnishing the State Government with statistics exaggerating the effect of the new Tariff. In July, 1899, the Western Australian Actuary submitted a report in which he offered, on the basis of a stationary population, a forecast of  the results of Federation on the finances of Western Australia, as they affect the Colonial Treasurer. He estimated the total Customs and Excise revenue of the Commonwealth at £7,181,000 of which Western Australia was to contribute £630,000. In the first year of the uniform duties, he expected Western Australia to gain £9,500, but in subsequent years he gives the losses to the local Treasury as follows: - second year, £150,800; third year, £196,450 ; fourth year, £242,050; fifth year, £287,650; sixth and succeeding years,£333,250. This gentleman, who is now putting exaggerated statements before the people of Western Australia, and rousing their animosity against the Federation, was astray with regard to the Commonwealth revenue by no less than £1,500,000. To show the magnitude of his error respecting the losses to the State Treasury, I cannot do better than set out the exact amount paid over by the Commonwealth to the Western Australian State Treasurer year by . year. He estimated the total revenue from Western Australia at £630,000, whereas the actual sums remitted to Perth were as follow : - first year, £1,221,948; second year, £1,256,923; third year, £1,064,035; fourth year, £1,031,223; fifth year, £871,960-","Customs and Excise Tariffs","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/continue[43]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

623,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MAHON, Hugh","KLB","N/A","N/A","N/A",3221,"- It was due to the disappearance of the sliding scale of duties. In the sixth year, when the sliding scale finally disappeared, the amount was £774,719. To put the matter in another form, this statistician calculated that the Western Australian Treasury in six years of a uniform Tariff would lose £1,200,000, whereas it has gained in that period something like £2,440,000. This is the official on whose calculations the public in . the West are now building, and who is responsible for breeding a good deal of disaffection in Western Australia. This is the unreliable guide whom the right honorable member for Swan followed before Federation. If he found it necessary some years ago to reassure Western Australia about the Kingston Tariff, a similar message is doubly necessary now in view of the effusions of this imaginative statistician. The right honor able member mentioned that of the four great industries of Western Australia the pastoral and agricultural industries did not need protection, but he left it to be inferred that the interests of the other two principal occupations of the people - mining and timber-getting - could be served by the Tariff. I should like him to explain how protection can benefit the mining industry, for even here no protectionist has yet contended that you can add a shilling to the world value of an ounce of gold or silver by means of Customs duties. However, it is a gain to find the right honorable member admitting that certain industries do not need protection, and, therefore, are not advantaged by it. The other representatives of Western Australia would have welcomed such a declaration in 1901 and 1902, but it was not forthcoming. We received no help at all from the honorable member when, in those days, we fought against the hampering shackles that were being placed on the great primary industries of our State. But he now complains, as a Western Australian member, that the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission has overshot the mark, and recommended excessive duties. He cites, as articles within that category, mining machinery, barbed wire, apparel and attire, piece goods, and galvanized iron, plain and corrugated. Will it be believed that the duties of which the right honorable gentleman now complains as excessive are in the main identical with those proposed in the Kingston Tariff, as originally brought down, and for which the right honorable member was himself responsible. Here is a short list in proof of my statement. On mining machinery the original Kingston Tariff provided for a duty of 25 per cent. ; the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission is a duty of 25 per cent, on the same item. I wish the Committee to bear in mind that the right honorable member for Swan, as one of the members of the Government that brought down the Kingston Tariff, was responsible for the duties it proposed: The duty on barbed wire under the Kingston Tariff was 20 per cent., and the recommendation of the Tariff Commission is also 20 per cent.","Customs and Excise Tariffs","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/continue[44]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

625,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MAHON, Hugh","KLB","N/A","N/A","N/A",3221,"- It is to be regretted that the right honorable gentleman is not here. Certainly, I should much prefer to make these statements to his face. On piece goods the Kingston Tariff proposed a duty of 20 per cent., and the Tariff Commission propose a similar duty. On galvanized iron the Kingston Tariff proposed a duty of 15s. per ton, whilst the Tariff Commission propose a duty of 10 per cent. On corrugated and galvanized iron the Kingston Tariff proposed a duty of 30s. per ton, and the Tariff Commission propose a duty of 15 per cent. I am not aware of anything that has recently transpired which would make a 25 per cent, duty more burdensome now than it would have been in 1902, when the right honorable gentleman advocated such a duty. When he voted for that high rate of duty on mining machinery, the right honorable gentleman knew, quite as well as he knows now, the benefit which the primary industries derive from a free and open market in which to purchase their appliances. As a matter of fact, the right honorable gentlemans Government in Western Australia for years admitted such machinery at the nominal rate of 5 per cent, ad valorem. Yet we find him, a few years later, through some occult influence that has not been explained, throwing to the winds all consideration for the industry which has lifted Western Australia into world-wide prominence and affluence. The other representatives of that State found him ranged against them in every crucial division, and if, ultimately, a less onerous toll was levied upon the primary industries, the relief came not from the right honorable member for Swan. As I have said, I would much prefer that the right honorable gentleman were present to hear these observations, but, in view of his new-born zeal for the primary industries, I propose to show the Committee how he treated the primary industries in 1902, when, as a member of the Government, he might have exercised considerable influence and power in determining the duties to be submitted to Parliament. On the 16th January, 1902, an amendment was moved that engines, boilers, and pumps, which bore a duty of 25 per cent., should be admitted free. The right honorable member paired against that. Another attempt was made to reduce the duty to 10 per cent., and he paired against that proposal also, as well as against a third proposal to reduce the duty to 15 per cent., which was lost by 25 votes to 23. He opposed amendments moved to reduce the duty on pumps from 25 to 15 per cent., and that on machines and machinery n.e.i. from 25 to 15 per cent. A reduction was moved on the duty of 25 per cent, on screws, and was carried by 23 to 19, but the right honorable member for Swan paired against it. An amendment to reduce the duty on axles from 25 to 10 per cent, was lost by two votes, and the right honorable members vote was counted with the majority. It was proposed to reduce the duty on springs from 25 to 10 per cent., and the right honorable member paired against the amendment. On the 29th January of the same year a motion was moved to exempt all mining machinery, and was lost with the assistance of the right honorable member for Swan. Another motion to exempt diamond drills was lost by twenty-two to nineteen; and the right honorable member for Swan was opposed to any reduction. It will be seen that the articles to which I have referred are used extensively in the mining industry. The right honorable member has always pretended to be a friend of. the agriculturist, and yet when on the 30th June, 1902, the present Attorney-General carried an amendment for the abolition of the duty on threshing machines by twenty-eight votes to twenty-two, the right honorable member for Swan voted with the minority. Again, on manufactures of metals, n.e.i., an attempt was made to reduce the duty from 25 to 15 per cent., and the right honorable member voted against that. In order that I may not delay the Committee, I shall just read other items connected with the primary industries of Australia on which the right honorable member for Swan, as a member of the Government of the day, voted for the retention of the highest duty.","Customs and Excise Tariffs","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/continue[45]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It would appear that the honorable member for Fremantle has prevailed against a law of physics, and that in his case the smaller atom has attracted the bulkier one. On the 9th April, 1902, an attempt was made to reduce the duty on mining machinery to 15 per cent., and the right honorable member for Swan voted against that. He also voted against a reduction on plain iron from 15s. per ton, and against an amendment to reduce the duty on corrugated iron from 30s. to 10s. per ton. On the 18th April, 1902, an attempt was made to free engine packing, and he voted against the proposal. Again, an attempt was made to free for mining purposes Oregon timber, which is absolutely necessary for the protection of the lives of workmen in some Australian mines, and the motion was lost by twenty-six votes to twenty-three, the honorable member for Swan voting with the majority. I desire now to show how he has assisted the agricultural industry. On the11th December, 1 90 1, a proposal was made to reduce the duty on agricultural machinery from 15 to 10 per cent., and he voted against that. An attempt was made to reduce the duty on horse-shoe nails from 7s. to 4s. per cwt., and he voted against that too. As regards the duty on nails, n.e.i., he voted to maintain the higher duty. He voted against the abolition of the duty on mill-boards and plough shares. He voted to retain the higher duty on axle grease and solidified oils. He voted to maintain the higher impost on asphalt tiles and roofing tiles. He thought so much of the interest of the farmer that he voted to maintain the duty on bags and sacks at 15 per cent. instead of reducing it to 10 per cent. He was so solicitous for agriculture that he refused to assist to secure the exemption of saddle trees from duty. He opposed the exemption of chilled cast shares. He voted for the higher duty on salt. He tried to maintain the duty on candles at 1½d. per lb. ; he voted against two attempts to reduce that duty. He assisted to maintain the duty on mangles and washing machines at 20 per cent. Then, in regard to the pastoral industry, he assisted to maintain the higher duty on carbide of calcium which, in remote portions of Australia, is used by many squatters to manufacture a sort of gas. Then, as regards disinfectants, which are very much required and almost necessary to health in the remoter municipalities of Australia, he voted to maintain a duty of 15 per cent. He voted to maintain the duty of 2d. per lb. on laundry blue, an article of general consumption. He voted for the higher duty on cocoa, chocolate, and condensed milk. He was aware that at that time £100,000 worth of condensed milk was being imported annually to Western Australia from Europe. It was the only description of milk which was then available to a large population in the interior. A proposal was made by me to reduce the duty on condensed milk from1½d. to ¾d. per lb. The honorable member voted against that proposal, and immediately afterwards, when I moved to reduce the duty to1d. per lb., and the question was put without any discussion, he left the Chamber and did not vote. The second division was taken immediately after the first. He voted against me on the higher duty, but, knowing the weakness of the case, he would not assist the Government to resist the lowering of the duty to1d. On piece goods, on which he now complains the duty is too high, he voted to maintain an impost of 20 per cent. He voted to maintain the duty on apparel at 25 per cent., on dungarees and denims at7½ per cent.; on matches at is. per gross, and on bananas at is. per cental. That is a little list which I have pleasure in presenting to the right honorable gentleman.  There are one or two other matters which I had intended to refer to. The other day the honorable gentleman said that he would be ashamed, to have his name associated with such a preferential trade proposal as the Government have submitted in the Tariff. But what did he have his name associated with ? A little while ago he was a member, of a Government which submitted a Bill to give to Great Britain a mere shadow of preference - on less than 000,000 worth of imports - which would have been of hardly any value to her. The right honorable gentleman, as an Imperialist, possesses a great regard for the mother country. I think if I called myself an Imperialist I should be a more genuine preferential trader than that ; I ould be prepared to make some sacrifice by way of proving the genuine nature of mv Imperial spirit. But the right honorable gentleman does not want to make any sacrifice. I cannot understand a man who professes protectionist principles being a preferential trader at all. We heard him make some remarks on leaving office about the naval subsidy, which I think will be found at the bottom of his breaking with the Government. He is mainly responsible for, and is rather proud of, the fact that Australia is paying annually ^200,000 , - that is nearly one-fourth of our total outlay on defence - to Great Britain as a naval subsidy. He complains of the Prime. Minister having expressed some dissatisfaction with the Naval Agreement. But he must know perfectly well that the original dissatisfaction with it was expressed by .the Admiral on the Australian station-Admiral Fanshawe - sometime before the Prime Minister referred to the matter. If the right honorable gentleman makes this an excuse for leaving the Government I want to know why he did not challenge the Prime Minister when the honorable and learned gentleman, to his knowledge, wrote the following despatch on the 28th August, 1905, to the Secretary of State -The Naval Commander-in-Chief, Admiral Sir A. Fanshawe, has recently criticised this Agreement on several public occasions in order to support his contention that our contribution, as there fixed, is altogether insufficient. Since, as vet, only three payments have been made . . . this appeal for an alteration of its terms might be deemed premature. But as it may indicate a dissatisfaction with the agreement shared by the Lords of the Admiralty, as well as by their official representatives -This is the passage on which I wish to lay stress - and as a similar dissatisfaction, though upon other grounds, exists here, it may be advantageous to commence its reconsideration without delay. The paramount importance of the Navy to the British Empire and to Australia may be taken to be freely admitted. Nothing in this despatch is intended to question it. Indeed, our obligations to share in the general defence of the Empire have been already recognised in practice and in principle.It the right honorable member for Swan was opposed to the discontinuance of the Naval Agreement he should have protested against the sending of this despatch to the old country. Here is another unequivocal sentence -Beyond this, the defence of Australia and of its coasts is accepted as a duty and as a necessity of our national self-respect. Yet even under these circumstances, the present Naval Agreement is not, and never has been, popular in the Commonwealth.","Customs and Excise Tariffs","BUDGET","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/continue[51]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Whatever the intention may have been, this attempt at joint naval action has failed to enlist a fraction of the support that was spontaneously accorded in all the States to the despatch of military contingents to South Africa. On this account, the question why the Naval Agreement is coldly regarded here appears serious enough to merit careful scrutiny.

Several questions have been asked regarding this Agreement, but none of the Ministers seem to know anything of the matter, or, if they do, they refuse to say what they know.

I shall conclude my reference to the Naval Agree- . ment with the following additional quotation .from the article by Mr. Hain -Mr. Deakin had admitted the over lordship of the Admiralty, which means the continuance of the subsidy, but which also leaves Australia free to build up her own independent coastal defence and training ships. It is a kind of combination of the two policies, and a recognition of the rights of both. It throws upon Australia the burden of harbor defence, the control of the smaller vessels, and probably means also using these as a training school from which the larger ships under the Imperial control may recruit their crews. It throws upon the Admiralty the burden of maintaining the control of the Western Pacific outside the harbors. That is, it necessarily leaves to the British Navy the providing of large cruisers. . . . It concentrates the, perhaps, home-made home controlled flotilla, and relieves it of the outlook into the outer seas. It relieves the British Navy of harbor defence, while at the same time it provides the Navy with an effective base. It also means more expenditure by the Australian taxpayer.I think the Ministry ought to be as familiar as are outsiders with matters of this kind. If, as this gentleman states, the report of the Conference is not a faithful one, that fact also should be established for the benefit of honorable members.

I thought I had made it clear to every honorable member that the Prime Minister himself wishes to deal with the question upon his return. But for that fact I should have made a statement on the subject. I am familiar with the matters to which the honorable member for Coolgardie has referred. . I know who was responsible for the partly private sittings of the Conference, and why they took place. If the honorable member knew the facts he would agree that it was right that certain statements should be made in private, and that the official report has not been manipulated in the sense in which that word may sometimes be used. There are occasions when the Imperial Government consider it unwise to give to the world their intentions in regard to certain matters.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I understand that men engaged in performing the same class of work in Sydney are paid 11s. per day. If the Public Service Commissioner has reduced, the wages of these carpenters, I think that he has ignored the desire of the House and of the community at large. Surely a carpenter, as an educated artisan, is worth more than 8s. a day? That, I understand, is the rate of pay received by labourers in the employ of the Commonwealth.

I understand that, during my absence, as well as after I put in an appearance to- night, the honorable member for Coolgardie referred to me and criticised me on account of several votes which he said I gave upon the Tariff several years ago. He seemed to desire to prove that I shall be inconsistent if I do not vote now exactly in the same way as I did more than five years ago. It is a well-known rule that members of Parliament who join Governments have to sink their individual opinions in many respects - but not, of course, in matters affecting their consciences, or which are so grave as to necessitate their separating themselves from their colleagues. A member of a Cabinet cannot, consistently with the loyal support which he owes -to his colleagues, absent himself from divisions. But I have no objection now to saying that, in regard to some of the excessive duties of the old Tariff, as well as in regard to some other minor matters, I held certain opinions not fully shared by my colleagues. Every one who has anything to do with Governments, or with companies, or with business of any kind, knows, however, that every one has to sink his individual views to some extent. For the honorable member to parade votes which he states I gave as a subordinate member of the Government, in loyalty to my colleagues, who were ina majority in that Government, and to base upon those votes a charge of inconsistency against me, was, I think, as unnecessary as it was unfair. .","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
