2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator HILL","BH4","SA","LP","N/A",1643,"—My question is directed to Senator Gareth Evans. Why didnt you, as foreign minister, act immediately after the French presidential victory to seek to dissuade the new administration from its election commitment to resume nuclear testing in the Pacific? Why didnt you lead a delegation at that time rather than after the public announcement when you knew it would be much more difficult to influence a change? And, after the announcement, why did you play down the decision with your statement that it was not as bad as it might have been, which you knew was code for telling the French that you were simply going through the motions of protest? How did you get it all so wrong?","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[1]/question[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
3,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator GARETH EVANS","VD4","VIC","ALP","N/A",1643,"—We did act to dissuade the French as best we possibly could. In the period immediately after the election and before an announcement was made on nuclear tests, the Prime Minister wrote to President Chirac in very explicit terms; I wrote to Juppe, the former foreign minister, now Prime Minister; and it was made very clear to them what our position on the basic issues of principle was.When it came to the decision actually being made, there was no question as to the reality of the feeling of both me and the Australian government in this respect. I have to say that, personally, I was extremely upset at the way in which the French government had breached faith with the international community in the context of the NPT negotiations. Only one month previously, in one of the hardest fought diplomatic exercises that Australia has ever mounted, we managed to get international support for the indefinite extension of that treaty. We did so, among other things, on the basis of the nuclear weapons states agreeing to exercise the utmost restraint so far as nuclear tests were concerned, and the French government, within barely a month after that, manifestly acted in breach of that commitment.Secondly, I was extremely upset at the implications of this for the CTBT, the comprehensive test ban negotiations, because of the implications, again, of the French decision for the course of those negotiations, which has been a very long, hard-fought-for Australian policy position. The dangers of polarising the environment in Geneva, the dangers of creating an impossible negotiating situation in relation to some of those outstanding sensitive issues, are very real. Thirdly, I and the government generally, like the Australian people, were deeply upset with that aspect of the French decision, which involved once again, with supreme and contemptuous disregard for the interests of the people of the South Pacific region—","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[1]/answer[1]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

5,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator GARETH EVANS","VD4","VIC","ALP","N/A",1643,"—I will come to this. It involved, with that sort of disregard for the people of the South Pacific region, after a break of three years which had won the French widespread respect and credibility around the region, their once again determining to go ahead, albeit on a limited basis.The question was: how was that anger, which was very real and very genuine, to be translated into a diplomatically effective response? That is the particular problem that we have been wrestling with. It is very easy in this kind of context to express yourself in extremely voluble, over-the-top terms without regard to the implications of that for a capacity to actually change the situation for the better in the longer run.What we in the government decided upon was a controlled response building up over time, with these following elements. Step one would be a relatively clear-cut but nonetheless modulated response which would make it clear that the French behaviour was utterly deplorable and to be condemned, and would spell out why that was the case but would at the same time create a basis for a further exercise in persuasion being mounted in a way that would not be counterproductive. Secondly, it would involve consultation with the South Pacific countries with a view to developing a combined regional response. We put that in place very quickly—within two, three, four days of the announcement—with the delegation to France. Thirdly, it involved follow-up action after that particular delegation had its opportunity to seek to persuade the French government and to get a response. That follow-up action is exactly what we are now embarked upon. There will be follow-up at a Forum-wide regional level. There will be further follow-up of an appropriate kind at the Australian government level. I will be putting a package of measures to the government later today which will do just that.

Before I get to the nub of it, in the last few days we have been told that you did write to the French Prime Minister. Then we were told in this place that you did not write to the French Prime Minister. Today you tell us that you did write to the French Prime Minister. I invite you to table that letter so that we can all have a look at it. Your modulated response seemed to be so much inaction. Why did you not lead a delegation and do more than write a letter before the decision was announced, when there was some real chance of influencing a policy change? Why leave it all until after the announcement and why, after the announcement, play it down? Surely that is a modulated response that can only tell the French that we are really not serious about protest.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[1]/question[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

But let me just remind you of what John Howards initial response was on the very first day. Last week Mr Howard said:. . . some times in these matters what you should do is give an initial response and if that doesnt produce any result, then you might consider a further response and its never smart in those situations to fire all your shots at once.That was exactly the position we adopted. We made very clear how much we deplored and condemned the situation, for all the reasons that I have just spelt out. We made very clear that we were engaged in an exercise in persuasion, not a mere futile Alexander Downer type adolescent protest. To make that persuasion effective, we believed it was necessary to acknowledge whatever it was that could be said by the other side. We then upped the ante by mounting a mission to Paris. Because that particular mission failed to produce the result, as it has, we are now proposing to take further steps.

I refer to the recent international forum on the Indian Ocean region, held in Perth, and the mixed media comment arising from it. Can you inform the Senate of what was achieved from the forum and whether it met government expectations?","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[2]/question/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
9,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator McMULLAN","5I4","ACT","ALP","N/A",1644,"—The government has been very confident since the conclusion of the Indian Ocean region forum that it was a success because it met the goals we set. But it is always more effective when you get the assessment of people other than yourself for something that you have undertaken. Let me indicate two or three of the responses that we have had to the outcome of the forum. Most particularly, yesterday I had the opportunity of talking to the Indian Minister of State for External Affairs, Mr Khur Shid. During my discussions with him last night, he made it absolutely clear that, in his view, the forum was a success in achieving goals which we share. They were the goals of having, for the first time, an inclusive gathering to discuss cooperation in the Indian Ocean region, to get the discussion going and to set up processes which will enable us to take forward regional cooperation, to elicit ideas on how we might move forward and to develop a process for doing it. They were our objectives, and they were met.We saw two regional bodies established—the Indian Ocean consultative business network and the Indian Ocean research network. They are both scheduled to meet in New Delhi in December next year. It is very easy for people, including some members of the opposition, to say that this was not a sufficient achievement and that somehow or other we should therefore consider it a failure. I refer to the two recently published responses by participants, not members of the government, and in one instance someone not even known to me, but people who have indicated their view of the response. Firstly, I refer to a response from Harold Clough, the president of ACCI, in a letter published in the Australian Financial Review on 21 June. He described the forum as a landmark event in world trade and commerce and said:. . . there can be little doubt an IOECC, or an equivalent, will be formed in the near future.He continued:. . . there is widespread support for a vehicle like an IOECC to improve commercial and economic relations in this region, and the Perth meeting was considered by all to have been a great success.Mr Clough chaired the meetings of business people at that forum, so he was the person best placed to judge the mood, rather than some of those who sat in Wagga and made clever remarks.Then there was a lengthy article by a fellow from the Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies at the ANU, Sandy Gordon, whom I have not had the opportunity to discuss this with. That contribution by Dr Gordon comments upon the considerable potential of the liberalising of the economy of South Asia and says:As for the conference itself, the fact that no cooperative structure emerged does not mean there was no momentum towards regionalism. In fact, there was a general consensus that the process should be taken forward, make certain comparisons with APEC.He goes on to say:It was suggested within the security workshop, for example, that an interinstitutional dialogue process be initiated. Such a process, if properly supported, could potentially lead to a genuine second track dialogue emerging, a goal that has hitherto alluded the region.So it met the goals that the government set and they are goals that are very important for Australia. It is a pity that some people tried to interpret it as not being a success because that undermines our opportunity to build on the momentum we have created. I believe the meetings that will happen in Delhi in December and subsequent activity and the meeting in Mauritius in August and what flows from it if it is as successful as the Perth one, will mean that we have a momentum for Indian Ocean cooperation that will be substantially to the economic and diplomatic benefit of Australia.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[2]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

What you dont get from me is a press release lion and a face to face mouse, which is exactly what you get from Alexander Downer. If you remember, the very first day that he was appointed foreign affairs spokesman he put out a press release saying what a hero he had been in raising human rights issues with the Vietnamese foreign minister. Two hours later the Vietnamese foreign minister and the embassy put out their own press release saying he had not even raised the issue at all, yet he put out a press release claiming that. This is the sort of nonsense we have to put up with from the other side of politics.The truth of the matter is that in all my representations to the French government—face to face with Alain Juppe, two days before the election in Bordeaux, and across the table in the Quai dOrsay with the French Foreign Minister, Herve de Charette, two nights ago—what you had from me was a full, frank, direct, robust, forceful, unequivocal and unambiguous presentation of everything that was wrong with the French decision and why that decision needed to be revisited and how it needed to be qualified and developed over time.In order to be effective in mounting those representations, you have to pay due regard to the way in which international discourse works and the necessity not to fire every shot in your locker and anticipate every course of action you will subsequently take before you do it; because if you ignore, in your public statements, whatever it is—however minute—that can be said for the other sides argument, all that happens is that when you confront those on the other side with your position, they spend all their time talking back at you about what you have ignored in your initial presentation. That is a fact of life. That is what I took into account in working out how best to set the ground for a substantial, effective, very frank and very direct face to face confrontation—which is exactly what occurred two nights ago.The New Zealanders were there; the other Pacific island countries were there; and all of them were totally happy, relaxed and confident about the way the thing was handled and believed it was very much an exercise in South Pacific regional interests, as well as acknowledging that this was entirely consistent with Australias national interest.In the entire time I have been this countrys foreign minister—and this will continue to be the case into the future—it is inconceivable that any consideration would wage impact upon me other than the most effective, most persuasive and most credible way, in terms of the normal courtesies of international discourse, of mounting a case in Australias interests. That is what I am about and that is why it is that Australian foreign policy and Australias international reputation at the moment stand higher than they ever have in this countrys history; because of the way in which we have systematically and effectively presented what it is that we are about in a way that is consistent with Australias security and economic interests and Australias responsibilities as a good international citizen.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[3]/answer[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

27,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator JACINTA COLLINS","GB6","VIC","ALP","N/A",1647,"—It was a very good conference, Senator West. Like many of the forum delegates, I am also concerned at the lack of involvement by rural women in the policy making process. Indeed, over the last 18 months I have taken a consistent position on this, particularly in the representations I have made to the industry bodies themselves to redress the situation in terms of their appointments to the many rural organisations across Australia which industry has control of, rather than the government—and with some success.I warmly congratulate the Grains Council of Australia for its recent appointment to a senior position of Linda Botterill, a former ministerial adviser on my staff—sorely missed—and on the staff of the previous minister for primary industry, Simon Crean. I think that primary industry is now recognising the great depth of talent of women around Australia, and this is reflected in this recent appointment by the Grains Council.We need to increase the participation of women, both to ensure that the issues relevant to them are addressed and addressed adequately, and to improve the quality of rural policy through closer consultation with those who are affected by it. I have already asked my department to put in place initiatives to achieve this aim. As a first step, a rural womens unit has been established in the department. The unit will develop policies and programs to improve the status of rural women and to enhance the role of women in agriculture. It will be headed by a national rural womens coordinator, supported by departmental staff.The national rural womens coordinator position was advertised widely in the national and regional press. It attracted, I am pleased to say, widespread interest. More than 300 enquiries were received about the position and 81 applications for the position were lodged from all over Australia, including from the Northern Territory. The major rural womens groups, the Country Womens Association, Australian Women in Agriculture and the Foundation for Australian Agricultural Women, participated fully in the selection process.On the advice of the selection committee, I am pleased to advise the Senate that Ms Helen Board has been appointed as the national rural womens coordinator. She will commence her duties with the department in mid-July. Ms Board has an impressive background in rural and remote community development. She is an effective negotiator and advocate, has demonstrated her ability to take a leadership role in issues at the national level, and has excellent policy and program development skills.One of the first tasks of the new coordinator and the unit will be to examine the agenda developed by forum delegates and to identify opportunities for action by the department. The rural womens unit will also assist with the portfolio strategy to improve the representation of women on portfolio bodies in line with the governments decision to achieve gender equity on government boards, committees and authorities by the year 2000.The department has made significant progress in identifying ways to meet this target and I am confident that the current low level of female participation in these bodies will improve. I stress again that industry has an important role to play, considering its role in appointing many of the people to these bodies.Finally, the department is in the process of establishing a committee on womens issues to advise the secretary on portfolio issues relevant to rural women. The committee will also act as a source of advice to the national rural womens coordinator. I expect that these initiatives will lead to real improvements in both the participation of rural women in the policy making process and better policy outcomes as a result in the long run.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[4]/question/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

29,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BOB COLLINS","OF4","NT","ALP","N/A",1648,"—The answer to the first part of Senator Coulters question is no. I am advised that since the Quarantine Act commenced in 1908 the importation of fish and fish products has, with very few exceptions, never been restricted for quarantine concerns. Prior permission to import has not been required and therefore has never been sought or given. Over the years, quarantine authorities have imposed a number of restrictions on the importation of fish in the light of the increasing knowledge of fish disease and developments in the industry.As I told the Senate the other day, I am advised—and our own inquiries seem to confirm this—that there is a great dearth of scientific knowledge on fish, not just in Australia but around the world. But, as that knowledge base has been improving internationally, a number of restrictions have been introduced. For example, quarantine requirements were introduced for oysters in 1935, salmonid fish products in 1975, live fish in 1983, and processed feed for aquaculture in 1990 and 1992, when there were concerns raised about insect infestation of these products and concerns also that other animal ingredients were being mixed into the fish feed products.In 1992, as I also advised the Senate, AQIS commissioned the BRS to conduct a major review of quarantine policies on the importation of aquatic animals, their products and related materials. This was in response to what have been quite rapid changes, particularly over the last few years, in commercial fisheries and aquaculture. As I advised the Senate a few days ago in response to a question from Senator Boswell, that report should be available by July.In terms of the last part of Senator Coulters question, I am advised that a preliminary review of the scientific literature reveals no report of significant infectious disease of pilchards anywhere in the world, as far as can be determined. No specific work has been undertaken on diseases of Australian pilchards. In terms of my own examination of the literature, it does not appear to be the case anywhere else, either. One study was undertaken in Western Australia in the 1980s of a parasite distribution amongst species of fish which included pilchards. There has been no scientific work done on the immune status of pilchards to infectious diseases. This would be impossible without the isolation of infectious disease agents.It is also relevant to again advise the Senate that, because of the death of large numbers of pilchards off the Australian coast some weeks ago, there has been an intensive scientific investigation into possible causes of those deaths by a special Commonwealth-state task force. I anticipate that an interim report from that task force will be with me shortly. In fact, I hope it will be this week.Senator Coulter and the Senate may be interested to know that in the last 24 hours the Chief Veterinary Officer of Australia has been informed of significant numbers of pilchard deaths apparently occurring off the north coast of the North Island of New Zealand. Thousands of pilchard deaths apparently have occurred there very recently and it appears from the advice we have received from the New Zealand authorities that those deaths have been related or appear perhaps to be related to what has been a significant and sudden drop in ocean temperatures in that area from about 19 degrees to 13 degrees. We are cooperating and consulting, of course, with the New Zealand authorities about this information to see whether any parallels can be drawn between the deaths there and the deaths here in Australia.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[5]/answer[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

There appears to have been very little research on pilchards anywhere in the world—and they occur in large numbers right around the globe. In fact, it is highly likely that as a result of the work that was commissioned by us in 1992 and which is about to be concluded, we have probably done more work on it to this point than anyone else.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[5]/answer[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This is an issue the small business community, through the Small Business Forum, has raised with me on many occasions. As a result, I have been able to have discussions with both the minister, the assistant minister, the Prime Minister and other colleagues. The announcement yesterday by the minister in no way moves away from our principal concern to protect the rights of employees from being unfairly dismissed.But the issue that the small business community has quite rightly raised a number of times in recent months involves the procedural rules for how questions of unfair dismissal are dealt with by the courts. The amendments outlined by Mr Brereton yesterday, particularly those about procedural fairness, will mean that the Industrial Relations Commission will be able to look at the broad aspects of why a particular dismissal has occurred rather than just whether there was procedural fairness.This was the major issue raised with me and the government on many occasions. It is an important indication that this government has a structural arrangement with the small business community and the Small Business Forum whereby issues of concern to the small business community can be raised and dealt with away from the usual ideological baggage that the opposition brings forward in dealing with the small business community.What is interesting about the announcement yesterday is that both the president of the ACTU and the chief executives of the ACCI and the MTIA have all indicated that they support these changes.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[6]/answer/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

In the context of the negotiation of accord mark 8, it was willing to support these changes. The way that those opposite would go about industrial relations under their present leader would be based on an ideology of the 17th century. There would be a master-servant relationship that abuses the rights of employees and gives them no rights.We believe that the balance we have achieved in this respect is excellent. We also believe that the small business community, through the Small Business Forum, has had a very proper role to play in raising its particular concerns on procedural fairness. That has been dealt with.Tomorrow, when the next meeting of the Small Business Forum takes place, I am sure that it will welcome the changes announced by the government. It had a constructive role in bringing them to the fore with the government.

38,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator GARETH EVANS","VD4","VIC","ALP","N/A",1650,"—I do not believe there is any need for an inquiry into the governments handling of these matters, although we have absolutely nothing to hide in terms of the way in which we have approached each one of them. In fact, they have been the subject of quite exhaustive examination and cross-examination in Senate estimates committees, and I am always willing to use that occasion to explain fully what we have done. Were an inquiry to be set in train, we would, of course, respond fully and explain exactly what we have done in each of these matters.The difficulty about these matters is, of course, something that is often misunderstood by members of parliament and certainly by the wider community—that there are extreme limitations on Australias capacity to deal with problems that do afflict Australian citizens abroad when those problems are of a kind which require police investigative action or other effective executive action of that kind. The most you can ever do is make representations to the government in question and, when it comes to police investigations, liaise with the local police authorities and hope that you can persuade them to do whatever is necessary to mount an effective inquiry.You cannot take it into your own hands and do it. The only context in which that is possible, technically, is for Australian offences which have extraterritorial application; for example, the paedophile laws or laws of that kind which make it an offence for Australians to do certain things while they are, in fact, overseas. Then there is a jurisdictional foundation on which to place an investigative role but, of course, in practice that, too, depends on full cooperation from the local authorities. So the particular problems that you are referring to all basically have had these characteristics.So far as Mr Bowra is concerned—and it has been a long and ongoing saga and a most unhappy one from his point of view—we have made every representation we can possibly do for him, including most recently in the context of his problem with a passport, which I understand has been resolved or is about to be resolved.In the case of Ben Maresh, I met with the family a couple of weeks ago and fully explained the limitations that have confronted us in terms of that particular investigation. I have undertaken to the family to have a complete review of all the available material and evidence, including some that was not put before the coroners inquiry, to see whether there is any foundation for going back to the Indonesian authorities and getting them to reopen that investigation.In the case of David Wilson and Kelly Wilkinson in Cambodia, that was a heart-rending affair for all concerned; and I believe we did, as a government, everything we possibly could and are continuing to do that in an endeavour to bring the killers to justice in both cases and are maintaining constant vigilance, so far as the Cambodian government is concerned, in ensuring that arrest warrants have been issued and there is appropriate follow-up action.Might I say, in terms of the capacity and performance of Australian consular officers generally in missions overseas, I get far more letters of congratulations and thanks, averaging at least one or two a week, from people who have been impressed and touched by the quality of the service that has been rendered to them—in many cases going above and beyond the call of duty. You never hear about those cases publicly. You only hear about the difficult cases, the heart-rending cases, the ones that go wrong.I believe we have a good and professional consular service, but there are just some things which are beyond the capacity of any government anywhere in the world to be able to do. You do just have to depend, basically, on the goodwill and the effectiveness of the governments with which you are dealing; and we are in that position, as is every other government in the world.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[7]/answer[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

42,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator GARETH EVANS","VD4","VIC","ALP","N/A",1651,"—The whole point about the conduct of foreign policy is to be as angry as you appropriately can and should be in these cases but to make that anger controlled and productive. You do not conduct foreign policy by putting on an Andrew Peacock angry face. You conduct your foreign policy in a way that is likely to be most productive.I have explained the step-by-step approach that we have adopted so far as the French tests are concerned. I have explained how we have, in fact, followed the injunction of Mr Howard not to fire all the shots in the locker at once but see what the initial response is and then develop a further response based upon that. That is exactly what we have done.I have explained how, as a matter of practical dealing with other governments, it is always best to frankly acknowledge whatever it is that can be said on the other side of the case rather than pretend that there is nothing at all other than sheer, unmitigated horror, and pretend on the basis of that to be able to make a persuasive case.There is enough in the French decision to make all of us deeply, genuinely angry and outraged. I have explained how angry I was personally at the breach of faith that I felt was there so far as the NPT negotiations were concerned. I have explained how distressed and disappointed I was at the implications of this for the comprehensive test ban negotiations, a major Australian and worldwide policy objective which, I believe, has been prejudiced by this.I was distressed, as I said before, by the contemptuous indifference that was shown to our South Pacific island neighbours by the move; that after all these years of anxiety and concern on environmental fronts and with all the unresolved issues about the dangers, not only of accidents but also of leakages, once again that concern was being ignored. I believed, for better or worse, that the best way of dealing with this particular matter was to put those concerns on the record and then to move from there to gradually but inexorably, and with as much effectiveness as possible, engage in a persuasive exercise with the French.I believe we did that very successfully in France in the sense of very successfully communicating the nature, the intensity, the depth of concern that is felt all around the region. I think that we also had some success in pointing out to the French a number of ways in which they could extract themselves from the morass in which they are now engaged, in particular: firstly, by having a decent negotiating position on the comprehensive test ban treaty; secondly, by committing themselves once and for all to joining the South Pacific nuclear free zone treaty and signing the protocols; and, thirdly, by closing Mururoa and making a commitment to do that, hopefully immediately but, if not, on the completion of these eight tests after the 175 they have already conducted there.Those were the propositions put to them. I think the French government understands the force of those propositions, the utility of them, and I think we made some particular progress because there is a lot of people in the French governmental system, as well as in the French community, who are deeply unhappy with the decision that has been made by the incoming president—deeply unhappy. What we all hope is that this will simply be the last twitch of the Gaullist dinosaur so far as attitudes towards nuclear explosions are concerned. That is what we are hoping to see.But, as Mr Howard said, you do not fire all your shots at once if you want to be persuasive. You do not behave like a grubby little opportunist, walking around with a wet finger in the air, taking positions that are utterly at odds with the policy positions you have adopted in your entire previous political life. We know where Mr Howard stood, we know where you lot stood on the South Pacific nuclear free zone treaty in the mid-1980s. We know the hypocrisy with which you are mounting your mock horror at this stage. We know the extent to which you turned on a sixpence within 24 hours from your initial statements when you thought there was a bit of political mileage in it.

First of all, the QCOSS report states that the social security initiatives in this years budget by the federal government are clearly heading in the right direction—that is, the difficulties it has seen and studied based on that out-of-date evidence clearly are being countered by the initiatives of this federal government in the budget that go a long way to addressing those difficulties around the country.But the most important point to reiterate is that the poverty statistics this report is based on were collected less than a year after the election of the Goss Labor government. The fact that poverty was higher in Queensland than in most other states of Australia reflects 30 years of neglect of social policies by the coalition government under the then National Party government. So the most important thing is to know that this is 1989-90 data and that it is a measurement of neglect by the Queensland government under the National Party in the 30 years before that.It is not a reflection on Brian Howe.

Can the minister confirm that this will mean, for example, a cut in funding of over $500,000 to Western Australia? Does the minister understand `the sense of helplessness and hopelessness which, according to Major Kingsley Cochrane, chair of the Emergency Relief Forum in Western Australia, has followed this `devastating news? Can the minister explain why there has been such a large cut in assistance to needy families and advise the Senate to whom the non-government agencies which provide this assistance should now turn for help?","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[10]/question/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
69,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CROWLEY","ZF4","SA","ALP","N/A",1655,"—The emergency relief funding is allocated each year on the basis of a formula that is principally dependent on the number of people on unemployment benefit. Based on those figures this year, as a result of the dramatic fall in the number of people on unemployment benefit, there has been a significant fall in the allocation for emergency relief—from something like over $19 million to $14 million. While I have not got the exact figures for Western Australia, Senator, I have no reason to doubt your figures showing that there has been a drop in Western Australia of the order you say.The most important thing to know is that the formula we have at the moment is based on unemployment figures. That significant drop means that there is a fall in the formula for emergency relief. Importantly, hopefully, that should be a measure too of the fall in the number of people who are approaching agencies looking for assistance for emergency relief. One of the things we hope is that people will, in fact, not keep using emergency relief but, indeed, get steered to or go directly to the payments under social security to assist families in times of difficulty. The ongoing commitment by government for payments for families is much the preferred way to go for families than depending on emergency relief.The government does recognise that, from time to time, families may have a call on moneys that they simply do not have access to—for example, if a car breaks down, it might be some hundreds of dollars to fix. For a family, that is very critical, but, if you are living on a very tight budget, you may not be able to find that kind of finance. The emergency relief is there to assist families in that kind of cash call.We are not quite sure who are the people using emergency relief. That is why I am pleased to inform the Senate that I have just approved a considerable grant to ACOSS to do significant research on the people using emergency relief so that we can be much clearer about just what it is that leads people to emergency relief—whether those people come back time and time again; whether they are people who visit emergency relief once and are then assisted into other payments and benefits that our government provides; whether they are working families on low incomes—we have a sense that quite a few families of that sort might sometimes use emergency relief; also, particularly, whether the people providing emergency relief do have the best training and support to assist them in working with families and to encourage them not to depend on emergency relief but to go into the mainstream payments on behalf of families.Senator, I think the important thing is that within your question there is an understanding that, as there may still be a considerable need for emergency relief, if the formula we have means these cuts are real and perhaps there will still be more call than there is finance for it, we might need to look at that formula for the allocation of emergency relief. We will be able to do it based on good data from the ACOSS research. I think it will put us in a much stronger position to know exactly who uses emergency relief and whether or not our formula does need to be changed.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[10]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The minister will be aware that I tabled earlier this week information which reveals that a Mr Mike Rowley is the front man for Taiwanese interests that are seeking to gain a foothold in the protected waters of TEC 4 area E off the North Queensland coast. This is the same Mr Rowley who boasted to last weeks ECTUNAMAC meeting that he had achieved the effective transfer of permits to fish in the area by transferring shares in the boats to which the permits had been issued. It is also the same Mr Rowley who misled ECTUNAMAC by claiming billfish were not being taken by long-line tuna boats, when photographic evidence shows his boats are doing just that. Does the minister feel it is acceptable that the clear intention of the Fisheries Management Act regarding non-transferable permits is being flouted by a member of a government advisory committee? Is it the governments intention to allow permits currently in the possession of Taiwanese investors to be renewed, when this protected area was established 15 years ago to keep foreign fishermen out of these waters? And, given the poor record Taiwanese fishermen have for protecting the environment, is the minister concerned at the impact an increased long-line effort in this area would have?","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[11]/question[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In relation to the two specific questions Senator OChee has asked, I am advised that the Fisheries Management Act provides for transferability of permits under section 32(10). In fact, it is the management arrangements in place for a particular fishery that determine whether the permit may be transferable or not.As far as the east coast tuna fishery is concerned, I am advised that permits in area E are not transferable at the present time. Where a permit is held by a body corporate, there is no provision in the Fisheries Management Act 1991 to inquire as to the beneficial ownership of that company or the nationality of the shareholders. It is therefore possible for ownership of a company, and therefore a fishing permit, to change hands without the knowledge of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority.In response to the second question, permits may be held by Australian companies in accordance with existing government policy, and foreign nationals may legitimately be shareholders of such companies. The Australian Fisheries Management Authority will continue to apply the existing legislation for, and policy of, renewing permits as long as the vessel being used is an Australian boat and complies with the other management requirements of that particular fishery.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[11]/answer[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Does the government believe it is satisfactory that these Taiwanese should be allowed to continue to exploit the resource?

Having checked my recollection, I am pleased to be able to advise the Senate that neither I nor Senator Ray said anything misleading.The situation is this: I did make oral representations to Alain Juppe, who was then foreign minister, just a few days before the French election when I met him in France in which the subject of nuclear tests was very specifically on the agenda and about which I made quite strong points to him.

It was on that basis that Senator Ray was advised to respond as he did in his clarifying remark earlier in the week. I was closely involved, as you would expect, in the preparation of the letter that went from Prime Minister Keating to President Chirac which, again, went very explicitly to the nuclear tests question. There had been discussion as to whether that letter would be best from Mr Keating to President Chirac or from Mr Keating to Prime Minister Juppe or from me to Prime Minister Juppe or from me to my foreign minister counterpart.

Earlier this week when we raised the question of what the Australian government did between the election of the French President and his announcement, when the whole world knew that he was going to announce the resumption of tests, when it was running hot in the international media, when it had been a specifically stated promise in the course of the French elections, what did the Australian government do? The answer we heard in the Senate on that occasion was twofold—the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Keating) had written a simple letter and so had Foreign Minister Evans to the now Prime Minister of France, Monsieur Juppe, formerly the foreign minister.Later in the week Senator Ray had to come in here and say, `No, in actual fact, the letter from Senator Evans didnt refer to the tests at all. Today Senator Evans got up and said, `I wrote to the Prime Minister raising concern about these tests. After question time he said that in fact it now seems he did not write to the Prime Minister raising the issue of the test. What a confused state of affairs! It demonstrates and underlines that the Australian government took so little action. At the only time when it had any realistic chance of influencing a change of policy on the part of France, the Australian government did next to nothing. That is the point. It seems that the Australian foreign minister personally took no action at all. I accept what he said; in fact, he is picking up a statement that my leader made. Obviously, in these circumstances you make a graduated response. You do not fire off all your shots at once.The point is that at the time when there was a chance that the Australian government could have influenced a change, it did not fire off any shots at all. This delegation that Senator Evans led to France is not firing off all your shots. If it was worthwhile doing, why wasnt it done before the public announcement of the French policy? Why didnt Senator Evans take diplomats from the South Pacific, or better still take leaders from the South Pacific, to France to express concern as to what would happen if the French election promise was implemented? It did not occur to him to do so because he was concerned with other matters. That is the point that we are seeking to make. Senator Evans did nothing at the time when he might have influenced a change of direction.Secondly, when the public announcement was made, what did Senator Evans do? He talked down the decision that France had made. There is only one way that that gets interpreted. We all know diplomatic code. That is interpreted by France and intended to be interpreted as a form protest.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[13]/speech/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

On the other hand, he said:We do acknowledge that the context in which these tests will be taking place is really very different from that in which they have taken place in the past. There are some very clear assurances that they will be limited in number . . .He goes on and eventually says that the situation is not as bad as it could have been. How else could France have interpreted that other than to say that Australia is not serious about its protest? There is no other way in which that could reasonably be interpreted. That is the whole point. A graduated response, yes, but take it seriously. When Senator Evans had a chance to influence a change of policy he should have done something. When the announcement was made he should have made a vigorous protest, not compromise the situation by almost talking it away before he led this delegation to France.

84,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COULTER","TF4","(South Australia)","AD","N/A",1659,"—Well may members of the opposition wave their arms around in anger when, in fact, they have had a pro-nuclear policy ever since the Ranger inquiry in the 1970s. They were the ones who began the uranium mining and the export of uranium. They were the ones who have supported the very industry which lies at the basis of both the civil and military nuclear program. For a short time the government took an ethical position. The Labor Party had a policy of opposing uranium mining and export but it too adopted a very pragmatic position later on and its present position is totally indefensible.What we have had today from Senator Hill is simply more arm waving. He is talking about who did what and when, not what should have been done. That is the important point. I remind the Senate that yesterday, when we raised this matter through seeking a suspension of standing orders, we raised the really important issue of whether Australia should continue to mine and export uranium and, particularly, to send that uranium to France, underpinning the very industry which is now the basis of those nuclear tests in the Pacific. We found that, with the exception of the Greens, this whole Senate—as a body—sat on this side of the chamber and voted against the suspension of standing orders.Those people did not want to debate the really important issue of what might be done effectively to send a message to France that in things nuclear we totally separate ourselves from what the French are doing and what other nations are now threatening to do—although I see from this mornings newspaper that the US seems to be drawing back from further nuclear tests. That is the issue that should be debated here, not whether the minister took action this week or last week and whether that action was weak—as it was. We accept the oppositions statement that what the minister said was clearly sending a message to France that Australia was not serious about taking significant action against the French.We stress again that our party since 1977 has consistently taken a position of opposing the mining and export of uranium because of the position we now find ourselves in. The minister may well speak in a moment. He will point to the non-proliferation treaty and other things, but they are bits of paper which have no ability whatsoever—as we see with these tests and as the minister in his reply has indicated—to restrict the use of the uranium that Australia sends to other countries once it has left our shores. There is no ability to control that.We know that even under the NPT it is possible for a country to make all the hardware for a nuclear weapon, short of actually arming it, go through the processes of giving notice, withdraw from the NPT in six months, put plutonium into the bomb and explode its weapons. There is no protection in the sorts of paper agreements to which the minister has drawn attention on a number of previous occasions.The issue is what substantive action Australia should take to indicate not only to France, but to the rest of the world, that we will not participate in any way in any part of this nuclear fuel cycle, bearing in mind that there are clear links between the civil and military programs, links which are indicated by the reticence of the Americans to support the sale of Russian reactors to Iran and the concerns we have expressed over the sale of nuclear reactors to North Korea. There are clear links and we should desist from that uranium mining and export.We have not made the enormous profits predicted back in the 1970s. There has not been the predicted expansion in the mining industry. It is not a great booming industry for Australia and I believe that for very good reasons we should withdraw from that industry.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[14]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
85,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CHAMARETTE","SN5","(Western Australia)","GWA","N/A",1660,"—I wish to take note of the inadequacy of the response of Senator Gareth Evans to the question put by Senator Hill. That also applies to Senator Alstons and my questions. I reiterate that the response of this government—and the foreign minister in particular—to the resumption of nuclear testing was totally weak and inadequate. We have to ask: does it really represent foreign policy or is it representing the kind of fancy diplomatic footwork that was described in Senator Evanss answers? It raises the other question of where and how we derive our foreign policy. Senator Evans did not answer my question which asked whether he was aware how out of touch he is with the people of Australia. That is what I would like to mention here.Where does the attitude of the population of Australia come into determining the strength of the stance that is going to be taken by the Australian government and the foreign minister on this issue? Basically, Senator Evans has found himself in the position of defending the indefensible, and we have to ask what was achieved by the fancy diplomatic footwork and the courtesies of international discourse that he described so repetitively and eloquently to us.I would like to comment on the French news on SBS last Sunday. The news described the New Zealand people as `a little bit nervous and said that `they seem to have an allergy to the atomic bomb. However, the foreign minister of France, Herve de Charette, speaking from Canada, reassured us. He said, `My Australian colleague, he understands. Is that the kind of foreign policy we want to see reflected on the world stage? The achievement that Senator Evans said he made at this delegation in Paris, that the French government will eventually cease after they have done eight more tests, is the same position that the French government took in its initial statement about what it intended to do.I want to continue with the statements of the French foreign minister on the SBS news on Sunday. Before Senator Evans had even reached Paris, the French foreign minister said, `You dont understand. There are two decisions made by President Chirac and one is much more important than the other. The first is we are just going to have eight little atomic bomb tests in Mururoa Atoll, and the second is that definitivement we will be ceasing in May. That is no consolation to the people of Australia, New Zealand and the South Pacific. It must not continue.No one in the region will be happy with the French governments stance, or the stance that has been reflected by this government, until the position of the French government changes so that there will not be a resumption of underground nuclear bomb testing in Mururoa Atoll or by any other country anywhere else in the world. It is a planetary position we hold, and we have to take care of the planet.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[15]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
86,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator TEAGUE","PJ4","(South Australia)","LP","N/A",1660,"—The point that the parliament is making is that the French tests must stop. The criticism of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) and of this government is demonstrated by the credibility and the representativeness of Senator Hills question today, his supplementary question and his motion to take note of the ministers inadequate answer. Even the silence from the ministers own colleagues behind him indicate the criticism from within his own party ranks, let alone the Left caucus of the Labor Party, let alone the eloquent speeches by Senator Chamarette and Senator Coulter.I support entirely Senator Hills remarks. I reiterate that the Australian public in the last two weeks has been so outraged by the way the Australian government has let down the national interest that it has made this an issue which will hang around the neck of the minister and the government. It is only rarely that foreign policy issues become election issues and I put it to the minister, in reiterating the protest from every part of this chamber, that, for his inadequate answer today, his inadequate action since the election of the new President of France who has declared his intention to renew atomic testing in the South Pacific, the Australian public will hold him and the government accountable.The minister may well say, `Life is unfair. He may say that he has been working flat out, had two hours sleep, had six years as foreign minister, achieved enormous gains—with bipartisan support on most issues, such as the NPT conference relevant to this matter, such as pressure for disarmament, such as, with Senator McMullan, pressure on the French with regard to agricultural subsidies in Europe, and so on. Despite all that, when a major mistake is made, this parliament and the people of Australia know it. We require of this minister and this government a more substantial response. There needs to be some mea culpa that there was an opportunity to act and there was no action.The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade happened to meet two weeks ago with the French ambassador. It is not appropriate for the private discussion between all members of the committee and the French ambassador to be disclosed here, because it was a private meeting. I can only speak with regard to my own statements to the French ambassador. This occurred before the decision to test was made. I say it now because it is also on the public record that I was not alone as a parliamentarian in saying to the representative of France in this country before the decision to test: `There are three issues, ambassador, that detract from what can be an excellent relationship between Australia and France, and they have been longstanding. The three issues are, firstly, your intention to continue nuclear tests in the South Pacific, which we totally object to, which all parts of the parliament totally reject; secondly, you have a continuing colonial record in the South Pacific and it is time that that colonial record was finished and there was independence for the peoples of the South Pacific; and the third issue is the common agricultural policy and Frances role, along with the others in the European Union, to act unfairly against Australia with regard to agricultural imports. The ambassador heard those protests loudly and clearly, not least from me, a member of the Australia-France friendship group within this parliament.I put it to you as credibly as I can, minister, that Senator Hills motion to take note of your answer and all the remarks he made are well understood by this parliament. This government has been found wanting. This is a matter that has the publics attention in Australia and a great deal more substance needs to be given to it by you and your government.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[16]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
87,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator GARETH EVANS","VD4","(Victoria-","ALP","Minister for Foreign Affairs)",1661,"—Senator Hill stated quite inaccurately that a specific commitment or statement was made during the election by the Chirac candidacy that the tests would resume. That is not so. The point was constantly made during the election that a decision would be made on the basis of technical advice from the military as to whether computer simulation was sufficiently far enough advanced to enable stockpile safety to be ensured without the matter of testing. Of course, there was a degree of scepticism about that in the international community which we shared. We wrote accordingly at the highest levels and made representations at the highest available levels in order to try to stave off a decision that did seem to be very likely. But there was no explicit statement made, as I have described, and we did do our best to head it off.When the decision was made we responded in the way that I have described. I think it has been constantly overlooked that in that initial Tokyo reaction of mine I was very explicit about the nature of Australias deploring and condemning. On 14 June 1995 I stated:The French decision to resume tests is not unexpected but it is very deeply disappointing. It will undermine the respect and credibility that France has been rebuilding for itself in the South Pacific. It will certainly cloud the atmosphere for the comprehensive test ban treaty talks which are so important in Geneva in the months ahead and it will reinforce the doubts and the scepticism of those who are not keen on the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, the most important arms control mechanism we have internationally which has just been indefinitely renewed. Australia will be making very clear how much it deplores the decision with a variety of appropriate responses including of course direct public statements and direct communication with the French government combined with the decision to freeze defence contacts with France at their present level.Without going into any more detail about that, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the text of the rest of that transcript of the press conference and, indeed, the subsequent one, which puts all the various remarks I made in their total context, which I do not think anyone has really given me the courtesy of doing in the press reporting so far.Leave granted.The documents read as follows —Journalist: Those other actions, other than those direct representations to France, what will they comprise?Minister: Essentially the decision to freeze defence contacts means just that. We wont go beyond the contacts that already exist. It is not a matter of severing any of those contacts because many of them are beneficial to the people of the South Pacific in particular because they involve cooperation in maritime surveillance, disaster relief and the operational cooperation that goes with that. To the extent, for example, that we have been beginning to think about new levels of cooperation, joint exercises, new research and development defence agreements and so on. They will certainly will be put very much on hold, any further consideration of those kind of things until the tests have run their course.Journalist: The French arent likely to really respond to something like that. I mean you wrote to President Chirac, the Prime Minister wrote to him. They have never listened before. They obviously dont place a great deal of stake in the relationship with Australia and the South Pacific countries. Isnt this just an example of bristling rather than a muscle-bound response?Minister: Well, its very doubtful that a muscle-bound response as you describe it could possibly have any significant impact. Ive heard that Mr Downer, for example, is talking about sending a frigate. Well, this is adolescent grandstanding of the worst kind. I know that the Libs are still constitutional monarchists but that kind of Victorian gunboat stuff went out about a century ago. It reminds me of the grand old Duke of York taking his troops to the top of the hill and marching them back again. What on earth could that accomplish.What we are talking about here are appropriately proportionate responses to the nature of the decision that France has made. We deplore the decision, we are disappointed by it. At the same time we do acknowledge that the context in which these tests will be taking place is really very different from that in which they have taken place in the past. There are some very clear assurances that they will be limited in number, limited in duration and they have been accompanied by a very clear statement of commitment by President Chirac to conclude the negotiations of a full-scale comprehensive test ban treaty by next year. If that is the case, then I think that it is important that we recognise that the context is different and to that extent respond in the way we are proposing.Journalist: Are you saying that the French decision to go ahead then is not as bad as what it could have been?Minister: Exactly. If the testing had been open ended, if it had been unaccompanied by any commitment to participate in test ban treaty negotiations, if the tests had been directed towards the generation of new higher-level weapons capability rather than simply stockpile stewardship which is the rationale for the tests were told mainly to ensure their safety and reliability of their existing weapon stocks, then the context then would have been obviously very, very different from that which we now confront.It is still a matter of acute disappointment to us that the moratorium has been broken because the moratorium was an important component in creating the atmospherics for the successful outcome of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty review conference in New York and the moratorium was a very important element in Frances own foreign policy relations with the countries of this region and it was an important element in creating the confidence for test ban treaty negotiations to move ahead quickly. So, for all those reasons the moratorium was important and the breach of the moratorium is to be deplored. But, lets keep it in context nonetheless.Journalist: I am just surprised that you think its not as bad as it could have been because the response in Australia and New Zealand is a highly emotional one where people are outraged and they are not only just outraged that the French arent listening to what we are saying, theyre concerned about the possible health effects for the region and things like that. And they see it as bad as it could possibly be, not that it really could have been worse.Minister: I think you have just got to keep these things in proportion. We are talking about underground tests, were not talking about atmospheric tests and as such the health implications of that remains to be proven beyond doubt that there is a serious and widespread impact. We are, of course, concerned that that issue has not been proved beyond doubt but there is no doubt equally that the issue is less serious in terms of health impact beyond the immediate lagoon that it might be if the tests were being done on a different basis. So you have got to keep that in proportion and it is important to keep in proportion and very much in the centre of your mind the fact that we are talking about limited duration limited number and the commitment to go down the track of the treaty. If people are not prepared to see the significance of those limits then that is unfortunate. It just has to be acknowledged and recognised as part of the total picture that we are confronted with.Journalist: Do you see this in a different light from the recent Chinese tests?Minister: Not really, of course. I think that both countries are equally to blame to the extent that they are continuing testing. The chinese never committed themselves to a moratorium so to that extent they are behaving no worse than they always have. Equally the Chinese however have committed themselves also to participating in the treaty negotiations and concluding that treaty by next year. So the Chinese tests are themselves finite in duration. Moreover, they are not taking place in the South Pacific, in someone elses part of the world—they are taking place in China. But these carefully modulated distinctions are really not all that much to the point. We have been very strong in our condemnation of the Chinese tests and I hope there is no doubt about the strength of our feeling in relation to the French tests.Journalist; The ACTU this morning, Vice President George Campbell, said that he supported the idea of a boycott of French products. Do you think that thats a good idea for maybe Australian households to do that?Minister: I dont think that it is going to make any practical difference to French behaviour or to be frank, the French economy. But if it makes people feel that thats an effective way of communicating a sense of personal outrage and protest, then I wouldnt suggest otherwise.Journalist: The treaty between the United States and North Korea, also on the nuclear issue. Are you happy with that?Minister: Weve been very happy indeed with the outcome of those negotiations some months ago and we are monitoring very carefully the further negotiations that are now taking place to put all that into effect. What was involved there was a very sensible outcome. You have got a very firm commitment on the one from North Korea that it will open up its nuclear establishments to full scale inspection thus giving us all confidence that they will not be able to proceed with any kind of weapons program in return for that, the Koreans are getting something—assistance for their own future energy requirements in the form of civil nuclear reactors properly safeguard I think that all the circumstances, given the volatility of the peninsula, given the fears that we had about that situation very seriously deteriorating, it has been a very good result.Journalist: Back to the French testing. Australias chair of the South Pacific forum this year. Do you imagine that you might actually suggest some kind of concerted action to protest the French decision?Minister: The Prime Minister, as chairman of the forum, is presently consulting with forum countries to see how they want to respond to all of this and what further measures they want to take, if any. I dont think I should pre-empt that particular process. But certainly the strength of feeling in the South Pacific countries is very strong on this and of course we understand that and share that.Journalist: This morning your New Zealand counterpart described the French decision as an example of Napoleonic Gaullist arrogance. Is that how you would describe it?Minister: You do appreciate that the New Zealanders feel particularly strongly about this as a result of the Rainbow Warrior affair. Not very many years ago they were on the receiving end of a particular brand of hubris from the French and I guess the memory of that still lingers.I wouldnt want to put it in those terms. I simply want to express the governments acute disappointment, that the fact that we deplore the decision to resume, the fact that we do think it is counter-productive to the larger objectives we are seeking, mainly adherence to the non-proliferation treaty and all the achievement of the comprehensive test ban treaty and I dont think we can make our position any clearer than that.Question: On the idea of the frigate. Why is the frigate such a bad idea? It could effectively stop something we are all opposed to.Minister: I am not sure how you or Mr Downer or anybody else is suggesting that the presence of a frigate in international waters would stop anything. It is a symbolic gesture and symbolic gestures have their place in international affairs but I think its an empty gesture and one that is quite unlikely to have any substantive impact and as such is back in the realm of feel-good politics rather than feel-good diplomacy, rather than anything that could possibly make a difference.The French are in no doubt about how strongly we feel about this. We have made endlessly clear in very direct talks and representations that I have had, that the Prime Minister has had going back now for the whole period. It was always on the cards that this policy would be changed with a change of government, once President Mitterand, the Socialist President, left office and the Conservatives were in power across the spectrum. One consoling thing about all of this is that the decision has obviously been wrestled with rather than just instantly taken and that it is accompanied by these important qualifications limiting the duration of the tests to May next year, limiting the number to eight and accompanied with a very firm commitment to negotiate and conclude by next year a comprehensive test ban treaty. That is a very important difference from the situation the last time round when these tests were underway. I think while still expressing our objections and protest to this in unequivocal terms, we should acknowledge the differences.REVISEDTRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE BY SENATOR GARETH EVANS RE FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTS HELD AT IMPERIAL HOTEL ON FRIDAY 16 JUNE 1995GE:Youve seen the Prime Ministers press release by now, earlier today, announcing the core composition of the delegation from the South Pacific that I will be leading to Paris on Monday, leaving Japan tomorrow for that purpose. The decision to send such a mission follows an initial conversation I had with the French Foreign Minister two nights ago; a long conversation in which I covered all the substantive grounds about objections and raised with him the possibility of such a delegation and urged him to receive it at as short notice as possible. Thats been able to come together and I will be leading it as I say.The object of that delegation is to convey, unequivocally and unambiguously, the distaste and resentment which does exist right around the South Pacific region about the French decision to resume nuclear tests. The arguments that we will be putting to the French Government are essentially threefold, seeking reconsideration of the decision. First, that the decision involves a really quite fundamental breach of faith with all those countries who worked so hard to secure the indefinite extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty just a few weeks ago and did so for the reason, among others, that the Nuclear Weapons States said that they would exercise the utmost restraint so far as nuclear testing was concerned in the future, until such time as the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is negotiated. The NPT has, of course, been in existence for twenty years. It is the most important single arms control and disarmament treaty we have, and it is absolutely crucial that its credibility remain intact if its effectiveness is not to be diluted, and that is a very important consideration.Secondly, we will be arguing, so far as the negotiation of the new Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is concerned—it doesnt yet exist; it is not in place, there is no legal obligation to stop anyone testing; we have got to try and put that in place that this decision poisons the atmosphere for those negotiations in Geneva which are still at a very sensitive and delicate stage and do involve, among others of course, countries other than the nuclear weapons states themselves. To the extent that they are as upset as we all are by this test resumption decision, it is going to make it that much harder to get a negotiated outcome within the time frame that we are all seekingThirdly, we will be arguing that this does involve a really quite serious breach of faith with the countries of the South Pacific who have made as clear as they possibly could their concern about these tests taking place in their own neighbourhood. We have made clear our concerns—particularly the environmental consequences, the dangers that could be obviously be associated with any accident during the context of the tests, and in particular the longer term, really unforeseeable, dangers associated with possible leakage from the underground rock structures, coral structures that are housing the tests. We are concerned that those consequences could occur. And we believe that if the French are as confident as they say they are that there is no risk of accident, there is no long term possibility of this kind of leakage occurring, then why dont they hold the tests on a farm in Provence or down a mine shaft in Picardy.That is the case that we will be putting. We will be putting it very clearly, very directly and seeking of course a reconsideration of the decision on that basis. There wont be any room for doubts—ifs, buts or maybes—about where Australia or any other South Pacific country stands on this, just as there has never been any room for such doubts in the past.Q:The other day Senator you said that you didnt think these tests were—Ive forgotten the exact words—but the decision to recommence the testing wasnt as bad as what it could have been, yet Australia is now leading a delegation to Paris. What brought about the changes of mind?GE:The other day I made exactly the same points as I have made today. I said that Australia deplored the test resumption; I said we were unequivocal in our concern about that and the way in which we responded to it; I outlined briefly, but clearly, I thought the particular reasons for our concern and I do not think there can be any doubt about the strength of our position. I notice that Don McKinnon, the New Zealand Foreign Minister (who hasnt been criticised at all so far as I am aware, for the way in which he has made the case) said in a radio interview, about the same time as I was talking to you, that, and I quote Certainly I dont see this in the same parallel as the late 60s or early 70s—of atmospheric tests or unlimited tests out in front of you: he made that point in various ways, that there were obvious contextual distinctions between then and now. I was simply explaining that that is why our response was a proportionate one, one that was appropriate to the nature of the sin that was being presently committed. But it didnt in any way then, nor does it now, effect the strength of our basic position. We are prepared to acknowledge what has to be acknowledged because that is the role in which you conduct diplomacy, that is the way you are most effective, most persuasive—not by being raucous, and refusing to acknowledge what can be said on the other side of the equation. But having acknowledged that, we keep on coming back to the basic point that these tests do appear to be unnecessary and they do appear to be counter-productive in terms of the major concerns we have about the effectiveness and credibility of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. And there are very major concerns we also have about being able to get a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty actually negotiated into place.Q:Senator do you see that there is any chance at all of getting the French to stop these particular tests?GE:All I can do is hope that when confronted directly, face to face, with those countries who do feel most strongly about this, who cant be just dismissed as being across the other side of the world, but are sitting, there right in front of the relevant Ministers. I can only hope that under those circumstances France will be prepared to reconsider.Q:Are you a pussycat? Mr Howard said you were a pussycat. You seem to have come out harder today than what you did the other day against the French. A few days ago you were willing to put their side and very much put it in the context of for a limited duration and limited tests and so on?GE:I think my record as Foreign Minister stands reasonable comparison against Mr Howards and Mr Downers in the international sphere, and I am prepared to be judged at any time by my achievements so far. It is very easy to succumb to the temptation, particularly if you are an opportunistic politician engaged in a domestic campaign, to engage in raucous chest-beating. But my particular responsibility as Foreign Minister is to be as persuasive and as effective as I can be with the Countries out there who are actually making the decisions that affect us and affect the countries in our neighbourhood. And I believe, from long experience at doing this sort of thing, that I can be most effective over the long haul in adopting an approach which is reasonably measured, but which nonetheless is coldly meticulous when it comes to Putting the arguments, and going to the questions of substance which have to be addressed. Others can be firing emotional bullets, and it is no bad thing that the French now realise the extent of the sheer raw emotion that exists out there in the South Pacific and in Australia. But in terms of the way in which I conduct the argument with the French, I have got to conduct it as a Foreign Minister, and not as an opportunistic, political brawler.Q:Is that the same sort of message you would have for the Labor Party Caucus as well?GE:I think the Caucus well understands the particular tightrope that I have to walk, and that I have always had to walk, in arguing the case as effectively as I can, to advance Australias national interests. I think the Caucus well understands that there is no doubt about the substance of our position. I think they also understand the distinctions that I was making in order to describe why it is we are responding in the way we are on this occasion, as compared with other previous events. I think they do understand that we had very real fears about this Chirac Government, given the previous track record of 148 underground tests initiated after the atmospheric ones were abandoned, and all the rhetoric that led up to the campaign. I think Caucus and everybody else that has been following the details of this, understands that there were very real fears that this new Government, new Presidency, would walk away altogether from not only the Test Ban Treaty, but any commitment to limit tests in the future. I think there was a real fear that we would be back into a situation of open-ended tests, and the development of new Generation weapons technology. Mercifully it seems—as a result of the kind of lobbying and the argument that I and others have been meticulously mounting over a long, period of time, the case we have been making, of the Test Ban Treaty—that at least we are not going down that path. I think Caucus can see the total complexity of this. But none of that diminishes the need for strong, direct and effective communication of the basic point here in issue; that these tests are not only intrinsically dangerous particularly because of the risk of accident and particularly because of the long-term (maybe five hundred years away but nonetheless real) risk of leakage in the area, but there is concern about those things but it is a concern also about the very real negative impact on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty that makes these tests indefensible. It is a complex balance of issues, and I think my position is strengthened in arguing this through with the French if I acknowledge what has to be acknowledged and do so frankly and directly but then, on that foundation, make the case that has to be made coldly, logically, meticulously, about why it is that this decision really does need fundamental reconsideration—in the interests of Frances credibility in the region; in the interests of Frances credibility in the world, and in the interests of the disarmament and arms control objectives that we are all supposed to share.Q:Senator Evans, do you feel that the other nuclear (inaudible)?GE:Yes I do. I think the US and the UK could be more direct and explicit in making the case for the negative implications of this for the test ban negotiations and for the effect on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Russia has been reasonably explicit, and critical, I understand in what it has said. China of course hasnt offered a squeak on the subject because China is, at the moment, going on testing—although it too has at least said that it will stop an embark upon the CTBT negotiations with a view to producing that outcome in 1996. But I do think a little bit of consistency is required around the world in the response of the nuclear powers. They cant change their tune—one week making a case for indefinite extension at the NPT and three weeks later being mute on the subject of a possible undermining of the credibility of just that operation. Consistency is a virtue in all sorts of places of course: I would have thought Mr Soorly might have been contemplating severing some sister city relationships in China as well as in France. But I suppose that is too much task of any politician even a Labor oneQ:Do you think your focus is principally to now lead the South Pacific nations Paris and focus entirely on the French Government. Will you then spend a effort on getting some of these other countries on board. Are you going to see the British, talk to the British, talk to the Americans?GE:I havent thought of being able to do that on this particular trip but maybe that will be possible. It sows a useful seed actually. We have certainly made the point diplomatically, through official channels, as to the reaction that we think is appropriate to the resumption. Whether a more direct ministerial response would be helpful I dont know. It does seem that the US and UK have rather taken the view that these further tests are the price that has got to be paid in order to get Frances adherence, under its now presidency, to the Comprehensive Test Ban, and they seem to be regarding that as the major game, and the major achievement. But for all the reasons I have spelt out to you, I think there may well be a case for them going in harder, there may well be a case for us urging them to do so. I think probably the opportunity has obviously been there with the G7 meeting taking place in Halifax—and Mr Clinton has obviously raised the matter with Mr Chirac, but whether anything more than that I dont know.Q:And lastly do you see that the US is actually going to (inaudible)?GE:No there is absolutely no sign of that. The US have conducted a very large number of tests, which is of course the point that France is making, I think that their current simulation technology, their capacity to operate stockpile stewardship—ie ensuring the safety and the reliability of the stocks so long as they exist—that that capacity is there without the need for the tests, to ensure that. They were prepared to make that decision and I am sure that President Clinton will stick to that.Q:Today there were two tonnes of manure dumped on the driveway of the French Embassy in Canberra and there have been various other shows of protest from Australians. Do you feel as though you have underestimated the strength of feeling about this issue in Australia?GE:Well that strength of feeling has always been there. I think it did become muted over the years as those successive tests took place. I dont know, up until April 1992, how many press releases I put out deploring tests when they occurred, at pretty monotonous intervals, as those 148 underground tests took place between 1975 and 1992, a lot of them in the years that I was Foreign Minister. Certainly during, that particular period there wasnt much in the way of community reaction each time that occurred, although there had been of course ten years ago at the time of the Rainbow Warrior affair. I think however that France having made the decision to go down the moratorium path, having created expectations that that was the course it would follow in the future, and with the test ban issue being such a prominent one at the time of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty arguments just a few weeks ago, the profile of the issue has been raised all over again. It is not surprising, accordingly, that public reaction has been strong, and I think it is important that the French Government understand the strength and intensity and breadth of that community reaction. I will certainly be doing my best to communicate some of the sense of that to the French Government, as indeed I did in talking to the French Foreign Minister by phone the other night.Q:You seem to have worn the brunt of criticism in Australia on all the front pages and so on today. Do you think that is unfair, do you think you can do the right thing in the publics eyes when you go to France?GE:Well thats a matter for your judgment. I have been around this game long enough to know that the press always personalises everything whether things are a matter of government decision, cabinet decision or a committee decision as the case may be they are nonetheless always personalised, in the form of the particular minister, who has got to carry the can. I have got a good enough understanding of the way the system works to acknowledge that reality. Any response that was a proportionate one, that was in any way a moderated one, was obviously going to generate some significant and noisy reaction and criticism on the grounds that it wasnt going far enough. But I have spent my life, the whole of my political life as Foreign Minister, wearing this. During the whole of the negotiations over the implementation of the peace plan for Cambodia, and still, I have been wearing the brunt of considerable criticisms from those who thought I had been wimpish about the Khmer Rouge. I think history is proving that wrong and similarly other judgments might change when people get a better sense of the complexity of some of the issues and some of the responsibilities that I have to balance as Foreign Minister. My basic responsibility as Foreign Minister, I repeat, is simply to communicate, as effectively and persuasively as I can, the basic core arguments to the people that are actually going to have to make the decision, other governments. I will exercise that responsibility as professionally and responsibly as I can. If it means on occasions that I have to carry a few cans, well so be it,Q:Did you get any reading here, while you have been in Japan, whether the Japanese are prepared to take this up at a high level?GE:Well I think the Japanese protest has really been very strong in diplomatic terms. Whether it is strong enough for the assembled hordes of the fourth estate here or in Australia or anywhere else, that is a matter for your own judgment. But it has been tough, it has been direct, as you would expect.Q:For example, against China (inaudible)GE:Well I dont think they grant aid to France. You have to recognise the limited armoury of effective responses available to you in these situations. And in the diplomatic lexicon to deplore, to condemn, to say the sorts of things we have been saying is about as tough as you can get when it comes to the message-sending business. And we are in the message sending business, we are in the persuasion business, not in the gunboat business, despite some nostalgia to that effect in the Opposition.Q:How do you rate the measures that have been announced from Governments such as freezing defence cooperation (inaudible)?GE:As the Prime Minister has said, Bob McMullan, and every other Minister who has had responsibility for the carriage of this, these measures are proportionate, they are appropriate for the situation as we find it. To the extent that individual consumers do want to make their outrage known—through boycotting their Camembert, tipping their Veuve Cliquot down the sink, or burning their knickers outside the Erotica shop, whatever the chosen route happens to be, if that is the way you want to express it, well that is an effective way of, I guess, recording a personal protest, and of sending a message at least to the French Government about the extent of that emotional reaction. The truth of the matter, as I said the other day, and as everyone has said, is that the nature of Australias economic relationship with France is such that any economic boycott of this kind, instituted on a wide spread scale, much more widespread trade sanctions, would be no doubt utterly unproductive and only end up hurting ourselves, without having any redeeming effect on the decision-making process. That is a judgment that you constantly have to make, but I think the balance is about right in terms of our response.Q:(Inaudible)GE:As I said the other day, as I say again, France has put at risk the respect and credibility that it had rebuilt in the region in the last few years after the very difficult time it had as a consequence of the Rainbow Warrior affair and concerns about its stewardship in New Caledonia and elsewhere, not to mention of course the tests themselves. France had re-created, I think, an image for itself as a good neighbour and a good regional citizen, and it has unequivocally and unquestionably put that reputation and image at risk by this action. And that is one of the messages I will be communicating. The response over and over again from the South Pacific countries, including ourselves, is simply this: if you are that confident that these tests run no risk of accident, run no risk of long term environmental damage, why arent you conducting them on a farm in Provence or down a mineshaft in Picardy rather than on a coral atoll in the South Pacific. Its a very hard question to answer. But its a question that should go on being asked.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[17]/speech/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

It was because I was thinking of how I would handle that further communication with the French government, and wanted to make it most effective and as persuasive as I could in terms of the way that these things are done in practice, that I did spell out the total context of the decision in relatively muted and moderate terms rather than move into Andrew Peacock angry faces and general posturing.

It is important to appreciate that this sort of dialogue does produce some results. In the first place, we have had an absolutely unequivocal assurance from the French government. It was ambiguous before this exchange I had that these eight tests, adding on to the 175 that have already occurred at Mururoa, will not be for the purpose of new generation weapons technology. That was left ambiguous before I met the French. The point had been made that the tests were for certain purposes—to test computer simulation technology and stockpile reliability—but it was not said specifically that they were not for new generation technology. That is the most crucial thing about the tests in terms of their overall significance for arms control.Secondly, I did get a repetition, obviously, of the assurance that they would sign the comprehensive test ban treaty in 1996, as President Chirac had said. I wanted to find out what sort of treaty they were going to be prepared to sign. If the French were going to hold out for some sort of impossible criteria so far as the definition of tests and so on are concerned—if they are going to go down the track of arguing that a 500-tonne T-equivalent explosion is okay as a permissible test—it would not be worth having these bits of paper, as Christabel Chamarette and others are saying. I did get some assurances that, at least as a result of these further tests, Frances position on that would be very much more moderate than would otherwise have been the case. I think that was an important gain.I got some further assurances that they would take seriously the whole question of SPNFZ, the South Pacific Rarotonga treaty accession, which until now they have been contemptuously dismissive of. I got some further assurances that they would consider seriously the closure of Mururoa after this test ban is completed. I said that their credibility will not amount to much if—","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[17]/speech/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

I repeat that it was the very process that we were recommended to engage in by Mr Howard, when he first opened his mouth on the subject before he put his wet finger in the air and discerned an element of electoral opportunity.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[17]/speech/talk.start[5]/para","N/A","N/A"

101,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MARGETTS","DX5","(Western Australia)","GWA","N/A",1669,"—I want to ask a few questions in relation to the answers given by Senator Gareth Evans during question time. First of all, why did Australia jump to lead the delegation of the South Pacific diplomats who, as we mentioned, were not South Pacific ministers? I would answer that it is part of the whole process and part of the whole problem. Instead of taking the time to listen to the South Pacific countries, Australia has jumped in in this manner to control the outcome of this delegation of the South Pacific Forum by taking diplomats whom the minister clearly had rank over.It seems to me that Australia is doing it. Why? Because there was to be a proposed trade-off. What is that trade-off? What will you give us if we accept your eight tests? What will you promise to do? In fact, it was exactly in todays answers that there was an indication that the trade-off would be to try to get France to toe the line in relation to the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. We know that we are being treated with contempt, and we know that the countries of the South Pacific are also being treated with contempt, because the definitions are being fiddled with.What is `comprehensive? `Comprehensive means that the nuclear powers will be restricted. Once again, just like the NPT, the nuclear powers will be allowed to update or maintain their own stocks and have tests of a certain size. It seems that the trade-off is not a trade-off at all. The trade-off is not in any way going to strengthen a comprehensive test ban treaty. The trade-off is more likely to put the whole test ban treaty off the rails altogether.Australia will share that responsibility if the comprehensive test ban treaty goes off the rails. Why? Because everybody is going to look and say, `We dont take this seriously. Were not judging the action in itself. Were judging it in the same way that the government considers it should operate in parliament—that is, to do trade-offs which are leading to something else, which we all know do not lead to a result. We are not standing on principle. We are not denying the principle of testing. We are saying, `If we accept your testing, what will you give us?It seems to me that we are selling off the vast majority of the people of Australia. But not only that. By taking this colonial attitude with relation to the South Pacific Forum, we are actually perpetuating the whole problem. The nub of the problem in relation to Mururoa is that the people of Mururoa are being denied access to a life. The people of the South Pacific are being denied access to their rights to a reasonable environment, to health, to safety, to the future of their country, and to fishing safely and so on in the future. That is what we are trading off here. The reality is that it is no trade-off at all, because France will be standing laughing at Australias position in relation to how `reasonable Australia is acting.What we have already done is traded off the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Australia delivered Indonesia. What was the trade-off? Was it guaranteed access to uranium? Does that mean Australia guarantees that—no matter what Indonesia does, no matter what other countries do, no matter what areas they may take in towards developing nuclear weapons, no matter how dangerous their program might be in relation to their nuclear power program, no matter what they do—we have to supply uranium if companies in Australia negotiate to do that? Is that the trade-off? Is that why we are sitting here, pretending we are doing something, having given away any real ability to negotiate in the future?If the government can say that we do still have the ability not to supply uranium to a country simply because it has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and is saying it is using that for its power program, if the government can say that Australia has left itself with the ability to say no—no matter what else that country is doing—it had better say it and had better say it pretty clearly, because it is in no way clear to the international community.

110,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,"Senator Cook","RF4","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","—The ready consensus that was achieved across the table informally was that, since a number of speakers had chosen to participate in this debate and since Senator Gareth Evans had the burden of replying to most of them, he should be allowed a bit beyond the standard five minutes in order to make a more comprehensive defence of his position. The chamber acted in a fair and reasonable way, recognising that the extra time he would take in the half hour set aside to take note of answers would deprive other senators of their time.The governments view was that we should extend the half-hour envelope to enable the additional time granted to Senator Evans to be extended to other senators who might want to speak. My understanding is that Senator Kernot has indicated that she wants to do that. There is an extra minute or so available to do that. If she does not take all that time, other senators can speak in the remaining—admittedly short—period.However, we now have an attempt to change the standing orders in relation to the total amount of time set aside for taking note so that other political points can be scored. There are four senators in the opposition to decide who takes priority in taking note. If others had wanted to take note they could have risen in their places and done so, displacing some of the other opposition senators already on the list. If they have not done that, that is their choice. Standing orders are quite clear: there is half an hour. In this case, there was special dispensation but there should not be exploitation of that, extending the whole concept of taking note because some senators have missed out today.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[18]/speech/interject[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Senator Crowley refused to answer my question and spent her time talking about the previous National Party government in Queensland. That was quite irrelevant to my question.My question related to the survey by the Queensland Council of Social Services into poverty. The survey was undertaken in 1994 and it raised a number of specific issues which I mentioned in my question. The low socio-economic group of people in Acacia Ridge in Brisbane was included in the survey. It is an area with a high poverty rate and people have difficulty in getting to hospitals because of inadequate public transport. The people interviewed in the Blackwater area of Central Queensland in 1994, during the term of the Goss Labor Government and the current federal government, said that the local hospital was like a bandaid way station and that they had to travel significant distances to get medical treatment. At the Kowanyama Aboriginal community there are no maternal medical facilities.If this is the record of the Goss Labor government and the current federal government on social justice issues, heaven help Australia. Mr Howe was lauded for the great job he has done. The unemployment rates in Queensland for youth and the long-term unemployed are higher than anywhere else in Australia.

115,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ELLISON","9X5","(Western Australia)","LP","N/A",1672,"—I move:That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) to a question without notice asked by Senator Ellison this day, relating to the procedures of the Department of Foreign Affairs for protecting Australians when overseas.The situation is this: in the last six years we have had some very unfortunate circumstances where Australians overseas have been in desperate need of assistance because they have been hijacked, held hostage or imprisoned. I refer to 1989 when Miss Jacqueline Hamill was taken hostage by some prisoners in the Philippines and subsequently murdered. I refer to David Wilson who was taken hostage in Cambodia and subsequently murdered. I refer to the case of Robert Bowra, a businessman from Western Australia who was trying to sell Australian-made boats in the Middle East and who had the misfortune to be involved in an accident which resulted in the death of a local citizen. Mr Bowra was subsequently imprisoned for six months. If Robert Bowra had been in Australia he would not have been liable to any criminal sanction at all. We have the case of Mr Maresh who died in Timor. There was a subsequent inquiry in relation to that matter.When Australians travel overseas they need the assurance that their government will do everything in its power to look after them and safeguard their interests. All the coalition is asking for is that there be an inquiry into how the Department of Foreign Affairs handles these incidents. I highlight the most dramatic examples to illustrate the point. There have been complaints about the departments handling of these matters and they cannot go unnoticed.What I am saying to the Minister for Foreign Affairs is that, if he is dinkum, let us leave aside the big picture and let us look at individual Australians and their families and see how they can be better serviced overseas by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Let us look at how the department has handled these particular instances where Australians have been in dire straits. That is all we are asking for—nothing more, nothing less—just an assessment of the departments handling of these situations.

In 1990, when the Iraqis invaded Kuwait, I had a relative, Mr Greg Pollock, who was the husband of my sister-in-law, in Kuwait. He was taken hostage and held as a hostage for five months—first in Kuwait and then later in Baghdad. At the time, honourable senators will recall that there was a lot of public criticism about the action or supposed inaction taken by the government of the day. There was also criticism levelled at the Minister for Foreign Affairs.In these circumstances obviously families under distress and the public believe that, because they do not see public demonstrations or public action being taken, no action is being taken. On that occasion, and I believe on all other occasions, what was done behind the scenes, what was done in the department and what was done in the embassies was as much as was humanly possible to be done by the government and by the governments representatives. I can say that because I know that it occurred in that instance.But, naturally, the families of people and other people are distressed and they hold out hope that something more can be done. I want to make it very clear that in that circumstance, and I believe in these current circumstances, everything that could be done was done. It behoves us to look to support rather than necessarily be too quick to criticise the work, particularly the behind-the-scenes work, being done by departmental officers to assist those families and to assist those people, as was clearly done in the case of the hostages during the lead-up to the Iraqi war.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[22]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The precautionary principle says that one does not do things which potentially are likely to damage the environment in a significant way unless one is certain that the long-term effects are not going to be adverse.

As usual, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short summary of the matters raised by the committee.Leave granted.The summary read as follows —Applied Laws (Implementation)(Amendment) Ordinance 1995Territory of Christmas Island Ordinance No.1 of 1995 made under the Christmas Island Act 1958Applied Laws (Implementation)(Amendment) Ordinance 1995Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands Ordinance No.1 of 1995 made under the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act 1955The Ordinances reinsert the Financial Institutions Duty Act 1983 (WA)(CI) and the Financial Institutions Duty Act 1983 (WA)(CKI) into the Schedule of the Applied Laws (Implementation) Ordinance 1992.These Ordinances are made retrospective to 1 January 1995. The Explanatory Statements for both Ordinances note that the Act that is being reinserted was inadvertently removed from the Schedule by the 1994 Ordinance. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking confirmation that the retrospectivity involved does not prejudicially affect any person other than the Commonwealth.Determination No.2 of 1995 made under s.356 of the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973The Determination revokes Determination No.1 of 1995 and determines Guidelines for the exercise of the Secretarys power under s.355 of the Act.The Committee did not receive copies of Determination No.1 of 1995. Although Determination No.1 dated 6 January 1995 was published in the Gazette on 9 January 1995, Determination No.1 does not appear to have been tabled in either the Senate or the House of Representatives. If Determination No.1 was not tabled, then, under the provisions of subsection 48(3) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, it would cease to have effect on the expiration of 15 sitting days from its commencement date which would have been 9 March 1995.According to the Explanatory Statement for Determination No.2 of 1995, the Department operated under Determination No.1 until it was revoked. If so, the Department may have been acting without the authority of any Guidelines from 9 March 1995 until the commencement of No.2 of 1995.Given that the instrument deals with the release of private information, the Committee has written to the Minister seeking advice as to whether the above matters outlined are correct, and, if so, for advice as to whether any information was released in reliance on the Guidelines after the date of expiry and the legal consequences of releasing personal information without legal authority.As Determination No.2 of 1995 deals with the release of sensitive personal information, the Committee has also asked the Minister for confirmation that the Privacy Commissioner was consulted during the process of developing the Guidelines.Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicle Standards) Regulations Statutory Rules 1995 No.55The Regulations provide a set of standards, uniform throughout Australia, for the construction and performance of heavy motor vehicles and trailers.Proposed Regulation 7 provides that the Minister may exempt a specified vehicle from a requirement of the Heavy Vehicle Standards on being satisfied after applying a number of criteria. Section 18 of the Road Transport Reform (Vehicles and Traffic) Act 1993 provides for the delegation of this power and the subdelegation of it thereafter. The Committee wrote to the Minister seeking advice as to whether there is a right to an independent review of the exercise of this discretion.Proposed subregulation 9(1) provides strict liability in relation to the failure of a trailer to comply with a requirement in the proposed Regulations. Whereas it may be reasonable that the owner of the trailer and the driver of a vehicle towing the trailer should be subject to strict liability, the Committee notes that the owner of any motor vehicle towing the trailer would be subject to the same liability. The Committee is concerned that in some circumstances, according strict liability to the owner of a vehicle may be unreasonable. The Committee wrote to the Minister seeking advice in respect of the strict liability provisions.The Minister replied to the Committees correspondence regarding the above concerns. The Committee however, has written back to the Minister seeking further clarification of the interim legislative arrangements.Instrument No.126 of 1995 made under ss.196B(2) of the Veterans Entitlements Act 1986This instrument amends instrument No.99 of 1995 which determined a Statement of Principles relating to chronic myeloid leukaemia.The amendment replaces the word acute with the word chronic in clause 1(a). The Explanatory Statement notes that this amendment reflects the correct decision of the Repatriation Medical Authority. Instrument No.99 of 1995 was, however, part of the legal process reflecting that decision, and the decision was not accurately reflected in that instrument.The Committee has written to the Minister seeking confirmation that no person other than the Commonwealth has been prejudiced by the making of this amendment.Radiocommunications (Multipoint Distribution Station Licences—Regional Licences) Guidelines No.1 of 1995Statutory Rules 1995 No.74This instrument establishes the interference management regime for services provided under licences based on a Pal-B video transmission format and the Reference Receiving System relating to Multipoint Distribution Stations for Regional Australia Transmitter Licences.Under Guideline 17, the Spectrum Management Agency (SMA) may impose or vary the conditions of licences without regard to nearly all the other provisions of the Guidelines. Guideline 18 states that holders of licences are to be involved in the alteration and consent process and must agree before the Guidelines are breached. The only holders who may be involved in the process, however, are those holders of licences whose services, in the opinion of the SMA, may be affected by the variation or imposition of a condition under Guideline 17.The Committee has written to the Minister seeking advice as to whether the exercise of the discretion conferred on the SMA in Guidelines 17 and 18 is subject to an independent review on the merits.Civil Aviation Orders, Part 105 AD/B747/147 made under the Civil Aviation Act 1988This instrument amends the Schedule of Airworthiness Directives dealing with Stretched Upper Deck Evacuation Slides.The Directive states that compliance is prior to 6 April 1998. Given the background against which this date is set, the Committee has written to the Minister seeking confirmation that the compliance date is correct.Determination No.T7 of 1995 made under s.15 of the Higher Education Funding Act 1988This Determination provides for payment to nine universities to reimburse States for the HECS liability for State funded places in respect of the 1994 year.The Determination confers a substantial sum of money on the Southern Cross University. That institution, however, does not appear in the Table in subsection 4(1) of the Higher Education Act 1988 under any name. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking advice as to whether a declaration under subsections 4(2) and 4(3) has been made changing Table A to include Southern Cross University. If not, the Committee has asked the Minister for advice as to the authority under which the present Determination confers funds on this institution.The Committee has also written to the Minister requesting clarification as to discrepancies which exist between the institutions named in the Table in subsection 4(1) of the Act and those named in the Determination, and whether the appropriate declarations have been made under subsections 4(2) and 4(3) of the Act.","N/A","NOTICES OF MOTION","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[1]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

122,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COLSTON","PF4","(Queensland)","ALP","N/A",1675,"—On 5 June 1995, I reported to the Senate on the committees concerns with these instruments, which related to a discretion with no indication whether subject to review and possible discrepancies requiring clarification. The relevant ministers have now provided the committee with information which meets our concerns. The committee is grateful for this cooperation. As usual, I seek leave to incorporate the committees correspondence in Hansard .Leave granted.The correspondence read as follows —11 May 1995Senator the Hon Nick BolkusMinister for Immigration and Ethnic AffairsParliament HouseCANBERRA ACT 2600Dear MinisterI refer to Statutory Rules 1995 No 38 being the Migration Regulations (Amendment) which were considered by the Committee at its meeting on 11 May 1995.Regulation 71 (on Page 41) amends item 8108 by adding a new discretion. Prior to the amendment the visa condition contained in item 8108 provided that the holder must not be employed in Australia by any one employer for more than 3 months. The amendment adds the phrase without the prior permission in writing of the Secretary.As this amendment confers a significant discretion on the Secretary the Committee would appreciate your confirmation that the exercise of this discretion is subject to independent review.Yours sincerelyMal ColstonChairman20 June 1995Senator Mal ColstonChairmanStanding Committee on Regulations and OrdinancesParliament HouseCANBERRA ACT 2600Dear Mal,Thank you for your letter of 11 May 1995 concerning the amendment to condition 8108 of the Migration Regulations in Statutory Rule No 38 of 1995.As you know, regulation 71 of Statutory Rule No 38 of 1995 amends condition 8108 to require that a person must not be employed in Australia by any one employer for more than 3 months without the permission in writing of the Secretary. Condition 8108 is only imposed in relation to subclass 417 (Working Holiday) visas.The working holiday scheme provides an opportunity for young people to holiday in Australia and supplement their funds through incidental work. Australia has formal working holiday agreements with Canada, the Republic of Ireland, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The agreements enable nationals of those countries who have turned 18, but have not turned 31, to enter Australia as working holiday makers, provided they satisfy all prescribed criteria. Nationals of other countries who have turned 18, but have not turned 26, may also enter as working holiday makers, once again provided they satisfy all prescribed criteria for the grant of the visa.As the main reason for subclass 417 visa holders being in Australia is to holiday, it is intended that any employment in Australia should be incidental to that purpose. It is considered that, in most cases, working for long periods with one employer would be inconsistent with this policy intent. Accordingly, subclass 417 (Working Holiday) visas are granted subject to condition 8108.Prior to amendments to the Regulations in September 1994, the equivalent to condition 8108 (ie condition 9217) required that a person must not be employed by any one employer in Australia for more than three months without the permission in writing of the Secretary. It appears that the words without the permission in writing of the Secretary were omitted due to a drafting error during the drafting of the September 1994 Regulations. The amendment to condition 8108 accordingly restores the former position.As condition 8108 is a condition which attaches to a visa, rather than a criterion relating to the grant of a visa, the Secretarys discretion in relation to this condition is not subject to formal merits review. The exercise of this discretion is, however, subject to other accountability measures such as investigation by the Ombudsman.Thank you for bringing this matter to my attention.Yours sincerelyNICK BOLKUS11 May 1995The Hon Simon Crean MPMinister for Employment Education and TrainingParliament HouseCANBERRA ACT 2600Dear MinisterI refer to Determination No T29 of 1994 made under s.16 of the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 which is presently before the Committee.This Determination provides for the additional allocations of grants for limited operating purposes for 1995 to institutions throughout Australia that are not part of the Unified National System.The Explanatory Statement (last sentence) states that the additional grants represent cost supplementation for base operating grants for three named institutions. Two of the institutions named, the Australian National University and the University of Canberra, are not mentioned in the Determination itself, whereas three other institutions are. These three institutions, being Avondale College, Marcus Oldham College of Farm Management and Batchelor College, are not referred to in the Explanatory Statement.The Committee would appreciate your advice as to whether the institutions named in either document, the Determination or the Explanatory Statement, should be substituted for others.Yours sincerelyMal ColstonChairman11 May 1995The Hon Simon Crean MPMinister for Employment Education and TrainingParliament HouseCANBERRA ACT 2600Dear MinisterI refer to Determination No T34 of 1994 made under s.15 of the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 which adjusts the Higher Education Contribution Scheme liabilities of institutions for 1994.A discrepancy concerning the name of an institution has been noted by the Committee. The Table in s.4(1) of the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 refers to an institution as the Ballarat University College. The Determination refers to the University of Ballarat. It is also noted that the procedure for changing the name of an institution in the Table is set out in subss. 4(2) and 4(3) of the Act.The Committee would be grateful for your advice confirming whether these institutions are one and the same, and, if they are, whether a declaration has been made under subss. 4(2) and 4(3) of the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 to amend the Table in s.4(1) by changing the name of the institution.Yours sincerelyMal ColstonChairman9 June 1995Senator Mal ColstonChairmanSenate Standing Committee on Regulations and OrdinancesParliament HouseCANBERRA ACT 2600Dear Senator ColstonThank you for your letters of 11 May 1995 concerning Determinations Nos. 29 of 1994, 34 of 1994 and G2 of 1995. I provide the following in response to your questions.In regard to Determination No. 29 of 1994, your Committee sought advice on whether the institutions named in either the Determination or the Explanatory Memorandum should be substituted for others. The names in the Explanatory Memorandum are incorrect. The Australian National University and the University of Canberra should be substituted by Avondale College, Marcus Oldham College of Farm Management and Batchelor College.The Committee sought confirmation, in relation to Determination No 34 of 1994, that the Ballarat University College and the University of Ballarat are the same institution. On 1 February 1994 I declared under subsection 4(2) of the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 that subsection 4(1) of the Act was amended by deleting Ballarat University College and inserting University of Ballarat. I have attached a copy of this declaration for your information.The Committee also sought confirmation that the confusion in the numbering system, as a result of Determination No G2 of 1995, would be avoided in the future. My Department will ensure that a more prominent system of numbering will be adopted in the future.Yours SincerelySIMON CREAN","N/A","NOTICES OF MOTION","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[2]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

Under Senate procedures, the committee is obliged to send copies of the evidence where persons are adversely named to those persons, with an invitation to respond to it if they so wish. The volume of adverse comment, and the procedures the committee is obliged to follow to deal with it, have imposed a large task on the committee, which threatened to delay its report unduly. The committee has therefore agreed to present a report by the due date of 29 June 1995, which will present its conclusions and recommendations on the matters raised in the terms of reference, and to seek an extension of time to complete the task of sending out the adverse comment to the persons concerned and inviting their response to it.

149,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ALSTON","LD4","(Victoria-","LP","Deputy Leader of the Opposition)",1682,"—I move:That the Senate censures the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) and the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator McMullan) for their deliberate refusal to table the report of the Australian Broadcasting Authority on cross media rules ordered by the Senate, in circumstances where the documents may contain matter highly critical of aspects of government communication policy in relation to cross media rules and, notwithstanding Senator McMullans assertions to the Senate on 21 June 1995, may not be made public in the near future, or ever, in order to conceal these criticisms from the electorate.During the life of this present parliament, there have been 43 occasions on which the Senate has ordered the production of documents. On only two occasions during that time has the government refused to comply with those orders. On one occasion the minister was censured and on another occasion he was not. This occasion is particularly important and certainly deserves all the condemnation which the Senate can bring to bear. What we are confronting is a deliberate and wilful disregard not only for the order of the Senate but also for the interests of the public and all those who are concerned about the way in which the government has used media policy to advance its own political interests.I was struck most forcibly this morning by the sheer hypocrisy of the government on this matter and its refusal to allow any public debate prior to the matter coming before cabinet. When I read todays Financial Review I saw that the minister—who is not prepared to allow the Senate or the public into his confidence—has provided a comprehensive brief about not only what is in the report but also what will go to cabinet, including sensitive discussions that are taking place and negotiations between Mr Lee and Mr Willis about the new foreign ownership limits. Mr Lee want wants to include quasi equity in a new definition of foreign investment. Treasury agrees with the need for a stricter definition but is pushing for a higher foreign investment limit and for companies to sell down under so-called transitional arrangements.I learned for the first time that Mr Willis is preparing a response to the recommendations of a Senate inquiry into the Foreign Investment Review Board. We know that 18 months ago the hearings were held and that the interim report, which was essentially the substantive report, was tabled about three months later. We have been waiting for more than 12 months. There is a requirement that the government table a report within three months. Now we learn for the first time that we are about to get some sort of token response; perhaps not. Nonetheless, this is the way in which the government responds to requests or orders of the parliament.The public ought to be outraged at the cynical way in which this government has reached the point in its political cycle where it really thinks that it does not have to take democracy very seriously, that it can simply govern in its own interests in an authoritarian fashion. If it wants to spend a couple of hundred thousand dollars in helping Carmen Lawrence, it quite cavalierly resolves that moneys be made available without limit. There is intense public interest regarding this matter on the back bench of the Labor Party. We well know that it is one of the few issues where the Left still has a voice on policy and is not afraid to express it.A large number of groups in the community have publicly expressed their views on these issues, and they ought to be given the opportunity to influence the public debate. There is no valid reason for withholding a public report. Senator McMullan has conceded that it has the status of a public report and that it will be released in due course. Cabinet decisions are not made in isolation. They should take account of public opinion on this matter. If ever there were a need for a full and public debate, it is in this sensitive area. The only logical conclusion one can reach from Mr Lees withholding of the ABA report and deliberately defying the Senate is that Labor is about to make yet another media ownership decision on the basis of rewarding political mates and punishing political enemies, rather than acting in the national interest.It may be that the nominal minister, Mr Lee, has been overruled by the real minister for communications, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), but he has to accept the blame for the wilful failure to cooperate with the Senate. I can well understand why Mr Lee would not be anxious to table this document, because in many respects it represents a humiliating backdown for him. After all, he was the one who was out there spruiking to all and sundry that 20 per cent ought to be the limit in the wake of the comments made by Mr Packer.We all know what this is about. Currently, the cross-media and foreign ownership limits for commercial television are both set at 15 per cent, although the limits have proved to be totally unenforceable because of the governments inept control test. What does the government do? It keeps the totally enforceable control test but proposes a new limit. In effect, the foreign and cross-media ownership limits would be 15 per cent if we can believe not only the ABA report, which has been leaked selectively, but also what Mr Lee is now saying, once again selectively. No longer is he insisting on 20 per cent; he has now come down to 15 per cent because he knows that the ABA has exposed the fact that 20 per cent would actually represent a higher level of foreign ownership and cross-media rule and would advantage, in particular, Rupert Murdoch and fundamentally disadvantage Kerry Packer because he would then be permanently locked out of any catch-up to Conrad Black, who has 25 per cent. As we know, he is on a promise to go even higher.The fact remains that now that Mr Lee is proposing a 15 per cent figure, we ought to know the basis on which the ABA has expressed a view that that is the most desirable option. I think at one stage Mr Lee was trying to suggest that he would come down in his figure because although the ABA had said in relation to Mr Packer that he had voting interests of 17.17 per cent, there were convertible notes which reduced that figure below the 15 per cent mark and, therefore, 15 per cent could be appropriate. When you examine that earlier ABA report, you find that convertible notes are included in voting interests. So there is no logic in that decision. It is clearly not just political expediency but it reflects the reality that the ABA has refused to roll over and do what the government originally wanted.We ought to be able to know what the ABAs recommendations involve. We ought to know how far they go. Do they cover such areas as magazines and telecommunications? Do they in any shape or form touch on multimedia or what one might regard as a new concept of the information or entertainment industries? Do they address the fundamental issues of plurality and diversity or is this simply a convenient basis for the government to make yet another highly motivated political decision?It is hard to understand why the minister is not wanting to release this document now, although to suit the governments political convenience, undoubtedly it wants to make a cabinet decision on the matter first. But there is absolutely no guarantee that we will ever get to the cabinet decision.","N/A","CROSS-MEDIA RULES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[1]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

155,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ALSTON","LD4","(Victoria-","LP","Deputy Leader of the Opposition)",1682,"—Let us understand this. We have been saying for a long time that you ought to bring forward the review of the cross-media rules which you foreshadowed 12 months ago. You finally caved into reality and invited the ABA to submit a report, narrow though it may be, in relation to the effectiveness of the cross-media rules and now you are conceding that cabinet may never get around to making a decision and, therefore, this report may never see the light of day. How does that advance the public debate on the issue? How is that consistent with your promise to bring forward a review? How does that in any shape or form enable serious decisions to be made on the issue? Of course, it does not.I was so sceptical because Anne Daviess article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 8 June stated categorically that the report would be considered by cabinet in the next two weeks. It certainly has not. There is no guarantee, as Senator McMullan said yesterday, that it will be considered next week, or indeed at all. Once we rise next week we may not come back. Once again, the government, with all the freedom in the world, will make some selectively and politically motivated decision that suits its political interests in relation to some aspect of cross-media. It will have absolutely nothing at all to do with public interests and nothing to do with the recommendations of the ABA.If there is any good reason why this report cannot be in the public arena posthaste, I would like to know about it. We know why it was initiated in the first place. The public is intensely interested. We do not know why the government will not support a comprehensive public review. Presumably, it is because it will reveal the extent to which the original decision was so hopelessly flawed. After all, it was Mr Keating who said you could be a prince of print or a queen of the screen but not both. The fact is that you have people in both camps wanting more all the time, you have enormous cross holdings, you have a state of continuing political unrest, you have a great degree of uncertainty and you have a long track record of making decisions that have very little to do with public interest. Therefore, quite clearly, the ABA report will be yet another way in which the shallowness of the original decision will be exposed for what it is worth. It was originally the `get the Herald and Weekly Times proposal. This report is now a response to the `get Packer amendments which have been foreshadowed by the government.I simply say that the public is entitled to this document. We ought to be able to see it as quickly as possible. Cabinet would be assisted by a public debate. We understand why Senator McMullan will not cooperate but it is simply outrageous that his contempt for democracy and his degree of arrogance is so high and his concept of accountability is so low that he will deliberately defy an order of this Senate. That has not happened very often in the past.It is quite clear that it has now reached the stage where he does not particularly care whether he is held accountable and whether anyone thinks he is acting in the public interest. He makes decisions like Breretons backdown and tells the press that this is totally and utterly motivated by the need to clear the decks for the election. There is no pretence any longer about making decisions in the public interest—whether it will assist the proper operations of the industrial relations regime. He is simply playing politics and he is so arrogant that he is prepared to boast about it. At least in this instance he ought to be exposed by the Senate.","N/A","CROSS-MEDIA RULES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[1]/talk.start[4]/para","N/A","N/A"
156,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator McMULLAN","5I4","(Australian Capital Territory-","ALP","Minister for Trade)",1685,"—There was a time when debates about censure motions were about questions of high principle but now they are about questions of low politics. This is just a pathetic contribution by Senator Alston. It is disgraceful and undermines all the things that are important about parliament. He has made it absolutely clear that this has nothing to do with the balance of power between the legislature and the executive. He absolutely and deliberately failed to address—if anybody had been listening, he would have deliberately misled them—the implication that a decision by the cabinet changes the media rules when they are changed by the parliament, which will not have to deal with any legislation arising from the cabinets decision for at least two months.By implication of that, the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) has said absolutely clearly that the Parliament will have access to the report for at least two months before it has to debate any legislation. The public will have access to the report for at least two months, maybe six months. I am not trying to exaggerate but I think by the time we finally get the debate here it will be more. But the minimum will be two months. It will be in the public arena, it will be in the Senate and it will be available for discussion before any legislation is introduced, let alone debated, let alone finalised and let alone affect the interests of any citizen.This is not a question of high principle that we need to have this information available to enable the legislature to properly hold the executive accountable. This is about the fact that the opposition would like to have the document a bit earlier because it would like to hop into the political debate before the cabinet makes its decision. That is a perfectly reasonable aspiration as a political party—it is a perfectly understandable aspiration for an opposition political party—but has nothing to do with the high principles of democratic accountability which are about making sure that the executive cannot act without proper scrutiny. In this matter it cannot.This matter can only be resolved by the parliament when the legislation comes before it. It will have had the report for two months. By that stage, everybody will have had the chance to find out what Senator Alston is trying to cover up, which is that he does not have any policies. So he continues to harass and find little debating points—","N/A","CROSS-MEDIA RULES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[2]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

I have to say that the second part is also true about my little effort. He would have delivered mine better, too. I think that Leo McKern would put us all to shame and he would fit Senator Baumes description for today. We are talking about a partisan argument: when it would be desirable, in terms of the oppositions political priorities, for the document to be released. There is no question about whether the public will have a chance to scrutinise any decision by the government before it is legislated. People will have at least two months, probably more.It is dangerous to raise matters of political preference to high principle. Important principles are raised in this place from time to time and we need to take them seriously. It does not mean we always agree about them; we sometimes have fierce arguments because there are differences of principle—and that is proper. I do not always like the decisions the Senate makes about those matters of principle, but that is the way democracy is: you argue issues of principle, you put your view, there is a vote, and sometimes you win and sometimes you lose. We can all live with that. We do not enjoy it, particularly when it goes against us and we get censured; but that is the way a democracy operates—and we live with it.But here we have a question of partisan preference elevated to a matter of political principle. If, as a consequence, the Senate decides to censure the minister, having made in my view a fundamentally flawed decision yesterday about requiring this document to be provided before the cabinet has had a chance to consider it—which is a reasonably dangerous precedent and one with which the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) has made it clear he will not comply—that would be a dangerous principle. But that is a matter for the Senate. If it makes that decision, I am sure the minister will give it due consideration.Then there is the regular process of censuring Senate ministers who you absolutely know cannot comply without the cooperation of their colleagues. I am not passing the buck; I will stand by the decision of my colleague the minister. I understand the principle that he is defending against what is merely a partisan attack. It is not that I am saying you should not make that attack; the Senate is entitled to censure me, if it wants. That is part of the process. But if you think that is in some way lifting the status and regard of this institution when you run around throwing up these things like confetti, when you really have a fit of pique that a document you want to use for political purposes will not be available until after the cabinet has made its decision, I have to say that you are sadly mistaken.We will make sure that the parliament has ample time to consider this report before it has to consider any legislation arising from it. We will make sure the public has ample time to consider and weigh the merits of the matters raised by the ABA report and all the other documents that will come out in response, before any decision is made which will affect the rights of any citizen as they relate to this matter. But we will not provide beforehand a document which is going to cabinet for its consideration on Tuesday, because this report is not just another report; it is a report which was considered on the basis of a specific request by the minister for advice on such options to go to the cabinet for consideration and decision. That is a document that was specifically requested by the minister so he might take it to the cabinet.The document, subsequently, will be made public; but it is not just a report by a public body that should be presented as a matter of public interest and which the government, like everybody else, might respond to and make a decision on, and on which other people might make alternative decisions. This is a document specifically requested so it might go to the cabinet as a basis for its decision.You are moving into dangerous and worrying areas with this decision with which we cannot comply. I am stuck between a rock and a hard place, but that is not something about which I am going to lose any sleep. That is just the way the Senate system operates at the moment. This is a decision with which we cannot comply. Therefore, it is a decision with which, I must regretfully advise you, we will not comply.","N/A","CROSS-MEDIA RULES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[2]/talk.start[4]/para","N/A","N/A"
163,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BOURNE","TW4","(New South Wales)","AD","N/A",1687,"—That was a very interesting speech by the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan). I understand why he had to give it. But the attitude of the government that tabling the ABA report is in some way dangerous is absolutely extraordinary. This is a matter of principle. The Senate required the government to table the report of the ABA. Whether I had voted for that yesterday or not, a majority of members in this place required the government to table a report which the government says it will make public.The question is whether it will be made public this week or next week. The Senate has asked for it to be make public this week. The government has said that it is dangerous—it used that term—to make it public this week. How can it be dangerous? That is such a silly term to use. It cannot possibly be dangerous to make it public this week. As far as I can see, there are two reasons this report has not been tabled today. The first is that the cabinet believes it has good reason for nobody to see this report, except people who work for the Sydney Morning Herald and the Australian Financial Review , until cabinet has made a decision on it. Why would that be? Is it because public debate would then substantially be on the report rather than on the governments response and the governments response would not be a fait accompli and would not be able to be influenced by its own back bench or by anybody else? That is a possibility.The second possibility—and the only other one I can think of—is that the executive considers itself to be above the parliament. Its members have a sense of arrogance and conceit, one that is quite familiar to us at the moment and one that the government does not like very much when the French are showing it—but it is fine when the government is.I find it quite extraordinary; this is a matter of principle. That report should be on the table now. We understand it will be there next week, but perhaps we will never see it. Perhaps it is such a dangerous report that we will never see it. I would love to know how dangerous it is—and why. I am really looking forward to reading it. I cannot understand what the government is doing. Whether or not I had voted for that motion yesterday, I am voting for this censure motion today. It is outrageous that this report is not on the table right now. I will definitely be voting for the motion.","N/A","CROSS-MEDIA RULES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
164,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ALSTON","LD4","(Victoria-","LP","Deputy Leader of the Opposition)",1687,"—in reply—Senator Bourne is perfectly correct: there are two fundamental issues at stake. One is the merits of the document, whether it ought to be in the public arena and the extent to which there are sensitive matters in it which either should not see the light of day or must go to cabinet first. That argument is blown out of the water by the fact that Steve Lewis and Tom Burton have been told the highlights of the document. I thought it was interesting that Senator McMullan did not even try to defend that fact. He did not for a moment try to say there had not been comprehensive leaks. What do we have? We have a government that is not even prepared to argue that somehow it is perfectly justified in leaking to the media but it cannot be allowed to leak to the parliament.The other fundamentally important principle which Senator Bourne identified is the primacy of the parliament. The executive is a creature of this parliament. It consists of members of this parliament. If a chamber resolves that a document be produced, then even your government, Senator McMullan, has overwhelmingly acknowledged that that is a requirement with which it must comply. We have not heard any serious attempt to justify this document as being somehow of such overwhelming national significance or sensitivity that it could not possibly see the light of day.As Senator McMullan said yesterday, this is only an argument over timing. The document itself, apart from this dangerous suggestion which perhaps was trotted out in desperation today, does not contain anything of significance. The fact is that you have conceded that the document will be on the table. Of course, we have had various indications of when that might be. I do not have the slightest confidence that the government is going to make it available at any particular time.It is interesting that only a few weeks ago Mr Lee was promising to introduce legislation to alter the cross media rules in this current session of parliament. Yet what we have now been told is, `Well, there will be at least a two-month gap between the cabinet decision and any legislation being debated by the parliament, so you will have plenty of time to kick it around then. Once again, perhaps without his even realising it, Senator McMullan is simply ripping up Mr Lees commitment to introduce legislation in this session.The government is in such frantic political campaign mode that it does not give a damn about what the parliament or anyone else might say. If there are solemn resolutions passed, it will simply ignore them if it thinks it is in its political interest. That is what I think is so offensive to all parties in this chamber. Over the years the respect for this place has been pretty high; it has been taken pretty seriously by government.","N/A","CROSS-MEDIA RULES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[4]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

In other words, the parliament is being treated with contempt. The ABA, in effect, is being told that its reports can be used for party political purposes. The ABA is not the private plaything of any political party. It is set up as an independent body to give advice. I presume the minister does not claim the government has the ABA in its pocket.Why shouldnt the ABA report be allowed to see the light of day? Is there anything in that report that will be so embarrassing? No, because we have been told that it will be released. What can the harm be in releasing it now? The ultimate argument, of course, is that, even if you disagree with all that, as Senator Bourne rightly says, you have the right to disagree; you have the opportunity to argue your case. But you do not have any respect for democracy at all. You come into the chamber on a political issue without the numbers and then have total contempt for the process. You say, `We are just not going to comply. We do not have to give any reasons. We will trot out a few arguments about how it does not suit our purposes, or we simply want to suit our political convenience by having the matter looked at by cabinet. We will advance no substantive argument.It is purely and simply the fact that this government regards itself as above the parliament. That can only come about when you have been in the game for as long as it has. You reach the point where you say, `Who cares? It will be a one-day wonder. We will give Carmen Lawrence $200,000 or $300,000. We will laugh it off and say that it is politics. The press will move on to the next issue. So what? People know that Keating is an arrogant so and so but we will live with that. We will have a whole series of talkfests and announcements and media circuses and forums and Creative Nations part 2. That will get us across the line. In the meantime we will ignore the parliament. We will use it for our own purposes but, fundamentally, we will have no regard for the concept of democracy. That is what is so offensive. That is why you are being censured.Question put:That the motion (Senator Alstons ) be agreed to.","N/A","CROSS-MEDIA RULES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[4]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

177,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator JONES","LH4","(Queensland)","ALP","N/A",1690,"—I move:That these bills be now read a second time.I seek leave to have the second reading speeches incorporated in HansardLeave granted.The speeches read as follows—CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1995The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995, which is now before the chamber, contains a number of amendments of the Customs Tariff Act 1987. I will briefly outline the amendments.Section three of the bill will have effect from the seventh of July 1994. Item sixty-three in part three of schedule four provides for the duty free entry of certified reference materials. Reference materials are mainly metallic compounds with accurately known compositions which are used as a standard against which like materials and processes are compared and apparatus calibrated.The amendment contained in this bill will allow certified reference materials to be used in a broader range of industrial and scientific processes.Schedule one operates from the eighteenth of November 1994. In February 1994, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal determined that blankets containing viscose rayon in quantities varying from eighty-one percent to ninety-four percent were wholly of viscose. This decision reduced the governments intended industry assistance rate from twenty-seven percent to free.The amendments contained in this schedule redefine the description of goods for the subject tariff items by replacing the word wholly with the phrase of 100%. This action will reinstate the level of assistance for goods of mixed fibre content by excluding them from tariff items which require one hundred percent content.Section 3 and schedule 2 of the bill gives effect to the governments decision on the Industry Commissions report on the tobacco growing and manufacturing industries and came into force on the first of January 1995. The overall effect of the tariff changes will be that all imports of unmanufactured and manufactured tobacco and tobacco products will be free of customs duty. Manufactured tobacco and tobacco products will still attract the excise equivalent duty.As a result of unmanufactured tobacco becoming free of duty, the concessional schedule four items 35b and 35c become superfluous and have been omitted. Consequential amendments to item 53a in schedule four and to the table in section 26 of the principal act are also necessary.I refer honourable members to the joint ministerial statement of the thirteenth of December 1994 by the ministers for primary industries and energy, industry, science and technology, and trade and the Assistant Treasurer which sets out the main elements of the package of measures taken by this government and the state governments of Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales to assist tobacco growers and manufacturers.Schedule two also contains an amendment consequential to the world trade agreement coming into effect in Australia. The change is necessary to maintain the intended rate of duty for parts of regulating and controlling instruments of tariff heading ninety thirty two which are not goods of a kind used as replacement components in passenger motor vehicles.Schedule three contains a similar amendment to burglar alarms for the same reason. This change is operative from the first of January 1996.Summaries of the amendments contained in this bill have been prepared and are being circulated for the information of honourable senators.I commend the bill.COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITIES (AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORIES PAY-ROLL TAX) BILL 1995From 1971 to 1 August 1987, Pay-roll tax on wages relating to the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) were collected by the Commonwealth under the terms of the Pay-roll Tax (Territories) Assessment Act 1971.When the ACT self government commenced, legislation was not put in place to make these Commonwealth authorities liable for ACT pay-roll tax. This bill will rectify this situation, and will make those Commonwealth authorities operating in the ACT liable to pay ACT pay-roll tax in the same way that they are liable to pay State and Northern Territory pay-roll tax.The bill applies only to those Commonwealth authorities which, immediately before the commencement of the ACT pay-roll tax regime, were registered as employers, or had an application for registration pending, under the pay-roll tax regime of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory. It will have no application to other Commonwealth authorities.Exempting provisions which would otherwise operate to exclude liability to ACT pay-roll tax are made inapplicable to those Commonwealth authorities.Those Commonwealth authorities that have paid ACT pay-roll tax before Royal Assent to the bill cannot recover the payments.This legislation will ensure consistency of treatment of Commonwealth authorities between the States and Territories.I commend the bill to the Senate and present the associated explanatory memorandum.Ordered that the bills be listed on the Notice Paper as separate orders of the day.Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of these bills be adjourned until the first day of sitting of the spring sittings, in accordance with the order agreed to on 29 November 1994.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1995 COMMONWEALTH AUTHORITIES (AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY PAY-ROLL TAX) BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Minister must cause a copy of the corporate plan to be laid before each House of Parliament:(a)within 15 sitting days after the Minister received the plan, if the Minister did not direct the members to vary the plan; or(b)within 15 sitting days after the Minister received a revised plan, if the Minister did direct the members to vary the plan..3.Page 28, before clause 73 insert the following clause:Tabling of directions or notices of the Minister72A. Where the Minister gives a direction under section 14, 15, 17, 45 or 46 or a notice under section 16 or 53, the Minister shall cause a copy of the direction or notice to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the giving of the direction or notice..Much of the substance of these amendments as proposed for the Air Services Bill have already been canvassed in the debate in respect of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority Bill. All I intend to do is speak briefly on the amendments.The arrangement made on the debate on the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 between me and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) was that we would speak briefly. Where it was obvious that neither side had the majority, we would nominate the fact that we supported the bill but would not necessarily divide. I draw this to the attention of Senator Schacht.My three amendments are very similar to the ones moved in relation to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority Bill. In relation to the first amendment, we on this side did not have the support of the Democrats, who did not agree with us that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority or Airservices Australia, or AA, would be either economical or effective. For some reason, they did not see fit to support that proposal. They also did not see fit to support the notion that these groups should promote and foster civil aviation. We divided on the Civil Aviation Safety Authority Bill.If the minister is agreeable, we will make the point that we continue to support those amendments to the Air Services Bill. We do not have the numbers, so we will not call a division.","N/A","CIVIL AVIATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1995 AIR SERVICES BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[6]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

194,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator PARER","KI4","(Queensland)","LP","N/A",1692,"—That is on amendment No. 1. Amendment No. 2 states:The Minister must cause a copy of the corporate plan to be laid before each House of Parliament:(a)within 15 sitting days after the Minister received the plan, if the Minister did not direct the members to vary the plan; or(b)within 15 sitting days after the Minister received a revised plan, if the Minister did direct the members to vary the plan..An argument was put that this is really a GBE and, as such, the rules, regulations and conditions that apply to other GBEs should apply to AA, or Airservices Australia. We have taken a contrary point of view because it is plainly obvious that AA is not a normal GBE in that it is a monopoly. It is no good saying that this will appear in the annual report, because the annual report will not be seen by members of parliament for 12 months. Therefore, that is the purpose of that amendment.The third amendment relates to the minister giving a direction under various sections of the act. The minister shall cause a copy of the direction or notice to be laid before each house of parliament within 15 sitting days. I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that this was a recommendation of the joint house committee chaired by Mr Peter Morris which was ignored by the government.In summary, the first amendment, for which we do not have the support of the minor parties, we would like to see embodied in the legislation. But, in the interests of time, we will not call a division. We have the support of the other parties for the second two amendments. Again in the interests of time, I suggest that the government follows the same course that we are proposing for amendment No. 1.","N/A","CIVIL AVIATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1995 AIR SERVICES BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[6]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

With the government sector—the government businesses, the government commercial enterprises—we are talking about something like 10 per cent of our GDP. So it is a very important sector and a very important provider of essential services. We want competition within that sector so that it is more efficient and so that businesses can get on with being more efficient and world competitive.The proposed framework allows competition within these sectors and the onus goes back on government, particularly the state governments, to adopt competition policies. We are talking about a new procedure—an access regime—whereby people will be able to access the essential monopolies, such as electricity for the transmission grid, gas pipelines, rail lines and ports. There are two arms in relation to this bill: the administrative and enforcement arm, which is the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission; and the policy and advice arm, which is the National Competition Council.This bill comes to us because, at long last, there has been agreement between the Commonwealth and the states, with each of the states agreeing to implement competition in their respective areas. There will be hurdles for the states with respect to performance on electricity, gas, water and road transport over the ensuing years. If the states clear those hurdles, as will be judged by the NCC, they will qualify for additional income from the Commonwealth.Why is this competition important? It is extremely important because it offers the prospect of increased efficiency within the economy. I commend to senators and to the public the Industry Commissions report of March of this year on the growth and revenue implications of the Hilmer and associated reforms. It estimates that implementing all those reforms will add 5.5 per cent to GDP. Since GDP is presently around $470 billion, that increase is equivalent to around $23 billion. For consumers, that will mean an additional $9 billion, the equivalent of about $1,500 per household, if these reforms are implemented.The reforms by the Commonwealth will contribute about $4 billion out of the $23 billion, with the Commonwealth getting increased revenue of about $6 billion. If the states carry out all the reforms, they will contribute about $19 billion to the $23 billion and will have increased revenues of about $3 billion.I would like to share my experience in one of those monopoly areas—the electricity industry. When I was in the commercial world I had experience as a major electricity buyer for Australian Newsprint Mills. I was the leader of a team which built a newsprint mill at Albury in New South Wales about 15 years ago. We spent $200 million at that time establishing a world-class, internationally competitive pulp and paper mill. But we were very dependent upon electricity.Within 12 months of building the mill and getting it going, the Wran government doubled the price of electricity to the mill, making it uneconomic. The mill would never have been built if the directors had known that the New South Wales government was going to do that. If there had been a national grid at that time and if we had been able to negotiate with a different supplier, that particular mill would have been profitable from the end of its first year. Instead, it had major losses for several years.I suggest that, had it not had to meet that price rise, the mill would have doubled in size by now, attracting, in current day costs, an additional $500 million in investment. Australia would be importing much less newsprint and would probably be exporting some of similar grades. But that has not happened because a state government doubled the price of electricity to an industry without due warning. That disastrous experience is a good example of how to frighten off investors.On the other side of the coin, before coming here I was chairman of the Hydro-Electric Commission, an electricity supplier, for four years. It was obvious that a national grid was coming and we went through a major program of reform in the face of eventual competition. We spent a lot of time and effort on improving productivity. I am proud to say that that organisation has doubled its labour productivity over the last several years through contracting out and outsourcing goods and services rather than having everyone employed within the one organisation. Sadly, I refer to an article in last Mondays Hobart Mercury , which reports that Labors state opposition energy spokesman, Dr Amos, has criticised the HEC for engaging so many consultants. According to the article:Dr Amos said an organisation should be able to manage its own affairs.If an organisation cannot manage its own affairs, then it is an organisation that is out of control, he said.What absolute nonsense! The whole point is that organisations cannot have experts in everything involved within the organisation. They need to contract out and buy in external services. That is part of being efficient.The Hilmer reform puts the onus back on the states to perform but they get rewards for doing so. If they clear the hurdles, they get additional income from the Commonwealth. So it is up to them. The states can exclude some entities from competition if they wish to, but of course the community will not get the overall benefits if that is done.Also in my home state of Tasmania, as reported in the Mercury of last week, there has been some criticism from the Public Sector Union, warning that competition may not be good for Tasmania. It suggests that we could see price rises, service cuts, loss of public revenue and great dangers for consumers. Again, what absolute nonsense!We must have more efficient public sector businesses so that the whole of the economy is facing up to being internationally competitive. There is no question about that. My own state has to face up to that and I know that the Tasmanian government is facing up to it. On the same theme, Hilmer said that national competition policy is not an agreement to be signed; it is a raft of difficult reforms to be implemented over many years.","N/A","COMPETITION POLICY REFORM BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

207,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator GIBSON","BX5","(Tasmania)","LP","N/A",1694,"—To the consumers benefit. Read the Industry Commissions report. I might also add that New South Wales is quite well prepared for this. Last week, the Premier, Mr Carr, made reference to the fact that the general government sector—government departments and agencies—would be required to engage in contracting reviews and market testing. That is, it will be calling tenders for the provision of particular services to see if outside contractors can provide them more cheaply but without loss of quality. We applaud that move. All state governments are doing this. I know that in my state of Tasmania the government has made enormous gains in efficiency and competitiveness.As I said before, the coalition welcomes these reforms but we have problems with the lack of action exhibited by the federal government. The reforms do not cover the labour market. For example, the National Farmers Federation gave evidence before a Senate committee on 5 May about the meat industry and said that, while the product markets for that industry are exposed to world markets, the labour market is not and, as a consequence, the cost of processing meat in Australia is double that of other world processors.The government backed away from secondary boycotts and shifted them from the Trade Practices Act to the Industrial Relations Act and substantially weakened the concept. It is a real threat to small business and big business. We have an example in aviation where the government backed down on the trans-Tasman integration. The government failed to meet the agreement it had entered into.We have the example of the waterfront where a lot of money has been spent, but with what result? There has not been much improvement in efficiency. Contship Containerliners measures wharf productivity at about 40 world ports based on the experiences of its own ships. In the first half of 1993 Sydney ranked 31 out of 40 and Melbourne ranked 20. By late 1994, Sydney ranked 31 out of 44 and Melbourne ranked 39. That is a serious deterioration. We have other figures in a similar vein.The Commonwealth government has backed away from shipping. It has done nothing about the trans-Tasman accord which was an agreement tied up by Australian and New Zealand unions to remove competition. The government has refused to allow international ships to trade on the Australian coastline. The government has retained part 10 of the Trade Practices Act for outward cargo liner shipping services operated by an international cartel—called a conference in the trade. This was against advice that the government received from the Hilmer committee, the Trade Practices Commission, the Prices Surveillance Authority, the Treasury and the Industry Commission. We also have the example of the government ducking issues concerning ANL.Recently we had the Commonwealth government ducking issues with regard to compact disks. The Australian community was promised efficiency and world prices for compact disks, but when it came to the crunch the government backed away.What has the government done to help business and investment in Australia? The government has added substantial taxes to the business sector. While the government talks competition, it is headed in the reverse direction on things which are within its own control. Since Prime Minister Keating came into power the total revenue of this government will rise from $100 billion in 1993-94 to an expected $124 billion next year. That is a huge increase in revenue. It is an example of a high taxing, high spending government.The opposition welcomes the Competition Policy Reform Bill 1995. We are pleased to see competition being brought in for an additional substantial sector of the Australian economy. The emphasis now moves back to the states. The coalition is delighted that the state premiers have signed off and have agreed to implement these difficult reforms.","N/A","COMPETITION POLICY REFORM BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

210,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator KERNOT","XW4","(Queensland-","AD","Leader of the Australian Democrats)",1697,"—I will go on to talk about that in my speech. I might refer to Compass Airlines. I will come back to aviation later. Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I say to Senator Panizza: you cannot always embrace theories unilaterally or universally without thinking about their impact on ordinary people. You must ask the question: who pays the cost of change? That is the point I want to make in this speech.The Competition Policy Reform Bill 1995 will help set in train one of the most radical and far-reaching public reforms. The public sector as we know it will be forced to restructure in far-reaching and not necessarily positive ways. This bill will force public service agencies to reassess their role, their relationship to the public, and to realign their operations. I do not object to any of that. However, the focus is to do all of this on largely economic commercially driven lines. As I said, nobody objects to the notion of an efficient public sector, but the question is who pays for it.In the Democrats view, competition policy represents the victory of economics over equity, of competition over compassion and of accounting over accountability in the management of public services. Yet this bill, and the ramifications of this bill, have been the subject of very little public debate. It has been the subject of minimal public scrutiny. It has been debated in closed forums—not by Australian people who own this debate and the outcome of it.While the Industry Commission has debated it, while cabinet has debated it, and while COAG has debated it, everywhere I go Australian people are catching up with the fact that it exists. In my view, this bill highlights that parliament has been largely sidelined by the Keating government as the forum for policy debate.The deal with the states on competition policy is already signed and sealed, and all this bill does is make sure it is delivered. The merits of the argument as to whether the Hilmer path, as opposed to any other path, is the best path or the only path have not been adequately aired. It is simply assumed. The majority of the media in this country has already accepted the Hilmer philosophy as gospel without any challenge to the likely effects or the fundamentally doctrinaire belief underpinning it that all competition is good and all regulation is bad—just like Animal Farm .The Democrats foreshadow that we will be doing all we can to raise the profile of the competition policy debate because the potential of this bill in terms of restructuring the public sector, and the role the public sector has in supporting and holding together our society, cannot just be discounted. As we always say, the devil is in the detail and it will be in the detail of the implementation. We want to closely monitor the way that the states put this package into effect.We will need to make sure that higher user charges, the end of cross-subsidisation, the narrowing of community service obligations and the inevitable path to privatisation paved by this package do not lead to fewer public services to those who need them most—the low income earners and, especially, regional Australians. Competition policy has great potential for banditry and bastardy. We want to make sure that we keep the bandits and the bastards as honest as possible.The bill has six major components. It sets up an Australian Competition and Consumer Commission by merging the Trade Practices Commission and the Prices Surveillance Authority. It sets up a National Competition Council to oversee the general performance of governments in promoting competition policy reform. For the Commonwealth sector it establishes provisions for the declaration of certain infrastructure services to be available for access by the private sector to compete against the public sector provider. It modifies existing provisions in the Trade Practices Act on competitive conduct, including allowing the authorisation of price fixing for goods and for resale price maintenance, the repeal of price discrimination, the extension of the act to cover services as well as goods, the application of notification to third line forcing, and the removal of the shield of crown immunity for states and territories in running businesses.The bill facilitates the extension of the Trade Practices Act to individuals within state jurisdictions following agreement with the relevant states and territories. It abolishes prices surveillance, downgrading former powers of the PSA to price monitoring, and extends its power to state and territory businesses.It is predominantly because we do not believe that this bill has had enough public debate—and I do not mean parliamentary debate; I mean genuine Australian citizenry debate—that we are going to vote against it. We are not doing that because we believe everything in the bill is bad—of course there are some positive aspects to it—but because the competition policy reform agenda is based on a flawed premise and a duping of the Australian public.We are told that competition is good. Senator Gibson said that. The Hilmer report is laudatory of the untrammelled benefits of market and competition underpinning it. But we have heard that line for 12 years in this country since our first foray into deregulation. We were assured that deregulating financial markets would usher in a new competitive world of banking. It did, but for whom? For corporate customers who saw unlimited lines of credit open up before them. But for the hundreds of thousands of home borrowers and small businesses—","N/A","COMPETITION POLICY REFORM BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

212,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator KERNOT","XW4","(Queensland-","AD","Leader of the Australian Democrats)",1697,"—Yes, Senator Boswell, I include them in that—competition has reduced rather than tightened, with real interest rates much higher now than they were a decade ago. These promises were made to us then. The evidence is in. Senator Panizza referred to aviation. What were we promised? We were promised lower prices. Compass went up, Compass came down and the aviation industry looks surprisingly similar now to what it did before, with largely identical airlines operating on largely identical routes on largely identical timetables.More recently, we were promised that partial deregulation of the labour market would usher in a new level of productivity and fairness. Some of the evidence on this is that the unions with industrial muscle are winning larger pay rises than ever before, while workers in less active markets—particularly women in white-collar employment—are actually watching their wages fall markedly in real terms. Let us compare the promises with the reality and see who gains and who loses. Prime Minister Keating is promising us another brave new world. He says that this brave new world is going to usher in a new era of benefits to consumers and governments and that this is going to happen because we are all going to share in ever increasing slices of some magic pudding style competition pie.In its usual first strike strategy—which is always to use the Industry Commission, because we cannot ever question what the Industry Commission says—the government produced an Industry Commission report to prove that competition is the best way to go. Hilmer has all the answers. However, this Industry Commission report was so unbelievable in some sections that even the authors of it in the commission felt necessary to qualify it by admitting, `Yes, there are a few strategic decisions in here. There are a few approximations. There are a few omissions. That is a very polite Public Service way of saying, `This is really a guess, but it fits the bill of what Prime Minister Keating wanted us to say.But that did not stop basically every media house in this country reporting without question the alleged bonanza, the alleged benefits. It was like GATT—`Everybody stand back; theres going to be $4 billion worth of benefits from GATT. We cant tell you exactly where from, but believe us. It is the same thing here. We are told that there is going to be a long run annual gain in real GDP of 5.5 per cent of $23 billion a year from Hilmer, a gain to consumers of $9 billion and a revenue gain of $9 billion for the Commonwealth and the states.It has since emerged that the Industry Commission, in its evangelical zeal, had grossly overstated the gains. Even the Business Council of Australia, the original sponsors of Hilmer, produced its own report from the University of Tasmania and suggested that the benefits really were about half the level of the Industry Commission report. But there is no problem in making ambit claims, is there, if they get reported first!Associate Professor John Quiggin of the ANU and James Cook University concluded that the Industry Commission report did not add up. It was identified that the Industry Commission had double counted a range of ongoing reforms, had overestimated the flow-on effects from the reforms to the general economy, had assumed reforms which go much further than the Hilmer report ever intended and had assumed no negative effects from the displacement of thousands of public sector workers whose job losses will provide the filling for the Hilmer magic pudding.Dr Quiggin concluded that there would still be a benefit from the Hilmer reforms, but a much more modest one: 0.5 per cent of GDP—one-tenth of that estimated by the Industry Commission. So then the question becomes: if the benefits are modest, is it worth pursuing? Is there a better way? Thank goodness for rigorous analysts like Associate Professor Quiggin.","N/A","COMPETITION POLICY REFORM BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

214,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator KERNOT","XW4","(Queensland-","AD","Leader of the Australian Democrats)",1697,"—Not much, no. I have not seen an official response to the Quiggin report. I do not expect to. The Industry Commission has done its job: it has delivered its first strike and it got its few weeks of good catchy headlines. But I want to talk about the other picture, the real picture—the picture that includes a long list of potential losers. I have said that there will be some winners. There will be some losers, too. The first losers are the thousands of public sector workers who stand to lose their jobs. The thousands who remain will be expected to provide a higher level of service to a larger population with fewer resources. It is not that people object to working harder: it is what resources they have to work with.Secondly, there are the consumers of services. These people will also lose. They are likely to get less and pay more for public sector services. The third group of losers will be in the education system, where schools could be forced to compete with each other, to accept commercial constraints, to contract out core services and to charge higher user-pay charges for parents—and all this without any consideration of the likely impact on educational standards. In a world based on competition, market forces are supposed to set quality, not the education system itself.The fourth group of losers is the environment and those who have concern for the environment. State-owned water, electricity, forestry and gas bodies across the country will seek to make a buck out of the resources, while the unprofitable conservation elements of their charters will wither on the community service obligation vine, because that comes out of the budget.The fifth area of loss is accountability. Operators of contracted out services, executives of corporatised and privatised services and companies competing with public services will not accept the same level of public accountability for service delivery and quality that government departments accept as appropriate for ensuring the public has adequate lines of redress. We will see where best practice ends up.The sixth key loser will be regional Australia. This will provide more than its fair share of the cost of the Hilmer magic pudding, because cross-subsidisation arrangements within agencies disappear as the profitable bits are increasingly separated from the unprofitable bits. Who gets left with the unprofitable bits? The remaining public sector agencies.Who benefits from this bill? Who benefits from this `far-reaching reform? What does Mr Martin Ferguson of the ACTU say? We have had all this discussion in this chamber about the battlers. He wrote to the Treasurer (Mr Willis) in March this year demanding further discussion on the bill, saying, `It is contrary to the principles of the Labor movement to promote reforms based on reduced employment and reduced pay and conditions for workers. We ask that this be rectified forthwith. Of course it has not been. The consumer movement, the environment movement, the Australian Council of Social Services, the Australian Local Government Association, public sector union and primary producer and professional bodies remain very concerned about aspects of this legislation. I do not believe that these concerns have been adequately addressed.Why do these concerns have to be addressed? We all know that the Industry Commission is on side, the economic rationalists are on side and the Business Council of Australia is on side. How could these predominantly male decision makers, safe in their own well paid positions, ever possibly be wrong! They will not be the ones who lose their jobs as a result of this. It is the ordinary Australian worker who has to be sacrificed in the name of competition and efficiency. Even if that is ever acceptable, the government fails in planning the transition for change.Of course things change. But this government has a very bad track record: it comes in first, sees afterwards and then says, `We didnt do enough about it or, `Bad luck. Thats the result. Of course the Business Council of Australias members are rubbing their hands with glee at the thought of all that government work to be contracted out to them—all of those profitable government service monopolies they can now attack while leaving the public sector with the unprofitable bits; all of those health, safety, consumer and environment regulations which will be struck down as uncompetitive and all of the money to be made from the inevitable privatisations this process will encourage.This parliament is here to do more than speak for the Business Council of Australia. It is here to speak for all the rest of Australians who may not have caught up with the effects of this piece of legislation but who will feel its effects.This bill does not enjoy the support of the key stakeholders in its implementation. It has been inadequately debated in the community at large. It is driven by ideology—the same ideology that has dominated this country for the past 12 years—rather than by good analysis. It is a zealous embracing of theory at its worst.In the committee stage the Democrats will be moving some amendments to this legislation and I will reserve my detailed comments on them until then. But, as you can see, we are not impressed with either the ideology underpinning this bill or the way in which it has not been adequately debated in this country.","N/A","COMPETITION POLICY REFORM BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start[4]/para","N/A","N/A"
215,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BOSWELL","YE4","(Queensland-","NP","Leader of the National Party of Australia)",1700,"—Some aspects of Senator Kernots speech need to be amplified. The press in this country have not given this particular bill adequate debate. The Competition Policy Reform Bill 1995 is part of a national policy package which aims to free up competition in Australian markets. The objective is to systematically remove anti-competitive behaviour so that efficiency is improved to the public benefit. The more competition, the better off we will be.The National Party of Australia fully supports and endorses the concept that economic efficiency is best served in a purely competitive market, where businesses can get on with their responsibility to maximise profits. However, my concerns are not within the bill itself but in whether it is possible to legislatively and unilaterally impose an economic principle or philosophy on a nation that will achieve its lofty objectives.There are two major obstructions. The first is that while business must aim to maximise profits, the government must aim to maximise social or public benefit. The two do not necessarily go hand in hand. That is why, in this huge country of ours, we have community service obligations and cross-subsidies that may not maximise profits but do deliver equality of price of access by Australian citizens to telephone, mail, electricity and so on.If we all lived in a country the size of Tasmania, these would be of little moment. It is difficult to create a single legislative framework that simultaneously fulfils economic efficiency and social obligations.Several groups have expressed concern about the vulnerability of community service obligations in the competition policy reform process. The Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations has a range of concerns as to its consumer, equity and environmental impact.Sydney University senior economics lecturer, Dr Evan Jones, warned that the restructuring of community service obligations is, in practice, concerned with their eradication and will probably hit the rural sector most of all. Utilities, airports, telecommunications et cetera are all heading to segment market niches with the real competition for the profitable niches.The question is: what happens to the niches that are not profitable and do not attract competition? Is there an adequate safety net for people in rural areas? Will CSOs be treated as a politicised and expensive privilege rather than a right? At the first sign of a loss of state revenue, will community service obligations be soft targets for budget cuts?Mr Monagle from the ACT and the Community and Public Sector Union said:We are concerned about the impact on services which are meant to be universally accessible, even if there may be a fee for service. What are the chances of them remaining fully accessible if they have to go to full cost recovery?Queensland local government is concerned about water supplies and the cost of water if cross-subsidisation does not continue. At this stage there has been no firm agreement between states and local government on CSOs. It has to be negotiated. No wonder local government described their situation as one of `tremendous uncertainty and great concern about where all this is going.How do we discern and define public benefit? The ultimate guardians of the public benefit are our Australian parliaments. Under the competition reform package, however, this power is abrogated to the competition commissioner. He or she will play an enormous role in adjudicating whether a specific market is operating in a way that is for or against the public benefit.I must make the point that we are not talking about the competition commissioner presiding over the fate of a couple of players in a few selective markets from time to time. We are talking about hundreds of thousands of Australian businesses and professions from all parts of the economy coming under the Hilmer microscope, whether at the state or national competition body level.So the second major obstacle in imposing a principle on an economy is the impossibility of knowing in advance how all these businesses will be affected in reality. Related to this is the other unknown: will the result actually be an increase in competition? This general lack of uncertainty and information about what the future holds under the Hilmer regime was reflected in many of the submissions to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, which looked into the Competition Policy Reform Bill.It comes as a surprise to many that small businesses are part of this nationwide push for improved competition. Most attention has focused on enormous utility organisations and how big business will now be able to get into those markets and make them more efficient. But tucked away in the competition agreements signed with the states is a section calling for a legislative review and, where appropriate, reform of all anti-competition legislation and regulation. A timetable for reform is to be completed by every government and submitted by June 1996. How high will the goalposts be? We do not know.In order to achieve such a mammoth task, much of the responsibility will be delegated to bureaucrats. Indeed, the Goss government recently passed a transport infrastructure bill to introduce some Hilmer reforms, which essentially said that we will achieve all these reforms through regulation—`Just sign here on the dotted line. Its very simple.The danger is obvious: unless you have a government committed to small business, which sees beyond the theory, then you are placing hundreds of thousands of small businesses, professions and farmers in a very vulnerable situation. They will have to go cap in hand to people who have never run a business in their life. I know Mr Carmody is in the gallery and I do thank him for his support over the last couple of weeks.No-one can reasonably object to improving legislation. No industry can reasonably object to changes that will improve efficiency and competition in the public interest. Many rural industries have worked hard in recent years to do exactly that. But I think it is quite reasonable to be wary of simplistic maxims such as, `Thou shalt deregulate, that assume a direct causal relationship with pure competition and public benefit.To better explain the scope of this legislative review, I seek leave to table an indicative list of Queensland legislation that would come under the Hilmer hammer.Leave granted.","N/A","COMPETITION POLICY REFORM BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"
216,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BOSWELL","YE4","(Queensland-","NP","Leader of the National Party of Australia)",1700,"—The list is the result of advice forwarded to me by Queensland and Commonwealth parliamentary library research specialists. I am indebted to the National Party member for Maroochydore, Fiona Simpson, who is concerned about small business, for passing on some of this information to me.There are more than 100 acts mentioned here—from architects and psychologists to the building and motor trades, travel agents and racing and betting acts. The list does not even mention the number of regulations which would have to be individually looked at. Let us say that there are 100 acts in every state that would have to be looked at for possible reform to comply with the competition principles. There would be 800 acts straight off before you even added the state regs, the Commonwealth statutes and the regulations and ordinances.A senior Treasury official at Senate estimates advised that several of the states, including Queensland, had canvassed reasonably widely in doing a survey of legislation that would be subject to Hilmer principles. When asked to table the results of this survey on what legislation would be reformed, Mr Goss replied:All legislation will have to be reviewed over the next five years to identify any anti-competitive elements and to subject them to a cost-benefit test.He added:The very intent of the reforms is that every anti-competitive provision in every piece of primary or subordinate legislation should be reviewed and carefully subjected to the cost benefit test.He mentioned the magnitude and complexity of the legislation review. I think we can take it as read that the list I have tabled is just the tip of the Hilmer iceberg.Mr Goss admitted to `an audit of government activities by legal advisers to identify which business activities would be affected by the application of part IV of the Trade Practices Act to the Crown in the right of each state. The Premier refused to table the audit because it deals with `commercial-in-confidence matters and is the subject of legal professional privilege. What I believe he meant to say is that all private enterprise regulations will be exposed to the Hilmer sunlight but his government is going to be very careful about letting anyone get too close to government enterprises. That is a double standard. If the Goss government were truly committed to the competition principles, it would be open about government enterprise reform. It is happy to throw small business to the deregulating wolves, but not its own—which is the very area where most of the benefits of competition package are going to flow from.In order to coordinate such a project—because you could not have one state deregulating, say, pharmacies one year and another state deregulating them two years later—there is the option within the competition agreement to have a national review of a particular industry. So what you end up with, in many cases, is a competition commissioner doing the work, making the decisions and taking the heat off the state governments.While not constitutionally compelled to apply competition principles, the states have nevertheless signed a performance-tiered agreement and they will be rewarded with money, which was rightly theirs in the first place, so long as they reform in line with the Hilmer principles. The advocates of deregulation are sure that there are a number of state laws which have the effect of exempting behaviour under section 51 but are not visibly or explicitly doing so. Under the new regime, these laws must be identified and amended to explicitly relate to the Trade Practices Act and, hence, bring more areas into the Commonwealth jurisdiction through the possibility of disallowance.Local governments are already on the record as fearing a heavy reliance on the state government to grant exemptions under section 51, which would be disallowable. Do small businesses, professions and farming enterprises have anything to fear from all this? It sounds simple: get rid of anti-competitive laws so that we can have a nice, efficient economy with lots of competition and we will all be better off. The major problem is that removing some regulations will make the big bigger at the expense of some of the small. The big can then dominate a market and charge oligopolistic prices to consumers without necessarily any changes to efficiency—competition has not increased; it will have decreased.The Hilmer report and the subsequent Industry Commission report used the fundamentally flawed assumption of pure competition, which is not possible in industries characterised by unequal market power. A newsagents submission said, `Our significant concern is that the unintended consequence of the legislation designed to foster competition may produce the opposite result. In many Australian industries—from beer to newsprint and hardware to groceries—there are a few players who are so large that they do exert considerable influence on price and raise the barriers to entry. They can sustain undercutting price wars to force new competitors out and they can extort the lowest prices from suppliers, so they grow more dominant. This bill does nothing to foster competition in those very imperfect markets. In fact, if you take away regulations that were set down to ensure that consumer interests were protected—for example, allowing only pharmacists to own pharmacies—you place more power in the hands of these conglomerates who can move to new markets and force the small players out.Efficiency and internationally competitive product prices and standards are not served by undermining a healthy small business sector. Mr Bowe, the President of the Australian Taxi Industry Association, disputed the benefits of Hilmer deregulation by saying:Certainly open entry is not going to produce a larger market of public to use those numbers. It would mean reduced income. In all of the areas of the world where it has been tried, reduced income has led to reduced quality of service and reduced quality of motor vehicle, and ultimately, the public, who are supposed to benefit from this ideological drive, are the sufferers. I hasten to add the point that, of the 21 states in America that embraced deregulation, 17—in the interests of the public—have had to re-regulate.Any process of compensation would probably be about $2 billion to $3 billion. This industry sees potential turmoil in the states feeling that they have to deregulate the taxi industry in order to get the money promised by the federal government.Several groups feel powerless to prove public benefit, in the face of the Industry Commission and Hilmer reports, which have already ruled it out. Mr Bowe, from the taxi association, complained that on two occasions the Industry Commission was not prepared to accept that the price of a taxi licence had to impact on fares. The associations frustration in dealing with these ideologically driven bodies is only too apparent, and I would suggest that it is only the beginning. The Queensland canegrowers message to the Senate committee was that they were:. . . vitally interested in the outcome of deliberations on the national competition policy. Part of the structure which has enabled the Queensland industry to take its dominant position in the world is our selling mechanism, whereby all sugar produced in Queensland is acquired by the Queensland Sugar Corporation which acts as a single desk seller. We see the potential that particular interpretations of the competition policy reform bill . . . might make these selling arrangements difficult or impossible to continue. Our particular interest is in the `public benefit test and the way in which this will be interpreted.Local government is concerned that the competition agreement does not provide for state and Commonwealth enterprises to pay local government rates and charges. By integrating their operations, Queensland local governments have improved their efficiency in comparison with other states. They are scared that this efficiency will be lost through dissection or dismemberment of business units through the competition policy arrangements.In Queensland, sole invitee rights are accorded to small rural councils because road works form a substantial part of the local economy. Mr Waldock from the Queensland Local Government Association told the committee:In those smaller communities, the roadworks gang of the council is the largest commercial activity in the area . . . the competition arrangements were such that councils were forced to disband those gangs because of competition with external operators who moved into the area and took advantage of commercial activity for a short period and then moved on somewhere else . . .Several witnesses to the Senate committee looking into the bill were concerned that many aspects of the implementation would be worked out in the courts. I hope the government has noted this. Has it considered the potential disruption involved in implementing this competition reform package? Does it have the answering strategies in place?I hope that I have proven that a strong small business hand will be needed to guide competitive reform in the direction that will be healthiest for Australia. It is not this one piece of legislation before us that will doom small business, because all it does is set up the Commonwealth framework. So much will depend on bureaucrats who have never run a small business yet will sit in judgment of the futures of hundreds of thousands of small businesses. Since they work to put into practice a specific governments policy, it is ultimately about that governments commitment to, and understanding of, small business.Unless you have a strong fighter in parliament for small business, the outcome could be disastrous. There is a discussion these days about getting more women into parliament. I totally agree with that, but there is a category of Australian that is almost as rare as a bilby, and that is a parliamentarian with a small business background. I trod the boards of small business for 20 years before coming here, and I have tried to bring that perspective into this parliament. But when you have a Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who says of small business, `If they are feeling the pinch, they ought to say that small business is not for me and go back to PAYE employment, I suggest that small business should be very concerned about Labors approach to deregulating everything except the labour market. Maybe the Prime Minister was prophesying the Hilmer fallout when he said of small business, `This is as good as it ever gets, meaning that it is probably going to get worse.","N/A","COMPETITION POLICY REFORM BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
217,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ABETZ","N26","(Tasmania)","LP","N/A",1704,"—I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to the debate on the Competition Policy Reform Bill 1995. I do so having had a longstanding interest in Commonwealth-state relations and being a federalist by conviction. I am also a very keen supporter of small business. I indicate at the outset that I was pleased to be able to participate on the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, which considered this bill in some detail. In fact, some 26 submissions were received. Whilst no publicity was given to the fact that the committee was sitting and deliberating, it once again shows the valuable work that the Senate and its committee system engages in, which unfortunately the public virtually never gets to hear about. I just place on record my thanks for the opportunity to participate in that process.Like Senator Boswell, I had some concerns about this legislation. The opportunity to ask questions of departmental officers and industries involved has relieved me of a lot of those initial fears. I will briefly comment on some remarks of Senator Boswell. It is very rare that I disagree with Senator Boswell, but on this issue I do. I disagree with him on the basis that I think he tried to tie down the legislation far too strictly with his comments. I am not sure that I wrote this down correctly, but there was a new maxim: thou shalt deregulate or thou shalt not regulate. I forget the way that he put it. The thrust of the legislation is that there should not be any regulation unless it can be justified on the basis of certain criteria. That was the important aspect that I think, with respect, Senator Boswell left out in his comments on this legislation.I turn to some of the key aspects of this legislation that may be of interest to some people. A major aspect of the bill is the creation of an access regime defined in the explanatory memorandum as providing for the declaration of certain services provided by facilities which are of national significance by which persons may seek access to declared services. The Trade Practices Commission and the Prices Surveillance Authority will be merged to form the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, and a new advisory body, the National Competition Council, NCC, will be established. Further, defining new Commonwealth state relations are two intergovernmental agreements—the conduct agreement and the competition principles agreement.The conduct agreement sets out processes for amendments to the competition laws of the Commonwealth, the states and the territories and for appointments to the commission. Amongst other things, the competition principles agreement sets out the arrangements for appointments to the National Competition Council and the principles which governments have agreed to follow in relation to prices oversight, structural reform of public monopolies, review of anti-competitive legislation and regulations, access to services provided by means of essential facilities and elimination of the net competitive advantages enjoyed by government businesses where they compete with a private sector.To a great degree, pressure has always been placed on the states to submit to competition without an equal focus on the Commonwealth. The statement has been made by the federal government that competition is good for all sectors of the economy. With that, I would basically agree. Yet the new section 235A states specifically that part IIIA of the Trades Practices Act access regime does not apply to the supply of telecommunications services by a carrier or under licence. There is no deregulation at all of the labour market. I will make comments about that later. An important provision, new section 29B (2) and (3), allows the council to carry out a function conferred on it by law of a state or territory. The council in carrying out its functions may cooperate with a department, body or authority of the Commonwealth, state or territory. The council has the potential to become a most powerful body.Provisions provide for the declaration of certain services provided by facilities which are of national significance and for the means by which persons may seek access to the declared services. By signing the competition principles agreement, governments agree to the processes for further micro-economic reform, but in general each government will be responsible for setting their own timetables and agenda for progressing these reforms. In relation to comments made earlier by Senator Boswell, I believe that aspect needs to be kept in mind.Another very important area of concern is that of the community service obligations. Many of the government business enterprises affected by these reforms perform important community service obligations by virtue of their monopoly or near monopoly position in the market. Concerns have been raised over the future compliance with these community service obligations, particularly in the climate of privatisation of government business enterprises and increased competition in the utility sectors of the market.While the bill does not deal directly with the question of community service obligations, the competition principles agreement does consider them particularly in relation to prices oversight. As prices oversight is primarily the responsibility of the state or territory that owns the enterprise, the agreement states—and I think it is appropriate that this be put on record:. . . State and Territory Parties will consider establishing independent sources of price oversight advice where these do not exist.It further states that any independent source should take into account:. . . any explicitly identified and defined community service obligations imposed on a business enterprise by the Government or legislature of the jurisdiction that owns the enterprise . . .Once again, to a certain extent, I think that answers the concerns that Senator Boswell raised. We on this side express our concern about the maintenance of community service obligations by state and territory owned business enterprises. But I am satisfied, given the mention of that in the agreement, that they will be appropriately taken care of.During the Senate Economics Legislation Committee hearing into this bill a number of issues of concern were raised that were meritorious. They highlighted that when one introduces such wholesale change, it is appropriate that it be done with a degree of sensitivity. The Liberal Party signed a brief, but nevertheless pungent, minority report which is on page 7 of the committee report. That was signed by my colleagues Senators Chapman and Gibson and myself. That highlighted three matters. Before developing those concerns, I hasten to add that, despite having expressed those concerns, the Liberal Party—speaking for myself as well—supports the legislation.The first point that I wish to raise—Senator Boswell touched on it as well—is the question of local government. It is in the Hansard and, as time is marching on, I will not bother quoting it. For those who are interested, at pages 29 and 30 of the Hansard dated 5 June 1995 there was some concern expressed. We voiced those concerns in our minority report. It is important that those concerns are given public expression and are placed on the public record. Paragraph 2 of the minority report states:The concern of Local Government in relation to the non-payment of rates and charges by State/Territory Governments is a matter that the States and Territories ought address.I move on to the concerns of small business, such as the taxi industry, which expressed concerns. My own view is that some of those concerns were not fully justified. If it does have a good argument as to why its particular industry serves the community well by a degree of regulation, that regulation will be sustained and it will be allowed to continue.The other point which I want to make and which I hinted at earlier is this governments complete refusal to deal with labour market reform. In an economy there are a whole range of matters that need to be dealt with. Clearly, the cost of labour and the way the labour market operates has a significant and vital impact on the total economy, on its productivity, on the number of jobs that become available, on the standard of living that is available within the community and the profitability of companies and individuals. From that profitability governments are then able to raise tax revenue to deal with some of the important social justice issues of the day. Without the profitability, governments cannot raise the taxes to then deliver the taxes to those who are so deserving.Clearly, why the government has not touched the question of industrial relations reform is because it is continually doing deals with the trade union movement to protect itself. We have not seen a better example of that in recent days than the unfortunate demise of Senator Bruce Childs from this place in about two years time to make way for a trade union official who, with respect, does not have a very good reputation. Of course, I refer to George Campbell.","N/A","COMPETITION POLICY REFORM BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

219,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ABETZ","N26","(Tasmania)","LP","N/A",1704,"—Senator Sherry asks what that has to do with competition policy. It indicates the way that the Australian Labor Party and the trade union movement of this country always act for each others mutual benefit. If there is a test of competition to be applied to government business enterprises, state governments, territories and the professions across the board, one would have to ask, `Why not include labour market reform? The reason is that the Australian Labor Partys financial lifeblood is through the compulsory levies that it gets from the trade union move ment.In Tasmania we still have a closed shop waterfront. Whilst Labor talks about its abhorrence of hereditary titles and its concern about the monarchy, let me say that in Australia there is only one class of people that has a hereditary birthright. They are the sons of wharfies who can be signed up at birth and given preference for jobs on Australias waterfront. No other job has that. I cannot sign up my sons or daughter to be lawyers so they get first advantage. It ought to be competitive.All of a sudden members of the Labor Party have gone deadly quiet. There are no more interjections, because I have them where it hurts. At the beginning of the governments reform process of the waterfront—this is the alleged process that it went through—the average ship turnaround time was 44 hours. Those in the gallery might be interested in hearing these figures. The Waterfront Industry Reform Authority identified a turnaround time as its target of 27 hours. To that, I say well done and well identified. It is something that ought be achieved. The government sets about, allegedly, reforming but all it did was rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic . In June 1994 what was the average turnaround time for ships in Sydney? Was it 27 hours or the 44 hours before the reforms took place? No, it was 53.4 hours. What a great record on reform! In Melbourne Ports the average turnaround time was not 27 hours, not 44 hours, but 47 hours. A great record of reform! Just in case honourable senators are interested in reform, the average wharfie earns $75,000 per annum. This is the result of the Australian Labor Partys dynamic reform process. I support the Competition Policy Reform Bill.","N/A","COMPETITION POLICY REFORM BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

221,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ABETZ","N26","(Tasmania)","LP","N/A",1704,"—Senator Calvert makes a very interesting and very proper interjection when he says that they receive it as opposed to earning it. The simple fact is that the Australian Labor Party is too scared to deal with the real problems facing this country of waterfront reform and labour reform. Having said that, I still support the legislation but there needs to be a lot more reform in other areas. It is about time the government got the courage and the backbone to deal with those other very important aspects of our economy.A lot of people would ask, `What is in it for us?—the average Australian in their suburban home or, indeed, the farmers in rural Australia. I have some doubt about the estimates and I will look at the figures with interest in due course. It is anticipated that as a result of the reforms to be initiated by this legislation, there will be an average saving to each Australian household of about $1,500 per annum. I believe that that is a significant saving and a significant benefit for average Australians who otherwise might not normally be interested in a bill which is entitled the Competition Policy Reform Bill, but there are very real benefits for them—the ultimate consumers—at the end of the day, estimated at $1,500 per Australian household.I welcome the general thrust of this legislation, look forward to its implementation and also look forward to other important reforms being undertaken as soon as there is a change of government.Debate interrupted.","N/A","COMPETITION POLICY REFORM BILL 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

223,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator IAN MACDONALD","YW4","(Queensland)","LP","N/A",1707,"—Madam Deputy President, you can say a lot of things about the Queensland Premier, Wayne Goss. One of the things you cannot say is that he is not a skilful politician. He said yesterday that he did not want Paul Keating or Mickey Mouse in Queensland for the election. He must think Queensland people are living in fantasy land if he thinks that sort of rhetoric is going to fool them into not seeing what his connection is with the federal Labor Party. I see in todays newspapers that he has gone even stronger than that in saying, `We dont want Keating here at any cost.Goss is simply indulging in the sort of hypocrisy the Labor Party has become renowned for, the hypocrisy of trying to distance himself from Mr Keating and indulging in a bit of good old-fashioned Queensland style Canberra bashing. He thinks that will do him good in the state election coming up. But the Queensland people are not Disneyland type people; they are not in fantasy land as Mr Goss thinks them to be. The people of Queensland understand that the government Mr Goss runs in Queensland is the same sort of high taxing, big spending, big bureaucracy government that we have here in Canberra.My colleague the Queensland member Mrs Sullivan asked a question in the House of Representatives yesterday. She alerted the parliament of Australia to the fact that state taxes, fees and fines in Queensland have jumped from $2.3 billion in 1989-90, the last year of the term of the previous government, to $4 billion in 1995-96, under the Goss Labor government. That represents a 76 per cent increase in six years.I do not think that even Senator Sherrys government could match that—a 76 per cent increase in fees, fines and state taxes by the Queensland Labor government in six short years. What a disgraceful effort that has been, affecting those of us who live in Queensland. We are now paying 76 per cent more in taxes, fines and charges than we were when Mr Gosss government came in. That means that I—and every other Queenslander—will pay $1,260 in state taxes in 1995-96, compared with the $790 that I used to pay six years ago in the term of the previous government. That is an increase for me and for every other Queenslander of $470 annually in state taxes, thanks to the state Labor government.Do you know what the new Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) said in answer to Mrs Sullivans question yesterday? He said that the people of Queensland should thank Premier Goss accordingly. Mr Beazley thinks that we Queenslanders should thank Wayne Goss for increasing our taxes by 76 per cent in the last six years.I think it is important that Queenslanders be alerted to this subterfuge by the Labor Party. You can be assured that in the next few weeks Mr Goss will indulge in a bit more Canberra bashing and he will get stuck into Mr Keating. But you can bet your bottom dollar that he has already checked it out with Mr Keating, and worked out the strategy. If he is at all persuasive, he will get Mr Keating to criticise him, to try to enhance his vote.All this rhetoric at election time is tremendous and brilliant but what we really have to look at is that when the crunch comes, what does Mr Goss do about the excesses of the Keating government? What about the fuel tax increases that go up automatically now every six months? Do we ever hear a pipsqueak from Mr Goss and the Labor Party in Queensland about Mr Keating—his mate—increasing automatically those petrol taxes every six months?I have listened to and read quite a lot but I have not heard or seen anything from Mr Goss or Mr DeLacey, his Treasurer, or from anyone else in the Queensland Labor government, about the 12 per cent increase on goods and services in the housing industry. I think they were pretty loud and vocal about the honest GST proposed by the coalition before the last election, but when Mr Keating introduces a goods and services tax on building construction—on housing, kitchens and cabinet making—we do not hear a pipsqueak from them or from Senator Sherry.This subterfuge of pretending that Queensland and federal Labor are different parties is hypocrisy. What have we heard from the Queensland government about the horrendous way in which unemployment has attacked Queensland, regional Queensland in particular? Youth unemployment in the regions of Queensland is around 35 to 40 per cent. Do we ever hear anything from Mr Goss about that? The number of long-term unemployed in Queensland is up tremendously. It is very high by national standards, yet there is not a word from Mr Goss.Mr Goss is introducing an electricity line through national parks and a lot of farming properties in the southern border area of Queensland. His mines and energy minister has said, `We are going to put that in, regardless of what the people of Queensland say. But where is Senator Faulkner in this instance? Where is he jumping up and down and saying, `Hey, you cant do that. He does not want to offend his mates in the Queensland Labor government.When we look at the document I referred to in question time today, entitled Drawing the line on poverty: an assessment of poverty and disadvantage in Queensland and commissioned by the Queensland Council of Social Services, we see Queensland is in a parlous state. Today I mentioned just four examples of how people in Queensland cannot get decent access to health services or any help with unemployment in my state which has been run by a Labor government now for six years in conjunction with a federal Labor government that has been in power for some 12 years. Poverty in Queensland is at a tragic level. Nothing is done by the Queensland Labor government and do not expect anything from the crew down here who have really forgotten the little people in Australia.I do not want to hold up the Senate. I am aware that we are anxious to get on to estimates committees. I just want to conclude by quoting from a speech Mr Keating made to a Labor Party dinner in Brisbane last year. It shows the hypocrisy of the Labor Party. When it suits, coming up to a Queensland election, the parties try to distance themselves from each other. Goss says he does not want Keating there and, as I say, he will indulge in a bit of Keating bashing and Canberra bashing over the next few weeks. But if you really want to know what it is all about, refer to the words of Mr Keating at that Labor Party dinner last year at the Greek Club in Brisbane. This is how Mr Keating finishes:So, thanks for having me back on this occasion, its a long way from the election now but weve got a lot to do yet. And, as we do it I hope you people of the Labor party in Queensland can be proud of this government—meaning Gosss government—proud of what we stand for, but, as important as that, know one thing, that well all stand together—Commonwealth Labor Government, Queensland Labor Government, Paul Keating and Wayne Goss, our ministers, our party friends and supporters, all of us, together.There we are. No matter how much in the next few weeks Mr Goss tries to distance himself from Mr Keating, there it is: they all stand together. The sort of federal government in Canberra at the present time is the sort of government that is becoming increasingly obvious in Queensland—there is the same arrogance, the couldnt care less attitude, the we know best attitude. It always reminds me of one of Wayne Gosss promises before the 1989 election. He said, `I want to do to Queensland what John Cain has done for Victoria. He is succeeding. From being one of the wealthiest states, we continue to go backwards, and the people of Queensland should be aware of that.

224,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator REID","VI4","(Australian Capital Territory)","LP","N/A",1709,"—Mr Acting Deputy President, if you had listened to AM this morning, you would be left in no doubt that there is an election in the air—probably in August of this year, maybe a little later, but certainly it is imminent. The Labor Party is running the same tired old line it was running during the campaign in 1983 and, of course, in 1980. What it says in Canberra every time is, `If you vote for the Liberals, you will lose your jobs in the Public Service.I want to put on record this afternoon the actual facts of what Labor has done to the Public Service, and Canberra in particular, so that people will be able to evaluate the sort of rubbish that the government keeps putting out as the election campaign goes on. As I said, it started the campaign this morning. There have been changes to the Public Service and drops in the number of staff under Labor, and you might say they are justified. The government may be able to explain it. But that is not what I am talking about today. I am talking about what the government says on the one hand and what it actually does on the other. That is what the people of Canberra and the people of Australia generally need to know something about.The Department of Finance Public Service Staffing Statistics Report 1994 states:At the end of the 1994 calendar year the number of paid permanent and temporary staff in the Australian Public Service totalled 141,700. This figure comprised 124,900 permanent staff (down by 2% over the year) and 16,800 temporary staff (down by 8% cent over the year).That is a significant drop. The same document goes on to say:At 31 December 1993, there were 143,100 permanent staff—That is quite a drop from what it was prior to the last election, when the government ran the campaign that if you voted Liberal, you would lose your job in the Public Service. There were, in fact, 149,035 staff at that time.The government might be able to explain the drop. It might be able to say why it has been cutting away at Public Service numbers, getting rid of more people than it has been employing. But what it says at election time is that we are the ones likely to do that, not it.Prior to the last election, we had Senator Nick Bolkus boasting on the Matthew Abraham show on 28 April 1992, and again in parliament on 19 September 1992, that staffing numbers in the Department of Administrative Services—that was his department at the time, so he would know—had been decreased from 18,000 to 13,000. He went on to say:It is a process that continues and will continue.In parliament on 14 December 1992 he said:Over recent years DAS has been reduced from a department with some 18,000 staff to one with some 11,200 staff.On 17 September 1992 the Canberra Times reported:The Labor Government intends to retrench a further 2,300 people from DAS over the next two years.During the same two-year period government business enterprises have reduced their staffing levels by a massive 34,000 people. Under the Labor government at that time—I am talking about 1992—the Department of Administrative Services lost 1,168 staff; the Department of Defence lost 697 staff; and the Australian Taxation Office lost 4,711 staff. Those figures are taken from the Department of Finance Statistical Bulletin of 1991-92. So honourable senators can trace the history of what has happened.It is even more interesting, though, to look at what the Labor Party has moved out of the national capital during the time it has been in government. We could ask a very good question in relation to each one of them as to why it was moved out of Canberra. That has never been satisfactorily explained in relation to any of them. Of course, the cost to taxpayers of doing so also is a matter that taxpayers would be interested in.I will tell the Senate some of the organisations that have been transferred away from the national capital, not set up somewhere else. The Human Rights Commission was transferred from Canberra to Sydney—at what cost? The Administrative Appeals Tribunal transferred from Canberra to Brisbane—at what cost and for what reason? The Industry Commission transferred to Melbourne; Australian Defence Industries transferred to Sydney. The National Aviation College, which ought by any test to have been established in Canberra, was established in Tasmania for totally political reasons.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

You are not game to answer, are you? It has been transferred out of Launceston—at what cost to the people involved and the taxpayers of Australia? The Australia Post national stamp collection was removed from Canberra to Melbourne. In 1989 the government threatened to relocate the Maritime Safety Authority to Newcastle. In the end it had the good sense to change that decision, but only after an enormous amount of lobbying to keep it in Canberra, which is where it should have been and now is.The federal Labor government voted for the Australian National Training Authority to be in Brisbane, rather than in the national capital, where, quite clearly, a national authority of that kind ought to have been based. Why were the CSIRO headquarters moved to Melbourne from Canberra in the December-January 1992-93 period? It was costly, and for what reason? There was also a proposal to transfer the Australian Broadcasting Authority to Sydney, but that was defeated in the end by the pressure of the sense of it staying in Canberra. So, at any whim the government will shift out of Canberra anything it likes. It does so not because it is in the best interests of the organisation, but for some reason of its own. It is in no position to talk about what a Liberal government would do.The reason this matter has come this week is because Senator Ian Macdonald had a paper and some notes of his own about his own area of responsibility—regional development. In it he referred to the fact that if he was able to persuade his colleagues for the $1 billion or so that he would like to see allocated to regional development—I suspect many of us would too—he would propose that some of that be spent at the coal face, where regional development is necessary. Who could argue with that? This was latched on to by the Labor Party as saying that we would take public servants from Canberra. Not every Commonwealth public servant is located in Canberra. In fact, I think it is only about 26 per cent who are located in Canberra.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

228,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator REID","VI4","(Australian Capital Territory)","LP","N/A",1709,"—There are a lot in Townsville. The great departments of state are based here. They are the big policy departments, so of course they would be here. But the others are out in the regions. The Department of Social Security has regional offices in many parts of Australia; they are delivering services to those in receipt of social security, in areas where there are a lot of people in receipt of social security. The Department of Veterans Affairs has offices in other parts of Australia where they are delivering services to veterans in need of those services. The Commonwealth Employment Service has offices all over Australia where they are delivering services to people who are unemployed. In regional development, if the government were spending money on it, it would have public servants based in the areas in which it was spending the money and where it was needed to deliver those services.There are other service departments out and about in the community. But no, the Labor Party just latches on to this one little thing to try to persuade people that if we were in government the Public Service would be attacked. I can assure you, it would not. We are very conscious of the need for a responsible, efficient, competent public service. The number of Commonwealth public servants in Canberra, in the national capital, would probably remain at about 26 per cent of the total number of public servants.I thought it was worth running over some of the figures today. There are others but that is about all I can fit in in the 10 minutes allowed for an adjournment speech. I have done so to remind the people of Canberra not to be misled by Labors propaganda.Senate adjourned at 2.21 p.m.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"
