To a great degree, however, Empire defence is home defence, for without the Empire we would soon have no homo to defend. Since the beginning of this war we have been given a very vivid reminder of the degree to which our economic security depends upon the supremacy of the British Empire. What would have been the value to us of the £100,000,000 worth of primary produce which we have shipped to the other side of the world if our trade routes had not been kept open? The transport of these commodities was only possible because of the protection afforded by the British navy. Our destiny as a free and intelligent people is bound up with that of the British Empire because, if the Empire should go down, Australia would become a big prize for one of the large powers which would then dominate the world.

That position is already acute, and it is becoming more acute as the war proceeds and will remain so for some time after the war has ended. An effective shipbuilding programme is vital in the interests of Aus, tralian economy and in order to keep the Empire supplied with foodstuffs. The building of ships, therefore, should be the first consideration of the Government ; because that work is certainly more important at the present time than the manufacture of motor cars. In view of the limited equipment and number of skilled men available, it is clear that it will be impossible to proceed with vigorous programmes for both shipbuilding and motor car manufacturing. Therefore, the Government must concentrate for the present upon shipbuilding. Finance for both projects will have to come from Consolidated Revenue. The Government has raised a special levy of approximately £1,350,000 for the manufacture of motor cars, but this sum has gone into Consolidated Revenue, not to the credit of a special fund, as apparently some honorable members and others outside Parliament believe.","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALs SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[1]/para[3]","N/A","N/A"

An examination of the present personnel of the Senate discloses that of 36 senators, 33 have names beginning with letters in the first half of the alphabet the AtoM group. The desire of all parties to nominate candidates whose names begin with the letter  A  or closely succeeding letters is becoming more intense. At the last Senate elections when nineteen senators were elected because an extra senator had to be returned in New South Walesonly one candidate whose name began with a letter in the latter half of the alphabet was successful.

Today our mechanized methods of production have developed the equivalent of 15,000,000,000 horsepower throughout the world, and this could, and should, be harnessed for the benefit of the race. To put it in another way, the horsepower which is available for the service of every man, woman and child of the 2,000,000,000 who inhabit the earth, is sufficient to produce an abundance of food and services for the benefit of mankind, and there should be no need for any widespread unemployment.

I should not have spoken today except for the ominous statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) with regard to the coal strike. He has said that next week he proposes to open the mines and attempt to work them by free labour. Appended to the award of Judge DrakeBrockman is a history in serial form of the disputes in the coal industry. The first dispute, and one over hours, occurred in 1S73, and not far down thi3 long roll occurs the mournful and laconic entry:  188S Strike free labourtroops . As long ago as that an attempt to work the mines by free labour loosed upon the people the military forces of the colony of New South Wales 1 The project, which the right honorable the Prime Minister and his colleagues have adopted, is a project which exposes this country to the great danger of disorder and to an enormous breach of national unity. During the Corio byelection campaign the Prime Minister told us that the eyes of Hitler were on Corio. I should like to know upon whom the eyes of Hitler will be very soon if there is a breach of the national unity of Australia. The responsibility for that breach will rest upon the Government, which instead of acting as mediator takes the side, as governments of this sort always have done, of the owners and masters. It appears to me from a careful study of the award that the facts of this dispute . have been forgotten or overlooked. They are encrusted with a mass of prejudices, and I propose to deal with the prejudices with which this dispute has been clouded by none other than the Prime Minister himself. In the first place, he tells us that, the miners are unsportsmanlike, because they dispute the umpires decision. What was the umpires decision ? The honorable member for Hunter (Mr. James) has told us that he considers that the umpires decision was the decision of His Honour Judge DrakeBrockman. The miners think so and, if one reads the records, one would think that there is a good deal in that. What happened? There was a stoppage of work in the New South Wales coalfields for six weeks in 1938. The cause of that stoppage was that the owners had refused to confer upon demands made by the unions in the mining industry. One demand was for a reduction of hours. That stoppage ended upon a basis suggested by the Government of New South Wales. The suggestion made by that Government was that the part of the claims which could be dealt with by the Arbitration Court should be dealt with by the court and the part which could not be should be examined by a royal commission, and that upon the report of that commission social legislation might be passed.

Mien engaged in the same class of occupation in Western Australia were foolish and unfair enough to say that 75 per cent, of the coalminers in New South Wales are Communists. What is the position? Mr. William Orr was chosen by the vote of the miners, I suppose, because of his efficiency, and because of the mens confidence in him, although they had no confidence in his politics. Men of the same class as those who elect a Communist as their general secretary reject the Communists with such wholehearted enthusiasm at general elections that the Communists lose their deposits.

I repeat that the fact that two, or three, or four Communists may be among the leaders of the Miners Federation does not affect the attitude of the other unions who are fighting in support of the miners demands in this struggle. Men are called Communists who, in fact, are not Communists. The northern president of the Miners Federation, Mr. Bondy Hoare, has long been a member of a body known as the Australian Socialist Labour party. He is not a Communist. It is quite true that in this dispute he agrees with leaders who are Communists. But many other men who are not Communists also agree with those leaders and are fighting side by side with them in this struggle men who, in some cases because of their religious convictions, opposed communism, whilst others on the political platforms and at the ballotbox reject Communist candidates with contumely. You will find such men working shoulder by shoulder with socalled Communists in vindication of the miners demands. It is quite within the power of the Government to settle this strike fairly. No persons are more willing than the miners to listen to the Prime Minister if he approaches them in a spirit of equity, fairness and humanity. I believe that if the Prime Minister had given the miners an opportunity to state their position equal to that which he took himself, he would have been received with open arms on the coalfields. If the miners had been allowed to broadcast their case just as he broadcast his own and the mineowners case to the country, there would be no trouble on the coalfields now. I can sympathize with the spirit of men who refuse to allow their institutions to be used as a megaphone by the Prime Minister in order to broadcast their opponents side of the case to the country. I appeal to the right honorable gentleman to listen to my representations in this matter. The history of the mining industry is studded with bitter struggles. As I have already pointed out, 50 years ago we had strikes followed by the calling in of free labour under the protection of troops. Unlike wharf labourers and seamen, the coalminers are a solid and permanent community of workers who live as well as work side by side, and they have been drilled and trained in the principles of class solidarity and loyalty. How can the Prime Minister expect to deal with men of that kind easily? Does he believe that by putting free labour into the mines he will do anything but divide the community in a desire to bring about an early election, just as he tried to fight the Corio byelection on the war issue and talk of national unity. Just as Joseph Chamberlain exploited the Boer War for election purposes in 1900 and Woodrow Wilson in the last war appealed to the American people to give his party a majority in Congress, so this trouble with all its attendant misery to the miners and the workers generally will be used as a means to enable the United Australia party to secure a new lease of political life.","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALs SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[3]/para[9]","N/A","N/A"

It is merely academical to ask why parties to an industrial dispute do not obey the law. You cannot settle disputes or bring about industrial peace in that way. I am not sure that the political advantage which the Prime Minister and his colleagues expect will accrue to them. In 1909, the Premier of New South Wales. Charles Gregory Wade, was faced with a coal strike. He passed special legislation for the purpose of dealing with that strike, but when the people of New South Wales realized that the strikers leaders, including Peter Bowling, were brought down from the coalfields to Sydney with irons on their limbs, they rejected Charles Gregory Wade at the next election with such determination that he never again obtained office in New South Wales; and at the following federal election in 1910 they voted overwhelmingly in favour of Labour because of this experience of a coalowners government which pursued the owners ends.","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALs SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[3]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I should not have participated in this debate but for the attempts of honorable members opposite, including the honorable member for Bourke (Mr. Blackburn), to justify the actions of the strikers. They are doing a disservice to the people of this country by encouraging a continuance of the strike. The remarks of the honorable member for Bourke always carry much weight in this House. He laboured the contention that in this instance the strikers should be entitled to take advantage of the decision of the single judge, that is, the decision of the lower court, or the decision of the Full Court, whichever they preferred. He pointed out that in the lower court Judge DrakeBrockman decided in favour of the principle of uniformity of hours, whereas the Full Court altered that decision. The honorable member contended that the men should have the right to maintain the decision of Judge DrakeBrockman, and to reject those parts of the decision of the Full Court which do not suit them. As a lawyer, the honorable member knows very well that the decision of the court implies that of the higher court. The Arbitration Court has one principle in common with our civil and criminal tribunals in that proceedings within its jurisdiction are initiated before a magistrate or a single judge. That decision is final unless it be appealed against. Certain limitations as to time and conditions are prescribed for the lodging of appeals of this kind. Either party to a plaint, if it be dissatisfied with a decision, has the right of appeal against the judgment of the lower court. But when the full bench upsets a decision of the lower court it is quite wrong to say that the decision of the court is the decision of the lower court. It is the decision of the higher court that counts, because that decision really abrogates the decision of the lower court. In this instance the miners refused to accept the decision of the Arbitration Court. That court was constituted for the purpose of ensuring that justice would be done to employees. It was established for the advantage rather of employees than employers. The miners now refuse to abide by the decision of the court. The honorable member for Bourke advanced the extraordinary proposition that no party will observe the law in industrial disputes. He referred to the decision of the court as an academic matter. That proposition cannot be tolerated for one moment. Too often in the past sections of employees have been dissatisfied with the decisions of the Arbitration Court and have repudiated them, and too much encouragement is given to such opposition by nien like the honorable member for Bourke and other honorable members opposite. These honorable gentlemen must feel in their hearts that the strikers are doing wrong. At the present time, when this country is at war and, when by their action, they are throwing other people out of employment, thus retarding our war effort, honorable gentlemen who talk in this vein are committing a disloyal and immoral act. They must know that they are doing wrong in speaking in this chamber in order to encourage the miners to continue on strike. I deplore the element of party politics which has been introduced into this debate. I confess that honorable members on this side have been as much to blame in that respect as honorable members opposite. However, it is most deplorable when any honorable member should speak in this House in order to encourage the miners to continue their resistance. They must know that, by striking, the miners are acting illegally and disloyally, and that such action cannot be justified. Consequently, honorable members opposite would1 do a great service to this country if they would either refrain from giving encouragement to the strikers or take their courage in their own hands and tell the strikers quite plainly the truth of their position. Members of the Opposition, or of any other political body, who by such actions encourage men to prolong the strike, put themselves in a position akin to that of the Communist leaders who are misleading the miners.","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALs SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is all very well for members on the Government side to make inflammatory speeches, in an attempt to condemn the attitude of the men engaged in this or any other struggle because, after all, both sides in an industrial dispute break the law. A few years ago, when there was a lockout in the coal industry, the Government of the day refused to listen to an appeal by one of its supporters, who was an eminent barrister, that action should be taken, against the coalowners. That fact is overlooked by Government supporters today. They are always on the side of money power and against those in the community who are less fortunate.

Unfortunately, there was not a double dissolution, and because of a hostile majority in the Senate the Labour Government was unable to clean up the mess which it had inherited. The Minister was at considerable pains to tell the people of the failings of that Labour Government, but he did not say, for instance, that the BrucePago Government had borrowed money overseas in order to pay interest on money borrowed previously.

In 1913 when the Labour party was in control in both branches of this legislature it tackled the problem of defence in statesmanlike manner. When that Government suggested the establishment of an Australian navy its political opponents said there was no need for such a navy, and that we were not prepared to accept the protection afforded by the British navy. Despite criticism, the Labour party formed the first unit of the Royal Australian Navy, and that navy is playing an important part today in assisting to convoy our produce overseas to Great Britain.

The result has been that the operations of the bank have ever since been restricted in certain directions. The bank has not been able to conduct its affairs with the maximum of value to the people. Unfortunately, persons interested in the operations of the private trading banks have been able unduly to influence the situation. The Commonwealth Bank rendered outstanding service to the nation during the last war, and the late Sir Denison Miller, the first Governor of the bank, made it clear that it could have rendered just as signal service to the nation in peacetime as it did in wartime had it been allowed to do so.

The purchase of the Bay liners and of the other vessels in the Governments fleet was a great development, and it was tragic that the ships should subsequently have been sold by the Bruce Page Government. Had the fleet remained in the possession of the Government, we should not now be facing such difficulties as the Prime Minister has referred to in the last day or so in the transport of our products overseas. The right honorable gentleman did not, it is true, state that the difficulties we are now facing would have been minimized had those ships not been sold, but it is nevertheless a fact that had that sale not been made the position would have been very much easier now than it is. The ships were practically given away. When the five Bay liners and two Dale steamers were sold to the White Star Line, controlled by the Kylsant interests, in 1928 they represented a total outlay of £7,225,000, comprising capital cost of £4,725,000, and running losses of £2,500,000, or so it was claimed. The vessels were sacrificed for £1,900,000, the conditions of the sale providing that £250,000 should be paid in cash and the remainder in ten annual instalments of £165,000 [Leave to continue given.] Thus an asset worth approximately £7,000,000 was sold for less than £2,000,000; but the Commonwealth has not even been paid that price. I understand that £600,000 is still owing on the line, because the firm which purchased the steamers had as its head a man who, to say the least of him, was not quite honest, and, because of his dealings, is now in gaol.","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALs SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[5]/para[12]","N/A","N/A"

Not only did the transaction involve the Commonwealth in a loss of many millions of pounds, but also, because the vessels were sold at a sacrificial price under powerful political pressure, the primary producers of this country have been compelled to pay dearly in increased shipping freights, by reason of the removal of the competition factor which the seven steamers constituted during the time they were operating in the national interests. The estimated saving to the primary producers of £500,000 a year, in respect of f reight charges, proves the correctness of this contention, if any proof be needed. Despite the fact that these ships were being run at a loss, the Government would have been wise to keep them in service, because of the effect they had on overseas freight rates. In any case, much of the loss was due to mismanagement. Immediately the vessels were disposed of, freights rose and the result has been a loss to the primary producers of this country of about £500,000 a year. That was in normal times. The value of the ships in this time of war would be inestimable. Had the Bay lines been retained, they could have been operated as they were during the last war. Not only would they have been able to supply Great Britain with the foodstuffs which it so urgently requires, but they would also have enabled Australia to preserve its economic stability by continuing its export trade. It must be remembered that Australia has to meet vast interest commitments overseas. It is necessary to preserve the dollar exchange, and the goods which we could have sent out of this country would have gone a long way towards doing that. As it is, primary products are going to waste. Only a fortnight ago I saw apples which had been dumped on a river bank because space could not be found to ship them overseas. In Canberra good apples cannot be obtained, and the ones for which Hd. is paid are of very poor quality. There is not an apple on the tables of the hotels run by the Department of the Interior. Fruit and other primary products cannot be obtained overseas. I repeat that the Bay liners were not sold but were given away, and actions such as that are in marked contrast to the accomplishments of the Labour Government during i the short time it was in power.

It relates to husbands who have been living apart from their wives and families. These separations may have been due to any of a variety of reasons, but it is usually the wife and children who suffer most if the husband either will not work, or, when he does work, spends his money in such a way that his domestic responsibilities are neglected. Some of these men have volunteered for service abroad, and have either left Australia, or will do so in the near future and, because in some cases the wife has been successful in getting from the court a maintenance order for only £1 a week £1 a week would be the maximum if the husband were not in regular employment the Government has decided that it can pay no more than that. In other words,, the Government is sheltering behind the fact that the man who has enlisted in its military forces has, in the past, so neglected his responsibilities that his wife isin receipt of only £1 by means of a court separation order. I have received communications from the Minister for the Army (Mr. Street) in regard to this matter, and he informs me that war financial regulations clearly state that a separation allowance can be approved only when theallotment made by the soldier is not sufficient to cover the amount of the court order. I say to the Minister now that if that provision is contained in the war financial regulations, there is somethingwrong with those regulations. It is timethat the Government realized its responsibility, and ceased to shelter behind suchtechnicalities. It is a gross injustice that: the wives and children should be so neglected.

I wish to draw the attention of the Minister for Aviation (Mr. Fairbairn) to the position of a group of about 150 young men, recruited as wireless operators, and for other skilled positions, who are at present supposed to be undergoing training at Point Cook and Laverton. Some of these men. have been there for three months none has been there for less than two months and they are becoming dissatisfied because they have not yet started their classes for training. They are working for 5s. a day,, which is much less: than many of them were receiving, before they enlisted,, and they are engaged upon labouring work, such as digging postholes and shovelling mullock. They do not mind hard work, but they are anxious to begin their training. They have been told that the first class will begin on the13th May. Only half the number there will be enrolled in that class, and the other half will be enrolled three months later. Thus, some of the men, will have been in camp for six months before beginning their training, and the training period will last for eight months. They will receive no increase on the 5s. a day until they get through their course. They do not want to do labouring work, which they think ought to be given to older men who are in need of a job. Some of these young trainees are married, and they would, not have gone into camp so soon if they had known that they would have to wait so long before beginning their training... I doubt whether the. Minister would have wanted them to go into camp so soon had he known the circumstances. I should like the Minister to look into this matter, and to get. the classes into operation as soon as possible. Some time ago I raised the issue of providing work for men at Point Cook and Laverton on the enlargement of the aerodrome, the alteration of the water supply, and the building of roads so that the aerodrome weald lie entirely inside the main road to Geelong. I know that between £30,000and £40,000 was set aside for this work. I notified the Williamstown Council, which had been promised £ 15,000 to doup the rifle range at Williamstown, that a larger scheme was to be put into operation, and that many more men would beemployed. In thisI went perhaps beyond what the Minister would have authorized me to say, but I was anxious to assure the council that provision was being made for the unemployed in its district, provided the men were suitable for the work. I am wondering whether these trainees, who ought to be studying for their various courses are being employed on this work, instead of the men from the district who ought to be engaged upon it. These trainees are becoming dissatisfied. They entered camp full of enthusiasm to get on with their job, and that enthusiasm is evaporating. Some of them, I understand have not even been taught Morsecode, though many, of course, had some training before they entered. I should like the Minister to inquire whether the money which was passed for this work is to be expended upon it, and whether the trainees are being engaged upon work which should be done by outside labourers.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I bring to the honorable members notice the fact that, although public inquiries are not held by the Commissioner in the same manner as Tariff Board inquiries, the Commissioner has full power under the National Security (Prices) Regulations to summon witnesses and take evidence on oath. In practice he frequently requires data concerning applications for increased prices to be supported by statutory declarations. As regards the specific increase of 10s. a ton permitted by the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner on the 2nd January last, the Minister for Trade and Customs has informed me that this increase was permitted after an exhaustive inquiry had been made by the Commissioner into increased costs since the outbreak of war. The increases were due mainly toincreased freight on rock phosphate and increased costs of sulphur and sacks and were in all cases on account of additional costs on imported goods or freights over which the Government had no control.","Price of Superphosphate","ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS","/hansard/answers.to.questions/debate/subdebate.1[7]/question/para[1]","N/A","N/A"
