10,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CURTIN, John","009FQ","Fremantle","ALP","Prime Minister and Minister for Defence",24,". - It is with very sincere regret that I refer to the death, which occurred on the 31st March last, of Mr. Maurice McCrae Blackburn, & former member of this House and of the State Parliament of Victoria. Honorable members will recall the shock and sense of personal loss felt by all on the receipt of the sad news in Canberra at the close of the last sitting day.The late Mr. Blackburn had a long and honorable parliamentary career, having first entered the Legislative Assembly of Victoria, for Essendon following a by-election in July, 1914. That seat he held until the general election in 1917. He was re-elected to the Legislative Assembly for Fitzroy at the by-election in February, 1925. Following upon the State electoral redistribution of 1926, he was elected for Clifton Hill at the subsequent general election in 1927, which seat he held until August, 1934, when he resigned, to contest the Bourke seat at the federal general election. From the 11th October, 1933, to the 1st August, 1934, he was Speaker of the Legislative Assembly. He was elected to the House of Representatives for Bourke at the general elections in 1934, 1937, and 1940, and was defeated at the general elections in 1943.It can be said without fear of contradiction that the late gentleman was held in the highest esteem by all who knew him and, indeed, between himself and many of his colleagues there existed a bond of affection, which was a natural corollary of his deeply sincere and sympathetic nature. He was, nevertheless, a man of strong character and of great independence of mind, direct and fair in the expression of his views, and forceful in the advocacy of those things which he considered to be right and just, regardless of whether or not they were popular. He will forever be gratefully remembered by the workers, particularly of Victoria, for his devotion to the cause of trade unionism and for his ready and valuable assistance in the solution of industrial problems. In addition to his colleagues in the political and industrial spheres, <a large number of friends in legal and cultural circles, of which he was a well-known and respected member, will mourn his loss.Maurice Blackburn, for at least 40 years, was engaged in the service of the people of this Commonwealth, and, in particular, of that section of the people who suffered injustice and whose capacity to speak for themselves was limited. For such people he became an advocate. He pleaded their cause, and he engaged in the study of how best he could serve them. It was the privilege of some members of this Houses - it most certainly was mine - to have shared with him, when we were quite young, the early struggles which young men have in giving effect to the ideas which come to them, and in serving the ideals which they cherish. Those ideas and ideals in the case of Mr. Blackburn impressed every one who came in contact with him. He lived his ideals, and it was his over riding desire that he should find in democracy, in the contest of mind with mind, not only the answer to the question of how, but also an answer which would appeal to the reason of all the people.He was opposed to violence. His soul revolted against the use of brute force, either to assert some right or to redress some wrong. Indeed, he revolted against the use of force in the settlement of any dispute anywhere. He was not a pacifist, but he was a fighter who believed that the struggle for right should be worthy of the ideals that would animate the right. As I have said, Maurice Blackburn was a cultured man, and in addition he was a most lovable man. He was, if I may use the expression, conscientious to a fault. He would allow nothing to turn him from what he considered to be the right, and however unpopular he might become, however discomforting his attitude might be to his colleagues, the divine monitor within him impelled him to stand for what in his soul he believed.He rendered great service in the legislatures of Victoria and of the Commonwealth. His influence affected the Labour movement, and the men and women associated with it, and he also had a profound influence upon every political party. He set a standard, and all of us were the better for endeavouring to live up to it. I pay a tribute to one who was the companion of my early years, and who, in himself, was one of the great servants of the people of the Commonwealth.To his sorrowing widow and family, by whom some consolation will no doubt have been derived from the tributes paid to his memory, we extend our deep sympathy in their irreparable loss. I move -That this House records its sincere regret at the death of Mr. Maurice McCrae Blackburn, B.A., LL.B., a former member of the House of Representatives for the division of Bourke, and Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, Victoria, places on record its appreciation of his meritorious public service, and tenders its deep sympathy to his widow und the members of his family in their bereavement.","N/A","STATUTORY DECLARATIONS BILL 1944","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I myself speak to it with very great sorrow.The Prime Minister has said a number of things about our late friend, Maurice Blackburn, all of them true and completely just. He was, as we all know, a man of many qualities, but perhaps his most remarkable quality was his indomitable moral courage. What he felt to be right was, in his mind, right, and he would pursue it wherever the journey might take- him. In the course of his political life he went through some very stormy periods. He was the centre of many bitter controversies, and many bitter things were said about him at various times, but I believe that he lived to enjoy a time when no man had any bitter thing to say about him whatever. It was a complete triumph for his character.The motion before the Chair mentions his widow and his family, and with them, of course, we sorrow. We sorrow profoundly. I should like to say to honorable members that I myself learnt for the first time after Maurice Blackburns death that his mother is still living at a very advanced age, and I am happy to say that the widespread tributes which have been paid to him by men of every shade of political opinion brought comfort to her.Maurice Blackburn served the people in two remarkable ways. One was in Parliament where, as the Prime Minister has truly said, he set a standard that all may well try to achieve. He was a man for whom no good cause, as he saw it, was lost while he lived. That, I think, sums up his attitude. Outside Parliament he brought, over a long period of years, a richly stored mind, great experience and great zeal to the service of the industrial movement of Australia. It was my pleasure, long before I was concerned with politics in this Parliament, to be associated with him on many occasions in industrial litigation, and I can speak at first hand of the unwearying zeal with which he placed his gifts at the disposal of the great trade union movement, not in a professional sense, not because he dreamed of making money out of it - for no man was less interested in money than he - but because he was convinced that that was an important way in which to serve the cause in which he believed.I honour his memory more than I cansay, and I am sure that every honorable member on this side of the House wishes to be associated with what I know will go to his family as a wholehearted tribute to a great man.","N/A","STATUTORY DECLARATIONS BILL 1944","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Maurice Blackburn. Speaking for myself, I always numbered Maurice Blackburnamongst my friends. His was a personality that this House appreciated and sadly misses. He brought to Parliament a discerning mind, and exercised a vigilance over all governments, all parties and all legislation. His watchful eye; his method of interpretation, his knowledge of the people, of Australia were advantageous to our consideration of matters concerning not only this Parliament, but, also, through this Parliament, the nation. Maurice Blackburn will be missed for a very long time by those who were privileged to be associated with him. I join with the Prime Minister (Mr. Curtin), and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Menzies) in conveying to his widow and family our heartfelt sympathy in their loss. I also express to Parliament and Australia as a whole my sympathy for the loss that they have suffered as the result of his passing.","N/A","STATUTORY DECLARATIONS BILL 1944","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
13,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BRYSON, William","JSW","Bourke","N/A","N/A",26,"- I associate myself with the expressions of regret at the passing of Maurice Blackburn. I was a friend and supporter of his for many years. I saw the work he did for those who require assistance most, th£ workers of this country. He devoted his life to their cause. He was a man of high principles and convictions, and because of his adherence to principles with which I disagreed I eventually opposed him politically. We had a friendly fight. We finished that campaign in a friendly spirit. Australia has lost a good citizen, and the working class a good friend. The good that he did will live after him. I extend my deepest sympathy to his mother, widow and family.","N/A","STATUTORY DECLARATIONS BILL 1944","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
14,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"WARD, Edward","KX7","East Sydney","ALP","Minister for Transport and Minister for External Territories",26,". - I rise to pay tribute to my very dear friend, the late Maurice Blackburn. It is usual to discover a mans attributes and qualities after he has passed on, but I am in the fortunate position of being able to repeat to-day the things I said of him while he lived. When he first came to this Parliament, I became a very close friend of his, and, as the years went on, that friendship became greater. Like many other honorable members of this Parliament, I had the advantage of his wide knowledge. I believe that every member of the Labour party, which he so loyally served, knew of his great worth and of how he assisted the Labour Government. Even though at that time he was not recognized by those in authority as a member of the Labour party, when we became a government, he assisted Ministers in drafting legislation and regulations. His aid was frequently sought by the Labour party, and was readily available. Maurice Blackburn has been referred to as a great scholar: I believe he was the foremost constitutional authority in this country; but where he differed from others who likewise may be classified as having scholarly attributes, was that, whereas Maurice Blackburn could have become a wealthy man had he desired to accept fees and retainers from wealthy combines and monopolies in this country, he refused to accept them, because he preferred to serve the people. He was, by choice, the peoples champion and will long be remembered for the work he did in an honorary capacity for the Labour movement of this country. He assisted trade unions in the preparation of claims to be presented to the Arbitration Court. Without hope of fee or reward, he assisted individual members of the working class, who required assistance. I mention as an illustration of the character of Maurice Blackburn that when I, myself, had to face a royal commission concerning certain statements that I had made, I asked him to act for me. Because he thought that he would not help the presentation of my case, as he was a member of the same party as myself, he refused to accept any fee or brief, but gave his advice and throughout the hearing rendered every assistance that he could possibly give. That, in my opinion, was typical of his whole attitude to life. He was a great scholar. He contributed many outstanding pamphlets on national questions. He was editor of a socialist newspaper in Melbourne at one period and editor of the Labour Call at another. So, he gave a lifetime of service to the people of this country. I join with others in regretting the passing of a great Australian and a great scholar, and I extend, my heartfelt sympathy to the sorrowing relatives and friends whom he has left behind.","N/A","STATUTORY DECLARATIONS BILL 1944","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
15,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BRENNAN, Frank","JSC","Batman","N/A","N/A",27,"- I first met Maurice Blackburn in the closing years of the last century and we then formed a friendship and an association, later a political association, . which endured until his death. That is my reason, perhaps I should say my excuse, for interposing a few words in this tribute. The question has been posed as to what is the salient, the outstanding quality of youth, because Maurice Blackburn was necessarily very young at the time I first came to know him. Some have said that seriousness is the outstanding quality. One writer suggests eagerness. But I would say of Mr. Blackburn that he very early developed qualities of eagerness and deep interest, in his fellow men. Those qualities se evident in his youth, interest and eagerness, he retained until his death. He had a singularly acute capacity for appraising the characters of men. Those judgments which he made, subtle and penetrating as they were, conceded something at times to the virtue of charity, hut nothing to the sourness of ill-will. Outside the domestic circle, the circle of his own family in whom he was, of course, deeply interested, I think he preferred the company of men rather than that of women, and he loved most the unusual man; the hard-bitten character pricked his analytical mind into action. I do not pretend, longstanding as my friendship was with him, that I was within that inner circle of his most intimate friends. His public services, as has been pointed out by the Prime Minister (Mr. Curtin) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Menzies), were outstanding, but I am of the opinion that his best work was personal and private. He joined the Labour party, not because he particularly loved party, and certainly not because be loved manual labour, either as a diversion or as a means of livelihood, but because the Labour party stood for things in which he most strongly believed and in the advocacy of which he was for many years an outstanding figure. He went out of the Labour party, indeed out of life, making room for my esteemed friend, the present honorable member for Bourke (Mr. Bryson), with the firm conviction that he had lived so long as to see everything which had attracted him to politics abrogated or destroyed in the rapine of war. He preached, and, to some extent, practised socialism, but rather, I think, as an instrument of service to the people, than from a deep-rooted belief in the doctrines of socialism, because from his individual judgment once formed there was no appeal. As was finely said at the time of his death,  He went his way though he went alone . He wasted no nerve tissue in useless anger, no breath in profanity. His mind was entirely free from the influence of the salacious. His tastes were of the simplest and may be summed up in three words - reading, walking, talking. He was as bright a talker as was Wilde; he was as rapid a reader as Macaulay, and as retentive of what he read. In the Garden Beautiful, he suffered a nostalgia for the musty air of the second-hand bookshop. He made no claim that, in doing so, he chose the better part; he merely made the claim that he had the right to make the choice. As I understood him, and I think I understood him well, he was little interested in creeds, but he raised his ethical standards to the dignity of a religion. He was modestly agnostic, though it grieved him that the Christian theory was allotted so subordinate a part in. the history of the nations travail. I adopt the graceful words of condolence of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. His was a simple, scholarly, lovable nature. May his gracious soul rest in peace!Question resolved in the affirmative, honorable members standing in their places.","N/A","STATUTORY DECLARATIONS BILL 1944","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
16,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CURTIN, John","009FQ","Fremantle","ALP","Prime Minister and Minister for Defence",28,". - I sincerely regret to inform honorable members of the death of Mr. John Henry Prowse which took place on the 20th May last. The late Mr. Prowse sat in this Parliament for a period of 24 years, having first been elected for the division of Swan, Western Australia, at the general election in 1919. He was subsequently re-elected for the new division of Forrest at every election for the House of Representatives up to and including 1940. He was defeated at the general election in September, 1943. During the long period that he was a member of this House, Mr. Prowse sat on a number of committees and held other offices. He was a member of the Joint Committee on Public Accounts from 1920 to 1923 and from July, 1925, to September, 1929, and was chairman of the Select Committee on the effect of the operation of the Navigation Act upon Australian trade and industry, and of the royal commission on the same subject in 1923. He acted as ministerial Whip from March, 1923, to August, 1924. From October, 1927, to August, 1934, he was Temporary Chairman of Committees. He was a member of the Commonwealth Delegation of the Empire Parliamentary Association, which visited Canada in 1928. In October, 1934, he was elevated to the position of Chairman of Committees and continued in that capacity until his resignation of the post in June, 1943. I am sure that honorable members who sat in committees of this House under his chairmanship will agree that he carried out his duties in a most thorough, efficient and business-like manner, his handling of bills being marked by quick perception and understanding, and his control of the discussions which took place on them by courteous treatment of the members of all parties.In this chamber and elsewhere his voice was invariably raised on behalf of the man on the land, for whom he did a great deal, particularly in his own State of Western Australia, where he was widely known and greatly respected. Before he became a member of this Parliament, lie had been Mayor of Perth, and in that capacity contributed much towards the development of the dignity of that gracious city. But he was interested also in a number of bodies, all of which were devoted to some form of public service. His connexion with the Primary Producers Association in Western Australia did not in any way compass the wide range of his interest in the problems of the man on the land. Time and time again he travelled through the State to ascertain the needs of roads boards and other public instrumentalities. He was keenly interested also in hospital welfare in the rural area of Western Australia. In many ways he devoted himself to the service of men and women, particularly in that State. So devoted was he to what he considered to be the interests of Western Australia that he believed that the State did not receive justice. The truth, however, is that the late Mr. Prowse was not only a proud member of the Parliament of the Commonwealth - proud in the sense that he considered that it was a great honour to serve in this Parliament - but also had a high and conscientious conception of the duty that he owed to those who elected him to this chamber. I am sure that throughout Western Australia there were many sad hearts when the news of his death reached the people. I move -That this House records its sincere regret at the death of Mr. John Henry Prowse, a former member of the House of Representatives for the division of Forrest, and Chairman of Committees, places on record its appreciation of his meritorious public service, and tenders its deep sympathy to his widow and the members of his family in their bereavement.","N/A","DEATH OF MR.

For many years the late Mr. Prowse was a member of this Parliament. He was a popular member, a very assiduous member, and in all circumstances an extraordinarily goodtempered member. He brought to this Parliament a most remarkable set of qualifications. As the Prime Minister reminded us, the late Mr. Prowse had been the Mayor of a great city. At another stage of his life he had been interested in roads boards in the country districts of Western Australia. For a number of years he had been a successful business man in the metropolitan world, and thereafter he engaged actively in rural pursuits. Consequently, he brought quite an amazing all-round experience to the service of the people of Australia. He placed that experience at the disposal of this Parliament with great good will, and without stint. We miss him very much. I shall always think of him particularly for his constant humanity, his constant interest in everything that was going on, and his never failing good humour.","N/A","DEATH OF MR.

He was one of the foundation members of this party, and his loyalty and conscientiousness throughout his association with it were never in doubt. He was a champion of the Australian countryside, the rural industries, and all those connected with them, and I am sure that the people of Western Australia, particularly the electors of Forrest, realize the loss that they have suffered by the death of such an upholder of their cause. It has been said that the late Mr. Prowse graduated to the Parliament of the Commonwealth after service with local governing authorities in Western Australia, and that he had been Mayor of Perth. But I remind honorable members that the late Mr. Prowse, when a young man, gained his early commercial training in Townsville, North Queensland, where he was manager of the United Insurance Company. To this day he is remembered and respected there. He was transferred to Perth and ultimately became Mayor of that city. For business reasons, he resigned from that public office. The late Mr. Prowse was a prominent and skilful exponent of cricket and tennis, and later of golf and billiards. He had h profound knowledge of true Australian life. The Australian Country party misses his association with it, and his loyalty to it, and this Parliament mourns his passing. As the Prime Minister stated, the late Mr. Prowse served Australia in many capacities. Western Australia has lost a great champion, and the rural industries of Australia are poorer for the absence of his advocacy. I join with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in conveying sympathy to his relatives who mourn his loss.Question resolved in the affirmative, honorable members standing in their places.","N/A","DEATH OF MR.

I had certainly not realized before how great were the calls upon Australia with the supply of food and general facilities for the prosecution of the war.It was not generally realized in the world at large how great a part the Australians had played in the South-West Pacific Area.We at the Ministry of Food can never be too grateful for what Australia has done for us in the supply of food since the war began.After Pearl Harbour, after the fall of Singapore, before aid could come to you from any quarter of the globe, you and the people of Australia must have experienced terrible anxiety. What Britain had to endure, when she stood alone facing the might of Germany, Australia for many months must have felt in facing the might of Japan. As Britain kept open the gates of freedom in the North Atlantic, so Australia and Kew Zealand kept open the gates of freedom in the South Pacific.The free world will probably never realize what it owes to Australia. We are anxious, however, at this moment, to express what acknowledgment we can of so great a debt. With this acknowledgment we wish to give to you the assurance that just as your forces and ours have been exerting their strength wherever the call was most imperative in this global war; just as to-day we wait with confidence the outcome of the colossal conflict which will crush forever the menace of Nazi tyranny; so on the morrow our forces will be found closer than ever at the side of yours, sharing with our allies in the total destruction of the tyranny of Japan.We have also examined together the principles which determine our foreign policies, and their application to current problems. Here, too, we are in complete agreement . . .Mutual respect and honest conduct between nations is our chief desire. We are determined to work with all peace-loving peoples in order that tyranny and aggression shall be removed or, if need be, struck down wherever it raises its head. The peoples of the British Empire and Commonwealth of Nations willingly make their sacrifices to the common cause. We seek no advantages for ourselves at the cost of others. We desire the welfare and social advance of all nations and that they may help each other to better and broader days.We have no selfish aims. We have given all that we had. We are concerned now only to ensure the establishment of a structure by which we will be able to promise those who are fighting in this war and their descendants a peace with honour and safety.That they recognize the necessity of establishing at the earliest practicable date a general international organization, based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all peace-loving States, and open to membership by all such States, large and small, for the maintenance of international peace and si security.That, for the purpose of maintaining international peace and security pending the re-establishment of law and order and the inauguration of a system of general security, they will consult each other and, as occasion requires, with other members of the United Nations, with a view to joint action on behalf of the community of nations.Wo affirm that after the war a world organization to maintain peace and security should be set up and endowed with the necessary power and authority to prevent aggression and violence.From time to time, it is suggested we should seek new methods of communication and consultation. I believe very strongly in close consultation, close co-operation, and effective co-ordination of policies.
