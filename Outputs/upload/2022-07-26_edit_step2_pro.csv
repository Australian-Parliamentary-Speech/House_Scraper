2,0,0,0,1,1,"Templeman, Susan MP",181810,"Macquarie","ALP","N/A",4," I move:That the honourable member for Oxley do take the Chair of this House as Speaker.I arrived in this place at the same time as the member for Oxley, in 2016. Our friendship was not hindered by the fact that we come from different states, we come from different parts of the Labor Party and we represent very different constituencies. In fact, our differences have helped. My respect and affection for the member for Oxley is based on what I have come to know of him in those six years. He is a generous soul—an attribute thats very welcome in this place and that will stand him in good stead in that chair. He is thoughtful and reasonable and he listens carefully—all essential Speaker skills. He speaks with care, with warmth and with authority.What many in this place may not know is his prodigious memory for numbers, particularly political numbers. In fact, he knows percentages in my seat better than I do. Admittedly, they were at times very small numbers to recall. But that will also stand him in good stead if he is elected Speaker of this place.One thing we have in common is a commitment to educating school students about our democracy—a commitment shared by a previous Speaker, the former member for Casey. What better place to do that from than the Speakers chair. I know the member for Oxley will bring to the role of Speaker an ability to make the parliament a more welcome and diverse place to visit and experience.From the start of his time here he has shown a deep interest in the rules of this place. I recall the odd misstep in his early years that saw him ejected from this place, but he learnt from those experiences and has worked tirelessly to improve the tone of this place. Not only has he been a member of the Speakers panel but, as deputy chair of the Procedure Committee for six years, he, alongside the member for Bonner, has helped to rewrite and recommend changes to the standing orders. Similarly, the member for Oxley has been a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters for all of that time, continuing a deep commitment to maintaining the integrity of democratic institutions, including domestic democratic institutions, which he pursued long before arriving in Canberra.While he has been well able to engage in vigorous debate in this chamber, I know from my discussions the deep commitment he has to improving the tone, temperament and tenor of this place. I hope that all of us in this House will be willing to join him on the journey he will lead us on as the Speaker of the 33rd Parliament—actually, I think Im getting my numbers wrong there, Milton—as the 33rd Speaker of the parliament. You can see why I need him for the numbers.Respect is never just given. Its earned, and I already see the respect with which the member for Oxleys contributions from the floor have been received. I have no doubt that he will earn this Houses respect in his role as Speaker. So it is with great honour that Ive nominated the member for Oxley, Milton Dick, to be the Speaker of the parliament.The Clerk : Is the motion seconded?","Speaker","PARLIAMENTARY OFFICE HOLDERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms TEMPLEMAN (Macquarie) ","(11:24):"
3,0,0,0,1,1,"Chesters, Lisa MP",249710,"Bendigo","ALP","N/A",5," It is my privilege to second the nomination of my good friend the member for Oxley for the role of Speaker. I have known the member for Oxley for almost 25 years. Yes, we were members of Young Labor. Back then I was loud, ranting and protesting, as the Left usually are, and the member for Oxley was calm, considered and focused. Some may ask, Whats changed? The member for Oxley is still calm, considered and focused on solutions.The member for Oxley has the skills and the attributes required for the role of Speaker. He is committed to listening to different colleagues for the best possible outcome—no doubt something that he learnt from his late parents: his father, Allan, who served in the Navy in World War II and then owned a small business, and his mum, Joan, a caring nurse and midwife who taught their three children service for others. Members of his family are gathered here today in the gallery: five strong women—sister and cousins; cousins who are more like sisters—and I am told that he is the glue that keeps everyone connected. Everyone in this place who knows the member for Oxley knows this to be true. If youve worked with him on a committee or a delegation, you would know that hes inclusive and reaches out across the party spectrum to find common ground, or to just catch up for a cup of coffee.The member for Oxley has the experience for the role of Speaker. Before his time in this place he was a Brisbane City Councillor—do not hold that against him—for eight years. That was before becoming the member for Oxley, which he has proudly served as for six years. He has served on the Speakers panel and various committees with distinction and with a work ethic that he will bring to the role of Speaker. The member for Oxley embodies what it means to be a member of the House of Representatives. He is a grassroots, hardworking local MP. He is a trade unionist. When he is in his electorate, you will find him at a mobile office, a workplace or at a local community, faith or multicultural event.The Oxley electorate is a diverse community, with around 50,000 people born overseas. Anyone who follows his socials knows how important multiculturalism is to him and he is not afraid to don the culturally appropriate clothing for any occasion, if asked. During the Queensland floods and the recovery he was there for his community, assisting on the ground with the recovery effort and clean-up. It is hard to find a Facebook post of the member for Oxley where he is not covered from head to toe in mud.The member for Oxley is an organiser, appointed to the very important role of secretary of the Wazza Thursday night dinner. Colleagues, I can assure you his ability to coordinate, accommodate and manage the many who attended that dinner puts the member for Oxley in good stead for this role. He was not afraid to sit anyone down who spoke for too long at these dinners or eject anyone who was being unparliamentary. He will be a great Speaker in the traditions of this place. The member for Oxley will serve the parliament in a manner that we and the Australian people will all be proud of. I proudly second the motion.","Speaker","PARLIAMENTARY OFFICE HOLDERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms CHESTERS (Bendigo) ","(11:28):"
4,0,0,0,1,1,"Katter, Bob MP","HX4","Kennedy","KAP","N/A",6," Speaking out in favour of Milton Dick: obviously, I came out of Queensland politics, where we ruled happily for 30 or 40 years until we were knocked off, and he was one of the people responsible for it. So it is a bit of a turnaround that Im supporting him here today. Bill Hayden said, and the previous speakers made comment about this, If you want a future in politics, look forward to 10,000 fates worse than death. Milton Dick ran the ALP in Queensland—a lot of people would disagree with that, and probably Milton would disagree with that—and, I think, played a major part in them holding on to office for most of the time since enlightened government ceased in 1990—the government fell in 1990. The only bigger part played in that, of course, was the incompetence of the LNP, but I dont want to bring up politics.But I would like to mention that, like all of the old families in Queensland, of which my family is one, all the people that go way back will come from Gympie or mostly from Charters Towers, because we are a gold rush country. Our population came here during the gold rushes, and they were the two great gold rush cities, outside of Ballarat and Bendigo, of course. But I would like to comment upon this, if the House would give me permission, because it is a story that so many other families here would share. His great-great-grandmother, a widow, arrived in Charters Towers around 1880. Thats a bit of one-upmanship—I think hes being a bit sneaky, there—because my mob arrived in 1881 from Scotland, looking for gold, with five children and his great-grandfather Joseph Allen, who married Miss Georgina Gough. My best mate is a Gough from Charters Towers. In those towns, it always remains the same. The Allens attended Richmond Hill State School. His great-grandmothers family, the Goughs, built the Excelsior Hotel and the theatre in Charters Towers, and theyre still standing there today.The businesspeople in Charters Towers, namely the Goughs—his family—they backed and threw all of their weight behind the fledgling labour movement. Cynics would say, Well, the more money in the workers pocket, the more money in their pub, but I dont think thats a fair comment. I pay tribute to the history of his family as a great Australian family, who not only contributed to business but also did what needed to be done when over 100 people died in two mining accidents in the electorate I represent. Seventy-two died at Mount Mulligan and 23 in Charters Towers. For businesspeople to stand up for those people was a wonderful thing, and Milton has carried on that tradition.I end on this note: it was announced that Mount Isa was going to close the copper stream and fertiliser plant, and this nation would lose about $3 billion a year in income. It was an official announcement. It was closing. The two people responsible for it not closing—and I am not going to go into the details of it—were Milton Dick and Tony McGrady. McGrady is a great enemy of mine, and Im a great enemy of his. I approached those two people and they did the job, and that $3 billion a year was rescued for our nation, and 2,000 jobs in Townsville and 2,000 jobs in Mount Isa were rescued as well. I pay him a very fine tribute, and I want to put that on public record. Very few people in this place will ever achieve what those two gentlemen achieved in that historic battle. The price of copper has gone up 300 per cent; were out of trouble now.I take very great pleasure in supporting Milton for this position.The Clerk: Does the member for Oxley accept the nomination?","Speaker","PARLIAMENTARY OFFICE HOLDERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr KATTER (Kennedy) ","(11:32):"

7,0,0,0,1,1,"Andrews, Karen MP",230886,"McPherson","LNP","N/A",6," I move:That the honourable member for Fisher do take the Chair of this House as Speaker.It is an absolute privilege to speak in favour of my fellow Queenslander and friend the member for Fisher. The member for Fisher was originally from Victoria. He was born in Melbourne, but like many, he made the right decision to move to Queensland, where he and Leonie have raised their daughters. He worked tirelessly with the community to make sure that they were very well supported. Having visited his electorate many times, Ive seen firsthand how very well regarded he is by a broad cross-section of the community. Ive been delighted to be able to work with him to secure additional funding from the proceeds of crime for the Daniel Morcombe Foundation on the Sunshine Coast. Hes been a big supporter and an advocate for Bruce and Denise Morcombe. They continue to work diligently to ensure children in Australia are safer.The member for Fisher is an incredible example of a broadly experienced parliamentarian. He was a carpenter and a joiner-builder before becoming a barrister, and, of course, he is a husband and a father. He did all of that prior to becoming the elected representative for Fisher. He is exactly the sort of person who makes our parliament richer with the experience he brings to it. In his maiden speech, the member for Fisher made reference to the kind of society that he believes in, and which Im sure members of all political persuasions would relate to and agree with, when he stated:It is testament to our Australian egalitarian way of life that a once-carpenter and the son of a motor mechanic and fabric importer can come to serve the community in this place. In Australia, there are no class structures; there are no hereditary entitlements to sit in this place; there are business people, farmers, bankers, tradesmen, unionists and labourers, among many others, who are privileged to take their seats in this chamber.I would urge the new members of parliament, particularly those new Independent members on the crossbench, to consider his experience as a previous Speaker of the House. This is, in a sense, the very first test of your independence. You dont have to vote for the government; you can make your own decision. You can consider the candidates on their merits. Having done the job admirably, the member for Fisher is clearly—clearly—the best-qualified candidate. Having done the job, hes very well placed to deliver the kind of impartial guidance that the House needs going forward. Consider, also, his years of service across multiple parliamentary committees, including as Chair of the House Standing Committee on Infrastructure, Transport and Cities; Chair of the House Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs; Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services; and Chair of the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade.Finally, in nominating the member for Fisher in November last year, my colleague the member for Berowra made a number of observations, including that the member for Fisher is very much his own person and that he is a deep thinker and a true parliamentarian. I agree. He is a thoroughly decent individual and exactly the sort of person who epitomises the qualities of a true, respectful and observant Speaker in the traditional mould. He served the last parliament with grace and fairness. If we are to make this 47th Parliament more productive and collegiate, surely we should be electing the best person for the job in this vital role.It is with great pleasure that I nominate the member for Fisher to take the chair of this House as Speaker.The Clerk : Is the motion seconded?","Speaker","PARLIAMENTARY OFFICE HOLDERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs ANDREWS (McPherson) ","(11:37):"
8,0,0,0,1,1,"van Manen, Bert MP",188315,"Forde","LNP","N/A",7," Im honoured and delighted today to second the nomination for the speakership for the member for Fisher, to continue to serve in this House in the role of Speaker. Following the retirement from the Speakers chair by the member for Casey in November last year, the member for Fisher served as the Speaker for the remainder of the 46th Parliament with dignity and respect.The working relationship between the parliamentary office holders and the Speaker is quite unique in this place. As Chief Government Whip throughout the 46th Parliament, I had the privilege of working closely with the member for Fisher during his time as Speaker. In order to ensure the smooth running of any given sitting day, communication and working with the Speakers office are paramount, and we always enjoyed a very close working relationship. I know the work that the member for Fisher put into the role was second to none, and I can attest to his incredible knowledge and passion for our nations parliamentary processes. This was demonstrated time and again during his decision-making process while in the chair, and Ive always found his decisions to be clear, concise and rational.When he took on the role of Speaker, the member for Fisher was conscious of the need for the chair to be an independent and fair voice within the chamber. I believe that he went above and beyond the expectations placed on him and that the member for Fisher should be very proud of the job that he did in the 46th Parliament. The member executed his responsibilities fairly and constructively, acting with tremendous reverence for the traditions and processes of our parliamentary system. Through thinking through the problems rationally and calmly as they arose, the member for Fisher was fastidious in his approach to the role, utilising his extensive knowledge gained through two years of service on the Speakers panel prior to his election as Speaker. His time on the panel allowed the member for Fisher to develop a comprehensive knowledge of the standing orders, which he demonstrated time and again as Speaker. A person of the highest calibre, the member for Fisher conducted himself in a manner befitting the office through a continued period of disruption brought on by the pandemic. And taking up this mantle from the member for Casey was no easy task, as we all readily acknowledge.The ability of our parliament to operate irrespective of the conditions faced by the nation was continually challenged, with our presiding officers responsible for implementing the measures which would allow this to happen in an appropriate manner. The member for Fisher was up to the challenge and performed admirably, serving the parliament with distinction. With the presiding officers once again being called upon to manage the operation of parliament through a period of strain and uncertainty, I can think of no better person to entrust in this pivotal role for our democracy than the member for Fisher.For many people who know the member for Fisher, these attributes will come as no surprise. Prior to taking on the role of Speaker, the member gained the necessary experience and qualifications by successfully undertaking roles in various committees right across this parliament. As a fellow Queenslander, I can firsthand attest to the manner in which the member for Fisher takes care of his electorate and advocates for his local communities in this place. The people of Fisher have a tremendous advocate in their local member, and I hope this place can continue to benefit from his judgement as chair.The 47th Parliament will come together during a pivotal time for our country. The challenges are many, both foreign and domestic. It is imperative that the Speaker who oversees the business of the House during this time takes on the role with impartiality, embodying the rich tradition of the office and this place. I know the member will continue to serve the parliament and people of Australia well and judiciously and conscientiously, as he did throughout the 46th term. Hes a man of great conviction, and I am proud to call him a friend and colleague. As the member for Moncrieff so eloquently put it in endorsing the member for Fishers initial nomination during the last parliament, he is simply a great bloke. Its with immense pleasure that I second this nomination of the member for Fisher to the office of chair.The Clerk : Does the honourable member for Fisher accept the nomination?","Speaker","PARLIAMENTARY OFFICE HOLDERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr VAN MANEN (Forde—Chief Opposition Whip) ","(11:42):"

The fact that you have received such an overwhelming majority is a credit to your standing in this place. Its a credit to your standing professionally. But its also a credit to who you are, your integrity as a human being.I was very pleased when I heard that you were interested in running for the position of Speaker, because I believe that this House needs to be treated with respect. This is a debating chamber by definition, and its one in which we should have open, free and frank discussion but do it in a courteous way wherever possible. Its one in which ideas are exchanged in the interests of the people who send us here, and we should always remember that. You are someone who has always conducted yourself with extraordinary propriety and conducted yourself in a way in which you engage with people across the chamber, across our caucus, across benches. I note the very fine words by the member for Kennedy in support of your nomination. It shows, I think, with the result of the ballot as well, that youve been able to already show even some new members that you will be someone who brings great dignity to the office.To the former Speaker: I thank you for your speakership. It was very difficult following on from the former member for Casey, whos in the chamber here today, who I believe was an absolutely outstanding Speaker and conducted himself with incredible dignity in what was often a very difficult time, particularly during the pandemic as well, where the rules in terms of the way that this parliament conducts itself were set aside on a bipartisan basis just so that we could continue to function as a liberal democracy, which is so important.To you, Mr Speaker: Im absolutely convinced that you will be outstanding as well. Theres no doubt that youre someone whos honest. Youre someone who has been a friend of mine for some period of time now, and youre someone, as well, who has been a wise counsel to me as Leader of the Opposition in my former position. I thank you for the support that you gave me to hold that high office and have that great honour of leading the Australian Labor Party and, throughout what was a difficult last term, provide counsel as part of the group of people who would engage across the caucus and be a bit of a sounding board for people.One of the things Ive noticed about you is that people will come to you for assistance and guidance, and thats something that a Speaker needs to do. The office needs to be open for any member of parliament.

He was following in the footsteps of a giant in this place, the member for Casey, who I acknowledge in the chamber here today. The member for Fisher was able to conduct himself in an equally honourable manner. Like the Prime Minister and many others, he is a person who holds the traditions of this chamber close to their heart, and he was able to exercise his rulings and his practice in this chamber on that basis.Mr Speaker, there are many people who know you well, and I am very pleased to have seen you in action in your own electorate in the recent Queensland floods, where I visited as the then Minister for Defence with some of the troops who were helping on the ground. It was obvious from the empathy that you demonstrated towards your constituents, the respect with which they responded to you and the engagement when we went into the community centre that, on the ground, you had a great deal of kudos. That is a great credit to you, and I know that you will bring those qualities into this job also.It is an incredibly important role that you take up as the 32nd Speaker this 47th Parliament.

Ive known you since we met in Young Labor in our early 20s in the early 1990s, and its a great honour for you to now be in this role.I want to thank the member for Fisher. People often dont know that, in the lead-up to parliament sitting before weve elected a Speaker, the previous Speaker continues to hold the office. A lot of arrangements and a lot of work has gone into today being organised. As the presiding officer, the member for Fisher has been responsible for that, and on behalf of the government I want to express thanks for the way that that was done.I also want to thank the former member for Casey, who put you on the Speakers panel. It was possibly a difficult thing to put you on the Speakers panel, and I should confess to the parliament that that was my fault. There are photographs circulating on social media of you turning up to the chamber with toy Muppet dolls. You were thrown out of parliament for that, and it was entirely my idea that you do that. You were chosen on the basis that, at that point, you were the only member of the caucus who had not yet been thrown out. So, while it was disorder, it was disorder on the basis that you, to that point, for an opposition member, had been too respectful of the system.I want to wish you well. Youve done a great job on the Speakers panel, but, importantly, this job doesnt end when the parliament adjourns. A lot will be required to be done—particularly with respect to the Set the standard report from Kate Jenkins—in terms of here as a workplace, where the role of the presiding officers is going to be critical. One of your great skills, which has caused you to be supported by so many members here today, is that you are someone who brings people together. You are someone who reaches out to people.

23,0,0,0,1,1,"Fletcher, Paul MP","L6B","Bradfield","LP","N/A",10," Congratulations, Mr Speaker. I join with the Prime Minister, the Leader of the House and the Leader of the Opposition in extending congratulations to you. On behalf of the opposition—the Liberal and National parties—we warmly congratulate you. We acknowledge your experience and your aptitude for the role. Youve been in the parliament since 2016, youve served on the Speakers panel, and I know from my discussions with you that you have a clear understanding of the importance of the role and the significance of the responsibilities that you now hold.As other speakers have done, I want to acknowledge former Speakers Smith and Wallace, who set a very high bar. While were acknowledging people, Id also like to acknowledge the member for McEwen, who served the last parliament as Second Deputy Speaker.Mr Speaker, this is a very important position that youve been elected to, and I know you are very cognisant of the need to deal with all members of this chamber with fairness and impartiality, following the high standards set by previous Speakers. The opposition looks to you confidently to uphold these values and the responsibility that comes with the position to engage with all members—government, opposition and crossbench—and work with them constructively and professionally. Our commitment to you is that we will work with you professionally and respectfully. Of course, well always put our position clearly and make our case strongly, but we will always respect the fundamental importance of the role of the Speaker. Your role is vital to this institution, this embodiment of our democracy: the Parliament of Australia. Ultimately, as the Prime Minister and others have mentioned, community confidence in our system of government depends very heavily on what happens in this place and very much on the way that the Speaker operates.The opposition warmly congratulate you and wish you the very best as you discharge your heavy responsibilities. We pledge to work with you in that objective—as with others in this House—of maintaining community confidence in our system of government.","Speaker","PARLIAMENTARY OFFICE HOLDERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[9]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr FLETCHER (Bradfield—Manager of Opposition Business) ","(12:16):"
24,0,0,0,1,1,"Bandt, Adam Paul MP","M3C","Melbourne","AG","N/A",10," On behalf of the Greens, I extend my congratulations to you on your election to this critical role and join in thanking the former Speakers for their service.Its customary for Speakers, when they enter the chamber and take their role, to nod to the right and nod to the left. But perhaps in this parliament, more than any other so far, theres also going to be a case for looking down the middle. Weve just come from an election where, roughly speaking, a third of the country voted for the government, a third voted for the opposition and a third voted for other voices. You see that represented, in part, here on the crossbench. In part, that was a reflection of a desire of people, probably across the political spectrum, not only for a higher standard of debate in this place but also for the capacity and the ability to debate issues that previously hadnt been put on the agenda. I trust that theyre also matters that are important to the whole parliament as we go forward.On behalf of the Greens, again, congratulations. We wish you well. You have our support in this role.","Speaker","PARLIAMENTARY OFFICE HOLDERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[10]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BANDT (Melbourne—Leader of the Australian Greens) ","(12:19):"
25,0,0,0,1,1,"Dick, Milton MP ",53517,"Oxley","ALP","N/A",10," I thank the Leader of the Greens. I seek the indulgence of the House to respond to the gracious remarks made by the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and other members of the House.I start by thanking the House for the enormous privilege in taking this office. Today I become the 32nd Speaker of the House, following my friend the member for Fisher and also former Speaker Tony Smith, who is in the building today. It is a day that they know Ill never forget.Speakers are supposed to be dragged to the chair due to fear. Its a tradition I understand—Im feeling quite a bit of fear right now—but when you are dragged to the chair by people of the calibre of the members for Macquarie and Bendigo, two of the strongest women I have met in my life, fear is the last thing I think of when I think of them. The member for Macquarie is a woman of warmth, strength, resilience and integrity, and particularly today she has shown strength in nominating me. The member for Bendigo is a warrior—fiercely loyal, always protesting and always standing up for what she believes in. I dont just thank them for nominating me today with their words; I thank them for their friendship, kindness and belief in me.I have many friends in this place, literally all over the chamber. Some might say too many on the Left; some might say too many on the Right. I want to recognise people like the member for Bonner, who is an old family friend, and the members for Capricornia and Wright. Alongside my old mates the Treasurer, the Minister for Aged Care and the member for Blair, with the Leader of the Opposition, its a Queensland unity ticket—well, at least for three nights of the year when the Origin is on. Sorry, PM!To the Prime Minister: thank you for your friendship and support. The Prime Minister has never wavered in his belief in this house and its power to make the lives of ordinary Australians better. These are the values that I know every member of the House will strive to uphold. This morning I learned something that we share in common: our late mums both believed in good manners.To the Leader of the Opposition and to the Manager of Opposition Business: I congratulate you on your new roles. You have my respect and I know you will give it your best. I wish you well.To the Deputy Prime Minister: through good and bad youve stood there, always encouraging me. I value your counsel and friendship.And to the Leader of the House: I met you around 30 years ago—thats correct. I always knew you would be a leader in this place, though I never thought Id be sitting in this place, let alone in this high office. Your encouragement and belief in me to enter this House in 2016 is something I will cherish and never forget, but dont expect an easy ride.To the member for Kennedy: I appreciate your very kind words and your acknowledgement of our hometown connection. I look forward—I think!—to your robust contributions to this House.But, at a time like today, it is a time for reflection. In reflecting on my own life and my own family, I reflect on my great-grandparents. They came with nothing but their faith and their belief in their children succeeding if they got a fair go. They came out from Scotland in the 1860s. Some of the descendants of my great-grandfather Joseph Park Allen are in the chamber today. They are my sister and some of my cousins—all strong, fearless women. In his memoir, JP Allen talks about leaving Scotland to come to Australia. He says, Needless to say, we were all very excited having at last made a start for this wonderful country we had heard so much about. When he arrived in Queensland he reflected on his experience, saying, Ive often wondered since how we withstood such a severe test—two lads, just 10 and 12, just fresh from a cold climate, dumped into the hottest part of a North Queensland summer, travelling through the mountain ranges and dense scrub from Port Douglas to Charters Towers. They often say they breed them tough in Queensland, and thats my background.Unfortunately, my brother cannot be here today as his obligations are with another house—more specifically the Queensland budget estimates process, which he is loving at the moment! I am enormously proud of him but even prouder of my sister, Susan, in the gallery—a teacher for over 34 years and someone who passionately believes in the transformational nature of education. Thats my story, and we all have a story about why were here and what we want to achieve.But this chamber should be a place of ideas and energy, and I want to allow debate to flow and the very best ideas to be exchanged in a respectful manner. Its probably fair to say every Speaker has said these words in some way or another over the years, but the difference is the people of Australia have sent a very clear message on how they expect politics to be conducted. They want something different. I am keen to work with every member to see that change, but I need every member to commit to that change to make it work.I also want to improve on civics education and awareness in this country. Every school across the country should be able to participate in a schools and parliament program, and I want to help make sure that this parliament is more inclusive and open to Australians of all walks of life.Of course, one of the most pressing matters before this parliament is making sure that this place and building is a safe workplace and every person who works here feels safe and is safe. In the last parliament we saw the Jenkins review highlight the ways that this building has failed to keep its occupants safe. However, it also presented a road map to ensure that we protect the people that we are responsible for. I take my responsibilities as a Presiding Officer in implementing the recommendations of this report very seriously. I look forward to working with the Senate President, the incoming Deputy Speaker and all members to address this and other matters.I want to welcome the 35 new members of this House. As you know, you are one of only about 1,200 people ever to have been elected. One bit of advice: cherish every moment; make every day count. To the crossbench: I am looking forward to working with you. No member of this House is simply red, blue, green or a mixture of blue and green. Some of you belong to parties; some of you are Independent. But to me, as Speaker, you are all members of the House of Representatives, elected by your constituents to represent their interests. My message to every member in this place is simple: my door is open. I have indicated I will be stepping away and not attending ALP caucus meetings, an important step that befits my role and the importance of impartiality in this chair.In conclusion, I briefly thank the many people who assisted me to become Speaker. To the utterly professional staff in the department, including clerks and table officers: I thank you and look forward to working with you. To my many friends and family who cant be here and to my wonderful electorate staff, who have been such a support for me for many years: I thank you for your service to me and to the people of Oxley. To my dearest and oldest friends, the ministers for communication and social services: youve literally been by my side my whole life, and I cant wait to give you a hard time!Honourable members, we are privileged to be elected to this chamber. I resolve to do everything I can to fairly uphold the standing orders. I want to make sure your voice is heard loudly, clearly and, at all times, fairly—with respect being shown through you to the people who have elected you without fear or favour. I thank the House.","Speaker","PARLIAMENTARY OFFICE HOLDERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[11]/talk.text/body/p[1]","The SPEAKER ","(12:20):"

37,0,0,0,1,1,"Dick, Milton MP ",53517,"Oxley","ALP","N/A",17," I have to report that the House this day attended His Excellency the Governor-General in the Senate chamber, when His Excellency was pleased to make a speech to both houses of the parliament. Ive received a copy of the speech, which will be incorporated in Hansard for record purposes.The speech read as follows—Honourable senators and members of the parliament of Australia.I begin by acknowledging that we are meeting today on Ngunnawal and Ngambri country and pay respects to elders past and present, and particularly acknowledge the younger generation who are our pathway to our future.Since I last spoke in this chamber, ferocious fires, devastating floods and a once-in-a-hundred-years pandemic have unleashed an extraordinary period of uncertainty, trauma and loss upon our country.The past three years have asked so much of so many.Again and again, Australians have risen to the moment.Thinking of their communities.Looking after each other.In hard times, Australians have been at their caring and courageous best.Major challenges—new and old—are before us.In confronting these challenges, this parliament must seek to match the resolve and resilience of the people in whose name you serve.As the Prime Minister has said—prove worthy of the people of Australia.In a turbulent world we can find hope in the strength of our democracy.In May, at more than 7,000 polling centres, many thousands of postboxes, via the phone and in diplomatic missions the world over, millions of Australians cast their ballots and exercised their fundamental right and responsibility as citizens of our great democracy.Australians have elected one of the most diverse parliaments in the history of our federation.And for the first time in almost a decade, Australians voted to change the government.All of us can give thanks that changes of government take place peacefully and swiftly in Australia, and with respect and courtesy for those with whom we may not agree.The new government has pledged to govern for all Australians, whoever they are, wherever they live and whoever they voted for—and to honour the trust Australians have conferred.The government knows this country faces serious and pressing challenges:rising cost of livinglow wages growthclimate change—and its devastating impacttensions in the region, uncertainty in the worldpressure in health and aged careand an economy in need of cheaper energy and new skills.The government is determined to tackle these challenges in a spirit of unity and togetherness—as well as urgency.It does not want to waste a single day.To this end, the Prime Minister and a select few ministers were at Government House to be sworn in less than 48 hours after the election result was known.Sooner than any other new government in Australias history.The governments commitment to hit the ground running was honoured, with the Quad leaders meeting in Tokyo and a prime ministerial visit to Indonesia.The government made a submission to the Fair Work Commission, to prevent Australias lowest-paid workers from going backward—resulting in a 5.2 per cent wage increase.The government also submitted a new, more ambitious 2030 nationally determined contribution to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.Committing to reduce emissions to 43 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, putting Australia on track to achieve net zero by 2050.Beyond that, the government has already taken measures to shore up Australias energy market, protect aged-care residents and provide assistance to Australians affected by the recent floods.The Uluru Statement from the HeartThe government takes office with a renewed ambition for Australia to reconcile with our past, to tell and know the truth about history, and to place a First Nations voice at the heart of our democratic process.The Uluru Statement from the Heart was an act of generosity by First Nations people, mapping out a path forward for us as a nation.It is the governments intention to take up this generous offer and seek to enshrine a voice to parliament in the Constitution via a national referendum in this term.The government views the implementation of the Uluru statement as an opportunity for healing and for learning from the truth of our history.And, just as importantly, the voice is a chance to build a better future for First Nations people.A future where a voice to parliament helps drive and deliver better health outcomes and longer lives, new education and employment opportunities, safer communities with decent housing, and an end to the cycle of injustice, incarceration and deaths in custody.All of this—voice, truth, treaty and closing the gap—depends on genuine partnerships.The government commits to engaging closely and respectfully with First Nations people and the Australian community more broadly ahead of the referendum.Honourable senators and members, a First Nations voice promises to be like the 67 referendum, like Mabo, like the national apology—a defining moment for our nation.An historic opportunity to move on from the safety of words to the bravery of action.At the centre of the governments determination to close the gap is to believe that First Nations people, like every other Australian, should be made to feel empowered.To this end, the Community Development Program, compulsory income management and the cashless debit card will all cease.In their place will be policies that provide First Nations people with greater support to secure good jobs and earn proper wages in safe conditions.In the same spirit, the government will invest in First Nations management of lands and waters, humbly recognising the skills and knowledge gained over tens of thousands of years.The government will expand the community led model of justice reinvestment to turn the tide on incarceration and act on the national shame of First Nations deaths in custody.It will partner with communities, peak bodies and elders to improve health and life expectancy.And the government will commit to new Indigenous employment targets for the Public Service and for Australias 200 largest companies.I congratulate the Hon. Linda Burney MP, member for Barton and a proud member of the Wiradjuri nation on her appointment as the Minister for Indigenous Australians.I also congratulate Senator Malarndirri McCarthy, a proud Yanyuwa woman, on her appointment as Assistant Minister for Indigenous Australians and Assistant Minister for Indigenous Health.And Senator Pat Dodson, a proud Yawuru man, on his appointment as Special Envoy for Reconciliation and the Implementation of the Uluru Statement from the Heart.I wish them all the best as they lead this urgent and historic work—work which will promote unity and healing.A stronger economyHelping Australians—all Australians—achieve their aspirations in life is central to the governments values of opportunity, fairness and reward for effort.The governments policies will promote economic growth that creates opportunities for Australians, and the governments policies will create opportunities for more Australians to drive economic growth.At the macro level, the Australian economy faces a number of significant challenges.Disrupted supply chains mean its harder and more expensive for Australian businesses and households to buy the goods they want and need.Rising interest rates are increasing pressure on mortgages.And a decade of low wages has put a handbrake on confidence.We are, in the words of the Treasurer, in choppy waters.But the government is determined to steer Australia safely through.The government will make targeted investments that expand the capacity of the economy, reduce debt as a share of GDP over time, and improve quality of life for Australians.Prioritising spending that achieves the greatest economic benefit is the most efficient way.Spending that creates jobs, boosts participation, lifts productivity, increases wages and grows incomes.The government will invest in cleaner and cheaper energy, better training of our workforce, cheaper child care, and an upgraded NBN.Importantly, the government will focus on the quality of spending, not just the quantity.This includes ensuring multinational companies pay their fair share of tax.Child careThe government recognises that the rising cost of child care is a pressure point for family budgets and a continuing drag on economic participation and productivity.To honour a key election commitment, the government will reduce childcare costs for more than a million families.The government will also instruct the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to design a price regulation mechanism to drive down out-of-pocket costs.The Productivity Commission will undertake a comprehensive review of the childcare sector, with the aim of implementing a universal subsidy for all families.This will be accompanied by a whole-of-government Early Years Strategy, focused on the wellbeing, education and development of Australias children.The ultimate goal is to add affordable child care to the list of universal services—alongside Medicare, the NDIS and superannuation—that Australians cherish.Investing in cheaper child care reflects the governments belief that one of the most powerful initiatives it can pursue for stronger economic growth and greater productivity is more equal opportunity for women.This is why the government has set itself a goal to re-establish Australia as a global leader in gender equality.A new National Strategy to Achieve Gender Equality will be developed, geared at closing the gender pay gap and improving womens economic equality, health and wellbeing.An independent Womens Economic Security Taskforce will also come into force to deliver gender responsive budgeting and embed gender analysis in the policy development process.The government will seek to strengthen the ability of the Fair Work Commission to support wage growth in female dominated industries, such as aged care.The recommendations of the Human Rights Commissions landmark Respect@Work report will be implemented, including, crucially, a positive duty on employers to create safe workplaces for women, free from harassment.The government has plans to help end violence against women and children, including finalising the next National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children 2022-2032.The government will establish 10 days paid family and domestic violence leave; increase the supply of emergency housing for women and children fleeing family violence; and invest in more case workers to assist women leaving violent situations.A fair go at workOne of this governments central aims is building an economy that works for people, not the other way around.An economy where working hard means Australians can pay their bills, support their families and save for the future.Today, more than 1.3 million Australians are either unemployed or looking for more hours, and many more struggle on low wages and with poor working conditions.The government knows Australia can do better than this.The nature of work has changed enormously, with an increase in new work arrangements and the gig economy. The government will seek to ensure that Australias laws catch up with this reality and protect people from exploitation and unsafe working conditions.The government will make secure work an objective in the Fair Work Act.And it will legislate to make wage theft a crime.SkillsFor the government—and for the business community of Australia—skills are high on the national agenda.In the coming period the government will legislate to establish Jobs and Skills Australia, to drive vocational education and training, and strengthen workforce planning.The new body will bring employers, trade unions and the training and education sector around the same table to achieve common objectives.The Commonwealth will help train thousands of new workers by ensuring that one in 10 workers on major government projects is an apprentice, trainee or cadet.Public TAFE will be returned to the centre of Australias training system.And the government will support fee-free TAFE places for Australian students, focused on those studying in industries with a skills shortage.There will also be up to 20,000 more university places, with priority going to universities offering places in priority areas like clean energy, advanced manufacturing, health and education.Action will also be taken to reduce the number of on-hand visa applications, to address skills shortages in the short term.In the same way, the government will work with Australias agricultural sector, to ensure farmers and producers can access workers at the right time while ensuring those workers see their rights upheld.The government believes that with the right settings we can build a bigger, better trained and more productive workforce; boost incomes and living standards; and create more opportunities for more Australians to get ahead.And, to support these goals, the government will hold an Australian Jobs and Skills Summit on 1 and 2 September here at Parliament House.The summit will bring businesses, trade unions, the non-government sector and all levels of government together to find common ground on the economic challenges we face.It will inform the development of an employment white paper, which will highlight the structural changes and opportunities in the Australian labour market and chart a path forward.A future made in AustraliaAt the election, the government signalled its strong belief that Australia must be a country that makes things.Australia has a proud history of manufacturing, but over recent decades the scope of our manufacturing has narrowed, as international competitors have displaced Australian makers and Australian skills.The supply chain issues experienced through the pandemic have put a spotlight on this challenge.The government will seek to rebuild Australias proud manufacturing industry through a commitment to a future made in Australia.This begins with the establishment of a $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund to grow and diversify Australias industrial base.The fund will take as its mission supporting new and emerging industries, helping our economy transition to reach net zero emissions by 2050, creating secure, well-paid jobs for Australian workers, driving regional economic development, and building our sovereign capability.Priority areas for investment will include renewables and low-emission technologies; medical science; transport; value-add in agriculture, forestry and fisheries; value-add in resources; and, finally, defence and enabling capabilities.The Buy Australian Plan will complement this investment by maximising the use of Australian-made goods, products and materials in Commonwealth contracts—harnessing the significant purchasing power of government.The government will also work with industry to reach a goal of 1.2 million Australian tech-related jobs by 2030.New investments will be made in the Australian railway industry too, ensuring that more trains are built in Australia by local Australian workers.Whether a train or a ferry, a solar panel or a piece of technical defence equipment, Australians will once again be making the products our economy needs for the future.Investing in infrastructureThe government believes revitalising Australian manufacturing is an investment in national resilience and national security—and the same is true for renewing and improving our national infrastructure.Infrastructure investment enables people and goods to move around faster, reducing the cost of doing business, growing the economy and better connecting our communities, improving Australians quality of life.The government is resolved to restore confidence in Australias infrastructure and regional development pipelines.At the centre of this effort will be reforming Infrastructure Australia as our nations foremost infrastructure advisory body.The Commonwealth—in cooperation with state and territory governments—will focus on quality investments, including to improve safety, reduce congestion and boost productivity.The government will also begin work on nation-building projects like high-speed rail and an Australian flagged strategic fleet.It will also ensure the Inland Rail project gets back on track.And—as part of a new national push to improve road safety and lower the road toll—the government will work with truck drivers and the wider industry to upgrade rest areas on national roads.Medicare and the NDISThe government believes every Australian has the right to access universal, affordable medical care. It is one of the things that underpins our unity as a nation.But for too many Australians, geography, income and background still pose barriers to care.The government is committed to making it easier for Australians to see a doctor and afford treatment.To serve this priority, at least 50 Medicare urgent care clinics will be established. Their services will be bulk-billed.The government will deliver a $750 million Strengthening Medicare Fund, with investment priorities guided by the Strengthening Medicare Taskforce.The government will also cut the cost of medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme from $42.50 to $30—saving Australians $12.50 for every medication.The 50 per cent loading for telehealth psychiatric consultations under the Medicare Benefits Schedule will be reinstated, allowing easier access to bulk-billed services for Australians who live in regional and rural areas.There will also be wider access to the Commonwealth seniors health card, opening up access to cheaper medicines, and bulk-billed doctor visits for an extra 50,000 older Australians.GPs will be able to access grants to modernise their practices, and the government will invest in initiatives to bring more doctors to regional and rural Australia.The government is committed to strengthening Medicare and is determined to fill the promise of the National Disability Insurance Scheme to empower Australians with disability, their families and carers.The wisdom, diverse experience and perspective of people with disability will be at the centre of the governments efforts to prove the design, delivery, accountability and sustainability of the NDIS.The government will also develop a National Autism Strategy and oversee the National Disability Data Asset so we can better understand the life experiences of people with disability in Australia.The government believes the NDIS can—and must—work better for people with disability.COVID-19As this winter brings a new omicron wave, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to challenge virtually every facet of our healthcare system.The government will continue to adapt its response in line with the public health advice, including significant renewed efforts to increase the uptake of booster vaccines, influenza vaccines and COVID-19 treatments.The government will also extend the National Partnership on COVID-19 Response for a further three months, to 31 December 2022, at a cost of approximately $760 million.This will provide funding to states and territories to continue to care for those with COVID-19 and protect the community through the public health response.The government will also use this opportunity to better prepare for the future.It will establish a Centre for Disease Control, to strengthen Australias pandemic preparedness and ensure a nationally coordinated response to future outbreaks of infectious disease.Aged careCOVID-19 took a devastating toll on Australians in aged care. But the government recognises aged care was in crisis well before the pandemic struck.The Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety has challenged Australia to do better. Far better.The government will legislate changes to deliver quality, security and dignity in care for every older Australian across our aged-care system.This will mean a registered nurse on site in every aged-care facility, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.It will mandate for every Australian in aged care to receive 215 minutes of care per day, ensuring more care for every resident.It will deliver better food, an increase in transparency and accountability, and a cap on the fees people can be charged for administration and management of their home care package.The government will back calls for a real pay increase for aged-care workers at the Fair Work Commission, recognising that higher standards of care must be supported by higher wages.The government sees a moral duty in caring for our elders and treating our older Australians with the respect, humanity and dignity they deserve.Climate change and energyActing on climate change is a priority for the government—and an opportunity for Australia. Embracing the transition to clean energy will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs.Under its Powering Australia plan, the government expects to create more than 600,000 job opportunities, with five out of every six in regional Australia.The plan will also spur $76 billion worth of investment and will help save families and businesses hundreds of dollars a year on their electricity bills.Powering Australia will create clean energy jobs and cut power costs.But is also a plan to bring people together and move the country forward, around a collective desire to take far stronger action on climate change and accelerate our efforts towards net zero emissions by 2050.Additionally, the government has formally updated Australias nationally determined contribution under the Paris Agreement, a 43 per cent reduction on 2005 levels by 2030.The government intends to go a step further, enshrining this new commitment in legislation and sending industry and investors a clear message: certainty.The government believes that, with the right policies and investments, Australia can become a clean energy superpower.Thats why the government will invest in accelerating the decarbonisation of Australias electricity grid.The government will also support manufacturing of renewables and low-emission technologies and invest in community batteries and solar banks.Australias first national electric vehicle strategy will be established, too.Investment in vehicle charging and hydrogen refuelling infrastructure will double.The government will establish a New Energy Skills Program and train 10,000 new energy apprentices.The role of the Climate Change Authority will be restored.And, to show the seriousness with which Australia approaches climate change, Australia will seek our Pacific partners views on co-hosting a future UN climate Conference of the Parties.Environment and waterThe government believes that acting on climate change is a chance to grow the economy and protect the environment.The Great Barrier Reef is a UNESCO World Heritage site and one of the seven wonders of the natural world.Protecting its future is an important responsibility.The government will invest in reef preservation and restoration, ensuring that the reef can be enjoyed for generations to come.The government will partner with local communities to clean up urban rivers and catchments, to improve water quality and amenity, and help protect threatened species.The government will double the number of rangers in the Indigenous rangers program, bringing the total number of rangers to 3,800 by 2030.And they will boost funding for the management of Indigenous protected areas—critical for maintaining cultural sites, biodiversity conservation and restoration.Furthermore, the government has committed to a full response to the Samuel review of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act; and to ongoing consultation to make environmental laws work better for everyone.Water management is a priority, too.The government will establish a National Water Commission to drive ongoing water reform, and futureproof Australias water supply.The government will also deliver on water commitments under the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, including 450 gigalitres for South Australia.Disaster readinessThe government recognises the economic opportunity and the environmental necessity that acting on climate change presents for Australia.It also understands that the consequences of climate change are already being visited upon our communities with greater frequency and ferocity.The government will oversee an ongoing process of review to ensure Australias national disaster recovery support arrangements are streamlined, fair and equitable.It will work with states, territories and local governments to continue to implement the recommendations of the Royal Commission into National Natural Disaster Arrangements.And it will build our national resilience, ensuring we have the capacity to predict, prevent, absorb, adapt to and evolve from national emergencies and disasters in the future, including through the Disaster Ready Fund.Australia  s place in the worldThis 47th Parliament of Australia meets in an international environment far less certain than any other time in recent memory.The Prime Minister earlier this month witnessed firsthand the devastation wrought by Russias invasion of Ukraine.As that unprovoked, illegal and immoral war continues to rage, the rules based global order comes under increasing strain.The government will continue to show solidarity with the people of Ukraine.And seek to manage the ripple effect of uncertainty in our own region.At this time, Australia needs to deploy all aspects of our power—military, diplomatic, economic and social.The government believes the Australian people must be at the heart of our engagement, because what we project to the world starts with who we are.Our multicultural society makes us a more diverse, more prosperous and more vibrant nation.But multiculturalism is also a diplomatic asset—as the home of more than 300 ancestries, Australia can reach into every corner of the world and say, We share common ground.We can work together, with our partners, to secure a region that is stable, prosperous and respectful of sovereignty.We will deepen cooperation through ASEAN, strengthen our bilateral relationships, and further our shared goals through the Quad.Australia will bring new energy and resources to the Pacific, respecting Pacific institutions and listening to Pacific priorities, the most pressing of which is the climate crisis.Ultimately, the governments foreign policy is an expression of our national values, national interests and national identity.An important part of that equation is trade.The governments objectives will be to advance Australias interests, bolster the rules-based multilateral trading system, and deliver business opportunities for Australian producers and suppliers.The government sees great gains for us in a future powered by cleaner and cheaper energy.So, as the world demands change, we need to not just diversify the markets we export to but what we export as well.Turning to defence policy and national security, the government will spend two per cent of Australias GDP on defence, including enhancing the Australian Defence Force with capabilities outlined in the 2020 Defence strategic update.AUKUS will remain central, not only in delivering nuclear powered submarines but also in guiding accelerated development of advanced defence capabilities where they have the most impact.A Defence Force Posture Review will similarly ensure the capability is there to meet Australias growing strategic challenges.In 2022, national security also takes in everything from cybersecurity to biosecurity.The government will seek to bolster Australian cybersecurity expertise—and has already acted to boost Australias biosecurity system against the threat foot-and-mouth disease poses to our farmers.Operation Sovereign Borders will be maintained, to ensure people smugglers in the region cannot restart a business model built on human suffering.And the government will support a strong humanitarian migration program that can respond to humanitarian crises as they arise.Keeping the nation safe is the solemn duty of every government.And the government believes that the Australians who fulfil that responsibility and risk their lives in the service of our nation are owed not just respect and remembrance but ongoing support.This is a moral obligation we owe ADF personnel, veterans and their families, including those affected by our longest and most recent war in Afghanistan.Priorities include speeding up DVA claims and payments processing times and expanding the network of veterans and families hubs across Australia.The government has also listened to the families of defence personnel and veterans and supported their calls for the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide, and will look forward to the royal commissions interim report next month.Safer and more affordable housingAlongside the governments commitment to nation-building sits a determination to ensure more Australians can count on the safety and stability of secure housing.We all know the difference a secure roof over your head can make to a persons life chances.The government will establish a Housing Australia Future Fund to build an additional 30,000 new social and affordable houses within five years.It will create a National Housing Supply and Affordability Council, and launch a National Housing and Homelessness Plan.The government also sees the importance of homeownership, the sense of belonging and pride and stability it can confer.And so, it will support more Australians into their own home through the Help To Buy scheme and the Regional First Home Buyer Support Scheme.EducationThe government believes education is the most powerful weapon against disadvantage—and the best investment in Australias economic future.Cheaper child care means more children will get access to early years education.And the government will cooperate with the states and territories to make sure all schools are put on a path to full and fair funding.The government knows great teachers change lives—and will initiate policies to attract the best and brightest to the teaching profession and work with schools across jurisdictions to address teacher workforce challenges.In addition, the government will prioritise helping kids bounce back after COVID-19, with a $200 million investment in mental health and wellbeing support.The government will boost investment in public TAFE and apprenticeships, to ensure a new generation of Australians can gain the skills and confidence for the jobs of the future.And resetting the relationships with universities is a priority, too.The government has pledged to develop an Australian Universities Accord, covering the accessibility, affordability, quality and sustainability of our treasured higher education institutions.With that, comes a renewed focus on university and research excellence, including the translation and commercialisation of great Australian ingenuity.Valuing the artsThe government has great faith in our national cultural endeavour, and recognises the importance of getting Australias arts industry back on track, too.The conviction is simple: that a nation that invests in art and creativity is a nation that knows itself, and invites the world to know it better.Its in this spirit that this parliamentary term will see the release of a national cultural policy—the first in almost a decade.There will also be greater certainty for two other vital cultural institutions—the ABC and SBS—with new funding terms spanning five years.Fighting corruptionThe government has an ambitious agenda for Australia.And it recognises that so much of what it hopes to achieve depends on the trust of the Australian people.Trust that government and public institutions will act with integrity in the interests of the nation.To strengthen this trust, the government will legislate to create a powerful, independent and transparent national anticorruption commission. This will bring the Commonwealth in line with the states and territories, and will enable investigations of serious and systemic corruption.It will be an important addition to the integrity framework of this country.And out of the same commitment to accountability and public confidence, the government will establish a royal commission into the scheme commonly known as robodebt.A strong Australian Public ServiceLeading with integrity also means working in partnership with a strong, committed and empowered Public Service.The removal of the average staffing level cap, rebalancing the use of labour hire, limiting fixed-term contracts and undertaking a strategic reinvestment of funds will form the first phase of the governments plan to rebuild the Public Services capacity to deliver the best outcomes for the Australian people.The government will ensure the APS becomes a model employer and an employer of choice, including—and especially—for First Nations people, and those living with disability.The government will seek to lead by example.ConclusionA change of government represents a chance to bring the nation together anew.To senators and members from the government, opposition and crossbench, I congratulate you on being called to serve our country and our democracy.I urge you to advocate thoughtfully, debate respectfully and—in everything you do—prove worthy of the Australian people.I wish you every success in meeting this moment.It is now my duty and my honour to declare the 47th Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia open.","Presentation","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1[1]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","The SPEAKER ","(16:01):"

39,0,0,0,1,1,"Murphy, Peta MP",133646,"Dunkley","ALP","N/A",25," Im incredibly proud to move:That Ms Claydon be elected Deputy Speaker of this House.Sharon Claydon, the member for Newcastle, is everything anyone could ask for in a parliamentarian. Shes also everything anyone could ask for in a colleague and in a friend. At a time when calls for doing politics differently rebound across our country and when restoring the publics trust in democracy and government feels like an urgent first-order priority, the member for Newcastle represents the standard that we should all aspire to. She embodies the qualities that are required not just to preside over but to enhance proceedings in this chamber, and she has the experience, commitment and work ethic to play an important role in ensuring that we bring in the reforms necessary to address the cultural problems that we know exist across this institution.Sharon Claydon was first elected to represent the people of Newcastle in 2013. Anyone who knows her knows that she has a deep and abiding love for and commitment to service of her community. Importantly, she approaches this service with a lived understanding of the history of her community, a sophisticated approach to the challenges that it faces and an infectious optimism for its future. Perhaps some of this comes from her previous profession as an anthropologist, which is not a profession that springs immediately to mind when you think of a federal parliamentarian but is just one of the things that set Sharon apart from the crowd. I know that much of it comes from being prepared to do the hard work of listening to the voices of people from across the political, social, economic and cultural spectrum, from her commitment to always seek a solution that promotes equality and fairness, from her valuing of the experts and the people with lived experience and from being inevitably the person who puts up her hand to deliver the solution, not just be part of talking about it.The member for Newcastle has also been a servant of this parliament since the day she was elected. She joined the Speakers panel in March 2015—I am told that that was the first opportunity for her to do so—and, everyone in this place will agree with me, she has been a respected occupant of the Speakers chair as part of that panel ever since. I will admit that I was quite surprised to find out today that she doesnt have a completely unblemished record of behaviour in the chamber. Apparently, she was 94(a)d by Speaker Bronwyn Bishop.","Deputy Speaker","PARLIAMENTARY OFFICE HOLDERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms MURPHY (Dunkley) ","(17:01):"

To be fair to the member for Newcastle, as I understand it, that happened to basically every Labor member of that parliament at least once.Sharon Claydon has served on more parliamentary committees than most of us have had hot dinners.

Have I missed any, Sharon? It makes me tired just reading out that list. She is a true parliamentarian and a servant of her community and this parliament.Sharon Claydon is smart and she is decent. And, because she is genuinely respectful of others and is genuinely great company, she is both liked and respected across the political divide. I am incredibly proud that she asked me to nominate her as the Deputy Speaker, and I ask that the House support that nomination.","Deputy Speaker","PARLIAMENTARY OFFICE HOLDERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[7]","N/A","N/A"

I was fortunate that at the start of the last parliament I got to sit next to the member for Newcastle in the chamber, and given it was the start of my time in parliament, and as a former journalist, I very much took the view that there were no stupid questions when it came to trying to work out what was going on in this place. Its a mark of the member for Newcastles fundamental decency and patience that she answered all of these questions, and she didnt request a seat transfer—at least as far as I know!It also became clear how deep her understanding is of the workings of this place, as well as her respect for it as a democratic institution. Her understanding is drawn from her experience in this place as a member, as a member of the Speakers panel and as deputy chair of numerous parliamentary committees. Her respect encompasses an awareness that this will only be an enduring democratic institution if we as a parliament meet the best of community expectations. I know she will bring this respect to her work from the Speakers chair. I cannot think of anyone more appropriate to drive the work thats been set out in Kate Jenkinss Set the standard report to improve the culture here and ensure that this is a safer workplace for women, and to make sure that as a parliament we dont miss this moment to set the high standards and to follow through on them. The member for Newcastle has already demonstrated her capability in this regard by driving change within the Labor Party and putting in place standards, policies and procedures that we never had before.The member for Newcastle is incredibly diligent. Many evenings when others of us here are socialising and debriefing from the day, shes in her office finalising one of those many committee reports or following up on an issue on behalf of people who have asked for her help. She consistently works on behalf of people who have not historically been heard in this place: First Nations people, women, the people whose lives were devastated by institutional violence, to name just a few. Her community know her as a fierce advocate for their interests. She is a trusted colleague and I know she is respected by many in this place. And, when she can be dragged away from her work, the member for Newcastle is excellent company and a lot of fun. Mr Speaker, there could be no finer choice, on character, on capacity, on qualifications and on experience.","Deputy Speaker","PARLIAMENTARY OFFICE HOLDERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms THWAITES (Jagajaga) ","(17:06):"

50,0,0,0,1,1,"OBrien, Ted MP",138932,"Fairfax","LNP","N/A",26," Mr Speaker, I congratulate you on your elevation today. When it comes to the member for Moore, he isnt just good enough; hes the best! He is the best, and I am delighted to second the nomination of the member for Moore as Deputy Speaker of this chamber.The member for Moore is a first-generation migrant, having arrived in Australia at the age of only nine. He made his own way through school, as a trainee accountant; through business; and, finally, as an elected official here in this parliament as the member for Moore, elected now for his fourth term. I share the views of the member for Bonner in saying that he is well respected on both sides of the parliament, and indeed he has been on the Speakers panel for eight years. I think his record—unlike, as we just found out, that of the other candidate in this race—is unblemished. Actually, I would go one step further: I would go so far as to say the member for Moore is probably the least likely person in this chamber to be booted out.Can I also share with the House the importance placed by the member for Moore on the procedures and standing orders of this place. Indeed, it was in the member for Moores maiden speech, his first opening remarks, that he congratulated the then new Speaker and went on to say that he planned to serve on that Speakers panel, and serve he did. I think it would be a great honour for him to be the Deputy Speaker, a role he would do a wonderful job at.Can I reflect also on the Prime Ministers expressed desire for a more gentle, kinder, more courteous parliament and say that now we have our chance. Now we have our chance in the member for Moore, somebody who lives and breathes those virtues when hes in the chair and outside. I would love to think that at the start of this parliament, as a great mark of unity, we could all swing in behind the candidacy of the member for Moore and give the Speaker a deputy, the House a deputy, and show the nation what a true gentle, quietly spoken Deputy Speaker—yet a lion in defence of the standing orders—is all about, and that resides in the member for Moore. I commend him to you—not just to those on the other side but also to those behind me and those who are new to the House. The member for Moore is not just good enough; hes the best!","Deputy Speaker","PARLIAMENTARY OFFICE HOLDERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr TED OBRIEN (Fairfax) ","(17:10):"

55,0,0,0,1,1,"Albanese, Anthony MP","R36","Grayndler","ALP","N/A",27," I congratulate the Deputy Speaker, the member for Newcastle, on her election and the Second Deputy Speaker, the member for Moore, on his election to such high office.The member for Newcastle has been a mate of mine for a very long period of time. The member for Newcastle is an outstanding local member, who has presided over a local community that has gone through a really difficult transition. When the community saw the BHP steelworks close, there was a view from some that somehow this would be a region in decline. The opposite has, of course, occurred. It is a cosmopolitan, vibrant community with a really diverse economy thats continuing to grow, and there are enormous opportunities for it.The port of Newcastle, which I visited with the member just last year, is the heartland of the economy in the Hunter Valley. It is a very large port with extraordinary opportunity to grow in the future, as we see new industries growing there as well. Theres also incredible opportunity for that region to take advantage of the governments commitment to build things here, to advance manufacturing. Ive seen coal trains, for example, that had to be redone with the member for Newcastle because they werent fit for purpose. We should be making those things there in Newcastle, and thats something that Im sure the member for Newcastle will be working on.Shes someone who has had an extensive period of commitment to committee processes, but, in particular, I want to single out the work that the member for Newcastle has done both within the Labor party and, importantly, within the parliament about gender equity and making the parliament a safer place. In the last parliament, issues were raised that needed to be dealt with. The member for Newcastle was diligent, committed and principled. She was someone who engaged right across the parliament to make sure that out of those processes we had unanimous recommendations in this parliament that were then adopted and that need to be implemented. Its an example of the sort of work that Sharon Claydon is noted for in her local community but also respected for in this place. I congratulate the member for Newcastle, who is a very worthy Deputy Speaker indeed.","Deputy Speaker","PARLIAMENTARY OFFICE HOLDERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ALBANESE (Grayndler—Prime Minister) ","(17:31):"
56,0,0,0,1,1,"Dutton, Peter Craig MP","00AKI","Dickson","LNP","N/A",27," I join with the Prime Minister in his words of congratulations to the member for Newcastle, who comes to this parliament with a breadth of experience in a number of industries. She has been a really passionate local—a fifth-generation local—and believes very much in her people. In the trials and tribulations that theyve been through, which the Prime Minister made reference to, she has been there providing support and leadership to them. Those qualities will serve her well in this role, and on behalf of the opposition I wish her all the very best.Of course it wouldve been a much better outcome had my good friend the member for Moore been elected and prevailed in this ballot, but that was not to be the case. Its hard to imagine a more decent or honourable person than the member for Moore. He is a first-generation migrant to our country—he came here as a nine-year-old in 1984. He has an incredible story, he has a small business background, he has a great deal of passion for his electorate and he is widely respected in Western Australia. Im very proud to call him a friend. He will make a fine contribution, as weve already seen when he has occupied this chair. He has a very soft and quiet demeanour but is an incredibly decent person, as I say, and brings not just a calmness but a command to the time that he occupies the chair. We wish both the Deputy Speaker and the Second Deputy Speaker all the very best in their respective roles.","Deputy Speaker","PARLIAMENTARY OFFICE HOLDERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr DUTTON (Dickson—Leader of the Opposition) ","(17:34):"

I see the member for Newcastle whenever I come to parliament and whenever I go to a music festival. The member for Newcastle represents not only what has become a cosmopolitan and wonderful electorate, but also the home of the Screaming Jets. The member for Moore is liked around the chamber and respected. I wish him well in the role.I also want to take the opportunity to thank the outgoing Deputy Speaker and Second Deputy Speaker. The outgoing Second Deputy Speaker, the member for McEwen, held that role for a long time. He is very well regarded and respected. Similarly, the member for Wide Bay—who I can say I supported in the role because I nominated him in that one as well—served well in the role.I think when you look at the issues that are going to have to be dealt with, in particular the response to the Set the standard report, the member for Newcastle in particular is going to be able to play an extremely important role on behalf of the parliament.","Deputy Speaker","PARLIAMENTARY OFFICE HOLDERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BURKE (Watson—Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Minister for the Arts and Leader of the House) ","(17:35):"

She has been on the Speakers panel since 2015 and has a strong, demonstrated interest in parliamentary issues. She is certainly very well respected on this side of the chamber for her proven practice of being very diligent in her committee work, and Im sure shell bring that same approach to her work as Deputy Speaker.To the Second Deputy Speaker: congratulations on your appointment. I know that the member for Moore will do a tremendous job, again drawing on extensive experience: eight years on the Speakers panel, member of the parliament since 2013, successful business career before coming into the parliament, an immigrant to Australia from Singapore, a passionate Liberal and a passionate Western Australian. All of those are perspectives that he will bring to this role. These are important roles in supporting the operation of the chamber and the operation of this parliament.I also want to acknowledge the service of the member for Wide Bay, as the former Deputy Speaker, and the member for McEwen, as the former Second Deputy Speaker, and, on behalf of the opposition, join with the Leader of the Opposition in congratulating both the newly elected Deputy Speaker and the newly elected Second Deputy Speaker.","Deputy Speaker","PARLIAMENTARY OFFICE HOLDERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr FLETCHER (Bradfield—Manager of Opposition Business) ","(17:37):"

62,0,0,0,1,1,"Fletcher, Paul MP","L6B","Bradfield","LP","N/A",29," I can advise the House that, broadly, with one or two issues that we wish to identify, the opposition is in support of these changes to standing committees, and we have certainly been working with the government and with the crossbench on these changes, and one of the consequences of them is to provide some greater roles for the crossbench in the committee process. I do want to note two specific issues, one of which is that there is no longer to be any reference to cities in the title of the standing committee on infrastructure, so cities has disappeared from the title of this committee and, indeed, from the ministers title. It does raise the question of the level of commitment of this government to the cities agenda. Our government had a very strong agenda when it came to cities, but we seem to be moving away from a commitment to cities policy. So I do note that we no longer have a minister for cities. We no longer seem to have a committee that has any investigation in relation to cities. The opposition does note that with concern.What we also note with concern is that two committees have been abolished, and one of those is the Joint Standing Committee on Northern Australia. That is pretty significant. Our government had a very strong commitment to northern Australia, and this government has failed to re-establish the Joint Standing Committee on Northern Australia. That is a matter of concern to the Liberal Party and to the National Party, and I believe that the Leader of the Nationals wishes to speak about that.","Standing and Sessional Orders","BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr FLETCHER (Bradfield—Manager of Opposition Business) ","(17:40):"

Their voice to this parliament is being removed through a bipartisan committee that was about the growth of northern Australia, where we have an extra $2 billion investment pipeline through the Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund, taking it to a $7 billion investment pipeline, because there is investment confidence in northern Australia. But the investment signals on northern Australia to take away from this government today are that they arent interested in them anymore. Every Australian should have the opportunity to have their voice heard in this parliament through important committee work, and this government, which trumpeted that it would govern for every Australian, has now turned its back on 1.3 million Australians. But, more importantly, they have turned their backs on over 200,000 First Nations people who have the opportunity to develop their country, to develop northern Australia, to take northern Australia to a level we have not seen before. So I say to those opposite: you have to govern for every Australian. The opportunity not just for northern Australia but for this great country is in the north. You should remember that, and you should engage that in a constructive way.","Standing and Sessional Orders","BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr LITTLEPROUD (Maranoa—Leader of the Nationals) ","(17:43):"

81,0,0,0,1,1,"Albanese, Anthony MP","R36","Grayndler","ALP","N/A",45," I move:That the House record its deep regret at the death on 8 July 2022 of the Honourable Mr Abe Shinzo, former Prime Minister of Japan; place on record its acknowledgement of his significant contribution to regional and global affairs and to the Australia-Japan partnership; and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.Our shock at the death of Abe Shinzo was acute, and I welcome today the ambassador and his wife and our friends from the Japanese Embassy here in Canberra. It is especially poignant to share our grief here in the very chamber where he addressed us only a handful of years ago. I attended the Embassy of Japan with Ambassador Yamagami just days after Mr Abes assassination, with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to sign the book of condolence on behalf of the Australian parliament and on behalf of the Australian people.As I said on the morning after Mr Abes assassination, it is hard to believe that we are talking about him in the past tense. On that terrible day, Japan lost a true patriot and true leader, and Australia lost a true friend and ally. Indeed, the friendship that Mr Abe gave Australia was warm in sentiment and profound in consequence. His commitment to furthering relations between our two nations saw him come to Australia no fewer than five times as Prime Minister.Mr Abe was instrumental in delivering several historical developments between Japan and Australia. Among them we can count the ratification of the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement, which created new opportunities for Australian businesses in Japan. He was an unflagging champion for the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. He elevated our bilateral relationship to a special strategic partnership. Under his longstanding advocacy for closer links between our two nations, we have also increased defence cooperation, including through the recently signed reciprocal access agreement.Mr Abe understood instinctively that our two nations share values of democracy and human rights, and a common interest in bolstering the global rules-based order. As befits a true statesman, his vision rose above the often self-defeating brevity of the modern political cycle, and, because of that, he was able to make a lasting difference. Not least was his vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific—which has had a profound effect on regional and global security—and his role in forming the Quad.In a world of change and unpredictability, Mr Abe was a reassuring figure of certainty. Our friendship with Japan is one of the central elements of Australias international relations. There is warmth at the heart of our friendship, there is respect and there is trust. Mr Abe embodied them all. The friendship between our two nations is all the more remarkable when we consider the terrible enmity it grew out of. Mr Abe was very much conscious of that. Standing here, he spoke about the horrors of the Second World War and conveyed his condolences for those who lost their lives and to the many left to carry the scars in body and mind. But he also gave his thanks for the slow, warm dawning of friendship and for the country that had made the improbable possible. He stated:… my great and whole-hearted gratitude for the spirit of tolerance and for the friendship that Australia has shown to Japan … we will never forget your open-minded spirit nor the past history between us.Four years later, in 2018, he was the first Japanese leader to visit Darwin and to lay a memorial wreath while he was there. He was certainly not destined to be Prime Minister in easy times, but he faced challenges with resolve. It is a bleak paradox that someone of such courage and strength of character could be taken away in an act of such utter cowardice. I say again to our friends in Japan: the precious democracy that you have built is stronger than this. The values that we share and that hold our societies together are stronger than this. A hand raised in violence can never be allowed to overpower what so many hands have built in peace. And this low act of cruelty cannot be allowed to overshadow a life that was lived with such high purpose.To Mr Abes family and to his loving wife, Abe Akie, I extend the sincerest condolences of the Australian people. To the broader Japanese family: your Australian friends share in your great sorrow. Yet even in sadness we must also celebrate his life. It was a life of such consequence. Mr Abe changed things for the better—in Japan, in our region and, indeed, around the world. And that, by any measure, is a life well lived. May he rest in peace.","Abe, Mr Shinzo","CONDOLENCES","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ALBANESE (Grayndler—Prime Minister) ","(17:53):"
82,0,0,0,1,1,"Dutton, Peter Craig MP","00AKI","Dickson","LNP","N/A",46," I join with the fine words of the Prime Minister today to honour the nation-builder and the builder of relationships between nations the late Abe Shinzo, former Prime Minister of Japan. I extend a warm welcome to His Excellency the ambassador Yamagami Shingo and his wife, and also the staff from the embassy.Mr Abe was the first Japanese Prime Minister born after the Second World War, and yet it was the shadow of war and the weight of history that would define his lifes work. He was a man who understood the consequences of conflict and was unwavering in his commitment to peace.On his appointment to leadership in 2006, his first—and brief—term as prime minister, Mr Abe spoke about his vision for Japan, his desire to create a beautiful country which was open to the world in his words. At a time when Japan was struggling to shake off its lost decades of low growth, from the early 1990s until the first decade of this century, Mr Abe believed Japan must not become disconnected from the world or the world become disconnected from Japan.It was in his second renowned term as leader, between 2012 and 2020, that made him Japans longest-serving prime minister. We now honour Mr Abe as a leader of conviction, a patriot who uttered his beliefs with courage and a politician who had the will and skill to implement his domestic and foreign policy agenda. His economic, social and structural reforms—Abenomics as they have become known—injected much needed energy and growth into Japans economy, which had been hit by years of deflation. GDP and private investment went up; unemployment dropped; and record numbers of women were in work. Today, Abenomics stands alongside Reganomics and Thatcherism as economic approaches of significance. Mr Abe is now a part of the pantheon of world leaders whose policies, due to their success, carry their creators names.As Mr Abe steered his country into a new period of vitality, opportunity and compassion, as he had always hoped to do, international outreach didnt escape his attention, and nor did Australia. Indeed, both were in his blood. He would follow in the footsteps of his grandfather, Japanese Prime Minister Busuke Kishi, who, with Australian Prime Minister Robert Menzies and trade minister John McEwen, brought to fruition the Australia-Japan commerce agreement of 1957. If that trade agreement normalised bilateral relations, gave rise to friendship and engendered new prosperity for both of our nations in the postwar years, then it was Mr Abe and Prime Minister Tony Abbotts signing of the Japan-Australia economic partnership in 2014 which signalled the evolution of the relationship into a truly special strategic partnership. It is hard to think of another family, besides the royal house of Windsor perhaps, that has had such a profound influence on Australias development as a nation.Importantly, the free trade agreement which Mr Abe finalised with Australia was the first Japan concluded with a major developed economy—one that, as Prime Minister Abbott noted, took rare courage to challenge entrenched ideas, and one that no doubt instilled confidence in Mr Abe to be a flag-bearer for free trade and the champion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.The most vivid characterisation of our bilateral relationship came from Mr Abe himself during his historic visit in 2014. In his address to this parliament on 8 July he said:Japan and Australia have deepened our economic ties. We will now join up in a scrum, just like in rugby, to nurture our regional and the world order and to safeguard peace.That same year, negotiations commenced on the reciprocal access agreement to allow our military forces to operate in each others country, an agreement brought to fruition under the former Morrison government. Just like his grandfather Mr Abe valued history, but he was not a prisoner of the past. He sought to transform Japans role in the world through constitutional recognition of its armed forces. His motivation stemmed not from a desire to rewrite history or to dismiss past horrors and injustices, rather because he appreciated more than most the increasing threats in the region and their implications.Mr Abes prescience and pragmatism was on display in his address to the parliament of India in August 2007. There he delivered his famous confluence of the two seas speech, now considered to be one of the most pivotal for the regions development. Not only did he reconceptualise the region, a broader Asia, that had come about from the dynamic coupling of seas of freedom and of prosperity, but he spoke of an arc of freedom and prosperity in which Japan and Indias coming together would engender wider partnerships with the United States and our own country. Ahead of his time, Mr Abe was the author of the concept and characterisation of a free and open Indo-Pacific and was the architect of the Quad. But it wouldnt be until 10 years later that he could give substance to the Quad—evidence of his persistence.Testimony to his character and influence, Mr Abes standing grew, both in Japan and internationally, following his retirement from high office. With growing tensions in the region, he became more outspoken about threats to Japan and to peace in the region, especially the prospect of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Such warnings were neither the voice of catastrophism nor chest beating from a man in post-political life. They were the considered views of a seasoned statesman who had earlier said:We have the great responsibility to take the lessons of history deeply into our hearts, to carve out a better future, and to make all possible efforts for the peace and prosperity of Asia and the world.Whether as a nation builder or builder of relationships between nations, Mr Abes legacy will never be forgotten and will be felt throughout the world for generations to come. A visionary statesman, pragmatic leader and conviction politician, Mr Abe is an example for all who are elected to office and all who desire to enter public life.I acknowledge the fact that former Prime Minister Morrison and his wife, Jenny, have met with the Prime Minister and his wife in Tokyo today to convey their condolences for this tragic loss. As the Leader of the Opposition and on behalf of the Coalition, I offer my heartfelt condolences to the people of Japan, to Mr Abes colleagues in the LDP and especially to his dear family and friends. May he rest in peace.","Abe, Mr Shinzo","CONDOLENCES","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr DUTTON (Dickson—Leader of the Opposition) ","(17:59):"

90,0,0,0,1,1,"Sitou, Sally MP",298121,"Reid","ALP","N/A",48," I move:That the Address be agreed to.This month is a special month for my family. My parents are celebrating 40 years of being Australian citizens. There is a beautiful serendipity about today—that I am now standing in this chamber as a member of parliament on the 40th anniversary of my parents Australian citizenship. This moment here is surreal, in the best way possible—that one could dare to dream this big. For this was an improbable candidacy. Being elected into our federal parliament is a big deal, but its an even bigger deal for my parents. They fled their homeland, fearful of what might happen to them because of who they were and the values they held. Even after arriving here they continued to carry that fear, not wanting to talk about politics, not wanting to share their views. And here they are, in the public gallery, watching their daughter speak in our federal parliament.So you can imagine what this means for them: how much theyve come to embrace the best of this country—our freedoms to speak out, to hold a faith and to build the life we want, and our responsibilities to those around us so that we may all prosper together. I marvel at how much has changed for my family in just one generation. That is the power of the Australian story, because stories like mine are possible only in countries like Australia. I am the daughter of migrants, a proud Chinese-Lao Australian. I grew up in Cabramatta in south-west Sydney. Im the product of good public education. And now Im the federal member for Reid.I stand here on the land of the Ngunnawal and Ngambri people, and I represent an area that is the land of the Wangal people. Australia is home to the oldest continuing culture in the world, the significance of which should never be diminished. The culture of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders has endured for more than 65,000 years, in all its richness and diversity. They were our first scientists, philosophers, teachers and bakers. They nurtured this land. We ought to celebrate the culture of Australias First Nations people, acknowledge their rightful place as the traditional and first custodians of this land. We ought to enshrine their voice in our Constitution, and I want to be part of a parliament that does that.For the sake of future generations, we must do more than pay our respects to their elders past, present and future. We ought to learn from them, continue their care of country and ensure that their culture remains the oldest living culture in the world. First Nations people have gifted us a tradition of custodianship: the idea that we are all here in service of others and must leave this country better than when we found it. When I acknowledge country Im reminded that I am but a small addition to a long and continuing history. I am a custodian for the present so that future generations may also care for this country.I stand here as the member for Reid, and I want to acknowledge the members who came before: my predecessor, Dr Fiona Martin, an advocate for improving mental health support; and thank you to former members John Murphy and Mary Easson for generously sharing their wisdom with me. To the people of Reid, thank you for trusting me to be your representative. This is a community I love. Its a wonderful microcosm of multicultural Sydney, imbued with the customs of migrants from around the world. They, too, enriched us with cultures and traditions that make our community stronger. I stand in this institution, as their representative, aware of the weight of responsibility, because it is in this institution that decisions are made that have a profound impact on peoples lives. I know this not as an intellectual exercise; I know this because decisions made here have recharted the course of my familys story and the stories of so many Australians.In 1977, then Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser developed Australias first comprehensive refugee policy. He may have been in a different political party to me, but on this I believe he was on the right side of history. He welcomed refugees fleeing Indochina following the Vietnam War, and one year later, in 1978, he welcomed my parents. My family is of Chinese heritage, but my parents were born and raised in Laos. They fled their homeland and were incredibly lucky Australia gave them refuge. When my parents came here, they had limited formal education and spoke very little English. They worked hard in factories, where they were able to find secure work with good conditions. They gave my brother and me the work and education opportunities they never had, and my family was able to thrive here. I went on to have the most incredible career, working in international development in the Asia-Pacific and then in international education.As I reflect on my familys story—a story shared by so many Australians—I also need to reflect on the journey we as a country have travelled to get to this point, because it wasnt an easy journey. Charting through the decisions that have shaped our country, its important to remember that for much of our history the path on which we walked was not towards multiculturalism but towards a White Australia policy. It was a path that said there was no place in this country for people like me. It was a path that denied our First Nations people their identity, land and kin. Those decisions were made based on fear and a failure of imagination. But we were able to fulfil the potential and promise of Australia when leaders in this place were driven not by fear but by hope and compassion. They looked around and saw what was and imagined what could be. They imagined a country not weakened by diversity but strengthened by it.In more recent history, when it looked like fear might again overtake imagination, Prime Minister Bob Hawke said in this place:One of the great and rare distinctions of Australian political leadership in the last generation has been its bipartisan rejection of race as a factor in immigration policy. This has been a triumph of compassion over prejudice, of reason over fear, and of statesmanship over politics.It was an appeal to turn to the better angels of our nature, and turn we did. In just over half a century, we have moved from an embrace of a White Australia policy to a country that is now a majority-migrant nation. But what is more remarkable is how this news was received—not with backlash but with a genuine embrace of modern Australia. And there is no better display of that than in our federal parliament.As I look around the House today, it feels like finally it is starting to live up to its name—a House made up of people who truly reflect and represent the communities in which they live. I believe it was important I put my hand up to stand for Reid, a thriving multicultural and multifaith community, because, as audacious as this dream was—to run for our federal parliament—it has never been more important for someone like me to dream it. I grew up watching Home and Away and Neighbours, but I also grew up with a slight unease, not sure of who I was, not sure if Id gone to the right schools and acutely aware of the postcode I grew up in—not sure of my place in this country. Thats why I think its important to have someone like me in our federal parliament, not for diversitys sake but because representatives that embody all of the Australian story make our parliament better and our democracy stronger.I speak about my familys story because it is core to who I am. Its what shaped me and the values I want to bring to our parliament. It also connects me to my community. The men on the factory floor in Silverwater remind me of my dad, who worked in an automotive factory for 35 years. Religious leaders who fled their homelands because of persecution—their stories remind me of my own family fleeing their homeland. Parents talk to me about wanting to give their kids good-quality education. Its the same desire I have for my son and the same desire my parents had for me. When I encounter racism and prejudice, I know firsthand how it corrodes our community and holds Australia back from being the best country we can be. And this is a message Im going to share with all young Australians: you are not defined by your postcode, the school you went to or where your parents came from; in this country, you are defined by the content of your character and what you want to do for others, where the potential and promise of this nation is only limited by our imagination.On 21 May this year we faced another key turning point in our nations history: do we continue on with another decade of inaction on climate change or do we imagine a better future for our kids? It was, again, an appeal to turn to the better angels of our nature, and turn we did. We chose care for country and future generations over fear. In the six short years my son has been alive, he has experienced the consequences of climate change, events described as once in a generation experienced in just a few short years. He has now lived through the 2019-2020 New South Wales bushfire season, a once-in-a-generation event. This year he lived through a once-in-a-generation rain and flooding event and now heatwaves breaking records across Europe, all once-in-a-generation events. Surely we can no longer look at the situation before us and believe this is okay. Surely we cannot say to my son and his generation that what we are doing to address climate is enough. Surely it is time to be audacious dreamers and imagine a better way. It is time for us all to learn from our continents First Nations people and take on roles as custodians of country. The policies and decisions and values of governments matter. The decisions made today matter for our generation, my sons generation and generations to come.Good governments change lives. I know because they changed mine. Former Prime Minister Paul Keating said education provided the keys to the kingdom because it unlocks opportunities for all. I was fortunate enough to have teachers who not only guided me through my academic life but also taught me about life outside the classroom—teachers like Craig Cantor, who volunteered to take six year 8 kids camping. It was the first time Id pitched a tent and slept under the stars, and I loved it. My history teacher, Frank Federico, taught me that progress, while not always linear or guaranteed, was possible if there were enough brave people willing to stand up for whats right. I didnt just get an academic education; I got an education in life. And that is the power of education.But we have lost sight of that in our current education system. We have failed to value our teachers. After 2½ years of COVID, our teachers are exhausted, and yet weve never asked more of them. We need to radically overhaul the administrative burden we place on our teachers. They should have more time doing what they love: teaching. We need to value them and finally pay them what they are worth. Sometimes we have even failed to provide our students with the most basic infrastructure. There is a school in my electorate where the toilets are so terrible students elect to drink less water to avoid going. There is a community in my electorate who have waited so long for a promised high school the kids are now at university. Our concept of education, too, needs an update. It doesnt start in kindergarten. We should instead think about education as starting from birth. Our early childhood educators are as vital to educating our kids as our primary and high school teachers and university lecturers are.We have allowed our university and TAFE sectors to languish, and, worse still, the previous government actively undermined tertiary education. They oversaw the most job losses the sector has ever seen—estimates of around 12,000 jobs lost in the higher education sector because of the pandemic. And the sad irony is that it was our university researchers we relied on to help us manage the pandemic: epidemiologists, virologists, public health experts. But its not just applied research that matters. We also need research in our arts, mathematics and basic science to be valued, because they provide the essential foundations for all future applications. If we can get this right, there is a kingdom that awaits us all, one made up of highly skilled and fulfilling jobs, an economy that is productive and makes the most of our talents and where imagination is valued.My parents were laser focused on ensuring my brother and I had a good education. They had to be, because their life in Australia was precarious—they did not have the comfort of being able to fail. We were lucky, though, because we had two communities supporting us. The Chinese-Lao-Australian community were like my big extended family, because I always had a collection of aunts and uncles watching over me. Its a resilient community, too. Weve had to be, because weve spent two generations searching for a place to call home, and now weve finally found it.The second community who supported us was the mighty trade union movement. When my dad was injured at work, it was his union that stepped in to help negotiate a new role that would accommodate his injury. When the company my mum worked for went insolvent, it was her union that stepped in to make sure she got her entitlements. I want to thank the union movement. You stood by my parents when they came to this country, just as you stand with all working people who want a better life. I acknowledge and thank all the union representatives present in the gallery here tonight.During the campaign I had the great privilege of meeting dedicated people who work to make our local area a community. I met Vicki Liubinskas, who started Lets Get Going because she wanted to ensure that adults with disabilities were able to exercise in a fun and safe way. I met Paula Nicolas from St Merkorious Charity. She gives people who are homeless dignity and respect by inviting them in for a hot meal and fellowship. I met the Wentworth Point Residents Action Group—a group of determined locals who got together to make their voices heard and advocate for local infrastructure in their community. These are people in Reid who looked around at what was and imagined what could be. They imagined a community where we were supporting each other, and I am inspired by their example and am determined to continue their good work.Throughout my campaign I had the support of volunteers who were committed to creating a better future for this country. They stood beside me and made me believe it was possible. They were my campaign community. Its thanks to them that I am the federal member for Reid.I want to pay tribute to the Australian Labor Party, a movement I joined when I was young and idealistic. I am older now but no less idealistic. To Kevin Rudd, Maxine McKew, Jason Li and Linda Voltz, thanks for the frequent special guest appearances on the campaign trail. There are many in this House I have admired for so long. That I now get to call you colleagues and friends brings me sheer delight. I want to thank the members for Watson, McMahon, Greenway, Chifley, Sydney, Kingsford Smith and Cowan for your support throughout the campaign. Thank you to Senators ONeill and Sheldon for your generous help. To Senator Wong, thank you—not just for your guidance but for the leading example you have provided to me and so many others. And to my old boss, the member for Blaxland, you bring a level of decency, respect and empathy that I hope to emulate. To the Prime Minister, thank you for bringing compassion back into fashion.The audacity of this dream was only possible because of three people. They believed in me long before I believed in myself: Jodi McKay, Kirsten Andrews and Dom Ofner. To the campaign team—Mitch Wright, Emma Ross, Ed Saloman, Louise Tran, Jacqueline Price, Phillip Kim, John McManus and LJ Margeit—you were the engine room of this campaign, making it all possible. To Greg Davis and Felicity Davis Rafferty, Karen Pensabene, Kym Ralley, Jacqui Thorburn, Tom Hore and Susan Yates, thank you for looking out for me and for your continuing support. To all the wonderful women associated with Asian Women at Work, particularly their drumming group and the Sydney Chinese Drum Art Troupe, thank you for helping me connect with my community. To all my Labor family in local government, our mayors and councillors, and to all the branch secretaries, presidents, local branch members and volunteers, you kept the light on the hill shining brightly. I will carry that passion for a better tomorrow with me every day.Im lucky to have an incredible family. My brother, Law; sister-in-law, Sharon; and niece, Haegan: it has been such a comfort knowing you are always there for us. To my parents-in-law, Shounan and Jian: thank you for your continuing support and love. To my parents, Phet and Syphan: for the sacrifices you have made, the love you give and the inspiration you have provided, thank you. To the two people who have been my biggest cheerleaders in life, my husband, Rui; and my son, Max: you are my reason for being, and I love you both.I want to dedicate my first speech to my ama, my maternal grandmother. She was the most remarkable woman. Ama was a widower and a single mother of eight. She had to uproot her life twice, first from China to Laos and then from Laos to Australia. I think about her often because so much of her life happened to her. She had very few choices. She didnt get to choose a career or even where to live. The last photo I have with her is on the dance floor at my wedding in Laos. Ama stayed on in Laos after the wedding, choosing to spend her final years there. It was one of the few choices she had an opportunity to make. Its because of her and the sacrifices she has made that my life was possible, where a world of opportunities has been unlocked for me. I have been able to make choices about what I want to study and what career I want to pursue, and the choice to stand for parliament. While we still have some ways to go before we achieve gender equality, when I think about how different my life is compared to Amas, I know were on the right path. If my ama were with us today, I think she would have been astounded but very proud too.","Address-in-Reply","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms SITOU (Reid) ","(18:09):"

93,0,0,0,1,1,"Mascarenhas, Zaneta MP",298800,"Swan","ALP","N/A",51," I second the motion. Thank you, Mr Speaker. Congratulations on your election as the Speaker for the 47th Parliament.I stand on the lands of the Ngunnawal people and the Ngambri people to speak about my community of Swan, which sits on the lands of the Beeloo people of the Whadjuk Noongar nation. Swan is surrounded by the Derbarl Yerrigan, the Swan River, and by the Djarlgarro Beelier, the Canning River. It is stunning country. The legend is that the river was created by giant serpents, who also created boodjar, moort and katitjin, meaning country, family and knowledge. Its astounding that we have the oldest continuous culture right here. Australias connection to country, family and knowledge will be critical to help us navigate our future.Building cubbyhouses in the bush and chasing lizards in the red dirt—thats how I grew up. I was born in Kalgoorlie and grew up in Kambalda, a nickel mining town. My dad, Joe, was a metalworker. My mum, Ethel, was a lollipop lady and kindergarten cleaner. Kambalda had the best of everything. Nearly everyones parents were employed at the mine. It was a highly skilled and multicultural workforce. We had magnificent gum trees that traversed our front yards. For school camp fundraisers we helped rehabilitate mines and planted trees. Mr Woolard, the environment manager, taught us that once you dug up the minerals you put the topsoil back and you healed the land again. The calibre of teachers was phenomenal—in particular, Elaine Wilson and principal Anthony Beatty. They fostered curiosity, play, respect and a love of learning. In fact, my primary school teacher, Mrs Wilson, was my childhood role model. This smart, compassionate woman taught us about our world, the environment, self-belief and, most importantly, that one person can make a difference. Educators lay foundations for kids that are critical. Thank you for the tireless work you do.My story—my Australian story—would not be possible if it was not for a federal Labor government. When my Goan Indian parents went to the embassy in Kenya they said to my dad: You have the right skills, but youre the wrong colour. This of course was because we still had the white Australia policy in place. My parents came to Australia after Gough Whitlam dismantled the last parts of the white Australia policy. This story taught me two things: politics is personal and politics can transform lives.Having a dad who is a fitter and turner meant that I got to get on the tools from a young age. Knowing how to fix a leaky tap or change a car tyre are useful lifelong skills. I also loved science and maths, so for me it was natural to study science and engineering at uni. Now, I want the number of women working in science, technology, engineering and maths to grow, and this starts in childhood. Give girls Lego to build those building blocks, hand a girl a spanner, and encourage them to use a telescope to reach for the stars.Curtin University, in the heart of Swan, is where I studied chemistry and chemical engineering. I loved Curtin. Like you do in the country, you get involved in community, and for me that was through the Curtin Student Guild and the National Union of Students. While Kambalda taught me that one person can make a difference, the union movement taught me that, collectively, we can achieve so much more together. My Australian Labor Students comrades taught me about inclusion, fairness, equality and what leadership looks like. These are skills that I used in corporate Australia, because empowering others to achieve their full potential is something that we should all be striving to do.This time taught me that unions and bosses dont have to always fight. Often the guild and the universitys goals aligned. Yes, the Vice-Chancellor and I disagreed on some things, but when we worked together we achieved better outcomes. In fact, in a sign of the strength of this relationship, Patrick Gormans Curtin Student Guild ended up naming a bar after Vice-Chancellor Lance Twomey. Despite the dizzying heights Lance had reached in his academic world, he explained that this would have been his dads proudest moment.Following on from this, Im excited about the prospect of businesses, universities, governments, education providers and unions coming together through the Jobs and Skills Australia body. Together, we can solve the wicked problems of our time. Id also like to extend this willingness to collaborate to my colleagues across the floor. Lets imagine Australia in the year 2100 and create a legacy which future generations can be proud of.Steelcap boots on a mine site: thats how I started my career. A resources job is a typical career for those that live in Swan. My boss, Tim McDougall, had faith in me and helped build my foundational skills. I relished the opportunity to work with operators and tradies—though times have changed. My dad is from a generation of tradies who have fewer than 10 fingers; my dad has 9½. Growing up, I remember reports of rockfalls underground. Kids would wonder, Did my dad get hurt or, worse, did he die? The mining industry has worked hard to change the safety culture. This has in part been due to community expectations, union power and a recognition that a safe workforce is a productive workforce. Safety trainers know that they are being effective when work practices are actually being practised at home, not just in the workplace. Another indicator of success is seeing that the least powerful person is empowered to speak up. As a graduate engineer on a construction site, I remember calling out an unsafe practice. The maintenance manager, Suresh Vadnagra, backed me and supported my concerns. At another time, this would not be the norm. This culture shift took decades, and the mining industry still has more work to do, but I have all my fingers, unlike my dad.In all workplaces, everyone has the right to go to work and come home safely. All workers deserve to have a workplace that is free from bullying and sexual harassment. I didnt experience too much sexism on site, but there were some pockets. Others have told me that politics is a blood sport and a Kalgoorlie girl who has made it in mining should be able to hack it in parliament. It should not matter whether your workplace is a bar, a mine site or a parliament. Across Australia, we need to clean up our act. To the brave women and men who participated in the Set the standard review: thank you. Please know that speaking up mattered and will make a difference. I sincerely hope that the pace of cultural change can be fast-tracked. To the 47th parliament: we have a choice to raise the bar and create a new culture. Workplace culture can change. The people of Swan expect this. The people of Australia expect this.Twelve years ago, I landed a dream job working in climate change. My colleagues Brian Innes and Harriet Kater took a punt on me. I combined my interpersonal skills and technical skills to help ASX 200 companies with their decarbonisation journeys. It was an exciting space to work in, but the policy environment was tough during the climate wars.During my career the greatest emissions reductions were achieved when there was a Labor government in power. It was a time when economists, scientists and politicians worked together to solve wicked problems. After a decade of government inaction, some companies investors began to lead the way again. I am proud of the track record in the west. At Goldfields the Agnew mine site meets 85 per cent of its energy needs from wind, solar and battery storage. Companies—such as Wesfarmers, BHP, Rio Tinto and Northern Star—who Ive worked with have committed to net zero emissions. We have FMG investing in future energy with hydrogen.While I am proud of some parts of the resource sector, I must stress that this is not uniform. Smart companies are looking at their climate risks and opportunities over the next three decades. This includes looking at value chains and scope 3 emissions. For us to achieve our goal of well below two degrees of warming, we need all sectors of the economy to pull their weight.Its important that we paint a picture of what our decarbonised future looks like: jobs, jobs and jobs, and not just any jobs—good jobs, secure jobs, jobs that our kids can be proud of, jobs that will exist in the year 2100. Australia is rich in critical minerals that need to be used to build batteries, wind turbines and solar panels. We can rewire the nation and also power Australia for the future. We can become a renewable energy superpower. Australia needs to increase diversification, commercialisation and sophistication of our industry capability. In WA we need to build beyond the resources boom and make our economy more resilient. We can do this by increasing our advanced manufacturing capability. We are a smart country. We have a history of innovation and ingenuity, particularly against the backdrop of harsh remote conditions.We saw disruptions to supply chains with COVID and natural disasters and the war. We need to be able to make things in Australia again. In the west we have the potential to become a battery powerhouse. Now humour the engineer within me. To build a battery it takes six steps: you mine the raw materials, you then process the minerals, you then manufacture the battery cells, you assemble it, you install it and then you maintain it. In Australia were on track to do all of these steps except the manufacturing of cells. This is the value-add step. We can build advanced manufacturing capability. Cathodes and anodes can be built in the west, and once we do this we can look at the full life cycle and recycle components. We can invest in building this capability through our National Reconstruction Fund, and when WA is strong, Australia is strong.Now lets remember what is at stake. Australia has been taking a battering. Weve had parts of Sydney flooded four times in 18 months. Brisbane has experienced multiple catastrophic floods. We had the 2020 Black Summer bushfires. In my home state weve seen fires in Baldivis, Waterloo, the Great Southern and Denmark. With climate change we will see an increase in the frequency and intensity of these events. We cant call these natural disasters anymore. Humankind has had a role to play. These are unnatural disasters.My friend Steven Goldfinch has worked in disaster management for decades. He explained to me that when we look at disasters people often assess devastation in terms of lives lost. Equally important is understanding how long it takes to rebuild the lives of those affected. Many tired Australians are currently living that reality right now. Its clear that were at a stage where both climate adaptation and mitigation are required. But the less we mitigate the more costly it will be for us to adapt.I know that Australian people step up in disasters. We support each other. We show resilience. But, just like an elastic band, we should not stretch them to breaking point.It is critical that we get this transition right and that regional Australia has pathways to secure, well-paid jobs. You see, Ive been the daughter of a fitter and turner who was made redundant after 19 years of loyal service. This was because the nickel price tanked. At 56, my dad was shattered physically and mentally. My dad became the breadwinner of his family at 16 and helped bring up his six brothers and sisters. My dad is a strong man, tough as nails, but losing his job broke my dad. It was worse than losing a finger. This was his identity. I hadnt seen my dad cry until then. Dad would say, Im sorry I have failed you. Dad, you didnt fail me; the system failed us.In the climate action space we talk about stranded assets. These are assets that have been prematurely written off. My dad felt like he had been written off. If we are not careful, we will not only have stranded assets; we will have stranded people too. Investment markets move quickly. I know that firsthand. A disruptive exit out of carbon-intensive industries will hurt Australia, so, yes, I want strong action on climate change, but I also want a just and orderly transition. Im a proud country girl who lives in the city, in the heart of Swan. We can get the transition right for regional and metropolitan Australia. Lets create jobs for the future. Climate action is good for people, the community, the environment and the economy. The triple bottom line is core business. Weve had the climate election. The climate war is over. Climate ambition is back!Now, who would guess that someone like me would be elected as the member for Swan? I stand here as the child of Goan Indian parents, a Kalgoorlie girl, a Swan local, a mum, a lady with an unusual first name and a long surname, a climate change specialist, an engineer. Id like to shout out to the STEM professionals. You have been some of the rock stars of our time—whether that be medical scientists developing vaccines, tech experts helping us stay virtually connected or engineers helping keep the lights on. Evidence based decision-making will help steer our country in the right direction. There is a place for STEM professionals in all decision-making bodies, including our federal parliament. We use systems thinking, love root cause analysis and problem-solving, obsess over efficiencies and have a continuous improvement mindset. I hope to use these skills to unleash the potential of our nation.Swan is rich in diversity. Forty-five per cent of people in Swan were born overseas, and nearly two-thirds of people have one or more parents born overseas. I am proudly Australian with Goan Indian heritage. This is the most multicultural parliament weve had in history. This is what modern Australia looks like—well, almost. This is not the high-water mark. The public have spoken. They want to see a parliament that reflects their community. Multicultural Australia can make a tremendous contribution to our society. Lets think about it: why would someone rip themselves away from their family and friends and move to another country? This lies in boodjar, moort and katitjin, meaning country, family and knowledge: having a beautiful land with a good job to put food on the table and a roof over your head, and having access to universal health care and access to education. To multicultural Australia: you belong here.But we have more work to do, especially for our First Nations people. Those with power and privilege must use that to dismantle casual and institutional racism. Its about a fair go. As Kay Miller, an old family friend, would say: Love, our bloods the same colour on the inside. Implementing the Uluru Statement from the Heart will be an important step to do this. We need voice, treaty and truth telling.Multicultural Australia is a shared story. When my dad came to Australia he came across alone. He worked at Mount Charlotte in Kalgoorlie for a bloke called Bob Martain. When mum and my sister rocked up to Kal, there was nowhere for them to stay. Accommodation was only for single men, not families. Dads boss, Bob, saw the worry in my dads eyes and quizzed him. Dad explained the situation. Bob was like: No worries. They can stay with me and Sally. Not only did this act form a lifelong friendship—their daughter Debbie is my godmother—but this generous act also inextricably tied us to Australia forever. It showed us how belonging and inclusion builds a new home. Its called mateship. The day before the election, I cried with anticipation at the prospect of the Murugappan family being reunited with their Biloela family. This spirit lives strong today.Id like to begin thankyous by acknowledging the former member for Swan, Stephen Irons, including his work with the forgotten Australians and his bipartisan support for the Rudd governments migrant children apology.Success in Swan is not something that I own. Its an achievement thats been carried by hundreds of volunteers and supporters who gave their time and/or money. Together, we knocked on 45,000 doors. We had people of different faiths, genders, sexualities and ages. To all the volunteers, thank you—including Christine Miller, Roslyn Hackshaw, Adam Dusty, Ali Rad, Alison McIntyre, Antoine Girardeau, Anne Sippe, Brendan Jackson, Bridie ONeill, Dani Simatos, Daniel Roden, Diane Mulroy, Francine Allen, Gabrielle Newman, Georgina Wilson, Helen Creed, Jillian Ferguson, John Eaton, Julie Rose, Lewis Chiat, Linda Pickering, Margaret ODonnell, Mitchell Affleck, Rebecca Thompson, Ros Silberstein, Trish Harris and Warwick Boardman. There were a lot of volunteers—and there were more.To my campaign team: you are incredibly talented. Thank you to Sally Talbot, Dennis Liddelow, Darcy Gunning, Klara Andric, Jaime Page, Sam Pirie, Catherine Whitely, Shudia Forgol, Nicki Slevin, Zoe Carter, Tom Wulff, Claudia Bakitch, David Scaife, Brock Oswald, Kirsti Gorringe, Bec Misich, Alannah Clohesey and Phil ODonoghue. You ran a fun, positive and well-coordinated campaign. Also, thanks to my supporters Faz Pollard, Ah Hong Lai, Peter Mann, Raj Selvendra and Daniel Smith.Thanks to my federal colleagues, including Senator Louise Pratt; the member for Perth, Patrick Gorman; and every Labor shadow minister—and now minister—who campaigned for our cause in Swan. Also, thanks to Senator Sue Lines, who has become the first female Labor President of the Senate. Thanks to my state colleagues Cassie Rowe, Geoff Baker, Hannah Beazley, Stephen Price, Bill Johnson, Stephen Dawson, Dr Jags, and Premier Mark McGowan. To our national secretary, Paul Erickson; our former state secretary, Tim Picton; our current state secretary, Ellie Whitaker; Henny Smith; and the WA Labor team—you ran an incredible campaign.Thanks to the union movement, including Steve McCartney, Alex Cassie, the AMWU, Wayne Wood and the ASU, the CPSU, the CFMEU, the HSU, Owen Whittle, and Unions WA.To my mum and dad: you sacrificed everything to come to Australia to give me and my sister Cleta a better life. Thank you for your belief in Australia. To my in-laws, Geoff and Jenny and Aunty Carole and friends: thank you. It takes a village to raise a child, and I love our village. To my husband, Sam: thank you for your unwavering support. Our story is a Swan story. We fell in love at Curtin, we travelled the world and we felt as though wed won the lotto when we landed our home at East Vic Park. You are my rock. Thank you for stepping up and being a fantastic lead parent. Lead parenting is harder than being an MP. To my children, Lincoln and Felicity: I want you to know that I love you so much and that saying yes to becoming a FIFO mum was really hard, but I want a better future for all Australians and for all children, including you. I hope to make you proud. I hope to make the people of Swan proud. To Prime Minister Anthony Albanese: thank you for bringing us together and being a prime minister that I, my children and my electorate can believe in. Finally, to the people of Swan: thank you for putting your trust in me and Labor. I am so humbled and honoured. We will build a fair, just, prosperous nation on a livable planet. This government will be the spark that leaves the light on for the whole of Australia. We will make tomorrow better.","Address-in-Reply","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms MASCARENHAS (Swan) ","(18:36):"

96,0,0,0,1,1,"Violi, Aaron MP",300147,"Casey","LP","N/A",54," There is no greater honour, privilege or responsibility than representing your community and your familys home in federal parliament. Casey has been my familys home since 1953, when Antonino and Grazia Violi and their six children travelled halfway around the world, leaving behind their family and the safety of the known in search of a better life in Australia. They settled in the small country town of Silvan and established a farm to support their family. I often reflect on my grandparents story and try to imagine the courage and sacrifice it would have taken to make that journey and the hardships that they endured. It is a perspective that inspires me when I face challenges and reminds me not only to be grateful for my life but of the responsibility that I have to improve the lives of future generations—for my children, Lewis and Georgie, and now for Casey and the nation.I do not believe Nonno and Nonna could have imagined a world in which their grandson would be the federal member of parliament representing their new home. It is an example of the extraordinary democracy we have in Australia that anyone, regardless of background, can become a member of parliament. My familys stories have shaped the person that I am today and the deep love and connection that I have to the seat of Casey. I have been blessed to grow up in Yarra Glen and buy our family home in Lilydale, surrounded by a community that supported me.When my parents separated, money was tight. While, financially, we went without, we were not short of love and support from our extended family and community. I still remember fondly receiving Sunday afternoon bread donations organised through our local church and the anticipation of whether that delivery would include sweet rolls. When they did, I do not think that a treat has ever tasted better. Spending time during the campaign packing hampers with local charity the Philanthropic Collective served as a potent reminder of the responsibility I hold now as the member for Casey to support our local charity and community organisations who support those in need.Being a teenager is challenging at the best of times. Navigating my parents divorce and a challenging financial situation left me carrying wounds that took me years to realise I had and to heal. Looking back, I do not know where I would be today if not for the safe place I found through sport at the Healesville Cricket Club and the Mooroolbark Soccer Club. They were my refuge, where I could feel secure and find myself. In many of the communities of Casey, our sporting clubs are the heart of the town, providing a safe place and refuge for young men and women. It has been heartwarming to visit so many clubs, to see that strong community spirit and to have clubs actively driving mental health and wellness programs within their membership. There are too many stories to share here in this place about the amazing and special communities of Casey. It is these experiences that drive me every day to make sure I am a strong voice working for our community. Serving our community is the heart of my responsibility as an MP, and it is a responsibility I will hold in the esteem it deserves.If sport was my sanctuary, then education was the foundation to create a life for myself and my family. I was fortunate that Mum sacrificed so I could receive a great education at Mount Lilydale Mercy College. That education provided me with the opportunity to study at university and was the pathway to starting my career at Yarra Valley Snack Foods. That experience underpins my belief that the crucial element in order to lift people out of poverty and build a better life for themselves and their communities is a strong education system—a system focused on delivering tangible education outcomes for students to set them up for long-term success and to provide parents with choice in their childrens education. Over the last 20 years, governments have invested billions in education, with results going backwards. This is unacceptable, not only on a societal level but, most importantly, at the individual level. A robust education system focused on educational outcomes and opportunities is the foundation of our society and of the individual. It needs to be the priority of government policy on education.My primary responsibility in this House is to make sure we are making the right decisions for the future so that the communities of Casey and the nation continue to thrive and support each other. My belief, born out of my lived experience, is that a strong economy underpins a strong society. With both these elements, anything is possible. A secure economy is not just about delivering a balanced budget or economic growth—although these things are very important. It is also about creating safety and opportunity for all. It allows governments to invest in the services that support Australians: child care, health, education, defence, aged care and many other needs for the betterment and protection of society. A secure economy will play a vital role in our journey to net zero, and we must protect societys most vulnerable by ensuring that our energy system is secure, reliable and affordable.To sustainably deliver these programs, we need to acknowledge that the economy faces significant structural fiscal challenges that we cannot, as leaders, pass on to future generations. We need to undertake genuine, comprehensive and systematic reviews of both our tax system and our federation. These reviews need to ensure that we are driving efficiency in our spending and government responsibilities while minimising the tax burden on Australians. These reviews cannot rule anything out before they start. They will need to form the basis of a national conversation on our direction as a country and how we tackle the challenges we face.There are moments in your life that define the person you become. For me, that moment was 7 February 2009, Black Saturday. It was the moment I went from being a carefree young man, living as if I would live forever, to understanding that the most precious gifts we have are life and time. The difference between Rachel and me being here today and being victims 174 and 175 was a matter of seconds and metres. Our story of Black Saturday is a story thousands of people who survived that day would understand. Why did we survive and not others? Words cannot do justice to how your view of the world changes when at 24 you stare death in the face and believe your life is over. You realise what is important: time with our loved ones, time to make a difference, time to make an impact. By putting my hand up to serve the communities of Casey and the nation, I am trading time with my loved ones. This knowledge drives me every day in this role to take the tough decisions required to ensure that as a nation and in Casey we prosper, now and into the future.At this point, I want to acknowledge and thank the most important people in my life: my wife, Rachel, and my children, Lewis and Georgie. Rachel, I know I would not be here today without you. You are the love of my life and my best friend. Your kind heart and care for others never cease to amaze me. You inspire me to be better every day. Thank you for supporting me to chase this dream. I couldnt do this journey called life without you. Lewis and Georgie, I love you both more than you can know. I will carry you both, and your generation, in this House to ensure that we make the right decisions to allow you and your generation to flourish and chase the Australian dream like so many generations before you.From one of the darkest days in our community came anguish, despair and heartache. It created wounds that have never healed and will never heal. However, from this darkness rose a community spirit of love and generosity that is often found at the fabric of our nation. Not only locals but the entire country rallied around our communities in Casey and Victoria impacted by the fires. I had the privilege of being part of this community spirit as we rallied to support each other in the days, months and years afterwards. This community spirit was called upon again in June 2021 when storms devastated the Dandenongs and large parts of Casey. While we were fortunate that no lives were lost, the storms destroyed many homes that have still not been rebuilt, and they left residents without power and communications for weeks and months. The recovery from the storms continues, and I stand with our community as we rebuild.In Casey, we need to make sure that we are doing everything we can to be prepared for these disasters when they come again. We have started this process through our partnership with Yarra Ranges Council to deliver the resilience project. However, we can and must do more. This includes communications resilience—so vital in an emergency and in everyday living. In the 21st century, reliable communications are an essential service and must be treated as such. As we undergo a digital revolution, new technologies such as satellite communications open up the possibility that every Australian, regardless of location, can access phone and internet. We must invest in technology to provide reliable access, for the safety of our citizens. A working phone line can be the difference between life and death.Investment in satellite technology for regional and rural communities can also play a vital role in delivering productivity gains to the economy as the digital economy continues to grow and flourish. Having worked for the last three years in the digital economy, I understand the exciting opportunities that can be unlocked as we continue to embrace new technology. The digital economy creates new industries and jobs in its own right. But the true benefit of our transformation is the productivity gains that flow for all industries in the economy. It will allow tradies to more efficiently quote and invoice work. It will allow a farmer to monitor their crops with drones. These technologies not only unlock productivity growth but enable workers and small-business owners to chase their dream and, importantly, spend more time with their families.While there are exciting opportunities as we transform into a digital economy, it creates significant risk for us as a nation—a risk that lawmakers have an obligation to mitigate through investing in our cybersecurity capabilities. This will be a challenge for all of government, as the pace of change in technology is not in sync with traditional government decision-making. We need to be agile and flexible.Having spent my career working in and with small business, I want to provide a voice in this place for small business. They truly are the engine room of the economy. Small business makes up 97 per cent of all businesses in Australia and employs 4.7 million people. Every large business was once a small business driving innovation, creating new products, unlocking new markets and new jobs. Small business creates opportunity and freedom for those prepared to risk their financial security to chase a dream.We must acknowledge and recognise that big business will naturally support regulation and red tape which stifles small business, to the detriment of competition. As a Liberal I instinctively support free markets and the benefits they bring to the economy and the nation. However, we must acknowledge the risk of dominant players in a market, which is detrimental to all Australians. For Australia to continue to prosper as a nation, we need to ensure our legislation supports the growth of small businesses and the digital economy.The reality is that I would not be standing here today without the support of so many people. Mum, one of my biggest regrets in life is that, until I became a father, I did not appreciate what you did for us. Thank you for your strength over so many years. I love you. I also thank my stepdad, Gordon, for the support youve provided to mum and to our family over so many years. I thank and acknowledge my brothers and sisters James, Emile, Michaela and Matthew, and their partners, and my stepbrothers and stepsisters David, Sarah and Jess, and their partners.

I also acknowledge my friend and mentor who is no longer with us, Fiona Ogilvey ODonnell.Ive been fortunate as a lifelong resident of Casey and a volunteer with the Liberal Party to have a great example to follow in my friend and predecessor, Tony Smith. Not only does Tony leave behind an incredible legacy as the member for Casey but his time as Speaker is also a towering example of the integrity required and expected of a member of parliament. The example set by Tony both in Casey and in this House is one I am proud to follow and determined to match. To the Casey FEC, led by my campaign chair, Alister Osborn, thank you for trusting me to represent you and for supporting me during the campaign. I thank Bryan and Maria McCarthy, also from the campaign team, for their support not only during the campaign but also in all my time in the Liberal Party—Im so glad youre here today. To Ben Zerbe, Paul Molluso, Michael McKinell, Gareth Ward, Florence Lindhouse, Tom Sterium and Rocky Pitasi, thank you for your support during the campaign. I give thanks to my state colleagues Catherine Burnett Wake; Bridget Vallence and her husband, Ben; Cindy McLeish; and David Hodgett. I also thank my friends Frank Greenstein, Holly Byrne, Sean Armistead, Nick Thodos, Senator Jane Hume, Senator James Paterson and Josh Frydenberg for their support.Thank you to my colleagues for the warm welcome, and to those ministers at the time who came and supported me during the campaign. To my friends and new Victorian colleagues Zoe McKenzie and Keith Wolahan, it is a unique journey stepping into the shoes of such well respected and long-serving Liberal members, as we did. I was honoured to be able to share the campaign with you both, and I look forward to our next chapter in this House together.As a nation, we face significant challenges, but what nation throughout history has not? As a nation, we like all nations have significant opportunities. The question for us is: will we let circumstances define our future or will we define our future? When my time representing the people of Casey ends I hope to be remembered as a member who stayed connected to and delivered for his community, someone who recognised the central challenges we have as a nation and who played a constructive role in solving them for current and future generations. I want to be a member who pursues his convictions without wavering while adjusting course when circumstances dictate. I want to be a leader who trusts individuals to make choices in their own lives. I want to be a member who upholds the dignity and honour of the role I am so privileged to hold.Mr Speaker and members of the House, I thank you for your indulgence. In finishing, I take the instructions of Roman Emperor and stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius, who 2,000 years ago confided to his personal diary: Waste no more time talking about what a good politician should do.

101,0,0,0,1,1,"Daniel, Zoe MP","008CH","Goldstein","IND","N/A",57," I thank the House for the opportunity to make this speech on the first day of our 47th Parliament, and I thank the people of Goldstein. I thank those in our community who lifted me up. Without you I wouldnt be standing here.I want to acknowledge our First Peoples and pay my respects to the Ngunnawal and Ngambri peoples, the traditional owners of the land on which we meet, and to the Boonwurrung people of the Kulin nation, on whose unceded lands Goldstein sits.In this, my first speech to the parliament, I want to state my support, after consultation with the Boonwurrung people, for a First Nations voice in the Constitution. The voice for the First Peoples will create a direct line of communication to and with this parliament and is a crucial step towards self-determination. I am hopeful and honoured to be able to contribute to the establishment of a voice for the First Peoples, a legacy that this parliament can build.Yet there is more that we must do. The legacy of the 47th Parliament must include climate action for the long-term future of our country, greater integrity, safety and empowerment for women and girls. These are the concerns of our nation. A few days ago one of these concerns was brought into sharp focus with the release of the State of the environment report. Our country is burning and flooding. Our water is polluting, our trees dwindling. Our very earth is wasting away. But the report gives us a path back which includes First Nations people, the first guardians of country. Its time to act.My job now will be to hold the government to account for dramatically improved climate policy and targets, backed by the best science that we have—a timely, planned and just transition to renewable energy. The governments carbon emission target, 43 per cent by 2030, must be enshrined in law as a floor, not a ceiling. We must have clear mechanisms to keep all of us, each of us, accountable to achieving net zero by 2050, if not before. Even 2040 would not be a moment too soon. This will give certainty to business and, if we are swift and purposeful, will help keep the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees.I would say that I appreciate the good faith the government has demonstrated to date in making changes to improve the legislation. So far, so good. This kind of collaboration is what the Goldstein community wants, and its one of the fundamental reasons that I stand here in this parliament.The State of the environment report tells us we must not delay. The facts are before us. Ending the climate wars requires courage and ambition beyond politics. Deception, fear and division must end. We have an opportunity in this parliament to go forward and to go forward together.I stand here today because of the life Ive led so far and the impact of my experiences, the things Ive seen, the people Ive met, the stories Ive heard and told, and a desire to contribute. The release last week of the State of the environment report made it clear to me, and I know for all of us, that we must act urgently and effectively to save our lands and our planet.I grew up in Tassie, but I was born in Essendon. Unlike the member for Casey, Im an Essendon supporter, thanks to dad, who played for the Bombers at the time. My father, also a teacher, instilled in me a deep ethical framework and competitive determination befitting a footballers kid. My mother, a hairdresser and then a social worker—who supported women escaping domestic violence and later worked in Indigenous communities and in the Middle East—gave me empathy and, I think, strength in adversity.My fathers experiences as a state Labor candidate in Tasmania put me off party politics for life—sorry! It was a murky mess of factionalism and dark political tactics—casting no aspersions! Just as my mother taught me to listen and to feel, my father has always pushed me to push myself and to strive to have impact. Im here from our community, but also because of my family—Rowan, my husband, and our children, Arkie and Pearl—who, when we talked as a family about me standing for election, said: You have to do something for us, Mum. Someone has to do something for us. Rowan, initially not keen because politics can be a nasty business, especially for women, has been so inspired by the community around us and the movement that we all created together. Like his own work in international development, it was a community working together for good. So many Australians do that—volunteering at the surf lifesaving club, running the canteen at the local school, reading in classrooms, coaching junior sport, cooking the barbecue at Bunnings, those who dropped off food packs to strangers during our many Melbourne lockdowns, and the people who share their houses after floods and fires. Our parliament can and should reflect that sense of community and the concerns of our communities across our diverse nation.In late 2013 I landed, on a military cargo plane, in the devastated Tacloban City after the superstorm Typhoon Haiyan had swept across the central Philippines. As a journalist and foreign correspondent, I have seen all manner of climate related disasters. Nothing before or since compares to those scenes in Tacloban, flattened by a storm surge that destroyed 90 per cent of the city—bodies in the streets, cars in trees, giant boats atop buildings and, amid the rubble, the shattered lives of residents. This event was a turning point for me, a realisation of the impact climate change, and its increasingly unmanageable weather events, would have on communities.It is not the only reference point. I have waded through floods in northern New South Wales, Thailand and elsewhere in South-East Asia; seen the melting permafrost in the arctic and the animals and people scrabbling for survival as the environment morphs right under their feet; and reported on the aftermath of cyclones in the Pacific, hurricanes in the US, bushfires in Australia and California.In late 2019 I met former Australian fire chief Greg Mullins on the fireground amid bushfires in California. He and others had spent months making calls and writing letters trying to get a meeting with the former government to warn them to prepare for a black summer ahead. They were ignored. During that summer of 2019-20, like all Australians, I watched horrified as those predicted fires came, changing communities forever, killing and displacing billions of animals and burning through our precious landscape. Enough waiting. Enough obfuscating. The impacts of these floods, fires and storms have become too much, too frequent to continue to do too little.I especially want to thank my family for supporting me as I stand here today wanting to do more. Rowan, Arkie and Pearl, the three of you know better than anyone that I am innately an introvert—happiest just pottering in the garden or having a quiet swim in the ocean and being with my family—but you also know why we must do this together. Its because its time to be fierce and to be brave, to represent community, to make hard decisions, yet to lead with optimism. Be the change you want to see—thats what we tell our children. Remember, Arkie, when Donald Trump pulled out of the Paris Agreement in 2017? You said to me: No one is doing anything. Itll be too late. Why isnt anyone doing anything? As a parent, it was a helpless moment. I remember saying, I cant do anything about that. Well, now is my chance.Its our chance to do something about climate, about transforming our economy amid a huge opportunity—a renewables revolution—and about restoring public trust in leadership. Its about grasping this opportunity that a pandemic delivered us. The pandemic has had and continues to have so many terrible impacts, but its also reminded us what community is about and what we can achieve when we come together.This is what the people of Goldstein have realised, and thats why our community has propelled an Independent candidate into this House. A movement mobilised to put me in this seat in this place—a movement that wants reasoned discussion and collaboration to solve the big challenges of our time.An honourable member: Hear, hear!","Address-in-Reply","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms DANIEL (Goldstein) ","(19:25):"

Weve been put in these seats for similar reasons by people who want honesty, sincerity and guts from their representatives.Back in the days before I was a foreign correspondent, I was a rural journalist and a presenter of The Country Hour on the ABC. The ABC, by the way, is a critical service that connects Australians in good times and in crises and must be funded to reflect its value to communities across the nation—as a teller of Australian stories, as a connection between us and the world and as an emergency broadcaster. I grew up as a horsey kid in Tassie, so being a rural reporter stomping around on farms was a natural fit for me.That was when I met the energetic whirlwind Cathy McGowan. She was involved with Australian Women in Agriculture, and we met on a study trip to the US that ended with a major conference in Washington, DC. I was in my mid-20s, and it was my first trip overseas. Years later, after several foreign postings, when I returned from four years in Washington covering the Trump presidency, Cathy sent me a note: I think youd make a great MP. In Cathys first speech in 2013, she introduced this place to Voices for Indi and to the power of a rural community to reinvent itself. Those were her exact words. Now its urban Goldsteins time for reinvention through its own Voices movement.For more than 100 years, Balaclava, now the electorate of Goldstein, had voted for men from the conservative side of politics, but in 2022 Goldstein found its Independent voice—a woman, at that! Youll note that Im not wearing teal tonight. Purple and white were the colours worn by suffragists like Vida Goldstein, after whom Goldstein is named. Vida was a peace advocate, an activist, a politician and—as owner and editor of Womans Sphere—a journalist, like myself. She was the first woman in the Western world to stand for a national parliament. Vida Goldstein also rejected party politics. I ask you to vote for me because Im not a member of a political party, she told voters early last century. She said:Study has convinced me that party government is a system that is entirely out of date … It is a cumbersome, unbusinesslike method of running the country …Vida, unfortunately, made five unsuccessful attempts to get elected to the House and the Senate, and it took Australia 40 years from Federation to elect—finally—a woman to federal parliament. In this, our 47th Parliament, women make up about 40 per cent, the highest proportion on record. That includes 19 first-term MPs. I am one, as the new member for Goldstein, in Vidas name.Id like to take a moment to recognise Tim Wilson, my predecessor, for his six years of service to our community, which threads through bayside Melbourne from Elsternwick to Beaumaris and inland into Cheltenham, Bentleigh, Highett, Gardenvale, Ormond, McKinnon, Glen Huntly and Caulfield South. Our community is diverse, culturally and religiously varied, established, and highly educated in parts, with green parks, a blue bay, old and young using our magic bush trails, all kinds of footy, netball, cricket and cyclists—a lot of lycra!But were not a community devoid of problems. Goldstein has housing stress and homelessness, small businesses struggling to recover from the pandemic, people struggling to navigate aged care and the NDIS, and serious youth mental health issues. Yet, its a place where youll find the Chatty Cafe Scheme, which brings people together to simply have a sandwich and a cup of tea and talk. Youll find lifesaving clubs and bay swimmers, from Brighton to Black Rock to Beaumaris, who choose to swim in the freezing waters of Bayside Melbourne, even on dark winter mornings, for health and connection. Youll find a group of people looking to secure hope for the future.The very first member for Goldstein, Ian Macphee, a longstanding member of the Liberal Party, generously endorsed me during my campaign. In his own first speech, Ian Macphee said he would:… endeavour to serve all constituents to the best of my ability and to make here a contribution to national policy formation.At the time, he said:It seems to be a fact of life that parliamentarians, the principal lawmakers, are not held in high regard by those whom they serve.… … …I anticipate that during my political life expectancy in this Parliament, the Parliaments greatest problem may well be to raise its own standing in the eyes of the community …Were still not there. In fact, I would contend that the situation has worsened since Ian framed that speech. But its also my goal—and the goal of all of us in this parliament, I believe—to behave and to deliver in a way that makes our nation proud.Along with my deep concerns about the lack of action on climate sit my observations about the fragmentation of truth and trust, and the danger that poses to our democracy and the future of our communities and our children. Authoritarianism, populism, disinformation and vast conspiracy theories have flourished in recent years in a volatile world. Social media has been used by Donald Trump and others like him to sow doubt on the integrity of elections. As weve heard in the evidence about the shocking events of 6 January 2021, those who stormed the US Capitol thought they were protecting democracy. Instead, they were deceived and manipulated.Without trust in policy and leadership, without integrity and good governance, we cannot function as a society. When facts become just a matter of opinion, we have a problem. It is our responsibility in this parliament to rebuild that trust. I would suggest that my former colleagues in the press could also reflect on their own behaviour.To be honest, I had little interest in becoming a politician. After years of covering politics, I knew what it was. When my old university friend Angela Pippos called me last year and said, Are you sitting down? and asked if I would be interested in running for parliament with the support of community group Voices of Goldstein, my first response was, No way! Yet here I am. I thank the Voices of Goldstein for their trust.I didnt take the regular pathway to politics. I have never signed up to a party or a particular ideology. When youve spent your life as a journalist, you create distance from the parties, and Ive always been a swinging voter. Ive spent much of my career so far talking to people with very different political views to mine. Ive learnt to consider how people are affected very differently by events and circumstances. While over the years Ive voted according to leadership, ethos and policies, it was only when the idea of running as an Independent was presented to me as a realistic option that I thought, This is a way of actually stepping in, stepping up to the table and having an impact, without having to pick a side.This community crossbench, I believe, is ready to work with government to make change. Our communities said this is what matters: climate, integrity, gender equality, and safety for women and girls. Theres more: fixing health care, aged care and the NDIS; humane refugee policies; tax reform; and affordable housing. We must return to collaborative politics to make these changes, and it must happen now, because, while all of our futures are at stake, its our young people who will pay the price for continued inaction, continued self-interest and the continued absence of vision.To our young people, our kids, our babies: Im sorry. Im sorry that your generation is going to pay the price for the failure of those who have come before you, for failing to make the government take the action we need to futureproof our nation and the globe from the devastating impact of climate change on your lives and those of your children. I know that, when you see things like the latest, shocking State of the environment report, you ask, Why arent we reacting? Whos going to make the hard decisions?With all of this in mind, I step into this place, into the room where it happens, with determination but also with optimism, with the opportunity to look forward to what we can achieve. Australia has a chance to lead and to take our place in the world as a nation of innovation. In doing so, we must implement an effective integrity system: an anticorruption commission, transparency of political donations and ministerial diaries, whistleblower protection and truth in political advertising.And we must hold the government to account on the safety and economic empowerment of women and girls. We must value the care economy to revalue the contribution that women make. Let us shift the focus from hard infrastructure, like roads and bridges, to hospitals and schools and give women and girls their best opportunity to participate in the economy, taking into account their multiple competing priorities. Higher productivity is critical and timely. Universal, cheap and flexible child care is central to this to cater for women working fragmented shifts.Independents have a special place in this parliament. Unfettered by party lines, we can and will speak up. We have a special role in our communities as listeners and then as a direct voice in this place. If we as leaders dont listen, learn and carry our communities forward with us, we will see more people vulnerable to disinformation, to conspiracy. We must provide policy, stability, hope, and a road map to follow.During my campaign I borrowed a phrase, its origins with the Jewish elder Hillel, later adapted by JFK: If not us, who? If not now, when? Our when is now. It starts today. Its time to act. Thank you, Goldstein, for your trust, and I ask you and all Australians to hold me to account.","Address-in-Reply","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[18]","N/A","N/A"
