But I think it is clear to all of us that the war has pursued a course this year which must cause increased disquiet on the part of members of this Parliament and the people of this country. No one can gather any great amount of satisfaction from the march of events this year. The fact is that our forces have been compelled to retire from position after position until we are faced with conditions in several theatres of war which makes it extremely difficult for the British Commonwealth of Nations to marshal its maximum capacity. That applies to both men and equipment. The battle of Britain and the battle of the Atlantic can be taken as one and the same, in that, by and large, the same forces are deployed, and the same general situation has to be faced.","Prime Ministers Mission Abroad - Ministerial Statement","INTERNATIONAL SITUATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[39]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Mediterranean is no longer a highway of commerce between Australia and the Old World. It seems to me, therefore, that this is a time for the taking of definite steps to meet thesituation rather than for the making of long speeches about how things should be done. Our reverses in the Mediterranean have affected our capacity to maintain our forces there, and therefore to defend the Suez Canal, to mention only one aspect of the battle. Our capacity cannot be measured simply by the amount of equipment that we can get to our land forces. However efficiently our infantry may be equipped, and however well we succeed in furnishing supplies to our armed forces, the plain truth is that if any of our forces on land or sea are not as strongly supported in the air as are the forces, of the enemy, then our capacity on land and sea will not be sufficient to enableus to prevail. It is incontestable that it was the air power of the enemy which drove us out ofGreece; and from all that happened in Crete the cardinal fact emerged that the German air power opposed to us was far stronger than the air power that we could employ against it, with the result that we were driven out with very grievous losses. That brings me, as it must bring all Australians, to the conviction that the retention of what we now hold in North Africa, in Palestine, and in Syria, will largely be governed by the capacity of Great Britain and ourselves to provide fighting planes of the requisite types and the required number, in order to ensure that the forces now fighting there shall have adequate air support. Upon this matter, I feel that I can speak with a certain degree of justification, for there are sitting opposite to me to-day honorable members who, three years ago, derided the possibility of air power being a decisive factor in- any world struggle.","Prime Ministers Mission Abroad - Ministerial Statement","INTERNATIONAL SITUATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[39]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It amounts to this : Our capacity to survive will be determined, not by weakening our sea defences or by lessening the strength of our land forces, but by making certain that whatever be our capacity on land or sea, we- shall have added to it the maximum force that we can provide in the air; because the absence of a maximum air power must spell defeat for our land or sea forces.","Prime Ministers Mission Abroad - Ministerial Statement","INTERNATIONAL SITUATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[39]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

108,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CURTIN, John","009FQ","N/A","N/A","N/A",108,"- Without attempting to argue with the honorable gentleman, I say that the strength of the British navy and the land forces engaged was not sufficient to defend either France or Belgium. I cite the British Prime Minister, who, dealing with what was achieved by the Royal Air Force in the defence of Britain, said that never was so much owed by so many to so few; which made it plain that had it not been for the strength and valour of the Royal Air Force last September, the battle for Britain might already have been lost. I do not say that it would have been; but at least I make clear to the country my opinion, that the maximum air power we can requisition in order to back up land and sea forces is indispensable to the fully equipped defence of this country, or to the full mobilization of our effort for the prosecution of the war. I therefore welcome the intention of the Prime Minister to appoint a Minister for Aircraft Production. I am also ready to accept whatever is considered requisite rationing of the consumption of petrol in Australia. I say that quite frankly. I know that great disability will be caused ; but I am not content, at this stage of the war, to allow the petrol stored in this country to be continually drained away while alternative  transportation systems are available. There could be a very considerable increase of the utilization of State and other instrumentalities, particularly in respect of heavy traffic. Whatever dislocation may he caused by this rationing, it will be far safer to take the risk of such dislocation rather than to run the risk of having aircraft produced and have no petrol with which to fly them. It is also essential to take that risk in order to meet an increased mechanization of our army. Obviously, speed is of the essence of strength in modern warfare. Therefore, for the defence of Australia our army must be mechanized. But it would be useless to undertake the mechanization of our army if, at the point at which it had to move because the country was assailed, it were found that, because we had refused to take the risk of economic disturbance, we had not built up such storage as would enable us to have supplies of petrol when they were needed. I know that statements of hills sort may not be popular; hut they must be made. We need aircraft of. every description, not only in Australia but also to provide air support for our fighting forces in the Middle East. I suppose that that will require some consideration by the Imperial Government, in conjunction with the general question of the provision of equipment for its armies and its other forces in the different theatres of the world. I say with .great respect to the Prime Minister of England, if my words should ever reach him, that if a crucial battle is to be fought in the Middle East, Australia cannot afford that battle to go against it in circumstances that precluded the subsequent movement of the British Fleet into the Indian Ocean or the Atlantic Ocean; for if it were a  last ditch  battle, in which Alexandria was destroyed and the fleet in the Middle East was, in substance, put out of action, such a state of affairs would involve almost immediately the uselessness of Singapore as a bastion for the defence of Australia; instead of being a bastion for Australia, it would become merely a service station for an enemy. Therefore, T can accept the dictum that the battle in the Middle East is of crucial importance to Great Britain and to Australia. But those who put forward that contention have to accept the logic of it. In no circumstances must they take such risks that an overwhelming defeat in the Middle East would involve synchronously the loss of Singapore and inability to salvage the Mediterranean fleet into the Indian Ocean or the Atlantic Ocean. It must be clear that the major defeat we would suffer in that theatre, if we did not supply the maximum of air power, would present to our enemies opportunities of which we are convinced, on statements that have been made to us, and on our general consideration of the situation, full advantage would be taken. This most certainly involves consideration of the general problem of Australia; for, just as it is properly stated that, as things now stand, the Middle East and Singapore can be regarded as outer bastions of Australia, so must it be recognized in this country that no nation completely denudes its last line of defence, which is its own territory, in order to resist the enemy at an outpost. Both Chamberlain and Churchill have stated from time to time, that battles may be lost, and defeat may be suffered, in different places, but so long as that does not happen at certain other focal points, we are still able to carry on. I agree with that, and accept it. But I say that the obligation of Australia is to remember that it and New Zealand have primarily, in the Pacific and Indian oceans, a responsibility which can be said to correspond to that which Great Britain and the United States of America have in the Atlantic Ocean. Whilst I agree that this country should make provision to ensure that all the places round about us are garrisoned and equipped, none the less there must be some understanding of what represents the balance as between what we can do in those theatres and what we are called upon to do in Australia. The broadcast speech of the Prime Minister last night, linked with the declaration that the right honorable gentleman made in this House when he returned from abroad, has told us, if we needed telling, that this war is one of machines and equipment. There is no argument in respect of man-power. Whenever we let our thoughts dwell on what has occurred, we feel that we owe more than can ever be stated in words to the men who have joined the various forces. There will never come a time when this country will have any reason to do other than express the utmost pride in its manhood. Therefore, it is a question not alone of man-power for the forces, but also of the means whereby our forces may be put to the best possible use. For a thousand reasons, we cannot obtain equipment from distant parts of the world. We have to turn Australia into an arsenal, capable of producing the whole of the equipment that we need. I am not revealing a secret when I say that we also have to produce a good deal of the equipment that is needed in the Middle East, in India, for our forces in the northern parts of Australia, and for our sister dominion of New Zealand. When all is said and done, that obligation necessitates re-adjustment hot only of our economic life, but also of all the ordinary avocations of our men and women. The matter has to be worked out, on its merits. That, doubtless, will involve considerable curtailment of civil production; and I accept the view that if it is to be worked satisfactorily, there must be some rationing of civil consumption. I say to thePrime Minister and to the Government, that we must have some measurement of what is proposed in the way of production, and the demands that that will make upon our skilled and unskilled workers and those others of our labour force who are capable of being trained. There will have to be some estimate of all that that means in the use of our man-power. That will have to be measured by what the Government regards as the requirement of men for service in distant theatres. It is well known, of course, that the party which I lead has always held the view that in a war of this description Australia would have to become increasingly self-reliant. It is also well known that, associated with that conception of the inevitability of our position, there necessarily comes a consideration of the extent to which Australia can make its manhood avail- able for service in distant theatre? There must be some assessment of the balance between the manhood required for production in Australia, and for defence within Australia, and the number of men we can use for service overseas. I know that the Government is committed to the voluntary principle of enlistment with regard to the expeditionary forces, and I accept that, but there is apparently a struggle for men going on now between the Air Force and the Army. They are viewing with each other to induce men to join. I realize that voluntary enlistment involves the making of appeals, but we have now to consider the appeals by both the Army and the Air Force in the light of the stupendous industrial and economic programme explicit in the speech by the Prime Minister last night, and the general outline given in his speech of three weeks ago. This involves the tremendous utilization of the manhood of Australia for war industries, the transfer of many men from the production of goods for civil use, and probably the displacement of men by women. These are practical problems that have to be solved. The added responsibility is imposed on the Government of seeing that wherever our men are called upon to fight, it receives, in co-operation with the British Government, the assurance that our men will fight as nearly as possible on terms ofequality, as far as equipment and air support arc concerned, with the forces against which they have to contend. A certain amount of thinking is going on throughout Australia in respect of what are now known to be the reasons why we were driven out of Greece and Crete. It is only reasonable to say that the Government of this country, and I hope also the Government of the United Kingdom, will have regard to what I believe to be the undoubted public feeling on this matter. I shall not attempt to put it into words. It is not. my business to say more than that, now our men are fighting in Libya and Syria, the obligation rests on the Governments of all the forces engaged on our side in those theatres to ensure that the only limitation which will affect theprovision of the necessary equipment - and I refer particularly to air support - is that of the means of getting it there. There ought, to be no other limitation. I know that that involves risks. It may involve taking so many planes from the defence of Great Britain, but it involves risks for Australia also, for we are engaged in a very large production of munitions and the like for war purposes, and a great part of that equipment is being despatched from Australia. I agree with that, for all of the risks in this war ought to be commonly shared. I would not accept for a moment the view that the whole of the munitions produced in Australia should be kept in this country, but I do say that the programme now unfolded before us involves so tremendous a transformation of our whole position as a nation that we have to ask ourselves what is the extent of the force that Australia can use outside this country, having regard to the inevitable obligation upon us to become the arsenal for the supply of ourselves, of India, of Malaya and of New Zealand. For, bear in mind, we have as close a relationship to the safety of New Zealand as Great Britain has to that of countries that are quite close to its shores. Just as the danger to Great Britain became overwhelmingly greater when France and Belgium fell, so, in the event of Australia being in doubt as to the capacity of New Zealand to hold out, the dangers to ourselves must increase at once. Since we have appointed a. HighCommissioner to Canada and a Minister to the United States of America, and have now agreed to send one to China, I think that there should immediately he an exchange of high commissioners between the Dominion of New Zealand and the Commonwealth, for I cannot disguise the fact that these two dominions have a very great responsibility, and having regard to what may but I hope will not happen, they will also face a common peril in the event of the war going increasingly against us.There are a few other things which I feel disposed to say at this stage. The first is that in this general plan in which the greater part of the disciplinary incidence will inevitably fall on the workers, because it is they who are to be transferred from job to job and will be called upon to go without some of the things that ordinarily they might be able to get, the machinery whereby that is done should admit of the greatest amount of consultation, agreement and concert. I believe that the trade unions of Australia will respond with cheerfulness to the proposals which the Government will make to them when its plans are put into definite shape. General statements made by me about labour being willing to do this have to be translated into practice. It is not sufficient for me to say that the Labour movement of Australia will do its best to carry these things through. I do make that statement, hut at best it is a generalization. Ways and means must be devised whereby labour and industry can be brought in to play their part. The details whereby a transfer can be made from civil to war production can. then be worked out, not only more amicably, but also more effectively, than if done without concert or collaboration. The decision of the Government to expand the trade-union panel to make it more generally representative should be welcome, but the Department of Labour itself will have a full-sized job to deal with what the Minister for Labour and National Service will recognize as inevitably involving the consideration of a great number of small matters and also many major problems as they arise from time to time.With respect to the vexed question of the rights and obligations of labour in war time, I think that the Prime Minister last night might have re-phrased a part of his speech, lt is not true that the tradeunion movement of Australia has had any association with the hold-up of war production. It is true that, here and there, grievances have been expressed and stop work meetings have been held. There have actually been strikes- which have, perhaps, been of longer duration that one would have welcomed, but which, compared with strikes generally, have been settled much earlier than would have normally been the case. The Government did well when it accepted the advice of the Advisory War Council and devised conciliation machinery in order to assist in solving this problem, and I consider that it might have given that machinery a little longer experience, and perhaps a wider elaboration, before the Prime Minister stated that it was intended to prohibit strikes. There will be some confusion as to what is meant by a strike. Some organizations have very properly laid it down that a strike associated with a log, ultimatum or demand should hot take place without holding a full meeting of the members of the union concerned. As the result of a great deal of overtime being worked, the only practical way in which many unions can secure a meeting that will he representative of all. of their members, and not a meeting packed by a few who are eager to get a certain decision, is by holding what is called a stop-work meeting.","Prime Ministers Mission Abroad - Ministerial Statement","INTERNATIONAL SITUATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[39]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

One of the great weaknesses of trade unionism in Australia over all the years is the fact that decisions have been made by unions at meetings which have not been representative of the union membership. Therefore, if decisions are to be made- in time of war they should be reached at meetings which are truly representative of the great body of members of the unions. Many of these men are working such long hours and on such varying shifts that there are occasions when it is better to have a stop-work meeting involving the loss of two or three hours or even a day than risk the chaos and confusion that will result from the failure of the union to have a decision taken as to what shall be done.","Prime Ministers Mission Abroad - Ministerial Statement","INTERNATIONAL SITUATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[39]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Last night the Prime Minister paid a well-deserved tribute to the great body of the Australian workers, and I am certain that the real test of these powers will be the way in which they are used. If they are to be used capriciously, without calm consideration, or without giving the unions an opportunity to state what their case really is, our next position may be worse than the present one, because we shall have created a feeling of bitterness and disappointment, whereas a proper statement of the case would have enabled appropriate remedies to be -devised. The Prime Minister has paid a tribute to the workers for what they have done since the commencement of the war, and I desire to pay my tribute to the Government for the way in which it has attempted to facilitate the working of the machinery for the settlement of industrial disputes, particularly in regard to the coal-mining industry. I do not hesitate to say what I think the Government ought to do, and I shall not go behind the door to say what the Government has done to help in these matters. I ask the Government to build on that foundation of collaboration with labour, rather than use this developing outlook on the war as a new reason for putting labour into a straightjacket, or for doing things which would please some commentators who can see no possibility of the nation being organized until labour is properly disciplined. [ Leave to continue given.] 1 now come to the expressed intention of the Government to make arrangements whereby Parliament may be its own watch dog over the Government in the carrying out of this programme. It is intended, I gather, .to set up some parliamentary committees which will report to Parliament regarding what is being done. That is a very wise move, but I do ask the Government immediately to set about establishing a standing committee of both Houses, a body with all the powers of a select committee, which will report constantly to the Government upon matters affecting social security. Reference was made to the subject by the Prime Minister last night. In my opinion, the workers and the people are entitled to some instalments of the new social order as opportunity offers, while they are being called upon to make this great sacrifice.","Prime Ministers Mission Abroad - Ministerial Statement","INTERNATIONAL SITUATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[39]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I have not spoken lightly, and I have said only what I believe should be said. What I have said I stick to, and I hope that those who have heard me will take cognizance of it.I agree with the proposal of the Prime Minister to create a Ministry of Supply as well as one of Munitions. The proper procedure is to preserve the authority of Parliament to determine the number of Ministers, and the Government should state the number of Ministers required. At a time when the economic functions of the Commonwealth are constantly increasing, it is only proper that the Ministry should he strengthened to cope with the expanding responsibilities. It is not right to expect the work to be done by the same number of men as formerly. Moreover, the war is now twenty months old, and some Ministers have been bearing a heavy burden since it began. They have been working long, hours, and it is time that the burden was re-distributed. This is also true of the heads of some departments. A man may be able to carry a heavy load of responsibility for six months, or even twelve months, but he cannot do so indefinitely ; we must take heed of the tremendous toll being taken of the strength and stamina of certain officers of the Commonwealth as well as of certain Ministers.When the matters referred to in the Prime Ministers broadcast come before Parliament for consideration, we shall have something to say about each of them. This afternoon I have given merely a general outline of what is in my mind. The great truth to remember is that this Parliament will have no opportunity to serve the people unless our cause is crowned with victory. That is my most fervent conviction. The question of how victory is to be secured involves many problems which must be discussed in this Parliament on their merits. Suggestions will be made, and the Government must decide upon a course of action after hearing the best advice available. Just as all the people of the nation are now being called upon to do their best, in order that the country may do its best, so I maintain that, when the war is won we should, not as an expression of empty rhetoric, but in very fact, pledge ourselves to the service of the people as a whole. The people alone stand between Australia and defeat, just as the people stand between Great Britain and defeat, and Great. Britain and Australia must be saved for the proper use of all their people, and not as the happy hunting grounds of a privileged few.","Prime Ministers Mission Abroad - Ministerial Statement","INTERNATIONAL SITUATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[39]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[11]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
123,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CHIFLEY, Ben","A48","Macquarie","N/A","N/A",113,".- I deprecate attempts by representatives of the Government here and in Great Britain, and by a section of the press, to prevent criticism of what are obviously grave errors of judgment by saying that such criticism is evidence of lack of patriotism. It is perfectly clear that grave errors of judgment were committed by somebody in regard to the Grecian campaign, and later in regard to the campaign in Crete. No Opposition which does its duty to the people can allow a government, or a group of persons, to stride blunderingly into error in seven league boots, and then to seek to hide behind a smoke screen of patriotism, or to deflect criticism from themselves by talking of the gallantry of our soldiers. Grave blunders have been made, and the people entertain serious misgivings regarding some of the things that were done in those two campaigns. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Harrison), speaking at a rally in Martin-place immediately after the Grecian campaign, said that it was cold-blooded murder to send men into battle if they were not properly equipped. I wonder what was running through his mind when he made that statement. Certainly the sentiments which he uttered have found an echo in the minds of a great many other persons. It was a grave error of judgment to send Australian or New Zealand troops, or troops of any other country, into the campaign in Greece without proper equipment and proper air protection in support of what seems to me to have been a somewhat quixotic notion of honour. It is obvious that adequate air protection was not given. Since the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) returned from abroad he has spoken of the tremendous work we now propose to do - indeed, a great deal has already been done - in order to speed up munition production and to improve the services. Frankly, we need to view the whole position, with regard to manpower and the purposes for which our man-power can be used. The plain fact is that although we have a Department of Defence Coordination, we have no real co-ordination in. recruitment of man-power for either the production of munitions or the fighting services. As my leader has pointed out, a competition is going on between two arms of the services. The statement has been made, and I take it to be correct, that the Government proposes to extend munition production to such a degree as to make Australia one of the important arsenals of the Empire. If we are to proceed along the lines now proposed, and every eligible man is to be recruited for the Air Force and Army, and, at the same time we are to undertake a tremendous production of munitions, I believe, bearing in mind that we have a population of only 7,000,000, that under these programmes, this country will eventually be bled white, or we shall find ourselves unable to carry on. Consequently, some attempt must be made to discover the real capacity of this country in both of those directions. If Australia is to become one of the arsenals of the Empire, is it proposed, at the same time, to carry the policy of recruiting for overseas to such a length that this country will be denuded of fighting man-power for the purposes of its own defence? Those, are matters to which the Government should give some thought.I now come to the organization of the nation in regard to the war itself. The Prime Minister, in his speeches, has expressed some excellent ideas as to what ought to be done; but it is just as well to say to the Prime Minister that the people of Australia will judge him not by his rhetoric, but by the results he produces. As I have already said, the plain fact remains that the Department of Defence Co-ordination is not a department of co-ordination in the real sense of the word. There is a measure of division among the services themselves as to what ought to be done. We have men in sections of some services who could be more fittingly used in sections of the other services. Instances come to my mind of men who have asked to be released, so . that they could join the Navy where they were needed in a technical capacity, but the Army has refused to release them ; it preferred to keep them occupied in clerical work for which they did not even enlist. I do not know of a more individualistic service than the Air Force. I am not now speaking of any particular Minister, but there has never been any measure of co-operation on the part of any chief of the Air Force with any other section of the defence services. I do not want honorable members to take merely my word for that statement. They can go to the unions and the employers, and they will be informed of many instances of skilled men, with technical training, having been taken into the Air Force hut not having been used for the purposes for which they were enlisted. No attempt has been made by the Minister in charge of that department (Mr. McEwen), or by the Minister for Defence Co-ordination (Mr. Menzies) to determine whether those men were being properly used in those departments. I believe that whenever an appeal has been made to the Navy to release men, the Navy has usually acceded to such requests, whilst in many cases, the Army has shown some willingness to release men who had some measure of skill when they were wanted by other arms for some special purposes. But the attitude of the Air Force in this matter has been so apparent that it has been talked about at every street corner. No one has come to me officially and made complaints; but it is known to every one that skilled men drawn from the engineering industry, who have been enlisted in the Air Force, have been employed in sweeping paths, picking weeds and washing down planes, when, at the same time, there is a crying need for such men to be loaned to other services, at least until such time as the Air Force is ready to utilize their skill fully. They have been retained in the Air Force, and no attempt has been made by that service to meet the needs of other departments concerned with our war effort. For quite a considerable time, there was a grave suspicion of snobbery in the Air Force; there may still be ground for that suspicion. That is a matter which the Minister for Air might investigate. I emphasize these matters solely to show the necessity for not giving to some Minister, or to the chief of a particular service, the right to say who is wanted in his service, but to place that responsibility on someone under the direct control of the Prime Minister as Minister for Defence Co-ordination, who is not wrapped up in the interests of any particular service,- but whose concern is for the nation as a whole and the great effort it is making. Such an official should be deputed to see what are the needs of the respective services, and whether the skill of men in cases of the kind I have outlined cannot, be better utilized in the production of munitions, if not permanently, then even for some months, and in some instances for some weeks. The appointment of such an official is most desirable at a time, when highly-skilled tradesmen are so badly needed.The Prime Minister has spoken about the acceleration of our war effort. In passing, I may say that it is also a byword that the Department of Defence Co-ordination itself is inextricably enmeshed in red tape, and that in no other department is there more delay in carrying out defence functions with regard to the war than in the very department of which the Prime Minister himself, as Minister for Defence Co-ordination, is the head. Recently. I saw in the press a statement by the honorable member for New England (Mr. Abbott) in which, without mentioning the specific instance, he elaborated on the long and tortuous road through which some transaction had to travel before it finally reached the point at which a decision was made. That is true; I say this to not only the Prime Minister but also every Minister. Honorable members must not think that I am not fully aware of the tremendous strain placed upon Ministers by the great amount of work they have to do. I do not charge any Minister particularly, but if our war effort is to be really accelerated there must be some delegation of authority by Ministers instead of allowing matters to pile up day after day, and week after week, awaiting the decision of one man, or the head of a department. That procedure might be all right in peace time, but not in war-time. Every man, charged with responsibility, from the Prime Minister down, must surround himself with men of (the greatest talent and capacity to reach decisions quickly, not, perhaps, on matters involving major Government policy, or which might produce major economic repercussions, but certainly on matters which can and must be decided promptly in order that we may get important things expeditiously done. Ministers should be able to place responsibility for such decisions on men capable of doing .these things on their behalf. If any service Minister thinks that he can handle all the things which the people think be should deal with, there will be no acceleration of our war effort. The Government talks about speeding up the war effort, but the right honorable member for North Sydney (Mr. Hughes) is Attorney-General and also Minister for the Navy. It is about time that the Government, and the Minister himself, realized that one can linger too long upon the stage. I do not like to have to say -these things, but if one wishes to be honest with the Government one mustsay what he believes to be the trouble. I do not wish -to be disrespectful to any Minister, but I do not believe that the holding of two portfolios by the right honorable member for North Sydney at such a time as the present is in the best interests of the nation.I now wish to refer to the proposed tremendous effort in which we are to call into being all the forces we possibly can for carrying on the war. I do not speak in any carping spirit, because I know very well how difficult is the Governments task, but while we are talking about great sacrifices, and demanding that the people shall make equal sacrifice, the plain fact remains that quite a number of people in this country, particularly big monopolies and big firms, are making a good thing out of this war. At the same time, I do not deny that quite a number of workers are doing better now than they did before the outbreak of war. But I draw the attention of the Government to the fact that a great number of small business people, primary producers and small farmers in country districts, see advancing upon them nearer and nearer each day the shadow of financial and economic ruin. I know that it is not easy to adjust these difficulties. A man may be only running a small motor garage or a shop ; and should he lose his business, his loss, so far as the community generally is concerned, will not appear to be very great. But the fact is that in many instances the savings and effort of a life-time are represented in these small businesses. To-day, however, they are mortgaged to the banks, and if the Government is not prepared to balance our economy so that producers can be enabled to continue at least a minimum of their operations, it will find that when the war is over, these people will have been driven off the land, and this country will be unable to carry on. It is the duty of the Government to keep in mind the fact that when the war is over, the task of restoring Australia to ordinary economic balance will be considerably greater if to-day disproportionate numbers of people are allowed to drift into a few avenues of activity - the production of munitions and the arms of the services - and, at the same time, the economic side, which has to do with the interests of business people in the country and the primary producers as a whole is entirely neglected.In respect of the Department of Information, I personally consider that that department has been a trap. The clearest evidence for that statement is to be found in the fact that the people of this country are more and more inclined to listen to the statements of the enemy in preference to those issued by the department. Quite a number of our people are now looking to short wave messages broadcast from other countries, mostly coming- from enemy sources, because the statements issued by the Department of Information are so grotesquely distorted, or the department delays too long the giving of correct statements. Consequently, the people are completely losing faith in that department.Most regrettably, the Prime Minister has allowed himself to be drawn into making a comment concerning the prohibition of strikes. Never in the history of Australia has there been such close co-operation as that which exists now between the trade union movement and its traditional political opponents. To my knowledge, no Leader of the Opposition in this Parliament has been more generous than the honorable member for Fremantle (Mr. Curtin) in his treatment of a government. Whatever Australia has to say about him, it must concede that he has always been not only fair but also generous in his criticism of his political opponents. When I see the jackal newspapers praising him when his policy suits their book, but tearing him to pieces when his advocacy on behalf of the Labour party does not meet with their approval, I wonder what form of gratitude exists in the press for a man who has rendered such outstanding service in the National Parliament. Devoid of selfish ambition, he has not sought to grasp for himself, when his party lacks the numerical strength to govern, the emoluments, glory and position of a Cabinet Minister. Australia is fast reaching a measure of co-operation by the workers which augurs well for a complete utilization of every resource in the country in connexion with the war effort. But the Prime Ministers announcement regarding the prohibition of strikes may easily be interpreted as some kind of threat. That it was not intended as such is my earnest hope. Whilst I am by nature a very mild person, I accept threats as a challenge.Another matter to which the right honorable gentleman referred, was the internment of Communists. My personal opinion is that the political label that a man wears is not a sure criterion of his patriotism or capacity for work. If subversive- acts against the welfare of the community are to determine whether a man should be interned, quite a. number of supporters of the United Australia party should have been deprived of their liberty long before the outbreak of war. I fear that some tribunal, perhaps even a tin-pot military autocrat, will be empowered to judge whether a person is a Communist. Such a policy would lead to grave abuses, and would cause serious industrial trouble, because the power would be used, as it has been used in the past, to intern people merely because they disagreed with the political opinions of the government of the day. For that reason, this Government must guard carefully against the misuse of the power which last night the Prime Minister indicated would be taken.Like the Leader of the Opposition, I appreciate greatly many of the Governments acts regarding arbitration and conciliation. When the new, streamlined form of arbitration was introduced, the Government should have put on a new engine instead of continuing to employ the old one. Unfortunately, arbitration will still be conducted in a legal atmosphere, with a, full observance of all the formality and procedure which are associated with the ordinary courts. The honorable member for Hunter (Mr. James) directed the attention of the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr. Holt) to what was occurring in regard to the coal tribunals. The Minister, who has worked hard, has done everything in his power to make the industrial machine run smoothly. Ho was very fair in the way in which he . constituted the miners tribunal; but at the base, there is an arbitration court composed of judges, and that in itself tends to prevent any desirable acceleration. If the rules of the House did not preclude me from making certain observations about the judges, I should do so on this occasion. A few . days ago, the honorable member for Watson (Mr. Falstein) asked the Prime Minister whether he would introduce legislation designed to prohibit men from occupying certain positions after they had attained the age of 65 years. Though the question was treated as a jest, it was really most serious. The accelerated machine, which the Government introduced to deal with arbitration, has at its head a man whose health demands that he should no longer occupy his position.The production of munitions has been the subject of considerable discussion. The Labour party believes that the production of munitions should not be a profit-making medium for any member of the community, but great organizations and monopolies are making very handsome profits out of the war. Employed in the Ministry of Munitions are persons who are associated in certain enterprises that are making such profits. I do not agree with the statement that the production of munitions to date has not been highly commendable. In fact, Australians have achieved wonders in this sphere, though undoubtedly bungling and hold-ups _ have occurred. Despite the fact that Mr. Essington Lewis is the managing director of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, his capacity to organize on a grand scale has been well demonstrated- by his association with the Ministry - of Munitions. Whilst that organization has not been able to achieve everything, Mr. Lewis has done very well. With some of the criticism directed at the Director of Machine Tool Production, Mr. Thorpe, I do not agree. In my opinion, he has clone a very good job. To no public servant is the community more deeply indebted than it is to the controller of the administration of the Munitions Department, Mr. Jensen. Elsewhere in the ministry, however, there are some blanks. The Government should know of the general feeling that the Director of Aircraft Production secured his position, and retains it, because of his social standing. Admittedly, that is not a very pleasant thing to say, but the efforts in regard to aircraft production have not been all that they might be. Whoever is appointed Assistant Minister for Aircraft Production will have to overhaul that section. Australia owes a deep debt of gratitude to hundreds of public servants who, without fee or reward, burn the midnight oil in connexion with the war effort. True, many of them are wrapped up in red tape, but there is no lack of sincerity, hard work or honesty of purpose in their endeavour. As many departments are under-staffed the Government should co-opt from the States all men who could be spared for the purpose of assisting the Commonwealths war effort. I know of no meaner thing in public life than the decision which was made recently by the Premiers not to allow State officers, to be interrogated by the Commonwealth Manpower and Resources Committee. Most regrettably, Labour Ministers were parties to that decision ; but I am. con- fident that the newly-elected Labour Government in New South Wales will not adopt such an attitude. The Commonwealth should take every opportunity to obtain from the States all suitable men in order that over-worked federal public servants may be given an opportunity to preserve their health.Although in my speech I have indulged in some criticism, every member of the Labour party is prepared to give to the Government all possible co-operation in its war effort. My remarks to-day are not a reflection upon individuals. Comments have been made about the Army, but the Minister himself was a most efficient Treasurer, and rendered excellent service to Australia in reducing interest rates. In his present capacity, he has done his best to move fast. Honorable members, who have had experience of the operation of the services, appreciate the difficulty that is experienced in driving them along, particularly when a civilian is responsible for control. The policy of appointing lieutenant-colonels without regard for their military qualifications is regrettable. Years ago, one understood that a captain or a lieutenant-colonel had earned his rank by braving the dangers of war. Now a lieutenant-colonel may attain that rank through his ability to sing comic songs. The Minister for the Army has made an effort to do his job thoroughly and conscientiously, and, in many respects, he has been an excellent man in the position.Every opportunity should be taken by the Government to cut away the red tape that enmeshes so many departments. I could enumerate hundreds of instances of its clogging and retarding effect. The public are gravely dissatisfied with the petrol position, not because rationing has been introduced, but because of the shocking waste of fuel by the military authorities. Months ago, I directed the attention of the Minister to this matter and suggested how it could be remedied. What has been done, and with what success, I cannot say, but the public has been made gravely uneasy by the scandalous waste of petrol by the military. As to the necessity for economy in the use of petrol, the public are not so seriously disturbed. They realize that consumption must be reduced, but they are gravely disturbed by the methods used to distribute such petrol as is available. When the petrol rationing scheme was launched the conditions were such as to provide a premium for liars. The statements that people made were accepted at face value and without investigation, with the result that petrol was rationed on a most inequitable basis and without regard to the purpose for which motor vehicles were to be used. I have made frequent appeals that all cases should be dealt with, on their merits. Two men may be doing the same class of work with the same class of vehicle in a primary  producing industry, but one man may live 3 miles, and another 40 miles, from the town. Yet they are rationed on exactly the same scale. What we need is a proper distribution of the available petrol. I have asked that police officers in country districts should he authorized to determine the ration according to the merits of individual cases. In that way we could greatly improve our distributing methods.My remarks have not been made in a spirit of captious criticism. I sincerely trust that the Government will take steps to act in full accord with the Prime Ministers undertakings with the object of really speeding up our war effort, not by a feverish wave of emotionalism but by sound, common-sense, economic methods. The affairs of this country can and should, be conducted in a rational way, for there is ample evidence of willingness on the part of every body to co-operate in the best interests of the nation.","Prime Ministers Mission Abroad - Ministerial Statement","INTERNATIONAL SITUATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[39]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
124,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"LAZZARINI, Hubert","L07","Werriwa","N/A","N/A",119,".- I do not intend .to speak at length, but the few points to which I shall devote my attention seem to me to require emphasis. I listened with attention to the speech delivered over the air by the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) last night, as I also listened to the speech which he delivered in this House on the 28th May last. The right honorable gentleman seemed to me, on both occasions, to be struggling with a desire to say something which would have the effect of flogging the flagging energies of the people of this country into a greater effort. If the Prime Minister did not actually accuse certain sections of the people of apathy, there was no doubt that some parts of his speech were open to that interpretation. His utterance could be described as an effort to disturb what he regarded1 as dangerous complacency on the part of the people. In my opinion there is no such complacency, hut if there were, certain sections of the press could be blamed for it.Reports that have appeared in the press at different times seem to me to be directly contradictory of remarks made by the Prime Minister both in thisHouse last month and over the air last night. The right honorable gentleman told us a stirring but tragic story of the manner in which the people of England were facing the constant enemy bombings. He said that people everywhere in Great Britain were making sacrifices, but some press reports tell quite a different story. I shall cite some passages from an article which appeared on the leader page of the Sydney Morning Herald of the 23rd May last. Although I do not regard the Sydney Morning Herald in a very favorable light, it isconsidered to be one of the most important daily newspapers of the Commonwealth. Anything that it publishes must therefore be considered in quite a different way from articles published in small country newspapers or obscure journals with small circulations. The article to which I refer was contributed to the Sydney Morning Herald by the newspapers special correspondent in London. It stated among other things -Unfortunately there are privileged sections who are still resisting fiercely any threat to what they regard as their rights and are selfishly and complacently asking others to bear the burdens which are necessary if victory is to be won.The writer proceeded as follows : -I have lived in Englands leading luxury hotel (facetiously referred to by my journalistic colleagues as my gilded cage). 1 have spent much time in other leading luxury hotels all over England. I have also stayed in country  pubs , and to-day I am sleeping on the floor in Fleet Street.I saw so much that pained and oppressed me in these luxury places that I can honestly say that, if I had my choice between my  gilded cage  and a bed on the floor in Fleet Street, I would choose the bed on the floor.He also wrote -It seemed impossible to me as I sat amid gaudy and lavish surroundings and watched women in expensive evening gowns and smartly-tailored men ordering extravagant dinners and expensive drinks that the mass of the people were fighting desperately and with a magnificent courage against a savagery such as the world lias never seen before.In their steel and concrete fortress, surrounded by huge brick blast walls, they are able to sit comfortably through the fiercest raid with hardly any evidence that buildings were being devastated and people dying all over the city. Even the roar of the huge guns a few hundred yards away come to them only as a muffled thudding.When I told some of them stories of the Plymouth blitz that T. had seen, some of the experiences I had had in the East End and of the conditions in shelters and under-grounds. they either looked at me with astonishment or treated me as though I were an explorer returned from the wilds.What I, and many other people, in Australia wish to know is : Who is telling the truth? The reports made to us by thePrime Minister do not  square  with reports of the kind to which I have just referred, and it is little wonder that many people in . this country wish to be reassured as to the true position. The glaring discrepancy between the state of affairs described by the correspondent of the Sydney Morning Herald on the one hand, and by the Prime Minister on the other, requires some explanation. Our people want to know the truth. We have heard a great deal recently about the proposed new order, burt we need some guarantee that steps will be taken at once to provide for the new order. Action should not be delayed until the conclusion of the war.The Prime Minister had a good deal to say last night about the shortage of man-power. Although he stated that the Government was pledged to the voluntary system of recruiting for overseas service, there was still an insistent but in his speech.  But , he said,  recruiting is too slow . The kind of propaganda proceeding in Australia at present is similar to the kind that preceded the attempt of the Government of the day to introduce conscription during the last war. We were told then that there was a serious slackness in recruiting and an urgent need to fill the gaps in the ranks. All I can say is that I and other honorable members on this side of the chamber have become sick and tired of listening to the stories of men who have offered their services during the present war and have been told that no place can be found for them. I believe that thousands of men in Australia have had their offers to serve rejected by the military authorities. One main wrote to me quite recently a pitiable tale. He said that he had attended a meeting in Martin-place at which an appeal had been made for wireless operators for the Royal Australian Air Force. Of course he had also seen advertisements in the press to the effect that wireless operators were needed. He promptly offered his services and received a reply to the effect that no more operators were required. Yet the same day he heard Brigadier-General Lloyd make an urgent appeal over the broadcasting network for wireless operators to enlist at once in the Air Force. That kind of thing is going on all the time. How is it that such appeals can be made when so many men are doing their utmost to get into the services?I agree with what the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Curtin) and the honorable member for Macquarie (Mr. Chifley) have said concerning the trade union movement. I could not help noticing one naive touch in the Prime Ministers statement last night. The right honorable gentleman said that the Government would regiment the trade unions. We were told that certain people would be placed in concentration camps if they did, or did not do,. certain things. The Prime Minister went on to say that any employers who failed to act as they should act would have their businesses taken from them. That was all the penalty they would suffer! No doubt if the Government took over any businesses under such conditions it would provide that the ordinary rate of profit should be paid to the proprietors. There might even be some premium, and it is possible that the employers who had misconducted themselves might be put in charge of the operation of the businesses. That kind of thing will not commend itself to us.One other remark by the Prime Minister stirred me. It was the right honorable gentlemans plain, cold-blooded statement to the effect that we must mortgage our future in. order to win the war. To whom are we to mortgage it?","Prime Ministers Mission Abroad - Ministerial Statement","INTERNATIONAL SITUATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[39]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

126,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"LAZZARINI, Hubert","L07","N/A","N/A","N/A",120,"- Of course it is. Does the Prime Minister expect that we shall be agreeable to mortgage our future as we did during the war of 1914-18 and so cause a repetition of the worst depression that this country has ever known ? Are we to be expected to leave ourselves in the hands of the moneychangers and to pile up huge debts which later will have to be paid by the blood, sweat and tears of the men who fought for victory ? If we must mortgage our future we shall mortgage it only to ourselves. We should operate through our own financial institution. The Commonwealth Bank should be the only organization operating in relation to war indebtedness. If the Government is honest in its desire to mobilize the resources of this country in respect of materials, men and machinery it should draw upon the resources of the Commonwealth Bank. Money terms mean nothing in our present situation. If the Government wishes to float a loan it should act solely through the Commonwealth Bank. It should not permit other financial institutions to burden the people of this country with debts that will he unpayable after the war. It should take complete control of the financial resources of the country and arrange financial measures in accordance with the needs of the situation. I shall never agree to the piling of huge debts upon the shoulders of the people. I am totally opposed to the mortgaging of our future to financial institutions, many of which have foreign affiliations. That kind of thing was done during the lust war, and after the war the peoples savings were carved up and distributed among financial institutions without regard to nationality or equity. For that reason we shall not accept the Prime Ministers statement that we must mortgage our future unless the mortgaging is to be done through our own financial institution.","Prime Ministers Mission Abroad - Ministerial Statement","INTERNATIONAL SITUATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[39]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

128,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"LAZZARINI, Hubert","L07","N/A","N/A","N/A",121,"- If it is intended it is not being done, and the honorable gentleman knows that it is not being done. The forces behind the Prime Minister will not permit him to do it. The inescapable fact is that the world will not be able to carry the huge burden of debt that will remain after this war. Debts will have to be cancelled. That will be all the more necessary if we are to enter upon a new era in a decent civilization. The debts being incurred by Great Britain, Australia, and other countries in this war will never be paid, and we are humbugging ourselves if we say or think otherwise. If the economic system of this country cannot carry that burden, it has to go. Far better would it be to operate under a system by which the debt could easily be wiped out, if wiping out were necessary. I now refer to the terrible burden imposed on the economic structure in the last war by reason of the huge profits derived from the manufacture of armaments. Mr. Lloyd George, as Prime Minister1 of Great Britain, proved conclusively what a toll was taken of the resources of Great Britain in this respect.Efforts are being made to convince us that to-day no profits are being thus derived. Leaving out of account the armaments manufactured in government workshops, the fact must not he overlooked that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, Lysaghts Limited, and the Commonwealth Rolling Mills Limited control the industries which supply all the heavy materials that are needed. During 1914-18 it was claimed that the manufacturers of armaments were not making any profits, yet an investigation disclosed that they were charging the British Government Â£65 for a Lewis gun which that Government could make for Â£25, and 25s. 6d. for shell casings which it could make for 12s. In twelve months, the British Government saved Â£500,000,000. These facts were placed before the House of Commons in 1918 by Mr. Lloyd George himself. If the Prime Minister, and the Government that lie leads, are honest in their professions, and intend to do the job properly, let them install a costing system in the works of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, the Commonwealth Rolling Mills Limited and Lysaghts Limited. Lloyd George took such action in 1916. Such a step would lead to correct information being obtained in regard to costs. If some men are to give their lives, and others to mortgage their future, as the Prime Minister has- said must be the case if this country is to be defended and democracy generally is to survive, these concerns ought to be very well satisfied if their industries are handed back to them intact when the war is over. What citizen of this country would not be made happy by the thought that when this war was over he would be- in a position at least as good as- he occupied when it commenced ? A few persons, of course, will make extra profits, and thereby place themselves in a better position, but the average citizen will not be anything like so well off as he was before the war. I say definitely to this House and to the country that under the present system of finance it will not be possible to mobilize the resources of Australia or to do one-half of what could be done in other ways. It is useless to wait for the flotation of loans, and to depend on the pence saved by children and the purchase of war savings certificates, because the necessary monetary resources are not available. Whatever lag there has been is the result of the inability of existing financial measures to do in the right way what is needed. I have heard a good deal to-day concerning aeroplanes. If we cannot obtain from overseas supplies of dolomite, we cannot build aircraft in Australia. During the last sittings of this House I was assured by a geologist, to whom I spoke in one of the lobbies, and I have been assured by other persons also, that we have plentiful material from which magnesium metal can be manufactured. Restriction of imports is proposed in order to stabilize the financial position of Australia. What is wrong with the exploitation of our dolomite resources, thus providing work for many who are still unemployed, and furnishing the material which is so essential to the production of aircraft in this country? Should the time arrive - we pray that it will not - when sea transport is further curtailed and these materials cannot be brought to Australia from overseas, our aircraft manufacturing industry will cease to function and no more aeroplanes will be made in this country. Not one of the thousands of persons to whom I have spoken is unprepared to do some.ducers everywhere admit that sacrifices tiling to help forward the war effort; business men, workers, and primary pro- have to be made. All are prepared to make those sacrifices; but there must be some degree of equality, and nobody must be permitted to grow rich out of profits derived from industrial undertakings. This is the psychology which has to be exploited; that is the opinion which is hold generally to-day, and the Government must realize that it exists. I have no wish to criticize. I admit that a good job has already been done. But since the adjournment of the House I have travelled extensively and have heard this opinion expressed openly. More evidence must be produced to show that there is to be a greater levelling of sacrifices. If that be guaranteed by the Government there will not bo found much lag on the part of the Australian people, even if there be any now. I shall never stand for the mort- gaging of Australia to institutions like the associated banks, as was done previously, because escape from our difficulties could be gained only by another depression, accompanied by the sweat, tears, and misery of tens of thousands of Australian people. The Labour party says that that shall not happen again. We have had that experience, and shall strive to our utmost to see that it is not repeated when this war has been won.","Prime Ministers Mission Abroad - Ministerial Statement","INTERNATIONAL SITUATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[39]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
129,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BARNARD, Herbert","JNX","Bass","N/A","N/A",122,".- The statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) in this chamber two or three weeks ago was supplemented by the speech that the right honorable gentleman broadcast last evening. I was not able to listen to that speech, because I was travelling to Canberra, but I have been supplied to-day with a copy of it, and this morning I read a report of it in the press.I wish first to refer to the distribution of our man-power. Only yesterday I read in a Tasmanian newspaper an unsigned article, of which I do not know the author and for which I could not find any authority, on Man-power for war victory. It reads -Approximately 50.0,000 Australian men, or one in five between the ages of 18 years and 60 years, are in uniform or available for immediate mobilization. Added to this is a minimum of 150,000 munition workers. Within a year the Commonwealth will have at least 600,000 men in the fighting services at home and abroad, apart from the huge number required for munitions production and other vital industries.The article went on to compare the effort being made on this occasion with what happened in the years 1914-18, in the following terms : -In 1014-18, with a population of about 5,000,000 (2,000,000 fewer than to-day) Australia enlisted 416,800 mcn for the Australian Imperial Force by the end of four years. Air Force, home defence, and munitions requirements were all numerically negligible by present standards. Last August-comparable figures are not available officially - the Prime Minister announced enlistments for the lighting services overseas to be 157,714, of whom 119,000 were in the Australian Imperial Force, and 30,000 in the Royal Australian Air Force. Since then tens of thousands more have enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force; organization of the armoured division has begun, the Empire Air Scheme has been pushed on, the Navy has taken new men for ships from Australias yards, and Australia is maintaining a home defence force of volunteers and universal trainees which the Government has announced will not be allowed to fall below 250,000.The point that I wish to make is, that during the last twenty months Australia has made fairly substantial strides in the organization of its man-power. Unlike our position during the last war, we are now, it is said, an arsenal for the British Empire. We know from our own investigations, and from what we have been told by those who are in a position to express considered opinions, that we have advanced very considerably in the production of munitions of war, from the commencement of our operations in the year preceding the outbreak of hostilities. I am concerned to know what arc our limitations in respect of putting our men into uniform and sending them out of this country. We should be fairly well satisfied with the progress made up to date with respect to the men employed in the munitions factories; and enlisted in the different services. I have been approached in my electorate as well as in other electorates by scores of men and women, who complain that they have not been able to find a niche in the war effort. Those responsible to the Government for the marshalling of our man-power and economic resources have not done all that the people of this country expected of them. Nevertheless, I realize that much credit is due for the work that has already been accomplished. From my own observation, I am able to speak of the remarkably effective service that has been rendered in the production of munitions, and of the cordial co-operation that has been extended by the industrial movement. In response to the appeals of their leaders, the workmen of Australia have risen to the occasion in a most creditable manner. In the Melbourne press yesterday, I saw a half-page advertisement, which was headed  We pledge the Australian trades union movement to work for a swift and complete victory. The advertisement was attractively prepared and was illustrated with drawings of factories and ships. Under the caption,  The 1 work for victory resolution, it set out the following resolution of the convention of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions held on the 5th June: -This Congress recalls and re affirms the declaration of the New South Wales and Victorian Branches of the A.C.T.U. and other sections of the Trade Union movement in 1930 and the Trade Union. Congress of 1040, supporting the war against Hitler and Fascism. We record our uncompromising determination to continue the struggle against the aggressor powers who are endeavouring to destroy personal liberty, industrial and political freedom, the right of collective bargaining and association and, therefore, pledge the Trade Union movement to work for a swift and complete victory for the cause of democracy against aggression and oppression.We affirm that in order to prevent the possibility of individual profiteering by the war there should be brought about the immediate nationalization of the arms industries and the utilization of the national credit. We demand a substantia] immediate improvement in the standard of life and freedom of speech and assembly.We extend our deepest sympathy to the relatives and friends of members of Australias overseas forces who have given their lives or suffered from wounds or illness whilst fighting to preserve democracy and express our highest appreciation of the bravery of Australian volunteer forces in overseas conflicts. Congress expresses its horror and condemnation of the barbaric and ruthless methods by which the forces of Nazism and Fascism are endeavouring to gain world control and domination.This advertisement was published, not by the trade union movement, but by the Department of Information, which evidently considers that the sentiments expressed at the convention were such as to make a desirable impression upon the minds and lives of not only the working people, but also the community in general.In his speech broadcast last evening the Prime Minister referred to the need for preventing industrial disputes. I join with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Curtin) in his comment upon that part of the speech, because I consider that the Prime Minister was rather ill-advised in regard to the declaration which he made on this matter, in view of the statement published by the Department of Information regarding the resolutions of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions Congress on two occasions. Day by day the leaders of the trade union movement throughout Australia, in their broadcast speeches, and in their declarations in public places, have repeatedly urged the workmen of this country to pull their weight in the war effort. I refer to the statement issued by the trade union leaders in the coal-mining industry only last week, imposing disciplinary measures against men who take upon themselves the responsibility of preventing the production of the coal which is urgently needed in connexion with the war effort. The Prime Minister has been back in Australia long enough to know the attitude of the trade union movement, and the sincerity of purpose of the great mass of the workingmen and women of Australia who are providing the sinews of war for their comrades overseas, in order to defeat the enemy that would destroy us. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that caution should be exercised before the Government proceeds any further with its proposals with regard to industrial disputes. The Prime Ministers proposal to keep the wheels of industry moving is not consistent with the attitude adopted towards those employers who cause lockouts. If the Government took over the control of certain works, what would happen? Would the basis of payment to the employers be the cost of production plus 5 per cent, as in the cases of munition annexes to engineering workshops would no other penalty be imposed ? The Prime Minister has not told us. One cannot forget that some employers have placed forged stamps on leather of inferior quality intended for the use of the forces serving at home and overseas. As the honorable member for Macquarie (Mr. Chifley) has said, we should not adopt a high-handed attitude in our dealings with workmen who have extended to the Government greater co-operation in this war than at any other time in our history. The advice of the Leader of the Opposition is sound, and I hope that the Prime Minister will accept it.The rationing of petrol is to be tightened up. This is inescapable if our man-power and resources are to he properly marshalled and our petrol stocks conserved. As the honorable member for Macquarie remarked, wastage has occurred in connexion with the defence services. I have heard of a three ton lorry having been used to carry a. colonelsbag to a railway station, but, of course, it is difficult to obtain proof of acts of this kind.","Prime Ministers Mission Abroad - Ministerial Statement","INTERNATIONAL SITUATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[39]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

131,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BARNARD, Herbert","JNX","N/A","N/A","N/A",124,"- Surely that has not been done. The tighteningup of the petrol rationing scheme will have a serious effect on the lives of the keepers of service stations and the mechanics employed in garages. Every effort must he made to utilize the services of these men in the best interests of the country. I have in mind a man 44 years of age, who owns a small garage.He is an excellent mechanic, and when the further restrictions of the use of petrol take place he will be forced out of business. He has been desirous of entering the Air Force for months, but he has been told that he is too old. There should be a niche somewhere in the forces for a good mechanic only 44 years of age. Every effort should be made to marshal our man-power to the best advantage.I do not entirely support the methods by which the Government proposes to finance the war effort. We do not know exactly to what extent bank credit is to be utilized, but money is being obtained by means of loans and the issue of war savings certificates. Certain organizations and groups of men are making appeals to the public. In Tasmania, the response to the appeal for the purchase of war savings certificates has not been so great as it might have been. One reason for that is that defence expen- diturehas not been inflated in Tasmania to the same degree as in other States. Consequently, many Tasmanians have come to the mainland, and we have not the same flow of money through the community as is occurring on the mainland. Another reason is that our war organization in Tasmania is not so effective as it should be. The honorable member for Macquarie referred to the employment of aged men in work connected with our war effort. I have nothing personally against the man in charge of the sale of war savings certificates and loan appeals in Tasmania. Over a long period of years he has rendered very fine service to the community as a town clerk. But today he is nearly 80 years of age, and has reached the stage when he is not really capable of doing work of that kind. On the other hand a returned soldier, who was employed on this work temporarily and did an excellent job in forming war savings groups, is available to take charge of this activity. The Treasury, however, prefers to employ the older man. I do not refer to this matter in any carping spirit; but the wheels of our war effort are being clogged in this way. When the last loan was being floated this younger man visited country centres at his own expense to appeal for subscriptions. Undoubtedly, he has the capacity to express himself, and he puts his heart into the work. No doubt, also, he wants to do something in the war effort. The point I emphasize is that the employment of old men in work of this kind tends to retard the wai- effort. The time is long overdue for the Government to realize that such a state of affairs must be remedied. I cannot understand why this mans services are retained when a young and vigorous man who is equally capable of expressing himself in public, and is willing and anxious to do the job, is available.The proposal announced by the Prime Minister in his broadcast speech last night to appoint a number of parliamentary committees is excellent. To-day, the Government and the Opposition in this chamber are at one so. far as the prosecution of the war is concerned. Every Australian, I believe, is united in that aim ; the war must be won. We may not agree in respect of certain details of the prosecution of the war, but we arc united on the supreme issue of winning the war. The constitution of parliamentary committees will provide the Government with a greater degree of assistance than it has been able to obtain during the last twelve or eighteen months. Such a system will be of advantage to not only the Parliament but also the country as a whole. I entirely agree with that proposal. We shall thus be enabled to get closer together in the prosecution of the war. The suggestion made by the leader of the Opposition for the appointment of a standing committee on social services is also excellent.The effect of the loss of markets on our primary producers, which was referred to this afternoon by the honorable member for Werriwa (Mr. Lazzarini) is one of the most important problems confronting us to-day. The farmer is bound to suffer further as the result of the stricter rationing of petrol. After all, honorable members are not so busy in their electorates that they cannot afford to give more attention to these problems. At least, they are better able than Ministers to go into details of these matters, and I have no doubt that the investigation of such problems by parliamentary committees will bring about closer co-ordination in our war effort generally. Last week I made a tour of a portion of my electorate. I found that the subject of butter production and marketing was a very live question. Farmers in that portion of my electorate are milking more cows to the acre than in any other part of Australia. It is probably the best dairy land outside of Denmark. These people are very concerned as to what the future holds for them. They want to know what will happen to them should the bottom fall out of the butter market. In such an event they would be faced with ruin. Therefore steps must be taken to deal with that problem, which involves the provision of sufficient storage and refrigeration space. The potato-growers also are in great difficulty, although their conditions are not so bad as last year when they enjoyed a high, fixed maximum price. This year, however, they find that the market price is not sufficient to cover the cost of production. Consequently, they are looking to the Government to help them. These problems must be tackled, and I know of no better way in which that can be done than by investigation along the lines proposed by the Prime Minister in his speech to the nation last night. I have no intention of offering destructive criticism, but , I believe that the Government should seriously consider the matters with which I have just dealt. .Let us tighten up our organization wherever it requires to be tightened up, so that in the future we shall be able to marshal the whole of our economic, industrial and primary resources in a common effort to defeat the common foe.","Prime Ministers Mission Abroad - Ministerial Statement","INTERNATIONAL SITUATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[39]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
132,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BAKER, Francis Patrick","JNR","Maranoa","N/A","N/A",125,".- At the outset I propose to deal with the speech broadcast by the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) last night. It has been said that speech is given to us to express thought ; the French Minister, Talleyrand, said that speech was given to us to hide thought; but it seems to me that to-day speech is given to us instead of thought. Certain parts of the Prime Ministers speech were decidedly good, particularly those sections in which he spoke of the national control of roads, ships, land transport, coal-mines, and an all-in war effort. He also dealt with petrol rationing. I hope that discrimination will be used so as to give to the primary producer sufficient petrol to enable him to carry on. In this respect, Ministers should set an example by abandoning their luxury cars and making greater use of the railways. At the same time, I hope that luxury cars will not be provided to convey Ministers secretaries to and from railway stations. The people have sharp eyes, and when they see that sort of thing going on, they immediately conclude that Ministers who speak of the need for rationing petrol are not sincere.I agree with the honorable member for Werriwa (Mr. Lazzarini) that the Prime Minister made a very bad mistake when he spoke about disciplining the trade unions and the workers. The right honorable gentleman should know that it is bad psychology to use a threat when there is no need for it. The people of Australia do not re-act amicably to threats. They can be led very easily, but they cannot be driven. The Prime Ministers remarks in that respect were in striking contrast to what he had to say about the banks. He said -","Prime Ministers Mission Abroad - Ministerial Statement","INTERNATIONAL SITUATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[39]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
133,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BAKER, Francis Patrick","JNR","N/A","N/A","N/A",126,"- The Prime Minister said that since the depression in 1930 the profits of the banks have been relatively small. Why this solicitous attitude towards the banking institutions? It is evident that the Prime Ministers broadcast had the imprimatur and endorsement of those institutions. It is evident that he represents them. If he proposes to take over railways and other activities, why not take over the most important activity of all, namely, banking? For the simple reason that the Government is not game to do so. The Prime Minister is the agent of those institutions, and I say that deliberately on the floor of this House. He used the expression  relatively small  in regard to hanking profits, meaning small in comparison with those earned during the depression. I remember reading some time ago that during the depression, that is, during 1931-32, the Big Five in England, namely, Barkleys, the Midland, Lloyds, Westminster and the National Provincial, earned published profits of between 16 per cent, and 18 per cent., and this at a time when the workers were unemployed because  there was no money , and when their wives and children were starving. I say that they made published profits, that is, profits exclusive of reserves A, B, C and D, especially D, bonus shares, and very large amounts written off for depreciation. We are now told by our Prime Minister that Ave must mortgage the future.The honorable member for Werriwa pertinently asked this afternoon to whom are we to mortgage the future. I reply by pointing out that we are expected to mortgage the future to those same banking institutions which made their 16 per cent, to 18 per cent, profit during the depression. Apparently, those institutions are to carry on their business untrammelled during the period of the war. The principal street corners in all our cities throughout Australia are occupied by palatial buildings erected by the banks during the depression, or by the insurance companies, which are, if possible, somewhat worse than the banks.Recently I inquired of the Prime Minister whether it was a fact that under the recently promulgated Moratorium Regulations, the insurance companies were empowered to charge members of the Australian Imperial Force 6 per cent, on unpaid premiums, and the answer of the Prime Minister was that they could charge up to 6 per cent. In spite of this we expect our young men to answer the call to serve their country overseas. That is bad business foresight on the part of the insurance companies. The interest on those unpaid premiums might very well have been wiped out or cut to 3 per cent., and I suggest that, if necessary, the Government might make up the difference. Surely we should not expect boys who are offering their lives for their country to pay 6 per cent, interest on the premiums, which, because of their service overseas, they are unable to keep up to date. There is no hope that this Government, or any other, will be able to achieve the maximum war effort unless it assumes control of banking facilities throughout the nation. Some time ago, I was charged by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Fadden) with seeking to follow Hitler. I say that we should follow Hitler and beat him at his own game. Hitler has nationalized the credit of Germany, and let us note what he is achieving thereby. We must do the same. We had to follow him in the organization of panzer divisions. We had to follow him in the building of heavy tanks, and in the method of using them. We had to follow him in the use of dive bombers. If we are to outmanoeuvre him we must learn the lessons he has taught, and apply them better than he has done, and this applies also to the use of money.The Prime Minister told us that we must mortgage the future. If we are to do that, what is the outlook? What is democracy to fight for? For my part, I hope that the time will come when we shall repudiate our war debt, because there is no hope of ever paying it. What are our men to do when they return from the war? Are they to be treated as were the men who returned from the last war, as hobos, and outcasts and worse? We had the spectacle recently of men who returned from this war being compelled to sit up in second-class railway carriages for twenty-four hours, weary, broken men who had been invalided home. Is that a foretaste of the new order ? Unless we start at the beginning with the thing that really matters - the credit of the nation - we shall get nowhere.","SMALLER BANK PROFITS","QUESTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[40]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
134,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"DUNCAN-HUGHES, John","JY7","Wakefield","N/A","N/A",127,". - I do not think that it is very satisfactory .that we should be continuing a debate of this kind after such a long interval. I listened with interest to what the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Curtin) had to say, but I had a feeling which, I think, was shared by many other, honorable members, that the debate had become somewhat stale. Nevertheless, this is an important period in our history, and it is only right that some of us should state our views, whether they coincide with the views of the majority or not.The problem, as I see it, is a threefold one. The first point has to do with the need for conserving money spent on goods which we do not require to use urgently. In this connexion, an important statement was published in the Melbourne Herald on the 4th April set- ting forth the views of Lord Stamp, economic adviser to the British Government, who, with his wife and son, were recently killed by a German bomb in London. The statement is as follows: -It is imperative that Australia in common with the other Dominions, should curtail luxury imports, especially from non-sterling countries. This applies particularly to petrol and newsprint.The resultant saving, in dollars and ships would be the most important contribution that could bo made to the Empires war effort.Australia is thinking of the war too much in terms of manpower and a magnificent scale of production. While these are very, valuable factors, they are no more essential than a reduction of consumption.This does not embrace food, because Australia has plenty of that, especially since the surplus has been swollen by a substantial curtailment of exports to Britain.But there are many commodities which could well be dispensed with or their consumption considerably lowered. . .All the evidence at my disposal suggests that Australians have hardly begun to feci the effects of the war on their daily lives. I have often emphasized the vital importance of the curtailment of consumption, but there are fewer signs from Australia of activity of mind in response to it than from any other Dominion.For example, South Africa got busy immediately, and recognized the importance of the question by appointing a  thrift organizer . There was also a good response from NewZealand.It is understandable that Australia should consider the war primarily in terms of production and manpower, and not in terms of a reduction of consumption. Britain made the same error early in the war, but the unwisdom of such a policy was quickly appreciated.The statement covers in a brief and adequate fashion the need for refraining from waste, of doing without those things which it is not necessary that we should consume.The second part of the problem has to do with equipment. We are all agreed as to the need for adequate equipment, and nobody who took part in the last war is likely to forget it. When I went to France during the last war, the supply of shells available to the army in those, days was very low. Nevertheless, we had to go. We had not the equipment, or the shells or the guns that the Germans had, but some one had to hold them up until the necessary equipment was ready. That has to be done in all wars. It is not a matter of having equipment equal to that of the enemy, if we have not got it, we have to do with What at our disposal until we can meet the enemy on equal terms. The Leader of the Opposition used the words :  We must have a maximum of equality with those that we have to fight . That of course, is obviously desirable. But if we have not got it, we have to do the best we can until we gain it. In 1916 I happened to be stationed for a time on Vimy Ridge where I saw almost daily three or four of our slow aeroplanes shot down in flames because they were not equal to the fast Fokkers of the Germans. No one can forget such a sight. It is easy for those who have not seen it to smile, but to stand there day after day and see our obsolete aeroplanes being shot down by the swift, up-to-date aeroplanes of the Germans was to give one a real sinking of the heart. Seldom did we then see one of the German planes brought down on that front. It was not until later that we were able to compete properly. In what I say about equipment, I am not to be misunderstood as stating that equipment does not play its part. When one speaks of an army, one naturally assumes equipment of every kind, shells, guns, planes, tanks, antitank guns and all the other modern forms of armament and munitions. It goes without saying that the soldier must have such things, but when all is said and done, it is not the weapons but the soldier himself, who makes the winning army. I have said more than once that in the last war it was not superior equipment that won for the Australians their successes.","SMALLER BANK PROFITS","QUESTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[40]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

138,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"DUNCAN-HUGHES, John","JY7","N/A","N/A","N/A",128,"- I shall come to that in due course. This country, which is mechanically and industriallyminded, has gone to extremes in this matter. People have the idea that by producing huge- masses of every kind of equipment they will overcome their enemies, so they need not bother greatly about man-power. To my mind, that theory is completely erroneous. The Prime Ministers broadcast speech last night contained hardly any reference to the fact that we are terribly short of troops overseas. Unless we have troops, we cannot fight. The honorable member for Griffith (Mr. Conelan) asked me why our forces were driven out of Greece and Crete. On the one hand the Greeks equipment was inferior to that of the Italians, but for a long while they put up a magnificent performance. On the other hand, the British and French stored up vast supplies of equipment in France before the evacuation at Dunkirk last year, and in a few days the whole of it was taken. All of it disappeared, providing magnificent proof of the fact that unless a country has the men to fight, enormous supplies of equipment in itself are useless. We have become obsessed with the idea that industrial production will win this war for us. It will do nothing of the sort ! Whilst that factor is of great importance, unless we have the man-power to use it, we shall not play our part. The great industrial drive which I mentioned has been visible throughout the war in different ways, whether in the matter of the tinplate industry or the building of motor engines, or now in this demand for enormously increased production of material. If Australia is to play its part in the war, it must produce the men who will fight. This is the third part of the problem.The numbers that will be sent overseas must be decided by the Government. That stands to reason, because the Government alone has all the information and can weigh the pros and cons. I wish that everybody would accept the fact that the Government should decide the matter. No government, whatever party it represents, is likely completely to denude Australia of its last line of defence. I concur with a statement by the honorable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron) in the House before I returned to it, eighteen months ago, when he was taunted with the fact that he urged that three divisions should be sent abroad. One honorable member asked him,  When three have been sent I suppose the honorable member will want four , and the honorable member for Barker retorted,  Yes, and then five. I believe that to be the proper way on which this war should have been fought. The day will come when people will recognize that the honorable member for Barker gave to the House good advice. Every day brings it nearer. Every day it is more certain that we should have a far stronger force overseas than we have at present. I think that the services of men who had experience in the last war should have been more fully utilized than they have been; and I regret that the Government has not made more use of them up to the present. I admit, as one honorable member declared, that we are not so young as we were, but the same statement surely applies to the politician. He would not suggest that. the politician does not, within limits, gain increased judgment with age, and the same applies to the soldier. Until one has been at war, one lacks the tremendous background of what war means. He cannot get it by any kind of reading, talking, or listening to the wireless. The soldier realizes from experience what war means. The Returned Sailors and Soldiers League has been for years most insistent on the maintenance of our defences, and no one imagines that they have adopted that course . because they wish to have any more wars. Their action was prompted by a desire to see that we had our proper fire insurance.Nothing has really been done yet to conserve any man-power of the country. The rural areas, which produce nineteentwentieths of our exports that bring new money to the country, are being denuded of men some of whom are finding employment in the munitions industry but the majority of whom probably are enlisting. The ridiculous discrepancy which exists between the payment of members of the Australian Imperial Force and the man in the munitions industry is obviously likely to drive men into munitions factories instead of into the expeditionary forces.","SMALLER BANK PROFITS","QUESTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[40]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Particularly do I say that, if, as should be the case, the work of employees in the munitions industry is to be done by women more extensively in future than it has been in the past. Any number of factories and big shops are full of men of military age whose work can be perfectly well done by women. When I went through an ammunition factory in South Australia, I was told by one of the officials that women were much more suitable for the work in that particular establishment than were men. Their temperament was much more equable, they did not distress themselves so much about the work, and they stayed at their job for years until they left to be married. On the other hand, the man scowled at his work for two or three years, became nervy and decided to leave.","SMALLER BANK PROFITS","QUESTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[40]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Incidentally, I recommend to the honorable member that he should work out a satisfactory definition of  profiteer . It is not quite so easy to do as he may think. I do not stand for the magnate profiteer whether he belongs to the country or the city, and I do not stand also for the masses of workmen who are trying to snatch a few shillings out of the present emergency. I speak as a private member. One of the advantages of doing so is that one may speak freely. Centuries ago, Milton wrote -This is true Liberty, when freeborn Men,Having to advise the Public, may speak free.I am quite sure that some honorable members opposite would; like to have liberty to speak as freely as I do.I now come to the Militia, which may well be linked with munitions. I have submitted to several members of the Government, and I now submit to the House, that too many people in this country are permitted to remain in reserved occupations. The book in which the list of reserved occupations is published is, in itself, large, but the number of people represented in the book is, of course, very much greater. It is, particularly, ridiculous that persons who have been reserved for work in primary production, on farms or otherwise, may nevertheless leave their reserved occupation and go to work on munitions at higher rates of pay. I contend that men reserved from military service for specific purposes should be obliged to remain in their reserved occupation; they should not be permitted to accept other kinds of work at higher rates of pay. I am quite certain that before long we shall have to reduce substantially our list of reserved occupations, and also the number of people who may remain in them.One of the main issues confronting Australia at present relates to equipment. We owe a great deal to the Minister for Supply and Development (Senator McBride) for the work he has done. We also owe a good deal to Mr. Essington Lewis. I do not for a moment suggest that we do not also owe a great deal to thousands of persons whose names are unknown to us, for doing their share in providing equipment, but, after all, it is to the men who go overseas and risk their lives on the field of battle that we owe incalculably more than to any others. We hear a good deal to-day about the  new order  after the war. I think a great deal more of the  new order  in relation to the soldiers who return than I do in relation to those who are not playing their part to preserve even the existing order.","SMALLER BANK PROFITS","QUESTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[40]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This system is absolutely undemocratic, and, as I have said from many platforms, I am not prepared to stand for it in this House or elsewhere. I stand where Sir William Irvine, Mr. Holman and Archbishop Kelly stood during the last war. I believe, as they believed, that the voluntary system is absolutely unfair. Every man who is of eligible age should be prepared to serve his country in its time of peril. It is not right to expect a family to send first one, a second, a third, and even a fourth and fifth son to fight, while other families will not send even one. Such a system is monstrous, and it is a scandal that it should be retained. Many Labour supporters, people who have been Labour supporters for most of their lives, believe as I do in this connexion. Many of them are quite prepared to do their share provided other people do theirs.

Very rarely has anybody the hardihood to attempt to advance reasons, because they are demonstrably full of flaws. Mr. Chamberlain who actually was in power in Great Britain following the giving of an undertaking that he would not apply conscription, when things became had decided that there was no alternative to the application of conscription, and it was applied. Sir John Simon, who left, the British Government at the beginning of the last war as an opponent of conscription, was a member of the Government which applied it in Great Britain on this occasion. In the last war, the hopelessness of attempting to obtain the necessary reinforcements without conscription was realized. There is a good deal of support for the idea that we can have masses of planes but you need not have masses of men. It has been pointed out that the Germans do not share that view, and that it is untenable is perfectly clear. When the Germans overran Greece, Crete, or North Africa they had masses of men. They made sure of getting what they wanted to get by having masses of men as well as masses of equipment. This policy may destroy Germany in the end because of the severity of its losses - that is a matter of opinion - but all the same, up to the present, its successes have been great. We are reaching the point where we shall need to have all the men we can spare in order to see that the Germans shall not advance very much farther. I need not develop that argument. In Germany, in spite of its colossal equipment and the fact that it has been preparing for this war for decades, and has a population of S0,000,000, speaking from memory, I believe that every man there up to 41 or 4?> years of age has been called up for service.

We may have differences of opinion and of outlook, as well as, possibly, different ways of speaking. As one honorable member has suggested, there may even be differences of dress. But I suppose that nearly all of us have been born in Australia, and that we all desire to make a nation of this country - so far as I am concerned, within the British Empire. We want to make this a country for the future. There will always exist differences of opinion as to how that is to be achieved. One section - I may belong to it - may speak too conservatively. Another section - perhaps represented by the honorable member for East Sydney - may be too much on the left wing. How can we make a success out of a nation which, when it is attacked at its heart, does not compel its people, if necessary, to rise as a man in defence of the women, the children, and the homes of Australia ? What sort of feeling is there likely to be after the war? I suggest that intense bitterness will bc felt by the men who are at present overseas and their families. I am told that they are asking in their letters,  What are you people thinking of out there? Do you not realize that we want reinforcements over here?  What are those who come back going tu think of persons at home who have done nothing but profiteer on a big or a small scale? Some time ago, I said at a meeting that after this war I feared the feeling was going to be most acute. At the conclusion of the meeting a lady said to me,  There is no need for you to say that it is going to be acute ; it is acute now . That is true. Some may say that I should not make a speech of this sort, that it is bound to cause dissension inside Australia. I say that the dissension is already here. I know that one cannot draw any hard and fast line. I know that some of the best of our manhood cannot, or are not allowed to, go. abroad; and there are also some, maybe not of the best type, who have gone overseas. But, speaking generally, the flower of the manhood of the country may be killed off; and that is not good for any country. Had I my way, in addition to conscription I would lay it down that in a family of two sons, if one went overseas the second should, if possible, be retained in this country, whether he wanted to go or not, so that families would not be entirely wiped out.","Auckland, Monday","ENROLMENT IN NEW ZEALAND","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[42]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[1]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

174,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BLACKBURN, Maurice","JPN","Bourke","N/A","N/A",134,".- I welcome this continuation of the debate on the Prime Ministers (Mr. Menzies; motion, mainly because it gives to me an opportunity to discuss the speech which the right honorable gentleman made last night. When I read in a newspaper this morning the report of that speech, I found that it was an expanded version of the speech that he delivered in June of last year. All that he now says was implied in that speech. The only difference between the speech of June, 1941, and the speech of June, 1940, is that the penal side of. his policy is emphasized to-day as it was not emphasized then. He was then appealing for Labour support of a policy which would enable him to do everything except send men overseas; support of a policy which would enable him to impose industrial conscription. To-day, having those powers, he tells the people what use he proposes to make of them, and emphasize* the penal side of his policy.It is very interesting to realize that we in this country are living under conditions quite different from any we have had previously. Both of the two highly organized classes are doing well, the great capitalists on the one hand and the organized trade unions on the other hand. The organized capitalist is making profits as he never made them before. Because of the demands for labour, the trade unions are strong, and are able to make their own terms as they were not able for a long time. But a new kind of proletariat is arising composed of the small business man, the small fanner, the self-employed man. This class is being crushed out by the policy adopted by this Government and enacted by this Parliament. Every regulation, every proclamation, leaves in its wake a ripple of broken enterprises and ruined men. The taxation approved by this Parliament is making men surrender their life assurance policies, abandon other provision for the security of their families, and is causing them to take their children from the universities. The middle class of the small entrepreneurs and salaried employees is going to pieces as the result of the policy which is being applied. There is nothing for them in that policy. The prospectus, carefully and deliberately prepared by the Prime Minister with the approval of the Government, offers the small middle-class man of this country nothing but further disturbance. Everything done in this country is making it impossible for him to live. That brings me to the consideration of the industrial policy of the Prime Minister. There never has been a leader of the non-Labour party in Australia who has been so well- treated by organized labour in this country as has the present Prime Minister. There has never been a man who has had more easy access to the leaders of labour and a more ready opportunity to impress his opinions upon them. Yet the Prime Minister says,  I am going to try to do something which Australia tried to do from 1906 to 1930, but has never succeeded in doing. I am going to prohibit strikes and punish the people engaged in them. Every Government in Australasia has tried to do that. Some of them still have anti-strike laws on their statute-books but they cannot enforce them ; South Australia and Western Australia have them and cannot enforce them; the other States have had them and have repealed them. The Prime Minister thinks that by the placard of anti-strike legislation he will conciliate the monopolist in industry and finance, upon whose support his influence is based. If there are strikes to-day it is natural that they should occur at a time when labour finds itself in a relatively strong position. When organized labour is weak, men will pocket their grievances; hut, when organized labour is strong, they will seek redress. I think that it is possible to avoid strikes in war-time. The Australasian Council of Trade Unions has prepared machinery which would secure that nobody need go on strike and that grievances will be dealt with expeditiously by men who know the facts and are accustomed to the conditions in industry. The Government, however, has set aside that proposal, and has proposed a system which has been effectively criticized by the honorable member for Macquarie (Mr. Chifley). The Government proposed to refer every dispute to the Arbitration Court. I make my living to a great extent in that court, but I have said over and over again that, in my opinion, judges receiving Â£3,000 a year are unfit to decide the issues that arise between employers and employees. The position has been made worse to-day by the fact that there is an enormously increased volume of work before the industrial tribunals, but, apart from the coal industry, no new machinery has been devised. Every dispute has been forced through the bottle-neck of theArbitration Court. I ask the honorable member for Wakefield (Mr. DuncanHughes) to read the National Security Regulations. He will then see that the union which resorts to direct action is given an advantage over that which does not. The union which rejects direct action files its papers in the court and awaits the courts convenience. The union which goes out on strike, decides to hold stop-work meetings, or passes resolutions about the action that it will take can have its case dealt with without delay. That is wrong. I believe that industrial machinery of a different kind could be set up in this country that would render it unnecessary for men to try to redress their grievances by direct action. In some cases we cannot expect direct action to he abandoned, for instance, in the case of the victimization of a unionist whose mates consider that he has been unfairly dismissed ; hut we could have machinery that would result in strikes, stoppages of work and stop-work meetings being greatly minimized in times of war.The Prime Minister then reverts to the old technique of talking of the strike as the work of the agitator, and particularly the Communist agitator. He and his advisers have read reports of discussions at the Melbourne Trades Hall and other places, and because Labour men and Communists have fought one another the Prime Minister chinks chat he can please members of the Labour party by attacking Communists. It will be found that, no matter how much Labour men are opposed to the Communists, they are not in favour of penal legislation being used against them. Labour men can settle their differences with Communists without the Governments interference. What the Government has done has increased the Communist influence. When, after the war began, Poland and Finland were invaded, the Communist influence was at its nadir. All that was left was a gallant handful, mostly of young people, defending, in most difficult and discouraging circumstances, the policy of Soviet Russia. But the workers did not heed them. Thinking to please the political and religious foes of the Communists, the Government declared their party and their press illegal. The result was to turn in their direction a tide of popular sympathy and the proscribed men and their proscribed opinions are more influential now than they were eighteen months ago. The militant trade union leader, Communist or not, does not create industrial unrest. That unrest is the dissatisfaction of a rank and file who feel themselves now more than ever before able to insist on the redress of their grievances. If the rank and file choose a militant official, whether Communist or not, they do so because they think him best fitted to get them better wages and conditions. However pacific may be the personal disposition of the worker or whatever may be his religious or political belief, he is not satisfied with his lot or that of his class. I thought that the idea of the agitator being the cause of strikes had been discarded long ago. I know that he is unpopular because of his political views but all I am concerned with is the Communist in his industrial work. Although most of the unionists are antagonistic to the Communists, the Government will make a great mistake if it thinks that it can ingratiate itself with the masses of labour by passing penal legislation against Communists, whether they be members of unions or not.The trade unions have asked for legislative preference, but the Prime Minister will not agree to that. He says  I shall give to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court unfettered power to grant unconditional preference to unionists, saving only the rights of soldiers . The Arbitration Court has, for 26 years, had conditional power, hedged in with all kinds of conditions, to give preference to unionists, but the court has refused to give it except in one case. It was prepared to do it in the clothing industry where a large number of women are employed. The court will continue to say that unless there is proof of discrimination against unionists it will not grant preference to them. The Prime Minister knows that as well as I do. He began his career of success as counsel for the trade unions. Other men may lack understanding and knowledge of these things: he does not.The Prime Minister and his Government are making a mistake. I do not believe that the Treasurer (Mr. Fadden) would make such a mistake. The Prime Minister is creating disharmony and discord between capital and labour. He is leaning to those 18th century-minded employers who want strikes prohibited while they still retain power freely to dismiss their employees. The counterpart of the strike is the right of the employer to deal with his men as individual employees. We cannot take away from the employer the right to hire or  fire  as he likes, and we should not take away from the employee the right to strike. The employer deals most effectively with his men as individuals. The employees can deal effectively with their employers only if they do it collectively.Now I come to the matter discussed by- the honorable member for Wakefield (Mr. Duncan-Hughes). I agree with him to the extent that the logical outcome of a recruiting policy is conscription. I believe that those who go on the platform and say that it is the duty of people to serve overseas have no argument in the. long run against the compulsory reinforcement of those serving overseas. Those who do this impliedly promise reinforcements, and also impliedly promise that if reinforcements cannot be obtained voluntarily they will be secured by compulsion. I personally have never believed in sending men overseas. At the federal conference of the Australian Labour party in June, 1940, the party declared that it agreed to sending men overseas on certain conditions, but I say that the conditions now are different, and that the conditions .on which it was said that the party would cease its support of recruiting have now come about. The party then resolved in favour of -Necessary provisions for reinforcement of the Australian Imperial Force divisions, the extent of European participation by volunteer army to be determined by circumstances as they arise, having regard to the paramount necessity to Australias defence.I believe that that paramount necessity of Australias defence demands that the main object of munitions production should be the defence of Australia, and that the first call on the manhood of this country is for its defence. I believe that we should no longer send men to the Middle East. I arn sorry that any have been sent, and 1 believe that those who are there should be recalled, to Australia or to lands adjacent to Australia. That is my own belief on the matter. 1 feel that the continued demand in this country to raise men for service overseas by the voluntary system means that in a short time we shall have no logical answer to the argument that we should compulsorily reinforce them. The man who urges men to go overseas can have no logical answer to the argument that there should be reinforcements by compulsion.","Auckland, Monday","ENROLMENT IN NEW ZEALAND","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[42]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

178,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BLACKBURN, Maurice","JPN","N/A","N/A","N/A",137,"- I believe, and have always believed, that we shall have to fight in Sydney and Newcastle. From the beginning of this war I have said that our membership of the British Commonwealth of Nations commits us to prepare for the defence of this country against invasion by Britains enemy, and that the only alternative was r.he dishonorable one of secession after the war had started. I believe that this country will be attacked, and that its resources should be reserved for its defence, just as the reserves of Britain are being used for its defence. I am glad to see those reserves being used for the defence of Britain. I would much sooner see Australian soldiers defending Britain, as the Canadians are doing, than fighting in the Middle East. In speaking to us during the last sittings of this House the Prime Minister told us that two divisions, an armoured division and an infantry division, mostly Australians, had gone up against twelve divisions of Italians. I do not know what emotion he thought should be aroused by that remark, but my emotion was that of horror at the tremendous risk being taken. In my opinion, our men have been wasted, and no one is more responsible for the waste of them than the Prime Minister. No man takes a less Australian view of Australias needs and Australias rights than does the Prime Minister. His speech last night was not the speech of a statesman. My conception of a statesman is one who, no matter what party he belongs to, puts the achievement and maintenance of national unity before all things. The Prime Minister has not done that. At the beginning of the war I thought he would, but then came the Corio by-election campaign, during which he branded all those who voted against his Government as potential supporters of Hitler. He 3aid that the eyes of Germany were on that by-election, and, in effect, that every vote cast for Labour would be a vote for Hitler. With all his good qualities - and he has -many - I do not regard him as a man who is capable of being in Australia the equivalent of Churchill in England. With all Churchills faults, I find in him a man who tries to be the common measure of British opinion, who refuses to be used by one section of the people against another. He is reckless, he has thrown away lives, but he is a great Englishman. I cannot see our Prime Minister filling, in Great Britain, let alone in Australia, the same role as Churchill fills.","Auckland, Monday","ENROLMENT IN NEW ZEALAND","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[42]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[2]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
179,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CAMERON, Archie","JTY","Barker","N/A","N/A",137,". - Generally speaking, it is not wise or pleasant to hold post-mortems, but the Australian Commonwealth has for some time been in a state in which a little talking over what has led up to the present state of affairs is overdue. The House to-night listened to a very interesting statement from the honorable member for Wakefield (Mr. DuncanHughes), a statement with which I entirely agree. The honorable member for Bourke (Mr. Blackburn) has just made a. pronouncement on the conscription issue which, I think, ought to be broadcast throughout Australia because, whatever his opinions may be on the wisdom of sending men outside Australia, we have never heard a more logical or more straightforward statement from any member of the Opposition on what must be done in order to reinforce our men serving overseas. When we remember what has been said in this House since the outbreak of war on this subject, and note the divisions that have taken place from time to time, we are obliged to remark on the changed attitude of the Opposition. I can understand the attitude of the honorable member for Bourke and of the honorable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan), but I find it difficult to understand the attitude of the majority of the members of the Opposition, or even to comment upon it adequately without resorting to Scripture, and recalling the words -Joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth more than over ninety and nine just persons which need no repentance.There is no record of a greater change of front on the question of participation in the war than that of the Australian Labour party.","Auckland, Monday","ENROLMENT IN NEW ZEALAND","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[42]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

181,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CAMERON, Archie","JTY","N/A","N/A","N/A",138,"- No, I am pleased about it, just as I am pleased to see that the Americans as a nation are doing much more than I ever expected of them. As I say, I cannot refrain from remarking on the changed attitude of the Opposition since the outbreak of the war, nor can 1 forget one or two statements by the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies). Shortly after the outbreak of war he said that we were not at war with the German people, but only with the Nazi Government, the rulers of Germany. My answer at that time was that we were at war, not only with the Nazi Government, but also with the German Air Force, the German Navy, the German Army, the German people and everything that was German, and that stands for to-day.Since I have been a member of this House I have made a number of statements on military matters. In 1935, I made representations to the government of the day that it should commence arrangements for the garrisoning of Singapore, and the defence of Malaya, from this country. I was practically told that I did not know what I was talking about, that such an eventuality would never arise, or, at any rate, that it was so remote that we need not worry about it. In the same year, I published certain articles regarding the need for providing mobile armoured units in Australia. Some honorable members of Parliament agreed with me. Three of them, unfortunately, are not here now. They have been removed, and it is to be regretted. As long ago as 1935 there were members of this House who were studying military developments in Europe, but I do not think that much study of the kind was done by members of the Opposition. When we mentioned such matters we were told that we were merely raising bogeys. When I was Postmaster-General I went to Brisbane, and told the constituents of the honorable member for Brisbane (Mr. George Lawson) - by telephone after I left - that they, would be better off with a new fort at Coloundra than with a new post office. On another occasion I said that, if. we became involved in another war, with France as an ally, we would be let down, that France would crack under the first shock. There were members of this House at the time who said that I was pro-German. Of course, I was not proGerman or anti-French; I was merely trying to be up to date. Again, in February, 1939, I caused some disturbance by stating that the next Australian Imperial Force would not fight in France. Well, the present Australian Imperial Force has not fought in France, and is not likely to do so. Before the war broke out I, as Assistant Minister for Commerce, tried to secure the establishment of the flax industry in Australia. I could make no headway, but it is a pity that the Government had to do last year in a few weeks what ought to have been done in two or three years. In May, 1939, there  was passed through this Parliament a National Register Bill, and if ever an important and necessary measure was mutilated and emasculated by political considerations it was that one. . In the form in which it was finally passed by Parliament, it was. not worth a row of pins, because the Opposition, voting in a solid phalanx, assisted by certain honorable members on this side of the House, had the happy idea that nothing concerning man-power really mattered. We could do anything we liked, so long as we left man-power alone. Then, after the war broke out, a measure which is generally referred to as the Motor Car Monopoly Bill was passed. I, as Leader of the Country party, moved an amendment - which was defeated by 46 votes to 11 - the purpose of which was that we should abandon this fantastic notion of manufacturing motor car engines, and get on with the construction of guns, ships, aeroplanes, and munitions. I now ask members of the Opposition, and those others who voted against me, whether I was right or wrong in that?","Auckland, Monday","ENROLMENT IN NEW ZEALAND","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[42]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[3]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

183,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CAMERON, Archie","JTY","N/A","N/A","N/A",139,"- Other things were even more necessary than that. The Prime Minister made the rather significant statement last night that the fate of this country, whether we win or lose the war, will be determined in 1941. Apparently, that discovery was not made until half the year had already gone. Later I shall refer to that matter again. In respect of the conduct of the war, one of my chief criticisms of the Australian Government ever since the outbreak of the war, and for some time as a member of It, is that too little regard has been paid to the principles of war in the conduct of our operations. This started off in Norway where an excellent opportunity was afforded us if we had had the troops and the ships rightly disposed. But the story there was that we were rather late. All of us know the story of France. There, again, we. were outwitted ; the attack caine where we were not prepared for it. The nature of the attack was forecast, but for some reason or other the necessary preparations were not in hand. We know the story of the Low Countries, and later the campaign in south-eastern Europe. Whether the Government likes it or not, it is its responsibility to decide in what theatre of war we shall fight. That responsibility cannot be cast upon the generals. Governments decide the theatres of war; they appoint the commander-in-chief, and they allot to him the services, communications and supplies: I refer to this fact because I am afraid that before we are through with some of the campaigns we are now indulging in, there will be a tendency on the part of some people to look for scapegoats; they will want to blame other people, and I do not want to see the  Y  knocked off the name of a famous Australian general. Looking at the position to-day we have to consider particularly the Middle East.","Auckland, Monday","ENROLMENT IN NEW ZEALAND","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[42]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[3]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

185,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CAMERON, Archie","JTY","N/A","N/A","N/A",139,"- It would be a muddle if the honorable gentleman had anything to do with it. We have to look at the theatres of war, and see what they mean to the British Empire. To-day, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Curtin) had much to say about the Battle for Britain and the Battle for the Atlantic; and he used other current phrases.. I am not very much interested in the way some of the fighting is described in the press. I am no enthusiast for grandiloquent phrases; but there is a tendency to coin them, and they never pay. We had an excellent exhibition of that fact in North Africa not long ago. First, there is the position in the Atlantic. If Great Britain he defeated by Germany in the Atlantic Britain will be starved into submission, and Germany will not need to bear the cost of any expeditionary force. But in this fight Germany has two strings to its bow. If Great Britain wins the Battle of the Atlantic, it is still possible for Germany, if Germany has the forces and can get them to Britain, to defeat Britain by an invasion. These two things have to be provided against. They are two separate problems which we have to consider in relation to Great Britain itself. Then we have the very important theatre of the Far East in which we ourselves arc deeply interested. The position there affects not only ourselves and New Zealand, but must also vitally affect the future of South Africa, India, Burma, the Malay States, and the dozen or so British colonies and protectorates scattered in those areas. Next we have the other theatre in which Australian troops are predominantly engaged ; that is the Middle East.. For the time being we have to admit that so far as man-power is concerned, we are well behind Germany, and it is useless for the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Opposition, or any other honorable member, to talk about equality of man-power at present. That equality does not, exist and it is not in sight. Indeed, so far as the white areas of the British Empire are concerned, that equality can never be established because there is a far greater number of Germans in the Germany of to-day than there are whites in the British Empire. There was a time when it was said by the Turks that Allah gave the land to the Turks and the sea to the infidel. I think that we have to pay a little attention to that. In such areas we must rely predominantly on seapower at the present time. Sea-power is very important, and in order to exercise it, correct bases are essential. Finally, it is necessary for the Commonwealth to display a more than lively interest in the position that faces us in the Malay States.Having looked at the Middle East as a theatre of war, we must try to define our objectives in that area. I say that one of the first is the security of our bases, namely, Palestine and Egypt. The second thing we should have done was to clear the Italians from Abyssinia, Eritrea and North Africa. We commenced that campaign very successfully. One of the most brilliant- military campaigns in history was that drive through to Benghazi by that very small force, which carried the grandiloquent title of the Imperial Army of the Nile. I do not detract from the fine achievements of that force which consisted of one armoured division and one infantry division. The tragedy is that that campaign was not completed, and that the drive was not continued right through to the French border, because one of the things we had to watch in the Middle East was the necessity for giving French North Africa and Syria something to lean upon. But the North African campaign at that time was going along easily. Our casualties were the lowest ever suffered in history. Having done part of the job, that force was divided, and some of it was sent to Greece. I do not want to be over-critical of a Minister of a Government which is not responsible to this House, but it is rather significant that Mr. Anthony Eden made a trip to that area just before that campaign started. I do not look upon him as one of the great geniuses of the British Empire when it comes to international relations. In the international sphere in respect of any theory of war, I should look upon him as I would a crow in a paddock in which there were a lot of ewes and lambs. Then there was a great necessity to drive through to French Tripoli, to clear up the bridge-head formed by Tripoli in North Africa. In that campaign, we saw the Navy being used for the transport of troops, a job for which it should not have to be used. Certain troops were sent across to Greece. Sooner or later, I have no doubt that the rights and wrongs of the campaign in Greece will be debated in this House.","Auckland, Monday","ENROLMENT IN NEW ZEALAND","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[42]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[3]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

187,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CAMERON, Archie","JTY","N/A","N/A","N/A",140,"- I have a few views myself on the employment of that force there. At this juncture, I say that it was not necessary to send troops to Mount Olympus to interview the gods there, nor was it necessary to send any to Thermopylae to report to the shade of Leonidas, because it was known that British and New Zealand troops could if necessary fight a hopeless battle there. Reverting to the subject of man-power raised by the honorable member for Wakefield, I point out that if you are the belligerent weakest in manpower, then it is all the more necessary for you to conserve the man-power you have trained. Again, I say that if this House had been wise enough early in the war to provide for the five divisions I then proposed, then owing to the influence we would have been  able to exert our position in North Africa and in Syria might be entirely different from what it is to-day. Instead of having only one division to send to Wavell for the drive into Tripoli, we might have been able to provide three or four divisions in that area. All this lost, ground must be made up. Events will develop from time to time which will have to be considered very seriously. The fighting in Syria has not been cleared up. Our problem there is a little sterner, perhaps, than we have been led to expect by reading the reports by some people who have been in those areas. It has been stated by one German, who deals with troops in a large way, that the first principle of strategy is to concentrate your strongest forces against the enemys weakest forces. I trust that the Government, one of whose service Ministers has just come into the chamber will bear that strongly in mind when handling any force in the future. I am not one who raises his voice against the sending of men into action. It is to send men into action that we raise them, and once men are in a war they must go into action. However, the more men we have trained and equipped to go into action, then the better chance they have of coming out of action successfully. But when it comes to selecting battle grounds and theatres of war, certain considerations must he borne in mind by the Government. I simply say to the Government that no war can be run successfully on sentiment. There has been too much sentimental nonsense talked with regard to our participation in certain campaigns during this war. If we take a look at Greece - and, for the time being, I am prepared to be an Aunt Sally for the press - we must realize that it was a miracle that the Greeks were ever able to hold the Italians in the way they did. However, to expect them to disengage from the Italians and shift a great body of their forces with insufficient transport at their disposal to the Florina Gap, and meet one of the strongest German armies that has ever been sent to the Balkans, was asking too much of the Greeks. The men who agreed to things like that simply did not know what they were doing. That is all I have to say about that matter at this stage.","Auckland, Monday","ENROLMENT IN NEW ZEALAND","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[42]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[3]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

191,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CAMERON, Archie","JTY","N/A","N/A","N/A",141,"- It is a most interesting question.My contention regarding the present position in Australia - a contention which I have never ceased, to advance since we entered upon this war - is that we must meet total war with total war. There is nothing else for it. I am asked to accept the Prime Ministers statement as being the Governments idea of total war. All I have to comment to this Parliament, and to the country to which I owe some responsibility, is that a wide gap exists between my notion of total war and that to which the Government has given expression. Although the speech of the right honorable gentleman contained no reference to man-power, to the necessity for mobilizing men and for training men, I noticed a statement that Service Ministers are to confer with lady heads of certain womens organizations, and in the circumstances, I may be pardoned for telling the Government that it must do a good deal better than that. If the Government believes that this struggle will be satisfactorily settled over a cup of afternoon tea partaken with a few -ladies and the appointment of somebody out of a corset establishment as a squadron leader to the Air Force, it is making another mistake.I could refer to many matters which are causing irritation to the forces and which should never have arisen, but I do not propose to weary the House with a recital of them. For some time the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Forde) has occupied a very responsible position as a member of the Australian Advisory War Council, whatever that institution happens to be. My views on it were well known before it was constituted, and they have not changed. A short time ago Parliament adjourned for six days in order to allow honorable members to view the visiting American squadron in Sydney. My views on the subject were well known in certain quarters, and some very interesting meetings were held in various places, because some people seemed to think that I might do anything at any time. In that, of course, they were quite wrong; but I invite the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to express an opinion as to whether I was right or wrong on that occasion. Would not Parliament have been better employed in debating for three or four days the question of the employment, the reinforcement, the supply, and the training of our. men overseas instead of adjourning in order to allow honorable members tÂ» visit. Sydney to see the American squadron? Only one answer could lbc given to that question. Once more, for some unaccountable reasons, I proved to be right. These matters are serious. This year Parliament has been rarely in session. Certain items which appear on the notice-paper require urgent attention. Regulations. demand debate and decision, but again, I am left with the very, very awkward feeling of a distinct desire on the part of the Government to evade a decision upon such matters. These regulations could never bc justified in any country in which the Government understood the meaning of total war. In this country to-da.y, things are going on which would never be tolerated in any other country at war. Loud squeals are heard about petrol rationing. At Warrnambool recently, a race meeting of three days duration was held, and numbers of horses were transported from Melbourne, by petrol-driven vehicles. Yet the Government is supposed to bc organizing the country for total war ! Although the petrol position is serious, speed boats continue to race across Port Phillip Bay and Sydney Harbour. It is disgusting. If the Government thinks that it is organizing Australia for total war and total defence along those lines, it may be deceiving itself, but it is not deceiving the great majority of the people. .Before long many very awkward things will have to be done. The Government will have to take a grip of the man-power of this country. A feeling of apathy is abroad to-day that is not for the best. The honorable member for Wakefield referred to it,, and I am not unconscious of its existence. Advertisements have appeared in the newspapers; I do not know what they cost the taxpayer: but it. was most interesting to see the photographs of certain members of the Government and of the Opposition with the following caption,  Ve speak to you as one .

[Leave to continue gwen.]War to-day is much more complicated than ever before. A division, a battalion, or any unit has a greater variety of needs and requires much more intricate organization. A well equipped army in the field to-day contains units which were never utilized in the last war, and it stands to reason that the more complicated and technical the army becomes, the greater the necessity for intensively training the men who are to use the weapons. They have to be recruited early ; they have to get accustomed to the weapons ;. they have to be given ammunition for the weapons and taken out on large-scale manoeuvres; they must have experience of digging in and of moving, of protecting convoys, and of obtaining protection against air raids. Under the present system, that is not being done, and in certain quarters the necessity for this training is not. realized.The Leader of the Opposition referred to the aircraft position. Honorable members opposite would be delighted if they could twist certain statements which I have made on more than one occasion and which are as true to-day as they were at the time they were delivered, namely, that a campaign cannot be won by aircraft alone. Aircraft must have bases from which they start and to which they return. They have to be protected in the air by other aircraft, and on the ground by gunfire. The big role that aircraft still has to play is first, that- of reconnaissance and observation, secondly, that, of bombing. If Germany were able to conduct a campaign with aircraft alone, then the Avar in Great Britain would have been over long ago. As it is, the Germans have made big concentrations on city after city. Whilst I do not decry the value of an air force, I regret the tendency, even in this 23rd month of the war, to look upon the position as being one in which we can rely on aircraft alone and forget about the navy and the infantry divisions. That is wrong. We must, take a very, careful stock of this situation. I admit frankly that I advocate conscription, because it is the only democratic method under which troops can be raised for active service. When talking about the campaign in Greece, honorable gentlemen opposite should study the history of that country, which was the motherland of democracy. They would find that whether it was Athens or Sparta, Elis or Thebes, every armed force of that community consisted of free men. If a man did not fight, he could not vote and, in some cities, he could not marry. The sooner we have it laid down that the duties of citizenship in Australia are not confined to voting at elections and to the payment of taxes, but include defending under arms, whenever the occasion arises, the soil and the interests of this country even beyond its territorial waters, the better it will be for Australia. If the members of the Opposition would look across the Tasman Sea to the sister dominion of New Zealand they would discover that the Labour Government there, which is as  true blue  or as  true red  as any Labour party in Australia, carries out successfully a policy of conscription for overseas service. If the Australian Labour party would follow that excellent example we might have in this country a much greater show of real unity than that which exists under the thin veneer of newspaper articles andwireless talks that we have to-day. We might then he able to produce out of such a condition of affairs, a real mobilization of the manpower of the country which we lack today, and for which no proposal of the Government has yet provided.","Auckland, Monday","ENROLMENT IN NEW ZEALAND","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[42]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[3]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
194,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"WARD, Edward","KX7","East Sydney","N/A","N/A",143,".- The directors of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited must have been immensely pleased when they listened to the speech of the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) last night, because it is evident that the Government, which is under the domination of this big monopolistic group, intends so to organize the nation that the privileges of that enterprise will be preserved. In the jingoistic speeches that have been delivered to-day from the other side of the chamber, the slogan with which we commenced the war was not repeated. On that occasion we were told that we were fighting to defend democracy. That was the appeal which was made originally to the Labour movement; but in this discussion honorable members opposite have not mentioned it. Most members who support the Government approve of Nazi methods in every direction with one exception, and that is where the Nazi influence may be affecting the interests of the wealthy British capitalists in any part of the world. Some of them are now very outspoken. There were no conscriptionists among them during the general election campaign, for they all said that they intended to adhere strictly to the voluntary system of raising troops for overseas service, but one or two of them were a little more outspoken than their colleagues. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Harrison), for instance, was reported as having said on one occasion -To apply democratic methods when we are facing an all-in war is absurd.The Postmaster-General (Senator McLeay) said nothing about fighting this war for democracy but he did say -I believe that if we had taken action against extremists, going back to the coal strike and interned them - there would be fewer strikes in Australia. We may be forced to do it yet, and I hope the Government will have the courage to do it.The Treasurer (Mr. Fadden) was reported in the Adelaide News of the 10th February, 1941, as follows : -If the noisy elements to whom we are subjected every day represented the average opinion of the workers in this country, I would say that the sooner we let Hitler run this country the better.These honorable gentlemen would still like us to believe that we are fighting the war in order to defend democracy.The Prime Minister himself was a proNazi right up to the outbreak of the war. He was reported in one of the Sydney daily newspapers as follows, when he was asked to comment upon a speech delivered by Hitler in the Reichstag: -For myself, I repeat what I said when I came back from England last September - it is imperative that we should get to understand the German point of view, and so help to destroy the German delusion that the democratic countries do not understand her, and have no sympathy with any of her ambitions.I know that when any public man offers the opinion that the German point of view ought to be studied and understood some fathead will accuse him of being a Nazi or u Fascist.Bui even this should not deter us from appreciating the fact that what .the world wants more than anything else to-day is mutual understanding and tolerance.We all remember, I am sure, the speech which the right honorable gentleman delivered in Perth shortly- after his return from a previous visit overseas in which he discussed the Hitler regime. He did not utter one word of protest against the attacks made by Hitler on the trade union movement, or against the action of Hitler in placing minorities in concentration camps. What is the right honorable gentleman proposing to do now? He wants to regiment the whole population for the purposes of the war. No one must dare criticize the Government. People who are branded as Communists must be placed in concentration camps. Officially there are no Communists in the country. What authority is to determine who are Communists? Where are they to be found?I listened with a great deal of attention to the speech which the right honorable gentleman delivered in this House on the 28th May, and noted particularly his remark concerning politics. The right honorable gentleman had previously stated in a speech in the Sydney Town Hall that it depressed him to think that he had to return to Australia to play the diabolical game of politics and that he objected very strongly to it. But he has had nothing to say about the failure of the British Government to prevent, profiteering and the exploitation of the common people. In Great Britain to-day there is a great deal of food racketeering. Some people are hoarding foodstuffs with the object of forcing up prices. Other people are living in luxury hotels although some of their fellow citizens cannot get enough to eat. Many people have been bombed out of their homes but the racketeering landlords have skyrocketed rents. Moreover, homeless people who ask for accommodation in the homes of the well-to-do are turned away. The Prime Minister had nothing to say about what the British Government proposed to do to overcome these abuses. This glossing over of such abuses should demonstrate that the one who is  playing  the game of politics is the Prime Minister himself. I direct the attention of honorable members to the following report which appeared in a recent issue of the Sydney Morning Herald : -BRITAIN UNDER BOMBING - CONTRASTS IN MISERY AND LUXURY.Unfortunately there are privileged sections who are still resisting fiercely any threat to what they regard as their rights and are selfishly and complacently asking others to bear the burdens which are necessary if victory is to be won.To some extent that kind of thing is going on in Australia.The honorable member for Wakefield (Mr. Duncan-Hughes) said that every body should be called upon to make sacrifices, but he would have great difficulty in describing any sacrifices that he has made since the war began. Many of the workers of Australia have been denied reasonable conditions for many years, and numbers of single men have had to exist for long periods on a weekly dole of 8s. 6d. The honorable member for Wakefield said that we shall have to ration ourselves and make sacrifices. The unfortunate workers to whom I have referred have had to ration themselves for years. Many of thom are still required to do so. The sustenance provided for them is not sufficient to keep body and soul together.Let us examine, for a moment, the proposals which the Prime Minister made last night. The honorable member for Wakefield and the honorable member for Barker (Mir. Archie Cameron) are now openly declaring themselves in favour of conscription. What the Government is proposing to introduce by subterfuge is a policy of economic conscription. I sincerely trust that no honorable member of the Labour party will be misled into accepting these proposals. In effect, the Government tells us that it proposes to order certain industries to close down, and to declare certain other industries as non-essential. The Manpower and Resources Survey Committee is to be called upon to review the list of reserved occupations. I ask honorable members opposite what is to happen to the men at present engaged in the newspaper industry who will lose their employment as the result of paper rationing? What is to happen, also, to the people who will lose their employment as the result of the intensified rationing of petrol? Is it intended that these men shall be absorbed immediately into other industries? Not at all, because the Government intends to make provision for the employment of women in many industries so that men may be released. In effect, the Governments policy is designed to starve men so that they will be compelled to join the armed forces. I repeat that I sincerely trust that no membet of the Labour party will be misled into supporting such a policy.We are told that insufficient recruits are offering for the services, and it has been stated that the voluntary recruiting campaign has been a failure. That is not surprising. It amazes me that so many men have offered for overseas service under the conditions laid down. The Government is- not prepared to pay the recruits a decent wage. It asks them to accept a miserable 5s. a day and to risk their lives on active service with poor equipment, while many other men, especially those who control our great industries improve their position and enlarge their profits as the result of the war.There is no prospect in these days of a working man ever obtaining a commission in the Army because democratic methods in connexion with commissions has been abandoned. The procedure of those in control of Army affairs is to hand out favours to the privileged few. Commissions are provided for the sons of well-to-do families regardless of military experience or merit. The procedure for such young men seems to be to make some inquiry, and arrange for commissions, and after having done so to enlist. Under this system we find that social darlings without any military experience join the forces and are whisked away to an officers training school. They serve there for a few weeks and come out as full-blown officers, albeit without experience. As such they are placed in positions where they may lord it over other men with many years of military training and experience. Let me give a few specific instances -Peter Playfair, eighteen years of age, son of the Honorable T. Playfair, M.L.C., of the Fresh Food and Ice Company, joined the forces and in a few weeks obtained & commission.Anthony Hordern, junr., was sent to an officers training school.Macfarlane V. Nathan, son of the very wealthy Mr. V. Nathan, enlisted in July, 1940. was made a corporal, and then sent to Duntroon Military College.Phillip Lloyd Jones, son of one of the principals of David Jones Limited, took six weeks to become an officer.This kind of thing is causing the ranks of the Army to seethe with discontent. A military order was issued from headquarters shortly after the outbreak of war to the effect that no man of more than 27 years of age is to be considered eligible for commissioned rank. That means that a large body of men who served in the Militia forces for years prior to the war and thereby gained valuable experience cannot be considered for commissioned rank. So much for the stupid military bureaucracy that is to-day in charge of our military affairs. It is scandalous that carefully selected young men from certain favoured families should be enabled to lord it over men with long and valuable military experience gained in service in the Militia, frequently in an honorary capacity, in the years prior to the outbreak of the war.There is another reason for the discontent that is rife in the Army. While it is extremely difficult for men who have trained in the Militia to gain commissions, it is extremely easy foi* any man who held commissioned rank during the last war to obtain a commission in this war, though he may never see active service. In all of the States to-day it is a. common thing to find grey-headed, tottering old gentlemen wearing officers uniforms of almost any rank performing simple clerical work in the barracks and drawing substantial pay for so doing.Earlier in this debate a speaker referred to the ease with which certain individuals are able to obtain commissions. We were reminded that, in one instance, the qualification was simply the ability to sing a comic song well. We all know that Jim Gerald is now a lieutenant-colonel. I understand that Jim Davidson also holds a commission because of his ability to conduct a jazz band. I feel quite sure that it would be possible to find a majors crown for  Mo  should he enlist, and no doubt commissions could also be found for the tumblers in Wirths circus.We may also call to mind the action of the Minister for the Army (Mr. Spender) in appointing himself a lieutenant-colonel. Bie went abroad for a trip without, I understand, the knowledge or consent of the Government, but entirely on his own initiative. I was amazed that he did not remain overseas for, after his return to Australia, he said on one occasion: I discussed plans for Bardia before the attack was made . Apparently the honorable gentleman genuinely thought that he had some claim to commissioned rank. At any rate he promoted himself to the rank of lieutenant-colonel. I believe he is in what is called the legal battalion, though I cannot understand what its functions are. Maybe it is intended to argue constitutional points with Hitler on some future occasion!Mr.Wilson. - No doubt the legal battalion will be good at charges.","Auckland, Monday","ENROLMENT IN NEW ZEALAND","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[42]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

He does not know why, and the Government refuses to give any reason. Greek citizens, who are said to be our allies, have been interned without any reason being given for their internment. The authorities are still grabbing workers from different quarters and placing them in internment camps without giving any reason for their action. Yet privileged enemy aliens in the community are able to retain their liberty ! I raised at question time to-day a matter concerning a relative of the Minister for the Army (Mr. Spender), who admitted that the gentleman in question - Hentze - is his brother-in-law. The honorable gentleman did not make a complete reply to my question. I wanted to know whether the Department of Military Intelligence had made certain reports and recommendations with respect to this man; whether it was not reported and known by the Department of Military Intelligence that he. had been in constant touch with prominent Nazis in Germany; and whether it was not true that, after a warrant had been issued for his arrest and he had actually been taken to an internment camp, he was released on representations made, and personal guarantees given, by the Minister for the Army.

The Commonwealth Savings Bank held Commonwealth Government securities amounting to Â£108,600,000 at the 31st December, 1939, and of a value of Â£103,000,000 at the 31st December, 1940. Compared with 1939, the value of the securities held at the 31st December, 1940, showed a reduction of over Â£21,000,000, which proves conclusively that the accommodation provided by this institution was actually reduced during that period, and that any banking accommodation obtained by the Government was provided by the private banks in the subscriptions they made to the loans that, were issued over a certain period. So much for the statement of Government members that national credit is being used to the limit of safety.

I interjected :  The honorable gentlemans bosses would not permit him to do so; and the honorable gentleman said: Bosses have nothing to do with it.

I understand that it is proposed to establish a parliamentary committee consisting of representatives of all parties to control and regulate profits. How can that be done, and what are the powers of this committee to be? Is it to have complete power to examine the taxation returns of large companies, and demand the production of all books and documents which the committee desires to peruse? Unless the committee has such powers, and also the power to limit profits, where it believes such action to be necessary, it will be so much humbug to talk about setting up such a committee. According to the Prime Minister, the Prices Commissioner, Professor Copland, has been working effectively in -restricting profiteering. Regarding the brewing industry, the Prices Commissioner said that a great deal of care had been exercised in seeing that the brewing companies were not exploiting the public. In September, 1939, the price of bottled beer was increased by Id. a bottle, and in November, 1940, there was a further increase of 2d. a bottle, making a total increase of 3s. a dozen. There are six bottles of beer to the gallon, and the increases of duty granted in September, 1939, and November, 1940, amounted to ls. a gallon. Therefore, the brewing interests passed on to the general public by way of increases of the price of bottled beer, an amount 200 per cent, in excess of the amount they should have been permitted to pass on. . It is not surprising that press reports have appeared under the heading Record Brewery Profits. Carlton and United . Similar profits have been made by all breweries. When the workers decided to have a beer strike against this exploitation, one of our national leaders - I refer to the Minister for the Interior (Senator Foll) - came forward with the statement that anybody who advocated a beer strike was a fifth columnist. According to that Minister, the way to win the war is not to produce more tanks, warships and shells, but to drink more beer ! These are the kind of men who are in charge of the affairs of this country. One would imagine that there is no proof of profiteering.

Some months have elapsed since the discovery that inferior military boots had been supplied by a certain manufacturer, but the case has not yet come before the High Court, and many members of the public are wondering when the Government will urge the court to deal with the matter. Honorable members recall what happened a little over twelve months ago when Labour members drew attention to the scandal in the boot industry. It was pointed out that an examiner in Sydney who had been rejecting military boots supplied by certain manufacturers had been removed from his position, and sent to another State. Although the matter was brought under the notice of the Government, nothing was done with regard to it. When the elections were in progress, advertisements appeared in the daily press, not advertising the wares of the particular manufacturer concerned, but telling the public that the Government had been getting full value for the money expended in the supply of boots to the Army, the Air Force and the Navy. The firm concerned was Fostars but the man behind the scene was Mr. Harry McEvoy, who was very friendly with the member of the Government who was being hotly assailed in Parramatta at that time in regard to this scandal. I do not know why the Government has been tardy in taking action against this firm, but I could make a shrewd guess. If honorable members desire first-hand information regarding the matter, I suggest that they refer to the member of whom I have just spoken. When our troops were being evacuated from Greece, many of them had no boots at all. Many of those who had been fighting Australias battle under arduous conditions in that theatre of war, had been sacrificed because of the greed of profiteers in this country, against whom the Government is not prepared to act. Many pairs of inferior boots were no doubt supplied to our troops, and were worn by them in Greece. The Government was prepared to risk the lives of these men because it was not willing to do the right thing. It has one eye on profits and the other on the winning of the war. We shall never get proper organization from a Government which is tied to vested interests, and whose members are interested in many directions in the profit earning capacity of many of our industries. The only way in which to organize the national effort properly is to eliminate private profit entirely.","N/A","EMPLOYMENT WANTED","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[44]/para[15]","N/A","N/A"

Many industries have been established in the East, where an ample supply of cheap labour is available, and I am wondering whether these industries will be retained and many Australian workmen will be found walking the streets in search of employment after the war has been won. A Victoria Cross winner who died in Melbourne recently had been in necessitous circumstances for a number of years, and for long periods had been without work. Evidently, a Victoria Cross means nothing when the war is over, but, when the Kings Birthday honours are handed out, knighthoods are bestowed on certain persons. It would be interesting to find out why many of those who hold these decorations managed to secure them. It appears that a title given for reasons other than valour on the battle-field enables the. holder to obtain a lucrative position on company directorates, but, if a man has won the Victoria Cross, he can wear it and obtain the plaudits of the crowd on Anzac Day, and go without work or eke out a bare existence as best he can for the rest of the year.

The war could not be carried on for five minutes without the co-operation of Labour. Is it not Labour which mans the trenches, which sails the ships, and makes the munitions ? Yet, when surplus food is accumulating in this country the Government does not take steps to ensure that the people shall have plenty. It says, Let us plow the apples into the ground. We cannot give them to the people because we cannot afford it. The Government appointed a committee which is telling the  common people , as the Prime Minister called them how they should conduct themselves, and what they should eat. This committee has worked out a ration on a mathematical basis, as one might do for a horse. Here is its suggested diet for a family of five, the parents, and two boys, one fourteen and the other eight years old, and a girl twelve years old: For breakfast, the father - who is an active man doing strenuous work - is to have 12 oz. of oatmeal porridge, moderately thick, the 12 oz. to include the water. He is to have two slices of fried bread with two teaspoonsful of treacle. I do not know what would happen if he wanted another slice of bread. Probably some other member of the family would have to go without. . In addition, he is allowed a  level  teaspoonful of butter and cocoa. Great care must be taken, apparently, to see that by no chance does he have a heaped teaspoonful of butter or cocoa. The other members of the family are to receive something less. This ration reminds me somewhat of the menus in the parliamentary dining-room. For the  Sunday special  there is to be a leg of mutton, costing approximately ls. lid. After the family has had its Sunday meal off this joint, it goes to make shepherds pie, whatever that may be. Probably some honorable member of the Country party might be able to tell us. The same joint must also provide sandwiches for lunch on Monday and Tuesday, and mutton broth on Tuesday evening.

230,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BREEN, John","JS9","Calare","N/A","N/A",154,".- I desire to bring to the notice of the House certain anomalies in the administration of the Repatriation Commission in dealing with claims for pensions by ex-soldiers. I have in my hand two letters from the department concerning the cases of two ex-soldiers. Up to about three or four months ago the first, who is sixty years of age, and who fought in both the Boer war and the war of 1914- 18, was in receipt of a service pension. The second man fought in the last war, and his degree of incapacity has been reduced from 100 per cent, to 30 per cent.The first point I emphasize is that the department seems to deal with many of these cases in a stereotyped fashion. The first man to whom I refer received the following advice from the department: -With reference to your claim for acceptance of nerves, neuritis, sciatica and stomach trouble as due to war service, you are informed that after full investigation you were found to be suffering spondylitis and osteoarthritis, mild deafness, pulmonary fibrosis, arterio-sclerosis, and old injury to the chest.He was refused, a war pension. In the second case the disabilities were diagnosed as gastric-neurosis, hyperchlorhydria, spondylitis and arteriosclerosis which the commission decided was due to war service. Although the diagnosis is practically the same in each of these two cases the commission refuses a pension to the older man, who is a resident of Manildra. He is now being prosecuted by the commission for the return of alleged over-payments of pension. He was receiving a service pension of Â£1 a week. Being a bush worker he was not able to look after himself when he fell sick. As he was refused medical assistance by the Repatriation Commissioner, he had to go to an hotel in order to obtain that consideration which he would have received in hospital, but which he could not afford. After a period of rest at the hotel his condition improved, but at the end of that period he found that he owed between Â£20 and Â£30 to the hotel-keeper for his accommodation. Being honest, he agreed to work for the hotel-keeper at whatever labour he could do in order to pay off his debt. The Repatriation Commission then said that he was earning more than Â£1 a week, although, as a matter of fact, he was not earning any money, but simply giving service to the hotel-keeper in payment for his accommodation during his period of illness when he was unable to fend for himself. It appears to me that the department has acted very inconsistently in granting a pension to the younger man, and, at the same time, refusing a pension to the older man, when the medical diagnosis in each case is similar. Originally, the younger mans incapacity was rated at 100 per cent. He was suffering from a gunshot wound in a leg which he received at the landing at Gallipoli. His reputation and courage as a soldier was beyond reproach. However, after a period of treatment his degree of incapacity was reduced to 30 per cent. As he grows older his present injuries will become more aggravated. The two cases I have mentioned are only isolated instances of similar treatment being meted out by the Repatriation Commission to ex-soldier pensioners resident in my electorate. Surely the Government realizes that these men have friends throughout the country, and that when it is appealing for recruits they, and the friends of many other ex-soldiers who have received similar treatment at the hands of the commission, will point out to potential recruits that, when this Government promises that when they come back from the war after making the world safe for democracy, their sacrifices will be recognized, it is not likely that this Government, which is the modern prototype of the Government of twenty years ago, will be any more ready to honour its promises. The military authorities are seeking the reason for the lack of recruits. I have submitted to the House logical reasons why many young men are hesitating. They doubt the sincerity of the Governments promise to ensure equality of sacrifice in the prosecution of the war. If the Government is capable of seeing the truth, it will rectify the injustice which has been done to the veterans of the last war, and such action, though belated, will stimulate recruiting.","Brisbane, Monday","WAR ORDERS HELD UP","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[46]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
231,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CALWELL, Arthur","BV8","Melbourne","N/A","N/A",155,". - I make a further appeal to the Government in connexion with the London Stores Building in Melbourne, a portion of which the Department of the Interior has secured from the owners for the use of the Pay-rollTax Department, which will administer the child endowment scheme. About a fortnight ago, the honorable member for Henty (Mr. Coles) and the honorable member for Parkes (Sir Charles Marr) asked questions about it, and I mentioned the subject on the motion for the adjournment of the House; but apparently the Ministry is adamant in its determination not to do justice to the tenants of the building. They are to be dispossessed, because the owners will receive from the Government the benefit of a five-years lease with the possibility of an extension for a similar period. An added advantage is that the Government will make structural alterations costing Â£6,000. In those and many other ways, the Government will be a more profitable tenant than the people who are to be evicted. Of the 80 original tenants, about 60 have already left, but the remainder have asked me to make a statement on their behalf and to urge the Minister, if it is not yet too late, to stay his hand and acquire other premises in Melbourne, for instance, in the Century building.These tenants claim that they have taken their stand for the following reasons: First, they felt that the  sacrifice  that the London Stores Limited told them it was making did not involve equality of sacrifice at all. Secondly, they were advised by several United Australia party members and senators and many Opposition members and senators to stand firm and fully exhaust their legal rights. Thirdly, their legal advisers told them that under the National Security Regulations they could not be forced to quit unless the owner either sold the premises or desired to occupy them himself. On the 28th May, the tenants served a writ through the Supreme Court, Melbourne, on London Stores Limited. At the request of the firm several days later, the tenants agreed to allow the case to be adjourned to a time to be arranged, on the understanding that the status quo was to be maintained.On the 6th June, the solicitor for the tenants wrote to the Department of the Interior asking for confirmation of the various press statements made by the Minister for the Interior (SenatorFoll) concerning the payment to his clients of compensation! The only reply that the solicitor has received is indirectly from the solicitors for London Stores Limited to the effect that the matter was being decided in Canberra. The status quo has not been kept. Walls have been knocked down around the rooms of nearly all of the remaining tenants. The resultant dust and rubble has made the carrying on of business almost an impossibility. That has been done despite the injunction order which is in operation. I raise the issue in the hope that the Department of the Interior will do justice to the tenants. If they are forced to leave their premises, they will carry the loss because there seems to be no immediate prospect of compensation being paid, and all the talk of equality of sacrifice is, in their opinion, of a chimerical nature. It is most unfair treatment of good citizens, who have been singled out because they are  little  people. Previously, I suggested that the Government could take over several stories of the Myer Emporium Limited, because a wealthy corporation can better afford to make the sacrifice than 80 small tenants. The Government, in spite of the Prime Ministers statement that he is no longer interested in the maintenance of the  old order , is still very chary about interfering with the vested interests that dominate the  old order .I now bring to the notice of the Assistant Minister some information concerning coal prices. A Melbourne firm of coal merchants sent to a number of fuel merchants on the 20th May last a circular letter which read -We have to advise that Mr. Justice Drake-Brockman, Chairman of Central Reference Board (Coal-mining Industry) has issued an award granting wage increases of 4 per cent, to contract employees and 5 per cent, to non-contract employees which will increase the cost of coal at Newcastle on and after 19th instant.Application is now being made to Commonwealth Prices Commissioner by Colliery Proprietors for authority to increase the price of coal to cover additional costs.We therefore have to inform you the price of coal will bc advanced in Melbourne in consequence of increases at Newcastle, and we will let you know as soon as possible the amount of actual increase.If ever there was a piece of arrogance, it is surely expressed in that letter. The firm treats the .Commonwealth Prices Commissioner as though he were a mere automaton to register increases, because the coal proprietors had decided to make application for the granting of the increase. It assumed, in the last paragraph, that the increase would be granted automatically. Bad and all as that is, I find from the accounts that have been rendered to one fuel merchant in May last that this particular firm had the audacity to insert on the monthly account, the following words :  To extra 6d. per ton on coal purchased between the 17th and the 31st March. The fuel merchant bought the coal in March and sold it to the general public. He has now no opportunity to pass on that increase to the purchasers of the coal during that period; but this avaricious firm, not satisfied with passing on the 4 per cent, to contractor employees, and 5 per cent, to noncontractor employees, decided to impose a further 6d. a ton on coal that was purchased a couple of months before the proposed increase. Even if the firm had obtained authority to increase the price of coal and make it retrospective, it has no right to ask a merchant, in such circumstances, to bear the loss occasioned by the increase. If anybody is to bear the loss it should not be the small man, but the coal-owners.This evening, a constituent informed me that if the Governments scheme for excluding certain types of motor car businesses from - access to supplies of petrol is given effect immediately, he will become insolvent overnight. This man conducts two businesses and he told me that there is one other big business of a like nature in Melbourne and five or six smaller businesses in and around the suburbs. He has 35 cars, valued at approximately Â£16,000. The major portion of his business is of a commercial nature, and is not pleasure-riding by people who can afford to hire a car and drive themselves. He assured me that, throughout Melbourne, 150 cars are affected by the Governments decision regarding vehicles that are hired out to persons to drive themselves. Those 150 cars are doing more commercial work than taxicabs and the great majority are used for commercial purposes essential to the every-day life of the nation. In fact, a misapprehension exists regarding the purpose for which the cars are used. I am confident that the Parliament desires to ease as much as possible the difficulties of the people concerned in the industry, and I suggest that no action should be taken pending an investigation of the whole problem. The Government should allow the car-owners to put forward their contentions in order that, a more equitable system of restriction may be imposed. I hope that the Assistant Minister will give me an assurance that my constituent will have an opportunity to make representations to the Government. There can be no equality of sacrifice in a procedure that will send a firm into the bankruptcy court overnight through no fault of its own. The firm is willing to allow a departmental officer to examine its books to satisfy himself as to its bona fides.Prior to the last adjournment of the House I asked the. Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Harrison) to lay on the table a report furnished to the Government by a departmental officer who was appointed to inquire into the alleged excess profits made last year by Australian Consolidated Industries Limited. The Minister stated that the report contained confidential information and that it would therefore not be proper to table it. I am sorry that the honorable gentleman took that attitude, for I am sure that the report contains matter that should be made available to honorable members. The details of the companys transactions are set out in a report which appeared in the Melbourne Argus of last Monday from which I abstract the following particulars : -","Brisbane, Monday","WAR ORDERS HELD UP","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[46]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is unlikely that there will be any substantial departure from that decision. It is essential that our consumption of petrol shall be reduced to about 12,000,000 gallons a month and the new ration is designed on that basis. If concessions are to be given to some users who consider that they have been harshly treated, it will have to be at the expense of other users.","AUSTRALIAN CONSOLIDATED INDUSTRIES EARNS Â£489,652","QUESTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[47]/subdebate.1/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
