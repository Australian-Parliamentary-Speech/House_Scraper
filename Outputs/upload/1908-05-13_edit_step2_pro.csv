The same question arose on the same date (4th September) in regard to other magazines in other States, and similar instructions were given in such instances.It may be explained that the only reason why the authority of the Minister was specially asked in this instance was, because, as originally introduced, the exemption was to be made under Ministerial by-law, otherwise the decision would have been given as a matter of course without, reference to the Minister.","DUTY ON PRINTING PAPER","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[1]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Freetraders are invariably told by protectionists that the object of a protective tariff is to encourage the starting of industries and to help them over their infantile stages, and that once fairly started they do not need protection. Since this industry has been started, and .has apparently flourished and developed under free-trade conditions, the argument for protection in this case falls to the ground. Then we have the further naive admission by the manufacturers in Brisbane - an admission that we do not often obtain from our protectionist friends - that they desire an increased duty to enable them to charge a higher price, because they cannot compete against the low prices charged for the superior imported article. Here we have another protectionist  fallacy exposed. Our protectionist friends opposite never fail to assure us that protection cheapens prices. These manufacturers point out that what they object to is cheapness - they object to the public being able to obtain these instruments at a low price. We are asked to impose a duty which will be practically prohibitive in its operation in order that local manufacturers may sell an inferior article at a higher price. We are here to see that the public are not robbed or unduly fleeced for the gain of any firm or individual, and we should be wanting in our duty if we accepted the request.

If the duty were taken off, it would do a lot of good to the trade ; a much better article would be produced locally because a high standard would have to be maintained. If, however, we levy a duty of 15 or 20 per cent., the tendency will be to stop the importation of white leather, and the trade must use whatever is locally produced. It will encourage that slovenliness which has prevailed in the -past. Certainly it is not necessary for the maintenance of the industry.

We suggested a duty of 25 per cent, on the former and a duty of 6d. per lb. on the latter. I think that a duty of 35 per cent, is excessive. I shall be prepared to support an alternative duty of 25 per cent. That would, I consider, operate with greater equality than would an all-round duty of 6d. per lb.

The calendar in question is a very fine production. It reproduces the Australian waratah and other native flowers, and altogether it is a work which reflects credit upon the printing establishment responsible for it. I have been informed that the contract for die production of this calendar was obtained for a clever American, who let the work out in Japan, where it could be done cheaply. If my information is correct, it evidences a new development of considerable interest to us, because, when the contract was let, it was doubtless assumed that the successful tenderer would have the work done in America, which is recognised as a high wage country, This is a case in which I shall vote for the imposition of a higher duty.

They are - I do not say intentionally - very misleading. The honorable member said that as there was a duty of 6d. per lb. on advertising matter, there ought to be a similar duty on directories. But the bulk of the contents of a directory is not advertising matter at all, and other printed books, even if written by an Australian author and printed in London, are admitted free. In this case exception is being taken to a particular work, and an attempt is being made to put it on a different footing from that of all other printed books. In those circumstances, we ought to have very strong reasons before we agree to the proposal now before . us. The honorable member for Yarras contention as to the wages paid in England might, from his point of view, be correct if there was no duty at all. But a duty of 4d., amounting to a considerable sum per volume, and multiplied by the very large number of volumes that have to be issued to pay for the cost of collection and of producing the work, represents so large a sum that, as the setting up has only to be done once, and the printing is all done by machinery, it would probably cover the whole cost of labour, even if the book were printed here. In those circumstances, seeing that the Government previously accepted a duty of 4d., and that an exception is proposed to be made of this particular work, although it is a printed book, while, if there could be competition from foreign countries, that competition will be prevented by a duty of 6d. per lb., we shall surely be doing quite sufficient if we fix a duty of 4d. against Great Britain.

The Committee determined that all magazines should be free ; but, to authorize the retention of the duty collected up to the date of its decision, it was necessary to agree to the item as it stood, adding the words  and on and after roth December, 1907, free. Then, to obviate the necessity of keeping two sets of statistics in regard to the one class of article, it was thought well to- alter this Molding in the Senate to  free, up to and including 9th December, 1907. The effect of this is that all magazines are now dealt with as coming under item 371, and the statistics regarding their importation are kept under one heading. If the Committee insists on adding the word  free to the item, it will create confusion in the minds of importers, and make necessary the keeping of two sets of statistics.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[79]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is idle for any one to tell me that the statement of a Minister in respect of Tariff items can be accepted. I do not mean to suggest that Ministers intentionally say what they believe to be contrary to facts, but I know of cases in which it has been pointed out to Customs officers, that during a debate in Parliament the Minister then in charge of the Tariff stated that a certain article would not be dutiable. After a lapse of time the Customs Department has charged duty, and replied that the Crown Law authorities advised that duty must be collected in respect of that article, and that it could not be made free merely because of any statement by a Minister. It is, therefore, incumbent upon us to make absolutely clear our determination in respect of the Tariff. The honorary Minister has stated that if the word  free  be allowed to remain, importers will experience difficulty. I would point out that, to importers, a still greater difficulty would arise if the item were allowed to remain without the addition of words providing that after the date named it shall be free. The requested amendment provides for a duty of 6d. up to and including 9th December, 1907, but there is no statement as to whether or not a duty is to be collected in respect of it as from that date. Unless we wish to create confusion, we should provide, as we have done in every other case, that after -the date named the item shall be free. lt is useless for the Minister or the officers of the Department to assert that the addition of the words I suggest would give rise to difficulty in the preparation of statistics, for they certainly would not prevent the printed matter referred to in the item from falling under item 371.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[81]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

But, notwithstanding a long debate which took place upon the item - a debate similar to that which is taking place now - we found that wood screws were subjected to a duty for fourteen days.
