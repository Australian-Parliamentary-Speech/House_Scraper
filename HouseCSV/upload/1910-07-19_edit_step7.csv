Three resulted in acquittal, and in one a fine was inflicted. It has been found that breaches of discipline in time of peace can ordinarily be sufficiently punished by the powers of fine and discharge now given to commanding officers. It is, however, provided by section 265 of the Commonwealth Military Regulations, that, whenever a commanding Officer proposes to inflict any but a minor punishment upon a soldier the latter shall be so informed, and that he shall have a right to demand trial by court martial.  In time of war it is obvious that offences cannot be dealt with by civil courts, and therefore the Imperial Army Act comes into force under section 55 of the Defence Act 1903-4. In the area of active operations no civil courts would be in operation, and it would be impracticable to send the officers and soldiers, whose presence would be required at a trial, back to the base for the purpose. The application of the Army Act is, however, limited by sections 96,98, and 106 of the Defence Act 1903-4. The following will show that the rights of the citizen are amply safeguarded, and that the civil courts can always prevent illegal punishment : - ' It is, therefore, highly important that the mistake should be corrected, which supposes that an Englishman, by taking upon him the additional character of a soldier, puts off any of the rights or duties of an Englishman.' - Chief Justice Sir James Mansfield in Burdett v. Abbott, 4 Taunton's Reports, page 401. ' The members of courts martial and officers in the exercise of individual authority are, like the inferior civil courts and magistrates, amenable to the superior civil courts for injury caused to any person by acts done either without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction.' - Manual of Military Law, 1907, page 119. The writs of prohibition, certiorari, and habeas corpus, as also actions for damages, are all available to one who feels aggrieved, and there are many such reported in the English Law Reports.","APPEALS FROM COURTS MARTIAL","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[5]/answer/quote/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

In the exploitation of the business the telephone companies are assisted by the almost universal system of the measured rate charge, i.e., a charge for each call made over a certain number. For branch exchange work this is the only method that can be well employed, as no hotel-keeper is likely to go to the expense of paying a flat rental for 100 or 200 telephones for the use of his guests. While I am not convinced that the measured rate system should be adopted in its entirety, I think it is likely that the rigid flat rate as in use in New Zealand, is largely responsible for our failure to develop on the lines I have indicated, and it would be well to consider whether a measured rate could not be adopted for branch exchanges,&c., which would give satisfaction alike to the Department and telephone users; that is to say, the present flat rate to be maintained for single connexions, particularly with private residences, and a measured rate introduced for branch exchanges and party lines.","NEW ZEALAND TELEPHONE RATES","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[6]/answer/quote[3]/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

An interim answer to the questions was furnished when they were asked, but the following are the complete answers to them : - 1.The arrangement in force in the Department is that as regards semi-official offices the personal allowance of the postmaster, together with the allowance for maintenance of the office (light, &c.), and the rental value of the premises as quarters shall equal the minimum wage of £110 per annum. I was not previously aware that in four cases in New South Wales and one in Tasmania this had not been carried out. In two of these cases the total is £2 less than£110, in one case £3 less , in one £7, and in the other £12. In the last-mentioned £52 per annum additional, and in the other cases £26 per annum additional is allowed for assistants. Steps have been taken to rectify the anomalies in these instances. In all other cases it is reported that the equivalent of the minimum wage is being paid. With respect to non-official (allowance) offices, which are in the hands of persons who make their living by other occupations, the allowance is paid according to a scale based on the statistics of postal work performed. A non-official (allowance) office is established on a revenue of£15 per annum. The work does not occupy the whole time of the postmaster, and the minimum wage does not apply. 2.See answer to No. 1. 3.Yes, but with the exception of five, they have not completed the three years' service required by law before they are entitled to receive £110 per annum. The five exceptions comprise three postmasters in Western Australia and two female telegraph messengers in South Australia. The revenue derived from the offices controlled by the postmasters in Western Australia referred to is £17, £21, and£87 per annum. In each case the postmaster receives an allowance in excess of the revenue. These persons became permanent employes of the Department owing to a technicality, they having been appointed by the Governor in Council of the State prior to Federation.

It is a great pity that the Financial Agreement entered into between the representatives of the States and the Commonwealth has not been given effect to; and one of the chief weaknesses in the Bill is that it does not, and cannot, give any hope of stability for a period of ten years. The Prime Minister, in introducing the measure, pledged himself to endeavour to keep the contract as herein entered into; but personal guarantees are not of the slightest value in such a case. Even- during the present session, we have been shown the utter futility of placing any reliance on this ten years' agreement. Three years ago we passed a Bill the operation of which was to cease at the end of 1912. That term was arrived at by a compromise, but we find on the notice-paper to-day a proposal to repeal that Bill before it has run half its length. I have no wish to transgress by dealing with that other measure, but merely desire to show how vain it is to expect that this or any other Parliament can pledge future Parliaments. Those who took the same view as myself think that the effect would be much more permanent if we left the future- consideration of the financial arrangements to the electors rather than to a future Parliament over which this Parliament has no control. What we urge is that the people of Australia ought to be trusted. There are two agencies elected by the people to do different works for the same people. Those people pay the same taxes, and when the two agencies differ as to the allocation of the money, a fair and proper tribunal is not one of the parties to the contract, but the people who have subscribed the money. The Prime Minister has said that the personnel of this House is an answer to the terms of that proposed Financial Agreement: but it is nothing of the kind. In practically every State the candidates who opposed the Financial Agreement did so on totally different issues. Senator -Pearce, the Leader of the Labour party in Western Australia, writing to the newspapers, pledged his party to a contract for twenty-five years, whereas in my own State the present Minister of Home Affairs, the leader of the party there, and those acting with him, based their opposition to the agreement on the ground that it was not fair to Tasmania in that it did not give her a sufficiency. At the great Labour Tally in the Theatre Royal, Hobart, at which, I think, nearly all the Labour candidates were present, the Minister of Home Affairs called on the people to reject the agreement, pledging himself and his party-","Second Reading","SURPLUS REVENUE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Those members who have so pledged themselves will have an opportunity of voting on their pledges. What has happened since those diverse pledges were given? The .Financial Agreement has been defeated, and the Labour party has been returned to power; and it will be interesting to see how those men who have pledged themselves - I say nothing of those who did not pledge themselves - will vote on the question whether or not the Braddon section shall be continued in operation to the end of the current year. It has been said that those who supported that agreement have no reason to complain, because it has practically been given effect to. But the agreement, as I understand it, and as it was set down in black and white, showed that the then Treasurer anticipated a deficiency of £1,200,000. It will be remembered that ,£600,000 of this was deficiency in revenue, caused largely, if not wholly, by the obligations of old-age pensions, ,;and £600,000 for new works. The State Premiers agreed that, as the Commonwealth had to pay old-age pensions, they would make good the deficiency on the conditions laid down. As a matter of fact, however, the revenue increased, and the deficiency is only some £440,000; and the whole of this, and not half, as previously agreed, the Treasurers are asked to provide. In the interests of Tasmania, it is exceedingly regrettable that the Financial Agreement has not been given effect to, because greater security would then have been given to the States, and also a larger contribution than under the proposed Bill. Another feature of the financial relations has been brought under the notice of the House by the honorable member for Wilmot. I am not here to ask for any charity for my State, but I think it is recognised by everyone who has gone into the question that there is a certain amount due to Tasmania on account of what is commonly called 'leakage'; that is, the loss caused by goods, which have been imported into other States, being transferred to Tasmania without the ordinary procedure of trade certificates being observed. When the honorable member for Swan was Treasurer, he went into the matter, and, I think, he accepted the view that there was a deficiency or leakage representing £20,000to £25,000. The matter was brought more prominently under the notice of the honorable member for Hume when he was Treasurer, and he came to a similar conclusion. The honorable member went so far as to bring the matter under the notice of the then Premiers of Victoria and New South Wales, and urged them to consider this claim, which he recognised as fair and just. They were not prepared to recognise any claim whatever.","Second Reading","SURPLUS REVENUE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Now that the Commonwealth Parliament is dealing with the matter in equity and justice, taking over the whole of the Customs revenue and distributing to the States the proportion to which it thinks they are lawfully entitled, and which it can honestly and fairly spare, the matter ceases to be one of concession between State and State, and it devolves upon the Federal Parliament, which has the responsibility, to do what is right, just and honest. The Federal Government must take the full and complete responsibility in dealing with this question of leakage, seeing that the Commonwealth officials in the Customs Department have failed to deal with it. A considerable portion of Tasmania, especially the north-west' coast and the west coast, does practically the whole of its trade, in the shape of importations, with Victoria. The north-west coast has become the happy hunting ground for commercial travellers from the adjoining States. There is an exceedingly large trade done between Tasmania and Victoria. A few figures will show how Victoria and New South Wales are becoming not only distributing, but also manufacturing, centres for the whole Commonwealth. Whilst the increase in population of Victoria for the ten years ending 1908 was 7½ per cent., the number of her factories increased in eight years by 60 per cent., the average number of factory hands employed increased by 71 per cent., the value of the buildings and lands on which the factories were erected by 16 per cent., and the value of the plant and machinery by 54 per cent. In those eight years the number of factories in Victoria increased by1,739 and the number of employes by 39,000, while the increased expenditure on lands and buildings for factory purposes amounted to , £3,600,000. One of the reasons why there has been such a falling-off in the Customs duties in Tasmania is that prior to Federation the same duties were levied, for instance, on boots coming from Victoria, as on those coming from England and America; but when Tasmania entered the Federation, and a uniform Tariff was imposed, whilst the duties remained, and were even increased against England and America, they vanished as against the factories of Victoria. These have consequently monopolized the whole of the trade, and the Customs duties have correspondingly fallen off. One of the interesting features of Federation is the extent to which InterState trade has grown, and the right honorable member for Swan has placed on the paper a notice of question asking whether uniform rates of wages are to be paid, in order that the people in the West, where wages are higher, may be protected from the undue competition of Victoria and New South Wales. Our experience in Tasmania is that, no matter what wages are paid in the smaller centres, the large centres, owing to the advantages of their increased output, can swamp the market. Prior to Federation, we had several flourishing little boot factories in Hobart and Launceston. There are no Wages Boards in Tasmania to regulate wages, which are much lower than in the Melbourne factories. Yet the Melbourne factories have practically wiped the Tasmanian factories out of existence.","Second Reading","SURPLUS REVENUE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","55","MCWILLIAMS, William","JUV","N/A","N/A","N/A","494","It is due to the larger output and a little dumping. The manufacture of boots in Tasmania is now almost wholly confined to one line, which is not used and therefore not made in Victoria - a very heavy class of boot for bushmen. Melbourne and Sydney have not only become the manufacturing centres for the greater portion of Australia, but they are rapidly becoming the distributing centres. Sydney is the distributing centre to some extent for Queensland, while Melbourne and Sydney are to a large extent distributing centres not only for Tasmania, but also for Western Australia. We shall, therefore, have to face the question of the allocation of Customs duties in a truly Federal spirit, because the leakage will go on. I am not blaming the Customs authorities, because I know from experience the difficulties which are placed in the way of any one buying goods in Victoria who endeavours to get a Customs certificate in order that the duties may be transferred. In fact, some of the business houses object to give certificates, as they do not care for the trouble. We make our claim in this matter not as a pauper State, not as a necessitous State, and not as an act of charity. We are trying to put our case within the four corners of equity and justice. We claim that goods are imported into Victoria, pay duty here, and are transferred to our own State, but instead of the duties being credited to the State where the goods are consumed, they remain in the first port of entry. The right honorable member for Swan and the honorable member for Hume, who were both Treasurer for years, and went in to the matter carefully, recognised that a large amount is due to Tasmania. The honorable member for Hume even took the trouble to appeal to the Premiers of the two States concerned to do an act of justice to Tasmania, and, therefore, now that the Federation has taken the matter over, and the responsibility rests upon this Parliament, it is the duty of the Federation to put the matter right without any appeal to the Premiers of other States, and not as a concession, but as a matter of right and justice. I think it will be generally con ceded that so far this discussion has been conducted with the desire to get down to the bedrock of things, and without any attempt to throw undue obstacles in the way of the passage of the Bill. We recognise that some measure of this kind is a necessity. It would have been much better for the States if the settlement had taken place years ago. The longer it is delayed the worse it will be for the States, and I wish I could hope that the Bill would run for ten years. I fear, however, that the projects which we are somewhat extravagantly and rashly launching will entail such an expenditure on the Federation that our resources will be strained, and strained so far that a desire may be evinced to get the money in the easiest way available, by restricting the life of this measure and deducting the amount required from the amount payable to the States. I warn honorable members of the utter futility of believing that a pledge given by a Minister, or, indeed, by any other member of the House, can bind future Parliaments. The Sugar Bounty Bill, which will be before us in the course of a few clays, is a case in point. It will serve to show that, although a time limit may be fixed to the operation of a Bill - although the Minister in charge of that measure may pledge himself that it shall run to its full limit - there is no guarantee that that limitation will be observed after an appeal has been made to the electors, and a new Parliament may decide that a change shall be made. The weakness of one State is the weakness of the whole Common wealth. That has been the experience over and over again of the United States of America. When honorable members say that the States of America have succeeded individually in carrying out their work without receiving any share of the Customs revenue, I am constrained to ask them to consider the straits to which they have been reduced because of the absence of that source of income. Many of the works now carried out by the States of the Commonwealth have long been impossible, so far as the States of America are concerned. They have had to hand over the greater proportion of works, such as we carry out through the States, to private syndicates and trusts which have gloated over and robbed the people of America to an extent which the people of Australia have never fully appreciated. While the Union Treasury has been overflowing with money - whilst the Union Government have been purchasing and storing in the vaults at Washington hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of silver, and have administered a pension list in relation to soldiers who took part in the American Civil War, in a way that has been disgraceful, every effort being made by the Union to spend money wisely or unwisely, the States themselves have been starved, and compelled, I repeat, to hand over to trusts and syndicates works which we in Australia hope the States will always be able to undertake. There is no room in this matter for antagonism between the States and the Commonwealth. If we could only keep always in front of us the fact that we all represent the same people, and that an injustice done by the Federation, or a State, injures alike all the people whom we represent, we should be able sometimes, I think, to come'to fairer judgments in these matters. It will not be in the best interests of the Commonwealth itself if, by starving the States, we prevent them from carrying out. the great developmental works which must be undertaken if Australia is to make the progress that we desire. The States can be enabled to undertake the construction of roads, bridges, and other public works only by the allotment to the m of a fair share of the Customs revenue. It would be well for this Parliament to remember that many of the most important functions of government are still in the hands of the States. They have to carry on extensive railway systems, the construction of public works of various kinds, a great national system of education - which, after all, is the most important duty that could devolve upon a Government - and State Judiciaries, and they have also to meet the interest on their national debt. For every pound in respect of which there is a claim upon the Commonwealth to-day, there is a claim of £7 or £8 on the State Treasurers, and they must be granted a reasonable proportion of the Customs revenue if they are to discharge their highly important functions. It matters little to the people who spends the money so long as it is expended to the ir advantage, but it will be a matter of serious concern to the m if one of their governmental agencies, having a surplus revenue, expends it on works that are not wholly essential and thereby renders it impossible for their other governmental agency to carry out equally, or more, important functions. It would be a serious matter for the people if, as the result of this process, the States were compelled to apply a brake to the wheels of progress, and to say that developmental works within their borders must-cease. We can come to a fair and proper decision on this question only by viewing it broadly from the standpoint of the rights of the Federation and of the States. I hope the time will never come when there will be any desire, either on the part of this Legislature or the State Parliaments, to create antagonism between the two great agencies of government, or to create in the minds of the people a feeling that one of the agencies which they have elected to do special work is in direct antagonism to another agency which is also elected to do work for them. The. Federation should be more generous to the States than is proposed under this Bill. The per capita allowance of 25s. per annum represents practically only one-half of the Customs and Excise revenue, and I believe that the payment of so small an allowance will cause a reduction in the expenditure of the States and hit a class of people whom' very few of us wish to see injured. In Tasmania, as the result of the pressure upon the Treasury by reason of the great reduction in the amounts that it has received from the Federation, officers in the lower ranks of the Public Service are receiving rates of wages of which few if any of us are proud. Their salaries have been cut down and they cannot be increased because of the shortage of revenue, and the loss Tasmania has sustained owing to the upsetting of her Customs and Excise income. We have an honest claim to make. When it can be shown by two men, who have gone in to the matter carefully, and neither of whom is a representative of Tasmania, that that State, since the inception of Federation, has not received its rightful share of her Customs revenue, then I do think that the Federal Government ought to go thoroughly in to the whole question before this Bill passes through Committee. It will be too late to take action after it has been passed. This Bill is to determine for ten years the allocation of the Customs and Excise revenue to the States, and, in view of the evidence of the two gentlemen to whom I have referred that Tasmania has been improperly deprived of her fair share of the revenue from Customs duties, it is the bounden duty of the Government to see, before the Bill leaves the Committee, whether the wrong cannot be righted. I trust that the claims of Tasmania will be determined, not on grounds of necessity or pauperism, but wholly and solely on the grounds of public right and justice, and that fair play will be meted out to the smallest State of the Union, and one which has made a greater sacrifice for Federation than has any other State in the Commonwealth.","Second Reading","SURPLUS REVENUE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is all very well for the Prime Minister to rise in his place, and in that pompous lordly autocratic style which he has affected so much of late, to say 'We ' - that is, he and his friends- ' guarantee to the States that the provision incorporated in this Bill shall continue for ten years.' But he cannot guarantee that it will continue for more than twelve months. He has not the power to do so. He can pledge nobody but himself. He cannot pledge even his own followers, because none of them is his own master, while they are all his masters, and in turn he and they are but the recording agents of another set of masters above them. Their masters are a body of men who meet and decide these things outside of Parliament.

No matter what his own views may be, he has to voice those decisions, and in no sense can he be regarded as a leader.","Second Reading","SURPLUS REVENUE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

As the heads of the State Governments, they have the right to speak for the States; and it would have been only ordinary courtesy on the part of the Prime Minister to recognise their status and lay his proposals before them, even though those proposals might not be accepted.

It is an attitude that no other Prime Minister, representing any other party in the Commonwealth, would have dreamt of assuming.

It will be within the memory of most honorable members that the suggestion for a per capita return to the States first saw the light at the Brisbane Labour Conference. In its embryo state, the proposal was taken up by the Tasmanian Statistician, Mr. R. M. Johnston, and by him handed over 'to a conference of Premiers. Year after year, it was under consideration by the Premiers, and eventually found expression in the Commonwealth Parliament by means of the Bill of last year. Members of the Opposition did not hesitate then to support a per capita return of 25s., but they desired a provision to that end to be placed in the Constitution for all time. So far as I can see, the only difference between members of the Opposition and members on this side is that the latter protested against thus shackling the Commonwealth for ever. I fail to see why members of the Opposition should now oppose what their own daily newspaper tells them is really their measure, and on the acceptance of which by the present Government they are complimented by that journal. I regret that the right honorable member for Swan is not in his place, because I desire to refer to the cruel manner in which he spoke of honorable members on this side of the House. I speak of the honorable gentleman most respectfully, in view of his long political career as a member of various Governments in Australia; but it is a pity he was not more guarded in his utterances. I have signed the platform as laid down by the Brisbane Labour Conference, but I emphatically declare that, outside that platform, I am' a free man, notwithstanding what the right honorable member said about the declaration of Senator Pearce, who, at that time, was not a Minister of the Crown. Why should the Western Australian utterances of. a member of the Labour party, who was not a Minister, bind a member of the Labour party in Tasmania? Why should a statement made by the present Minister of Home Affairs be binding on me? I happened to be at the Hobart meeting referred to by the honorable member for Franklin; and I spoke before the present Minister of Home Affairs, and simply told the people that I was in favour of a per capita return of 25s., but not in favour of the provision being placed in the Constitution for all time. I cared not one iota what the honorable member for Darwin might say. Why should his statements bind me any more than the statements of the Leader of the Opposition bind honorable members opposite? I tell the right honorable member for Swan that, in my opinion, Western Australia has been exceedingly well treated. In addition to the per capita return, Western Australia is given a special grant in the face of a declining revenue. Who can say what the revenue of Western Australia, large as it may be at present, will be in ten years' time? We can say what the revenue of the other States will be at the end of that period, because they have reached normal conditions. According to Mr. Knibbs, Western Australia, in 1901, had a revenue of £2 0 13s. 4d. per head; whereas, at the present time, it is only £12 2s. 5d., showing a decline since Federation. Seeing that Western Australia has been so well treated, I should advise the representatives of that State to take what is .offered as quietly and quickly as possible, in case other honorable members may go more deeply into the question and change their minds. In Tasmania, in 1901, the imports per head amounted to £4 14s. 2d., whereas at present the figure is £4 2s. id. But, the imports of Tasmania are low because its Inter-State trade is so high. Its Inter-State trade is £13 8s. 11d. per head, whereas that of Western Australia is only £11 3s. 10d. per head, so that we are not the poor hungry little people that the right honorable member for Swan and other honorable members would lead the House to believe. We are importing largely from Victoria and New South Wales, and, therefore, we should be granted some consideration by the Commonwealth Government. The oversea and Inter- State trade of Western Australia is £2 3 6s. 3d. per head, while that of Tasmania is £18 us., or a difference of only £4 15s. 3d., so that there is not such a vast difference after all between the amount of products consumed per head in Western Australia and Tasmania. New South Wales and Victoria have stepped in and taken practically the whole of our trade, and so a considerable leakage has come about, because people come from Tasmania and purchase dutiable goods in Victoria. Only the other day, as the honorable member for Bass can bear out, I met a gentleman from Tasmania, who had purchased in Melbourne, and was wearing, apparel to the value of He had no Inter-State certificate, and was going back to Tasmania, and so no duty would be credited to Tasmania on those goods. That sort of thing has been going on all these years, and our excellent statistician, Mr. R. M. Johnston, stakes his reputation on the statement that Tasmania has been done out of no less than ,£40,000 per year since Federation began. If we have been done out of that big sum of money, surely we are entitled to some consideration from the Federal Government. I do not ask for consideration for the relief of the wealthy taxpayer of Tasmania. We have very few wealthy men there, but even those are paying considerably more than is paid in any other State. The Tasmanian income tax would be considered a war tax in any other country. If I interpret it correctly, I shall pay this year about is. in the pound, or a total of ^30 in income tax. It is a question of' the interpretation of the Act. A gentleman I approached here looked up both Acts, and said, ' I should not care to interpret them; that is a matter for the Commissioner of Taxes.' I may pay 6d., or I may pay is., but I shall say no more about the matter lest the Minister of Home Affairs, hearing the enormous sum he will have to pay to the State of Tasmania in income tax, should take fright or fall ill. It is not on behalf of the wealthy taxpayer that I am speaking now, but on behalf of the poor taxpayer who is in receipt of £2 2s. a week. If a man in that position loses a day's pay it takes him six weeks to overtake his consequent indebtedness. Yet in Tasmania he has had to pay an ability tax in the past, and now has to pay an income tax. I also appeal to the House on behalf of the widows who, in Tasmania, are making incomes of slightly over £100 a year by keeping small business establishments. They have to pay income tax. Surely if we are federated, as I hope we are, the wealthy States will come to the rescue of our little State.","Second Reading","SURPLUS REVENUE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Why did they not move in the matter last year when it was before the House? Why did they sit quietly ir their seats when if they had made out the case which they have made out this year, they might have led the present Prime Minister to consider our claim favorably? They simply sacrificed their little State to save the Fusion party which they had joined. They cared not one iota for their State, but now they ask the House for a special grant, in order to inconvenience the present Government, and to enable them to mount the hustings next time, and say, 'Look what I did for Tasmania.' If they were in earnest, why did they not do this last year when they had the opportunity? My task of obtaining a special grant for Tasmania has been made exceedingly hard by the action of honorable members representing Tasmania, not only here, but in another place. When they had the opportunity to vote for a special grant in the Senate last year, they did not do so. Senator Keating brought the matter up.","Second Reading","SURPLUS REVENUE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

He was then sitting in Opposition, and it was not his place to do so. The system of bookkeeping has been far from perfect, and through it Tasmania has lost considerably. It is also losing population owing to the progress the larger States are making. I am proud to say that Tasmania shows the highest birthrate of any of the States, and yet our population is on the decline owing to the rapid progress which Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, and Western Australia are making under Federation. Our young people, -who are the true wealth of the country, are being attracted into those States, and a per capita return will not benefit us as it will the richer States, whose population is so rapidly increasing to the detriment of our own. I hope that it is not too late for our little State to be helped, but I fear it is. From the little I know of parliamentary procedure, I fear that the suggestion made by the honorable member for Wilmot, will be ruled out of order when it comes before the House, and that when the Bill passes this House it will be finally dealt with, and we shall not have an opportunity to reopen the question. I have, therefore, very little hope that Tasmania will get any help from the Commonwealth, but I am sure that, had members gone deeply into the question, they would certainly, as a matter of justice, have given us more than a per capita return of 25s. Trade with the west coast of Tasmania, as I pointed out the other day, is practically in the hands of Victoria; we bring profits to Victoria and New South Wales, and I appeal to the representatives of those two States to give some consideration to the claims of Tasmania in dealing with this measure. I do not intend to take up the time of the House further than to say that at the Brisbane Conference no reference was made to the proposed per capita return being embodied in the Constitution, or to paying a fixed sum to the States for all time. I have the report of that Conference, and shall be pleased to hand it to any honorable member who desires lo read it. A perusal of it will show that the Conference had no intention of urging that the arrangement which it proposed should be placed in the Constitution.","Second Reading","SURPLUS REVENUE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If the Ministry went out of office to-morrow, I fail to see that we should be called upon to retire from the seats we now occupy. Why should we be held responsible for anything that the Government do? Honorable members on this side of the House are as free as, if not freer than, the Opposition. I had the pleasure on one occasion of travelling to New South Wales with a gentleman with whom I engaged in conversation, and eventually we became friendly enough to allow of my asking whether he was a member of any Government. ' No,' he replied; ' if I were, I should be only one man in the House, but at present, when 1 pull the strings, nine men jump.' Who is the freer man - the man who is here with no- thing to lose, or the man who is running a big business, and has, perhaps, a big overdraft with one of the financial institutions of the Commonwealth? We know how hard it is to be free when one is running a business, and certain men can bring certain pressure to bear.","Second Reading","SURPLUS REVENUE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

That, I think, is their due. I gladly and heartily congratulate them, believing that the measure is one of the utmost importance to all the States, and that no time should be lost in passing it, so as to settle, for at least ten years, the financial relationship of the Commonwealth with the States. The time limit is certainly too short, but, I suppose, that we can no t hope for more at the present time. Old members will recollect very well the difficulties which State Treasurers have experienced from year to year in preparing their Estimates, because of their inability to determine with any degree of certainty what revenue would be forthcoming from the Commonwealth. With the passing of this Bill that difficulty will disappear to some extent, and that fact alone should induce ho no rable members to assist in passing it into law as soon as possible. One of my objections to it is that its operation ought no t to be limited to a period of only ten years. The Prime Minister the other day spoke freely of his generosity to the States, and while he was in that generous mood I think that he might well have proposed to provide for this per capita payment extending over a period of at least fifteen, if no t twenty, years. I am given to under stand, however, by some ho no rable members who have spoken, that there is a possibility that this allowance may no t be paid to the States for even ten years.

Whilst I object to the proposed per capita allowance being limited to a period of ten years, I presume that the Opposition will have to take whatever the Government chooses to give, and to be thankful for it. This Bill, to my mind, has not been well drafted, and appears to me to be contradictory in terms. We have the statement in plain language in clause 4, that the Braddon section, under which the States are to receive at least three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue until 31st December, 1910, shall cease to operate six months before the time limit attaching to it. That clause reads -  The Commonwealth shall, during the period of ten years beginning on the first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and ten, and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides, pay to each State by monthly instalments, or apply to the payment of interest on debts of the State taken over by the Commonwealth, an annual sum amounting to Twenty-five shillings per head of the number of the people of the State. Under that clause, the Bill would come into operation as from the1st July of this year, and the provision in question contemplates the payment to the States of 25s. per capita. In this connexion, I desire to ask the Prime Minister one or two questions in the hope that he will be able to make the position clearer than he did the other day. Under clause 4, I repeat, the Bill will become operative as from the1st July. But section 87 of the Constitution, which is known as the Braddon section, provides for the return to the States of three- fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue until the 31st December next. I wish, therefore, to ask the Prime Minister whether the States will receive their full three-fourths of that revenue during the first half of the present financial year?","Second Reading","SURPLUS REVENUE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","162","QUICK, John","KYJ","Bendigo","N/A","N/A","509","As this Bill is likely to pass and to remain on the statute-book in substantially its present form for a number of years, I desire to make a few remarks explanatory of my views and attitude concerning it. During the recent election I was one of the strongest supporters of the Financial Agreement, and did my best to secure its adoption. I am glad to say that in my constituency I was able to secure, not only a majority for myself, but also a majority for that mode of settlement. The Financial Agreement is now, however, a thing of the past, and, as practical politicians and statesmen, we must make the best of the means and opportunities at our disposal. Subject to certain comments which I shall make upon the form of the Bill. I welcome it as the nearest obtainable equivalent to the ill-fated Financial Agreement. There are three elements in the Bill to which I desire to draw attention as being somewhat approximate to the fundamental provisions and principles of that scheme. First, there is the principle of the per capita allowance; secondly, there is the 25s. per capita amount; and, thirdly, there is the element not of constitutional stability, but of parliamentary continuity within the period of ten years. Those were, no doubt, the broad outlines and the organic principles of the Financial Agreement. The claim has been put forward this afternoon that the principle of the per capita allowance originated with the Labour party at the Brisbane Conference. That is not historically accurate. As a matter of fact, the principle of the per capita distribution of the surplus revenue was considered by the Federal Convention at its first session held in Adelaide. A proposal was put forward there that the surplus revenue should be distributed per capita among the peoples of the various States; but objection was strongly taken to that principle by the representatives of some of the States, especially New South Wales. It was held by them that owing to the vast revenue that would be received under the Federal  Tariff, a per capita distribution would be hardly fair to New South Wales. Sir Frederick Holder, on behalf of South Australia, gave his approval to the per capita principle, and said that he believed it would prove to be fair. Sir George Reid, then Premier of New South Wales, said that he would agree to a sliding scale ending in a per capita system after ten years. So that those leading members of the Convention were advocates of the principle of a per capita distribution after a certain time - that is, after the expiration of what is known as the book-keeping period, which was limited to five years. This Parliament could have brought into operation the per capita principle at the end of the five-years' period. But, unfortunately, parties were so distributed, and opinion was so divided, that we could not arrive at any settlement of the question. Then came the Financial Agreement arrived at by the representatives of the late Federal Government and the State Premiers. That agreement recognised the per capita principle for the first time in this Parliament. Consequently, it is hardly fair to say that the Labour party at the Brisbane Conference was the originator of this system. At any rate, I believe that we are now unanimously agreed as to the 25s. and as to the mode of distribution according to population. I welcome this Bill also, because I think it is a manifestation of a desire on the part of the Ministry and the Labour party to do some measure of justice to the States in the distribution of the surplus revenue. It is also, I consider, a refutation of some of the misrepresentations made, and objections urged, against the Financial Agreement during the last election. I believe that the agreement suffered defeat to a very large extent owing to misrepresentations, and to some extent also through misapprehensions and misunderstandings as to its possible results and its probable effect upon the finances of the Commonwealth. In some quarters, the very strongest objections were urged to the amount of 25s. per capita . It was said that that was too large. The honorable member for Lang has quoted to-day the strong argument that was pressed by the present Attorney- General in Sydney, to the effect that 25s. per capita would lead to the Commonwealth revenue being unduly strained and straitened. No doubt that argument went a long way. There were columns of articles in some of the newspapers urging that the payment of 25s. per capita would mean that the Commonwealth would be crippled, would be leg-roped, would be manacled, would be starved, and would be unable to carry out such national works as the transcontinental railway, the taking over of the Northern Territory, and the establishment of the Federal Capital. It was urged that we would be short of money for defence purposes. All these arguments no doubt told in the minds of a considerable number of Federal electors, who thought that the Commonwealth had better have the benefit of the doubt. Accordingly, they refused to ratify the agreement. I should like to know what has become of the great outcry that was raised against the agreement based upon (the necessities of the Commonwealth? We do not hear it urged now in the House that 25s. per head is too much. It is not said now that we shall be short of money for the Northern Territory or the transcontinental railway or the Federal capital or for Defence purposes. There is a remarkable silence on that side of the House, as to the possible shortage of Federal funds. Apparently we are all going now merrily and strongly for the 25s. per head. We hear a murmur here and there that it is not sufficient; but very little is said now under the heading that 25s. per head is toomuch.","Second Reading","SURPLUS REVENUE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

They further contemplated the revenue from the issue of bank notes as a part of their policy. It cannot be said that the Commonwealth can pay 25s. better now under the Labour policy than it could under the late Ministerial policy. Therefore, to some extent the Ministry are to be complimented on the promptness with which they have dealt with the question, and their desire to remove all doubts in the minds of the State Governments and State Parliaments. It is only fair that they should know at the earliest opportunity what are to be their financial rights under the new regime. It is said by the Prime Minister that this is practically a crystallization or re-enactment of the Financial. Agreement. His intention may be such, but I hardly agree as to the possible realization of that. Under the Financial  Agreement we proposed to shorten the period of the operation of the Braddon section by at least six months. That was an important feature of the agreement which cannot possibly be realized by this Bill. An attempt is made in the form of the Bill. I admit, to make it appear to the general public that the new arrangement will begin on and after 1st July of this year. I do not know how the Government propose to do that, except in the cutting down process of the last six months, as was suggested just now. I fail to see how the arrangement can possibly begin on1st July. It cannot possibly begin until1st January, 191 1, because the Braddon section is still in operation, and will automatically require the Treasurer to pay to the State Governments monthly their three-fourths share of the net Customs and Excise revenue. Therefore, I agree with those honorable members who have said that it would have been far more straightforward, consistent, and in harmony with the Constitution, had the Treasurer stated straight out, ' This is a ten years' agreement, to come in force on1st January next.' That would not have prevented him from deducting the amount which he claims to deduct as representing the shortage or the deficiency for the past year. I agree with him that it is only fitting and proper that that deduction should be made at some time or other. That could have been made within a ten years' period, beginning on1st January, without the Bill assuming its present form. As it is, the Treasurer will be in a difficulty. Under the Bill there will be two appropriations operating.' First there will be the month's appropriation of three-fourths of the net revenue from Customs and Excise from month to month under the Constitution, which goes on automatically and cannot be stopped. Secondly, it may be contended by some smart lawyers that in the Bill there is a second appropriation of 25s. per head, because it says -","Second Reading","SURPLUS REVENUE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

As a representative of Victoria, as a Federalist, and as a public man, I would very much like to see the principle of absolute freedom of trade introduced right off if it can possibly be done by the abolition of those certificates.","Second Reading","SURPLUS REVENUE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

With a half-and-half system it will be difficult to say what the rights of the States are. I approve of a per capita distribution, and would have welcomed its adoption long ago. had it not been for the Braddon provision; but, as that provision must operate until the end of this year, it would be better to wait until it has expired before making a change. We have the assurance of the Prime Minister, on behalf of his party, that the legislation now proposed is to remain the law of the land for ten years at least - that is, during the life of at least three Parliaments. It is not to be changed at' the will of chance majorities from session to session, or from Parliament to Parliament. That gives the States a certain amount of security. The last Government held the view that the States would not have sufficient security, and would be unable to launch in to enterprizes to be carried out over a number of years, if their revenues were liable to be affected by the policies of changing majorities in the Federal Parliament, and, therefore, it thought that the Financial Agreement should be embodied in the Constitution. During the elec to ral campaign we had the greatest difficulty in convincing the public that it was not intended that the arrangement come to should last for ever. It was argued that, if put in to the Constitution, it would be unalterable, but the intention was simply that it should remain in the Constitution until a majority of the people, voting in a majority of the States, decided 'that there should be an alteration. Had the people determined to put the agreement In to the Constitution, they could at a later date have taken it out again. If the people put a provision in to the Constitution, that provision can be taken out again at the will of those who put it there. When addressing my constituents, I said that I thought it probable that the proposed agreement, if embodied in the Constitution, would remain there for ten or fifteen years. I did not suggest that it would last longer. By the end of that period, the requirements of the Commonwealth may have so largely increased that the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States will have to be reviewed. I did not dream of the continuance of the arrangement for twenty-five or thirty years. As to the argument that an agreement put in to the Constitution has to remain there in perpetuity, it must be remembered that the Constitution makes this Parliament supreme in matters of finance. Were the Financial Agreement -embodied in the 'Constitution, and were it to be discovered later that the Commonwealth was not receiving enough revenue to meet its requirements, this Parliament could, should the States raise any objection to the reconsideration of the financial position, impose a land tax, an income tax, a stamp tax, or other direct imposts. That position was put by Mr. Dugald Thomson. He pointed out that, were an objection to be raised to a proposal to amend the Constitution with a view to allowing the requirements of the Commonwealth to be met. this Parliament would be the master of the situation, because it could say to the Governments of the States and to the State Parliaments, ' If you will not allow a re- arrangement, we must exercise powers of direct taxation, which we do not wish to exercise unless you make it necessary for us to do so.' It would be most disastrous were any political party to endeavour to foment disputes or jealousies between the various governing bodies existing under our Constitution. The State Parliaments and Governments have their proper share of activity, just as this Parliament and Government have their proper share. I do not think that the Prime Minister and his party will ever make it part of their policy to foment such disturbances as 1 speak of.","Second Reading","SURPLUS REVENUE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/continue[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I wish to say that, backed as this Bill will be by the assurance of the Federal Labour party that it is to remain on the statute-book for ten years at least - and to that statement I hear no dissent - the States will have the benefit, to a large extent, of the constitutional security which we proposed to give them under the Financial Agreement. With that guarantee and security, this proposal for the payment of 25s. per capita is open to the objection of rigidity and inelasticity which was raised against the Financial Agreement by the Labour party and the opponents generally of that agreement. It is, in the circumstances, a matter for congratulation that we have been able out of the wreck of the Financial Agreement to secure in this Bill an alternative which, if it does not satisfy some of the advocates of the agreement, may be regarded as a not inconsiderable instalment of what they expected and desired. I hope, in conclusion, that the Prime Minister will remember the objections raised to the form of the Bill, and will not insist upon passing it in its present form, pretending, so to speak, that the agreement will come into operation as from the1st July last when it will really be made to operate from the 1st of January next. If an agreement for nine and a-half years, or for only nine years, is meant, why not say so? A great and important instrument such as this, intended to operate for ten years at least, should on the face of it be clear and unmistakable. It should not be open to any quibbles, doubts, or ambiguities. The States should know clearly what their position under it will be. It is obvious from the criticism offered in various parts of this House, and by various State authorities, that the provisions of this Bill, even after this debate is concluded, will not be clearly understood, and it is suspected in certain quarters that there are some ambiguities in it, and that it is not as clear as a great and important instrument like this ought to be.","Second Reading","SURPLUS REVENUE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/continue[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Government propose, on advice of course, to abandon the whole of the Inter-State certificates of the bookkeeping system immediately this Bill becomes law. They think that the provision made in this measure is ample and secure. It will enable them to keep account of the whole of the revenue collected, and to make dead sure that three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue will, during the first six months of the current financial year, be paid over to the State Governments if they demand it. But, as I mentioned in my speech on the second reading of the Bill, in view of the fact that not very long ago the whole of the State Governments agreed together with the Government of the Commonwealth to the repeal of the constitutional provisions requiring the payment to the States of three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue, and so enable the Federal Government to begin the payment of 25s. per capita as from the1st July of this year, they might very well, if they desire a good result to follow their labours, come to some agreement with the present Commonwealth Government. I do not wish to enter into any controversial matter, but, as it affects the question raised, I should like to mention that I was approached by the Premier of Victoria, in view of my public promises, and he informed me that he was ready and willing to consult with the Commonwealth Government, and to come to an arrangement. He thought, after that interview with me, that it was worth his while to go. to Sydney and interview Mr. Wade. He subsequently returned to Melbourne, and came to see me again. He asked if the 17th June would be a suitable time for Commonwealth Ministers to meet State Ministers. I said that it would be a most inconvenient time for the Government of the Commonwealth, but that I was quite ready and willing to meet State Ministers to discuss the matter on the conditions laid down. The conditions were the fulfilment of the pledges of myself and the Government to the people of the Commonwealth. That was communicated, I understand, to all the Premiers, and subsequently there ensued the correspondence which Has been laid on the table. I am advised by the authorities who are competent to advise me that what is here proposed is the proper way of dealing with the matter; and it is the desire and wish of this Government, and all the Governments, together with the traders and the people generally, to have the Inter-State certificates abolished as useless, unnecessary, and as retarding trade and industry. That can be done in the way proposed as soon as this Bill is passed, or by. another measure if it is desired.","Second Reading","SURPLUS REVENUE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If we keep section 4 of the Act, revenue will have to be credited, and the expenditure debited, according to certain lines.

Parliament made such a provision by the Surplus Revenue Act 1908, of which we are now repealing section 4. It contains the whole of the provisions made by the Parliament for the distribution of the surplus revenue in accordance with the Constitution. If we sweep away that section, no provision by Parliament, ' on the basis that it deems fair,' remains, so far as I know. Section 4 provides for the Commonwealth crediting each State with revenue, debiting each State with expenditure, and paying over each month to the States the balance of revenue over expenditure, on a certain basis. It provides also a definition of new revenue, directs what is to be done with duties of Customs in certain cases, and defines payment to trust accounts as expenditure. All this goes. Nothing is proposed by the Government to be substituted for that section. Consequently there will be no provision of this kind by Parliament for the distribution of our revenue during the current six months. The Treasurer, of course, can during the following six months adjust his payments to fall in with his own design of paying only 25s. per head for the whole financial year, if he still thinks fit to do so. That is another matter, we are not now concerned whether it is right or wrong. But for the current six months the Treasurer appears to be sawing off the branch on which he and other Treasurers for the last nine years have been sitting. He should appeal to Parliament to authorize some provision for the distribution during the six months of the three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue which, under the Constitution, he must return to the States.","Second Reading","SURPLUS REVENUE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Bill is drafted, it is difficult to understand how' the Government propose to d1stribute, the Customs and Excise revenue in accordance' with the principle which has been in operation since the establishment of Federation.'' Under the bookkeeping system we have' credited to each State all revenue received, and debited against each State all expenditure incurred within it, and I fail to see how that system is to be carried out under these provisions. The difficulty has arisen owing to the desire of the Government to make this Bill come into operation before the expiration of the Braddon section. Had the Government proposed that it should take effect as from ist January, 191 1, the provisions of the Surplus Revenue Act could have been repealed as from that date; but the Government desire to bring this Bill into force six months before there is any legal power to make it effective. It cannot be made effective so far as the annual payment of 25s. per capita is concerned until 1st January next, and the whole trouble arises from the determination of the Government to try to drive a coach and four through the Constitution. I agree with those who have spoken that it is inadvisable to repeal section 4 of the Surplus Revenue Act until we can get something in its place. It is all very well for the Prime Minister to talk airily about the States agreeing to the Government's proposal, but I doubt whether they have power to come to such an agreement. The State Governments could not invade the Constitution by merely saying, 'We will take 25s. per capita during the remaining six months of the present year, instead of our proportion of the three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue due to us.' Each State Parliament would have to pass an Appropriation Act providing that any amount over 25s. per capita per annum may be retained by the Commonwealth during this six months' period.","Second Reading","SURPLUS REVENUE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[12]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I have read the Bill over and over again. I have had a good deal of experience in reading Acts of Parliament, but I must confess that the position has already presented itself to me in at least two or three different lights, and I do not yet know which is the correct one. I would like the attention of the Prime Minister for a moment, because, after all, we are merely dealing with a matter of form, and, so far as our work in Committee is concerned, we all desire to assist the Government to put the Bill in a form in which it will give effect to the Intention which the House has affirmed by agreeing to its second reading. Let me put one or two of the difficulties that I feel in connexion with this matter. As I intimated during my remarks upon the motion for the second reading of the measure, the object of clause 4 seemed to me to be to provide that during the whole of the current financial year the Commonwealth should return to the States 25s. per capita. but should it be obliged to return them more than that amount during the first half of the year, it should be enabled to strike a balance by returning them less during the second half of the year. Is that the view of the Prime Minister?","Second Reading","SURPLUS REVENUE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[14]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Under that provision we inquire, ' What is the population of Queensland?' The reply is, ' Half a million.' We then have to ask ourselves, ' What has the Commonwealth to return to Queensland?' The answer is, ' 25s. per head, or £625,000 per annum.' How is that to be paid? By monthly instalments. Therefore the Commonwealth, during each month of the financial year, must pay to Queensland one-twelfth of £625,000. That is what the clause provides. For- the current six months of the financial year the provision is really in the nature of a parliamentary appropriation. One-twelfth of 25s. per head must be paid monthly to Queensland. Let the matter stand there for a moment. Queensland may say, 'Oh, that is all very well, but section 87 of the Constitution is in existence until 31st December next, and under that the return to Queensland of a great deal more than 25s. per head is guaranteed.' Therefore, during the first six months of the present financial year, the proposed monthly appropriation will go for nothing. The declaration is tantamount to saying that we will pay a portion of our debts. Of course we will. The Constitution provides that during that term we must pay to Queensland a great deal more than 25s. per head. Now, the Treasurer must obey. an Act of Parliament as well as the Constitution, and under this Bill he will be required to pay monthly to Queensland during the first half of the current year one-twelfth of 25s. per head, whilst under the Constitution he will be bound to return the difference between that amount and the three-fourths share of the net revenue from Customs and Excise. That is the extraordinary way in which the matter is put. I have always maintained that in the settlement of this financial question we ought to exercise the powers which have been directly vested in us by the Constitution, without any agreement with the State Premiers or with anybody else, and that we ought to exercise them as authorized by the Constitution, that is, from the 1st January next. But for some reason or other, the Government have chosen to say, ' We are going to initiate this scheme as from ist July of the present year.'","Second Reading","SURPLUS REVENUE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[14]/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

That is one intention. I have dealt with it before on its merits. But assuming the intention to be right, I say that clause 4 does not give effect to it, because it says that you are to pay by monthly instalments 25s. per head in the first six months, and then the Constitution comes in and says that, in addition, you have to pay the surplus amount to the States. In the second half of the year you would not be able to cut down the 25s. instalments. You must still go on. According to that view, the intention of the Government will not be carried out, if I can read the clause at all. The second point is that this Bill gives no parliamentary authority, no direction, no authority to the head of the Government, as Treasurer, to distribute amongst the States, in proportion to population, or in any other way, that very large sum - amounting to some millions - forming the difference arising during the first half of the financial year between the aggregate amount of 25s. per head and what will be ascertained to be three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue. Unless I can be shown to be wrong, surely the Treasurer ought to take time to have this matter investigated. The Attorney-General is not here. We have been offered no explanation of this particular crux. I can promise the Treasurer that, if he will give us an opportunity, I will render him every assistance in my power to frame a Bill to carry out the intention which the House has authorized in passing the second reading; but I have thought it right to point out the difficulties which present themselves to my mind.","Second Reading","SURPLUS REVENUE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[14]/continue[13]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

But something said by the Treasurer in his speech made me think that I was wrong. The position as it appears to me is plainly this: The Treasurer intends - and some of the legal members on this side of the Chamber say that that is what the Bill will effect - to carry out the terms of the Constitution during the current six months of the financial year by paying back three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue to the States; that is, if he does not - as he seems to assume that he will be able to do - effect some arrangement with the States by which they will fall in with his ultimate design. That ultimate design is simply this : Having paid to the States - in some manner which I can assure him that no legal member on this side can understand - three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue during the current half of the financial year, he is then going to pay, under the succeeding clause, a sum sufficient to make up the total of 25s. per head for the whole financial year.","Second Reading","SURPLUS REVENUE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[15]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

When I first read the clause I made a note that there was a doubt as to what was meant. What the honorable member for Flinders relies on mainly, I think, is that 'surplus revenue ' referred to in the Constitution is the difference between out one-fourth share of the net Customs and Excise revenue and our expenditure. I went to the Library to get the report of the surplus revenue case, but it is not there at the present moment. I think that in that case the High Court did not say that that was the definition of 'surplus revenue.' I think it said that it did not decide that point, and could see no distinction between the surplus revenue dealt with in section 94, which is all the balances and the surplus revenue referred to in section 89. In other words, section 94 obliges the Commonwealth to hand back to the States the whole of the unexpended or unappropriated balances, and that applies after the expiration of the Braddon section, as well as before it. Before the expiration, the payment must amount to at least three-fourths of the Customs and Excise.","Second Reading","SURPLUS REVENUE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[16]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I do not think that there is an Act or decision to say that we are entitled to keep the whole of the revenue which does not come from Customs and Excise. What the Constitution says we are entitled to spend is, in relation to our powers of administration and legislation, all revenue received from any . source, subject for ten years to the payment of three-fourths of the Customs and Excise to the States. Any revenue in hand beyond that is surplus revenue which must be handed to the States. Had the Financial Agreement of las'- year been carried at the referendum, that would have been put an end to, and then we would have had the power of retaining from time to time, subject to section 87, without appropriation, the unexpended moneys in our hands, and the States would have been entitled to nothing. But section 94 is not repealed by this measure, and the result is that we will continue to make payment to the States of surplus revenue from whatever source it may have come. The intent of the Bill is that we do not want to let the States see that we are not giving them 25s. per head from the 1st January, 191 1. By an ingenious method of drafting which reflects great credit upon the draftsman we say that we will pay 25s. per head from the 1st July of this year, less £450,000 and subject to section 87. And after deducting our expenditure from whatever balance is in hand - and part of that expenditure will be £125,000 to Western Australia as provided for in clause 5 - we shall make the ordinary deductions for the management of the Department which will no longer be affected by the bookkeeping provisions. Therefore all expenditure will become Commonwealth expenditure, and all that is deducted from whatever revenue we have in hand. The balance remaining is surplus revenue, and is dealt with under clause 6 of the Bill. If that balance, plus a payment of 25s. per head to the States, amounts to whatever sum ought to be paid under the Braddon ' blot ' for six months and under the 25s. per head provision for the balance of the year, then all constitutional requirements will be complied with.","Second Reading","SURPLUS REVENUE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[16]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If we examine the Bill carefully for a considerable time, we may discover from it the intentions of the Government, but though we have listened to the Prime Minister for some minutes I defy any one to understand the reply he has given to what has been said on this side. Arguments by authorities who merit attention were addressed to the Committee on the legal aspect of the case, and the Prime Minister, jumping in where the Attorney-General fears to tread, does not reply to the arguments at all, but says that the Crown Law authorities, whose presence we are not privileged to have here, have told him that the Bill is all right. The honorable gentleman himself, in his legal wisdom, also thinks that it is all right, but as a lay member of the Committee I should like very much, in answer to the arguments to which I have referred, to have the opinion of the only representative of the law in the Cabinet. I do think the Attorney-General might answer what has been said upon a question fraught with enormous consequence to the Commonwealth; because if we have to pay 25s. per head for the last six months of the coming financial year, in addition to three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue for the first half of the year, the Commonwealth will either be bankrupt or will have to raise the money by loan. I am sure it is not the intention of the Government to bring about such a state of affairs. I think the Attorney-General might take the Committee into his full confidence, and let us know, what the Prime Minister in the course of his speech was unable to do, what are the arguments behind the Government proposal to give us assurance that the position of .the Commonwealth in the matter will be absolutely, safe.","Second Reading","SURPLUS REVENUE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[18]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If that be the point, then it is necessary to emphasize the distinction between section 87 of the Constitution which deals with the aggregate minimum to be returned, and sections 89. 93, and 94, which deal with its distribution. This Bill substitutes for those sections a per capita distribution. From the date of its passage there is a per capita distribution, which, until 31st December, 1910, is to be of not less than three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue, and thereafter during the currency of this measure not less than 25s. per capita per annum.

They will be not one penny piece the poorer for any legislation such as this. We cannot take from them one penny that is their due, and the whole question, as the Treasurer has frequently pointed out, is simply whether we should take it from there when we have a right to take it, after the first day of the coming year, or whether they should not, seeing that we and they are partners, do what is proper by making allowances for the position. The whole thing is simple, and I do not see why, in the circumstances, there should be any hesitation on their part or doubt on ours. As to our right to deal with the matter, and the manner in which the three-fourths is to be paid, it was laid down clearly by the Chief Justice in the judgment of the High Court on the Surplus Revenue Act, as reported on page 190 of volume VII. of the Commonwealth Law Reports, that for certain reasons given it is impossible to hold that the balances are to be finally struck as of the last day of every month. He went on to say that the plaintiffs rested their whole case on this contention, which, in his opinion, was untenable, and added -","Second Reading","SURPLUS REVENUE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[24]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The remark of the honorable member for Richmond that the Bill does not provide for the allocation of surplus revenue, because the three- fourths is not surplus revenue, is not correct. It is perfectly true that the three-fourths is not surplus revenue, and it is what the States are entitled to under section 87. When, therefore, 'surplus revenue ' is spoken of in the Bill, the words do not and cannot refer to the three-fourths, which has to be paid to the States until 31st December of this year. They refer to the difference between the Commonwealth's share and the Commonwealth's expenditure, which, unless appropriated, will be surplus revenue, and must, under the ruling of the Court, be paid over to the States before the 31st December, 1910. After that date all revenue beyond 25s. per capita , plus that which is expended or appropriated by the Commonwealth, will be surplus revenue, and, therefore, will be dealt with in the way provided by this Bill.","Second Reading","SURPLUS REVENUE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[24]/para[2]","N/A","N/A"

No matter what our opinions or the ultimate consequences may be, the House cannot be expected to transform itself into a Court to decide questions of law as between lawyers who take up different views. The Attorney-General is the authority of this House. Believing that, I should have been quite prepared to submit to the decision which he has given without making any further observations, but for the fact that, owing probably to his absence during a considerable portion of the time devoted to the consideration of this point, he seems not yet to have grasped or to have fully considered the difficulties which have arisen. I shall put again the two points that I raised, my only excuse for doing so being the vast moment and importance of the matter with which we are dealing. Hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of pounds are involved in the difference between our views. I stated, first of all, that I understood the intention of the Government was that the -per capita payment of 25s. per annum should commence as from 1st inst. - that is to say, that it should cover the whole of the present financial year - and that, although we were obliged under the Braddon section, which must be observed until the end of the year, to pay more during the current six months, we should be enabled to strike an average by making a deduction from the payments during the last six months. The Treasurer assented completely to that view.

The per capita distribution applies only to the surplus revenue of the Commonwealth, and if there is one thing which the Attorney-General has made clear, it is that the surplus revenue of the Commonwealth does not include the three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue which is payable to the States. Therefore, the provisions relating to the distribution of the surplus revenue do not touch the particular subject with which I am dealing, namely, the difference between the 25s. per capita and the three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue. The Bill deals with a contribution of 25s. per capita , which is only a portion of that revenue. The remainder is left unprovided for. Neither the Constitution nor the Surplus Revenue Act, which this Bill will to some extent repeal, nor the Bill itself, makes any provision as to how the Commonwealth shall pay that difference, or in what proportions it shall be paid to the several States. The Government require parliamentary directions in this matter - why not take them? Why not frame the Bill in such a way as to make it give specific directions? The Committee have a right to have these legal difficulties removed, apart altogether from questions of policy. It is true that questions of policy have been introduced into this debate by some honorable members, but by none more than by the Prime Minister himself. I put to the Attorney-General the two points which I have raised, and which seem to me to require explanation. Another point has been put by the honorable member for Bendigo which did not occur to me, but which seems to carry equal weight with the points which I have raised. The Constitution provides the mode in which the apportionment to the States of their share of the Customs and Excise revenue shall be determined. It sets revenue against expenditure, and under the Surplus Revenue Act that disposition has been continued with slight modifications. But under this Bill it is proposed to wipe out that Act. . If the Government are attempting to federalize our revenue, they are making no provision for the other side of the account, by which to arrive at the amounts which will be payable to the States. Without unduly pressing Ministers upon the matter, I think that we are entitled to have these points made clear.","Second Reading","SURPLUS REVENUE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[27]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In my opinion, there is no difficulty and no inconsistency in this, Bill. There is nothing contradictory in clause 4. Two points require emphasis. The Bill cannot affect the provisions of section 87 of the Constitution before 31st December next. The three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue must be returned by the Commonwealth to the States until 31st December of the present year. Twenty-five shillingsper capita per annum must be paid to the States as from the1st of July, 1 910. Now clause 4 provides for both of these things being done.

Section 87 of the Constitution prohibits that, and clause 4 of the Bill is not inconsistent with the Constitution. But, after 31st December, it can pay at the rate of 25s. per annum. Now, since the arrangement starts on the1st of July, 1910, all the Commonwealth has to do to comply with section 87 of the Constitution and clause 4 of this Bill is to pay 25s. per capita in the year that starts on the1st July, 1910, and ends on the 30th June, 191 1. And there is nothing in clause 4 that regulates the amounts to be paid each month or during each six-monthly period. The Bill thus complies with section 87 of the Constitution, and also with the condition to pay the 25s. per head. The 25s. has to be paid during the year, and as from the 1st July, 1910. It is perfectly clear that if you pay 18s. out of 25s. before the expiration of this year, you will only owe 7s. during the six months of the year which starts on the1st day of January, 191 1. Clearly, then, this Bill does not violate the Constitution, nor attempt to take from the States anything to which they are entitled. If I agree to pay a man 25s. in a fortnight, and I am also bound by a prior agreement to pay him £1 in the first week of the fortnight, the second agreement does not necessarily conflict with the first at all.

I do not propose to occupy any time in repeating or elaborating the argument against the legal effect or form of this Bill, since all the points suggested by the debate have just been admirably summarized by. the honorable member for Flinders. But let me ask honorable members to measure the divagations of the Bill by what is actually authorized to be done thereunder. In the first place it does not authorize, and it cannot alter, as the Attorney-General has just admitted, the primary obligation of the Commonwealth to pay three- fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue up to the end of this calendar year. That has to be done; it cannot be escaped. In the next six months of the year what is proposed is to pay to the States not 12s. 6d. per head for that period but some sum less, owing to deductions made from the three-fourths legally paid to the States, so as to bring their income clown to 25s. per head for the whole financial year under a method of calculation, less £450.000. In the first six months the provision of the Constitution runs and three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue must be paid to the States. In the second six months something has to be paid less £450,000, and therefore only after the 1st July, 191 1, is 25s. per head to be really paid, to the States without deduction. All the difficulty before the Committee, all this long argument, and all our misunderstandings are due to the fact that for some mysterious reason the Government wishes to draft this measure so that it may appear to authorize the payment of 25s. per head to the States from the 1st July of the present year. As a matter of fact, it cannot constitutionally do that and does not, in fact, do it. This is the whole point. Yet all that the Ministry desire to do might have been clone without question or delay. They had only to accept the provision of the Constitution, as they must do, until the end of the year. They had then to deduct £450,000 in the first six months of next year and after that authorize the payment of 25s. per head for ten years. The whole of our difficulties to-night are due to the fact that instead of putting these three propositions plainly on the face of the measure, the Government, whose attention was drawn to this point during the debate on the Address-in-Reply, has thought fit to adopt a method of draftsmanship which has brought us face to face with three intricate questions as to the legality of the measure, to which the honorable members for Darling Downs, Flinders, Angas, Bendigo, and others have called attention. Is this worth while? It is for the Government to decide. We have nothing more to add. Why not frankly legalize their proposed action at once, getting rid of all this transparent pretence, which deceives no one, of commencing to pay the 25s. per head earlier than the Government intends to pay it?","Second Reading","SURPLUS REVENUE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[29]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I would remind the Committee that another honorable and learned member, with a great deal more diffidence and humbleness - the Attorney-General in the previous Government - has expressed in legal language a very positive opinion that the present drafting of the clause covers all necessities from a legal point of view. Expressing himself in quiet language, he said that it only bears that meaning. He did not speak dogmatically and say, ' That is the law and no other.'

The Constitution, however, requires that, until the end of 1910, they must be paid three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue. I am afraid that 1he High Court, the final arbitrator, may decide that this measure is an attempt to over-ride the Constitution, and may compel us to pay to the States three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue for the first six months of the financial year, and for the second six months an amount equal to 25s. per capita , according to their populations. Would it not be better to say clearly that, until the end of 1010, the States will be paid the three- fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue due to them under the Constitution, and that, from 1st January until 30th June, 191 1, they shall receive a sum - less the deductions provided for in the schedule - which, taken with the payments for the first six months of the current financial year, will make the total payments for the financial year equivalent to a per capita distribution of 25s. for the whole of the year? It seems to me that it would be safer to legislate in that way than to run the risk of being mulcted in costs for attempting to evade the Constitution. Personally, I think that we are treating the States very liberally. If I had my way. I would not do more than bind this Parliament. I think it would be. enough to provide for three years ahead. What is being proposed is to bind this and two subsequent Parliaments. Of course, the Government, having decided that the arrangement which is to be made is to stand for ten years, will be able to carry that decision into effect. It would be safest, however, to make our legislation date from the beginning of next January.","Second Reading","SURPLUS REVENUE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[32]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In section 89, the reference is - shall pay to each State, month by month, the balance -  In section 94, the reference is - may provide for the monthly payment. It is very clear in the light of the judgment of. the High Court in the surplus revenue case that that does not mean equal payments. The dictionary meaning of ' instalment ' is just as clear as is the dictionary meaning of ' payment.' That is to say, that unless it is qualified by a term that comes before it ' instalment ' does not connote equality in any way. In fact, it is a common thing in connexion with agreements for the purchase of land on a time- payment principle to say that there shall be a payment for so many months of equal instalments. There is nothing in the Bill to lead one to attach to the word ' instalment ' as used here anything more than attaches to it generally: I think I might explain the difference between ' payment ' and' instalment ' in this way: The word ' payment' is properly used in sections 89 and 94 of the Constitution, because it relates to an unknown amount of money. The word 'instalment' relates to a definite amount - namely, 25s. per head of the population. There might be no payment at all under section 94 of the Constitution, but if there is it must be paid, not by equal monthly payments, but monthly. I submit that 'instalment' is the proper word to use in relation to this specific amount of 25s. per head. There is absolutely nothing in the terms of the Bill which should force one to attach to it the meaning suggested by the honorable member for Flinders. 'That meaning really cannot be attached to it, because, as I pointed out by way of interjection, to do so would make clause 4 ultra vires. It clearly could not have effect, because it would mean that we could not fulfil the terms of section 87 of the Constitution. If we paid the 25s. per head in equal instalments clearly we should pay during the current six months less than three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue. I submit that the difficulties in this matter are only those which have- been created by the remarks of honorable members on the other side, and whether one views the matter from the stand-point of constitutionality or from the very much more important point of equity to the States, this Bill gives effect in the only way possible to the terms of the agreement arrived at between the State. Premiers and the last Commonwealth Government. There is no other way by which effect could be given to the terms of that agreement without throwing the affairs of the Commonwealth Treasury into headlong confusion during the next six months. That I am sure would not be desired for a moment. There is nothing in the wording of these clauses to alarm honorable members. In my opinion, they are perfectly in order, are constitutional, and are adapted to the purpose we have in view.","Second Reading","SURPLUS REVENUE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[34]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

'There was a straightforward statement made to the electors that the States would be guaranteed for ten years a payment of 25s. per capita , and this Bill, on the face of it, attempts to do that to a certain extent. The Bill says distinctly, in clause 4, that there will be an annual payment made to the States by monthly instalments at the rate of 25s. per capita . That, I take it, is the clear meaning of clause 4, but it seems that the Government are going to do nothing of the kind. After declaring, in the clearest language, that they are going to pay the States an annual sum of 25s. per capita by monthly instalments, the Government show that the real purpose is to pay the States for half a year at the rate not of 25s. per capita , but of only 5s. 2d. or 5s. 3d. per capita .","Second Reading","SURPLUS REVENUE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[35]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The honorable member referred to the fact that the instalments could, under this Bill, be paid in unequal amounts during the course of the year, to any States, provided the States received the full amount of 25s. per capita in the year. How is that going to affect the finances of Australia and the general Government agencies that are absolutely essential to the wellbeing of the people, whether those agencies be operated by this Parliament or the Parliaments of the States? Almost as important as getting the money to any governing body that wishes to remain solvent, is getting it in even proportions and amounts, so that they may know what they have to expect. What is going to happen in the future with regard to the Bill should be pointed out now, because it seems to show the necessity for more definite and clear machinery than the Bill embodies. If in the latter half of this financial year we may give the States something less than 2s. 6d. per head in order to make up for the excess they have received in the first six months, equally properly - if that is proper - we could, in the next nine years, give any State the same amount in the first month, practically nothing the next, more the third, and so forth, right through the year. If the amounts are going to be paid unequally for the next nine or ten years, a very serious state of affairs will be brought about by the Bill. If the instalments are not to be regular equal instalments, it will be within the power of any party which may happen to be in control of the Federation to bring to its knees any particular State Government with which they happen to be in disagreement.","Second Reading","SURPLUS REVENUE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[36]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I do not think that that power is limited, nor do I think that the monthly instalments need be equal. In leases and other documents as a rule we have the words 'equal monthly instalments' when the instalments are intended to be equal.  To hold that the instalments must be equal would be to render the whole clause an absurdity, because if that were the position we could not deduct from the proposed payments the amounts set forth in the schedule. We could not deduct them in respect of die first half of the year because the Braddon section would prevent that being done; and if the deduction were made during the second half we should not be making a payment of 25s. for the whole year by equal monthly instalments. I therefore hold that the alleged check on monthly payments does not exist in the terms of the Bill and that the Government can during the next half-year cut down the payments to an amount that, having regard to what has been paid under the Braddon section during the first six months, ' will make the total payment for the year equal to 25s. per head.","Second Reading","SURPLUS REVENUE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[38]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Thus he sought to convey to the public the impression that the proposal embodied in the Bill will take something from the States. It is true that under the measure the monthly payments may not be quite what they would have been had the agreement which was entered into between the late Government and the State Premiers been ratified by the electors and embodied in the Constitution. But if under that arrangement £5,000,000 would have been returned to the several States during the financial year, under this Bill the same amount will be paid to them within the same period. The honorable member for Parramatta has alleged that the Government intend to make excessive payments to the State during the first half of the financial year, and to make certain deductions during the second half of that year. But I submit that when the balance is adjusted on the 30th June, 191 1, the same amount will have been paid to the States under this Bill as would have been paid to them under the agreement made by the late Government.","Second Reading","SURPLUS REVENUE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[41]/continue[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Why an honorable member should seek by specious reasoning to prove that honorable members upon this side of the Chamber are doing something which would shock the sense of justice of any Judge is to my mind incomprehensible.

Of course I recognise that under the scheme propounded by the late Government that agreement would have been embodied in the Constitution.

The Premiers representing the States made concessions in order that the Financial Agreement might be embodied in the Constitution. The clause under consideration proposes to repeal certain legislation passed by Parliament to effect the distribution of revenue to the States. The Government propose to pay 25s. per head per annum. The point has been raised that they have not provided the machinery to deal with the apportionment of the revenue hereafter. The honorable member for Adelaide says that the opposition is based on political motives. It is not so in my case, because I am prepared to approve any reasonable arrangement to settle the difficulty. I state at once that the1 proposal of the Government is a reasonable one; not perhaps so reasonable as I should have hoped to get, but that is another matter. Are the Government satisfied that the provisions of the Bill will give effect to their intention? The arguments to the contrary have been clearly put from this side. With all due deference to the Attorney-General, whose ability in dealing with general questions is well known, I hold that he has not given any clear answer to satisfy the Committee that the Government are even carrying out their own intention. After the second reading of a Bill has been affirmed, our duty is to make its provisions as perfect as possible. Now the question is, will this clause carry out the intention of the Government. Certain discrepancies have been pointed out by legal members on this side, and the Attorney-General has been asked to specifically answer their objections. He has risen and made a declamatory address, hut he has not answered them in any' sense. 1 for one now wash my hands of all responsibility, which of course the Government must take. I have been in no way actuated by party hostility to them. I desire to see this question settled, and, even though the Government's proposal may not be what I should like altogether, still I am prepared to accept it. But I am unable to see that the provisions in die Bill will carry out definitely, without fear of controversy in the High Court, their intention.  Clause agreed to.
