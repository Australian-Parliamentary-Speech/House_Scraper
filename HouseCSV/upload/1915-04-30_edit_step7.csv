The letter was in reply to a request made by me for further consideration for the mail contractors who had been so badly hit by the high price of fodder. I draw attention to this passage in it -  The general question of granting relief to mail contractors on account of the drought has already been given careful consideration, but it is not seen how, without inflicting a grave injustice on tenderers, and striking at the fundamental principle of public tendering for mail services, any consideration can be shown to contractors by way of increasing their subsidy during the currency of their contract. The contracts are let both in good years and in bad years, and tenderers understand that they must make provision in their tenders to meet the vicissitudes of the weather. The communication adds that the concession offered by the Department is that services may be reduced 50 per cent., with a subsidy of 25 per cent. I ask the Postmaster-General whether he is not aware that horses have to be fed, whether they make two trips a week or a trip a day? It is impossible, at the present time, to turn them out when they are not running. I ask him to again consider the representations that have been made to him on behalf of the mail contractors.","POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[2]/question[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Since the drought, some of the contractors have substituted motor cars for horse-drawn vehicles. Of the contractors who are still using horses, while some have to feed their horses, others are able to obtain grass. All are not in the same position. The problem with which the Department has to deal is a most difficult one. A large number of the contracts were let last December, in the middle of the drought, and the contractors knew the conditions when they ten dered. Doubtless their prices were higher than they WOuld have been under ordinary conditions. The Department does not demand a refund when seasons prove to bp unexpectedly good, and it would be an unsound business arrangement to increase subsidies when a bad season was being experienced. To do this would be unfair to those persons who, having calculated the probability of a bad season, had tendered at a higher price than those who succeeded in getting the contract. To increase the subsidies in the manner now proposed would cost an enormous sum of money, and could not be done in the offhand way that seems to be thought possible.","POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[2]/question[4]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I refer the honorable member to one typical case cited by the honorable member for Barrier, who is reported in Hansard, Vol. LXX., page 752, as follows: - I have here a pamphlet which gives an account of the arrest and trial of six men simply because they proposed to form a trade union to improve the lot of their fellow-workers. They wore agricultural labourers, and were anxious to obtain a living wage for those employed on the farms of England. They had been receiving 7s. per week, and when they were told that this rate was to be reduced to 6s. per week, they formed an association with the object of securing a wage of 10s. per week. In opposition to their scheme, placards were distributed throughout the agricultural areas of England setting forth that any one who joined the union would be sentenced to seven years' transportation. In the words of this pamphlet - 'This was no idle threat; within three days of the publication of the notice George Loveless and five other labourers were arrested and lodged in Dorchester gaol.' George Loveless was not only a Labourite, but a Methodist local preacher - a fact that should appeal to the Prime Minister - ' The five other labourers were James Loveless, brother to George, also a Wesleyan local preacher; James Hammitt their brother-in-law; Thomas Standfield, another Wesleyan local preacher;' John Standfield, his son; and James Brine.' These men had to stand their trial because they had formed a union with the idea of raising the wages of agricultural labourers to 10s. per week.","CRIMINAL PROSECUTION OP UNIONISTS","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[4]/answer[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","216","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","By section 3 of the original Judiciary Act 1903, the Parliament conferred on the High Court original jurisdiction in matters arising under the Constitution or involving its interpretation; and by the amending Judiciary Act passed last year, in all matters of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. The present measure gives the Court original jurisdiction in trials of indictable offences against the laws of the Commonwealth. There is a broad, general reason for the passage of this measure. It is, first of all, an eminently desirable thing that the Federal Court should have jurisdiction to deal with offences against Federal laws; and, secondly, it is very desirable that the power possessed by the Attorneys-General of most of the States to submit cases direct to the Court without any preliminary commitment, should be vested in the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth also. In South Australia that power is conferred by the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1876, section 334; in Western Australia by the Criminal Code 1913, No. 28, section 579; in Queensland by the Criminal Code 1899, section 561; in Tasmania by 19 Victoria, No. 9, section 4; and in Victoria by the Crimes Act 1890, section 386. By those Statutes the Attorneys-General of those States are enabled to do what it is proposed to empower the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth to do under clause 3 of this Bill. By clause 4, section 72 of the principal Act is to be amended in such a way as to prevent a conflict of jurisdiction and prolongation of procedure. As the section stands at present it would be possible for a person tried in the High Court to require that Court to reserve a question of law for the Full Court of the State or the Full Court of the High Court. This clause amends the law so that it will be possible to reserve such a point for the Full Court of the High Court only. It is proposed to amend clause 4 by striking out of the last line the words ' the Supreme,' and inserting in lieu the word 'a,' so that the last line in the Bill will read ' if the trial was had in a Court of a State.' The-reason for the alteration is that in some States indictable offences can be tried in other State Courts than the Supreme Court, for example, in a Court of Quarter Sessions. I do not wish to labour this matter. The measure that stands next on the notice-paper must be regarded as complementary to, and consequential upon, this Bill, and I ask my learned friends to look at the Bill in that light, so that we shall not be traversing the same ground twice. As this is a measure which does not appeal to members generally, but only to' those learned in the law, and deals with matters quite' familiar to the learned members for Angas and Darling Downs, I will confine myself to the reasons I have advanced in support of the Bill, and without further remark move the second reading.","Second Reading","JUDICIARY BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/para[3]","N/A","N/A"

It contains no important principles. Its object is really to fill up gaps that have been discovered, the most important of these being the fixing of the application of the Army Act. Under section 55 of the principal Act, when Defence Forces of the Commonwealth are called out for active service the Army Act applies, but the application of that Act is somewhat vague. It is desired to make it more definite and to put it beyond doubt' that it applies both within and without the limits of the Commonwealth. An amendment of the existing law in that respect is therefore embodied in this Bill. At the beginning of this session, we passed an Amending Defence Bill, which was designed to legalize the raising of Expeditionary Forces. At the outbreak of the war the then Government took the necessary action to raise those Forces, but there was really no complete authority in the Defence Act for that action, and an Amending Bill was therefore introduced to legalize it. Unfortunately that Bill, which was introduced at the beginning of the session, was not dated back to the commencement of the war, and therefore it became operative only as from the date on which it was assented to, which was subsequent to the raising of the Expeditionary Force despatched to New Guinea. It is desirable that we should bring these actions of our predecessors within the scope of the law, and this Bill will have that effect. Then again, under the law as it stands, no power is given to surveyors in the Department to enter upon private property to carry out certain necessary surveys.","Second Reading","DEFENCE BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

Some trouble has arisen with regard to this matter, and in certain cases pegs so put in have been disturbed. We now desire that the Defence Department shall have statutory authority for such action. Since the commencement of the war the Department has found it necessary, as an act of justice, to adopt a certain course, although it was doubtful whether we had the legal right to do so. For instance, as I mentioned in this House a few days ago, certain men enlisted for active service under assumed names, and stated they were unmarried. After their departure for the front, however, it was discovered that they were married, and the Department has assumed the responsibility of paying for the maintenance of their wives and children a portion of the money due to them. It is contended that under the law as it stands, these men, if they returned to-morrow, could claim a refund of the money so paid unless the authority for which we ask in this Bill be given to us.","Second Reading","DEFENCE BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Under the law as it stands, if it be proved that a member of the Citizen Forces is dismissed from his employment because of attending drill or a camp of instruction that he is commanded' to attend, then the employer may be fined, and the fine so inflicted is paid into the consolidated revenue. The Government consider that where it is proved - and it has been proved in many cases - that a citizen soldier has been thrown out of work owing to the action of his employer in dismissing him because of the service thus rendered by him to his country, the fine imposed by the Court should be paid to the soldier who has suffered.

It validates among other acts some done by myself. It adds another technical arm to the Defence Force, and makes further detailed provisions which, T think, on the whole are wise. In war time authorities cannot stop to consider whether a necessary action is legal; it must be done at once. That was what we felt when war broke out. During the six weeks that we were in office, we did many things that were not strictly ia accordance with the law, nor consonant with the expression of fine sentiment of which we have heard so much lately When war breaks out there is no time to theorize. The duty of the authorities is to make the country safe, so far as they are able to do so, leaving all political and soc ia l obligations to be dealt with afterwards. It-is an old maxim that the safety of the State is the highest law. The Bill validates any informalities and illegalities that may have occurred during the trying period to which I refer. As to the compensation of employes who are unjustly dismissed from their employment for attending drill, I am inclined to think that the matter is best left to a Court. It is better that a magistrate should determine what compensation shall be paid than that a Minister, Labour or Liberal, whose decisions in many cases would be looked upon by the public as influenced by political or personal considerations, should have the matter left in his hands. Employers who prevent their assistants from undergoing training should be severely punished, but the Court must act at its discretion, according to the circumstances. There are cases in which the employer is not wholly to blame.","Second Reading","DEFENCE BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I would point out, however, that an employe may not be injured in any way by an attempt to penalize him or prejudice him in his employment. Yet, notwithstanding, the Court is empowered to direct that the whole or any part of the penalty recovered from his employer may be paid to him.. I think that the clause should be drafted to meet the case in which it is proved that the employe has been penalized or injured, so that the magistrate may then assess reasonable compensation, and direct that it shall be paid out of the penalty recovered from the employer. To my mind, as the clause is drafted, a wider power is given than is intended to be given. Section 55 of the principal Act is to be amended by making it apply to troops on active service, whether within or without the limits of the Commonwealth. If I am not mistaken, the Imperial Army Act of 1881 applies to our troops when they are outside the limits of the Commonwealth only if there is a provision in our local legislation to permit it to do so, or if those troops are serving with Imperial troops. The amendment to which I refer is intended to give the Army Act application, whether our troops serving abroad are with the Imperial troops or not, and whether they are within or without the Commonwealth.

This seems to me exceedingly unjust. The reason that the men receive the same rates of pay as the men of the Australian Forces is that they have become citizens of Australia, and have entered into our national life, so far as their Imperial obligations will permit, and that consequently they ought to be treated as Australians are treated. The same reasoning will apply to Imperial reserve officers. I know of a case of a second lieutenant who has taken up land in Australia, and has;iincurred obligations in connexion with it, but who, now that he has been called away to the front, is being paid only the Imperial rate of pay, although the rank and file of the Imperial reservists receive the Australian rate of pay.","Second Reading","DEFENCE BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Department having ascertained that this provision has caused a great deal of trouble, desire to amend section 62 by omitting the word 'second,' thus permitting trainees who have passed the necessary examination to be promoted to the rank of lieutenant without any further examination. I move -  That the following new clause be inserted : - ' 4a. Section 62 of the principal Act is amended by omitting from sub-section (7) thereof the word ' second.' ' Sub-section proposed to be amended - 62.- (7) A person who has served as officer in the Senior Cadets shall be eligible . . . to be appointed second lieutenant in the Citizen Forces. . . .

Constituents who have relatives at the front often ring me up here, and at my own home, to ascertain if there is news of them.
