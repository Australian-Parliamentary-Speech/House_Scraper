I feel, however, that I must say it is absolutely essential, in a House like this, elected as it is by the people of the Commonwealth, that honorable members should take an intelligent interest in the progress of events, and have a clear understanding of the manner in which important public works are carried out in this country. Unfortunately, it appears that, even at this late hour of the day, it is necessary for the voice of the missionary to be heard amongst those who live politically in the dark ages, to do what is possible to educate them to the advantages of a properly organized system for the carrying out of Government works. I have no hesitation in saying that whenever those who are regarded as authorities in this matter - men not necessarily of the same political colour as myself or other honorable members on this side of the House - have been asked which method - day labour under proper supervision or contract - is the better for the carrying out of public works, they have stated that the balance of expert opinion was in favour of the day-labour system. In view of this testimony from the most highly-qualified engineers and contractors in the Commonwealth, I cannot conceive how any honorable member can attempt to justify the contract system. It has been tried certainly, but in connexion with the bulk of our public works, even in the constituency represented by the honorable member for Riverina (Mr. Killen), the responsible authorities have had to resort to the day-labour system. The most important public body in Victoria - I refer to the Metropolitan Board of Works - approves of this method. The Board consists, for the most part, of men representing municipal councils throughout the metropolitan area, and in recent times it has carried out public works involving the expenditure of considerable sums of money. I believe that on many occasions when tenders have been altogether too high - I do not suggest collusion between contractors - on the advice of its engineers the Board has carried out the works by day labour, which is now its recognised system. As far as I have been able to gather, this is proving most satisfactory. The pace at which work is being carried on is as good, if . not better than under the contract system, and the Board's experts are thoroughly satisfied with the quality of the work that is being done. I state these facts to show that one of the most important public bodies in the Commonwealth has, after a long experience of the contract system, reverted to day labour. If the contract system is the best, as the honorable member for Riverina would have the people of the Commonwealth believe, it is strange that he does not advocate its adoption for practically every class of work.","N/A","GOVERNMENT WORKS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Throughout Victoria great sums of money have been saved by the construction of railway lines by day labour. The honorable member for Corio (Mr. Lister) interjected sarcastically about the East-West railway. I am confident that if that line had been built bv contractors the cost to .the Commonwealth would have been considerably more than it was, and the results would not have been as good. If the honorable member has any practical knowledge, and will compare works carried out under the contract and day labour systems respectively he will agree that day labour, under strict supervision, gives the best results.

I do not wish to say anything that may be regarded as offensive, but I must protest when I find a man standing up and. in a half-hearted way, trying to make out that the day-labour system is bad, and that Australian workmen are not good workmen unless they are driven all the time. I believe that the great bulk of the workmen of Australia will work well whether under the eye of the overseer or boss, or when the boss is a hundred miles away. Many of us in this House know what it is to work for wages, and also to employ men. I have known what it was to pay men to- do work for me, and, speaking from my own experience, I say that very few workmen will take down an employer: The Australian workmen are not only as honest, but I believe even more honest, than workmen in any other part of the world. We have had considerable experience of the construction of railway engines in this country. In this connexion w.e had a somewhat sad experience recently, when it was proposed to send out of Australia for railway engines when we have our own workmen here able to construct them. That was a scandalous proposal, and I am sure the honorable member for Corio (Mr. Lister) does not stand for that kind of thing. We have here the material and skilled labour* for the manufacture of railway requirements. I can refer honorable members to what has been done under the Railways Commissioners in Victoria. I am speaking now, perhaps, of what occurred a few years ago, but we know that the thousands of workmen employed at the Newport Railway Workshops have done magnificent work. They have constructed railway engines at a cost £1,000 less per engine than the Baldwin Company of America could have constructed them for, and did better work. They have constructed all the girders required for our electric railways. All this work was done by day labour, and more cheaply and better than some of the work done under the contract system. I trust that, if this motion comes to a vote, the House will rise to the occasion. The motion proposes that the contract system shall be adopted for all Government work, and if it is passed, and the Minister for Works and Railways receives a tender for works, he may feel himself bound by the resolution of the House. Now his officers may advise him that tenders are too high, and on that account he may refuse to accept them, but, if we pass a motion of this kind, he may feel himself bound by the vote of this House, and the passing of this motion will practically tie his hands. He may then say, ' The House, by resolution, has told me that I must insist upon the adoption of the contract system.'","N/A","GOVERNMENT WORKS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/speech/continue[13]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

When I had to do with tenders I know that it was always the practice in advertising to use the words, ' The lowest or any tender not necessarily accepted.' I have frequently voted for the acceptance of a higher tender than the lowest ' because I knew the contractor putting in the higher tender would do better work. I knew that he knew more about the work and would give a better job than the lowest tenderer, and that although the institution I represented might have to pay- a few more pounds for. the job, it would be getting a better class of work than it would get from the lowest tenderer. I am sure' that the Minister for Works and Railways is in a position to say, from his own observation and experience, that work carried out by day labour is to be preferred to work carried out by contract labour, and that it is carried out as expeditiously as well as more efficiently. Under the contract system, if the clerk of works or the architect is not on the job, it is not uncommon for workmen to be told that defective work will do, and to have such work covered up. Some of the worst experiences we have had in connexion with war service homes construction resulted from the' contract system. There are contractors who, to-day, ought to be in gaol, without the option of a fine, for the work that they did in the construction of war service homes. Yet I believe that some of these men have had the unblushing audacity to demand from the Government more money under their contracts. The names of those contractors should stink in the nostrils of the people of Australia, and particularly of the members of this House. From our experience of them we should be wary about adopting the contract system, in the future. If there is any work which should be carefully carried out surely it is work done for the men who did their best in the time of crisis to serve Australia. In connexion with war service homes construction scores of pages of sworn evidence are filled with references to contractors who tried to dip their hands into the pockets, not only of the taxpayers and the Government, but of the returned soldiers. These revelations warn me that we should keep clear of the bulk of contractors. I do not say that all contractors are alike, because I know that there are some who carry out their work faithfully and well, but one may say that the better class of work is that done by day labour. I can give a concrete instance in support of this statement, and it is that there has not been one yard of railway constructed in Victoria within the last 30 years by contract labour.

It is difficult to understand why this particular work should be placed under a Commission, as the Minister himself has said that the present arrangements are satisfactory, and that the Advisory Committee which now operates there is doing good work. One reason given for the change was that there is now dual control. It was pointed out that two Departments are operating in the Federal Territory, and that a change is desirable. I do not advocate dual control, but it is not a sufficient reason for creating a Commission to administer the Federal Territory. I see no legitimate reason why the administration of the Federal Capital should not be placed under the control of one Department - whichever is the most suitable. It has, however, been decided otherwise by Ministers. But to do what they propose will add to the cost of government in this country. It is proposed to create positions for three men, each of whom will be paid a good salary, in addition to travelling expenses. The President of the Commission is to receive £3,000 per annum and expenses, and each of the other Commissioners £2,000 and expenses. To-day only two members of the Advisory Committee are paid officials; the others receive expenses only. The cost of the Advisory Committee is a mere bagatelle in comparison with that of the proposed Commission. The Minister admits that the Committee is doing excellent work, and took to himself credit for the progress which has been made in the construction of the various buildings and other works at Canberra. If everything has been progressing so satisfactorily, what is the reason for this contemplated change? Ever since the commencement of the war we have been getting away from responsible government. While the war was in progress such action was understandable, but the Government appears to have forgotten that it is time we were returning to normal conditions. The control which it is proposed to give to this Commission should be retained by this House. I shall probably be told that control will not be taken from Parliament. But, like many other measures, this Bill gives power to make regulations, and, although provision is made for such regulations to be laid on the table of this House, and for objection to them to be taken within 30 days of presentation, honorable members know that very often little notice is taken of them. Consequently, administration is left entirely in the hands of the Board or Commission which frames the regulations. While the Government retain control, matters which honorable members consider should be ventilated can be brought up in this House, and the persons concerned can be dealt with if necessary, and first-hand knowledge of matters pertaining to the Federal Territory can be obtained. I am opposed to this Commission, because the time has arrived when, except in special cases, we should no longer delegate our powers to such bodies. I do not know whether the Government desires to pass over its authority and responsibility to Boards ian d Commissions in order to escape criticism .because of its composite nature. It is probable that in the present Ministry, composed as it is of members of two parties, many difficulties present themselves, and that in order to take the line of least 'resistance, it has been decided to adopt this course in connexion with the Federal Territory. The ratepayers of this country will not long be satisfied with the present state of affairs in connexion with many of our undertakings. The Advisory Committee is composed of able and competent men - Messrs. Sulman, de Burgh, Ross, Goodwin, and Colonel Owen. If these men have given satisfaction at a low cost, why increase the expenses of. government by appointing a Commission? .If excellent work is being done - and the Minister says that greater progress has been made during the last twelve months than previously - why is it that this Bill is suddenly placed before us? The salaries of the three Commissioners will total £7,000, and the revenue t to be administered by them will probably not exceed £20,000 or £30,000. Either tone of the two Departments now controlling the Federal Territory would be competent to deal with that area.","Second Reading","SEAT OF GOVERNMENT (ADMINISTRATION) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Chief Railways Commissioner and two other Commissioners of the New South Wales railways receive between them £6,000. Are the duties of this proposed Commission anything to be compared with those of the Railways Commissioners of New South Wales, who have to deal with an annual revenue of £19,000,000, and administer a big network of railways, as well as the State's tramways;system? rt would appear that it is proposed to pay excessive salaries for the administration of the Federal Capital Territory. Again, let us take the Metropolitan Board of Water and Sewerage in Sydney. Its president, who- holds an important position, carrying great responsibilities, receives £1,200, and six other members each receive £250 a year. That makes  a.total of £2,700 a year for salaries to the managers of a concern whose business is far greater than the supervision of the Federal Territory. Recently Mr. Brown was appointed Secretary to the Postmaster-General's Department over the heads of our own men. I do not believe that we have no men in our Service competent to take these leading positions. We have in Australia men equal to any in the world, .but for the filling of this position they were not considered. We are paying £2,500 per year for a man to take the place of Mr. Oxenham, who was paid £1,150. I say nothing against the qualifications of Mr. Brown , noT do I object to a man receiving a fair salary for his services, but it is time attention was drawn to these matters. Is the Government justified in doubling the salary previously paid? If it is in the interests of the country, I have no objection to it, but we have in Australia men who could have done the work for a lower salary, and, prior to this appointment, it was don-> satisfactorily for less.","Second Reading","SEAT OF GOVERNMENT (ADMINISTRATION) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The men who are to be transferred to the Commission will lose their rights under the Public Service Act. I am aware that 'there is a clause in the Bill which provides that at a later period all their rights will b© restored to them, but when they are taken over by this Commission they will cease to be under the protection of the Public Service Commissioners. The public servants prefer to remain as they are, with their present rights. Under this Bill, authority is given to the Commission to employ people from outside the Public Service I have no objection to 'that if suitable men cannot be found in the Service, but it is not fair that the public servants should be placed under the Commission if that means a loss of the rights in respect to arbitration and .other matters which have accrued to them during a .period of years. I have here a long letter which sets out a number of the grievances of public servants. ' It shows plainly that they are alarmed at the action of the Government in. taking away their rights from time to time. Many of them suffered considerably when the re-arrangement of the Taxation Departments took place, as they were paid off, and had to leave the Service.  If there- is amy service in -which we must nave loyalty, it is the Public Service. We should do nothing to- cause discontent in it. Our public servants should bo shown that if they do- their work successfully, they may attain , to the highest positions the Service holds. Because this Bill tends \,y interfere with the rights, of public servants, it is most objectionable to me. I am opposed to> the appointment of the proposed Commission also because I believe it to be absolutely unnecessary. We are being asked to vest this- body with very large; powers, comparable with those possessed by the Melbourne City Council and the Sydney City Council. There is no justification for doing it. The time has arrived for us to cease, delegating the powers of Parliament to. outside bodies. Governments should fee prepared to accept the full responsibility of office. They should be obliged to administer the legislation passed by Parliament, and they should accept responsibility for mistakes. We have had too many blunders by recent Commissions to justify the appointment of another one. The War Service Homes Commission is an illustration in point. Simply because Parliament placed too much power in the hands of two or three individuals, h lost control of that most important work of prodding homes for oar soldiers. It is idle to say that Parliament hat control of these Commissions. When once they are appointed, Parliament has very little authority over them. Even Ministers are not able to obtain the information that honorable members desire to procure. Parliament is appointed to look after the interests of the people, and! it should do so.

The gentlemen on that Committee, other than the permanent officers- of the Public Service, are giving their services for their bare out-of-pocket expenses-. Seeing that they are doing their work so satisfactorily, and that such excellent headway has been made erith the construction of the Capital in th« 'last twelve months, we should not interfere with the present arrangement. The Minister may say that dual control- is inadvisable. If that be so, let us put the work in the hands of one Department. There should not be two> heads to anything. Better administration is always secured when one Department is in control. That Department should be aa.-swera.ble to' the Miti'ister, and the Minister to Parliament. We are getting away from that position. Theoretically, these Commissions are under the control of Ministers ,» but actually they have very little authority over them. The 'War Service Homes Commission was subject to' much more parliamentary control than the proposed Federal' Capital Commission would be, and the- doings of that Commission are too recent for us to need reminding of the blunders audi waste which- resulted from, their work. Large numbers of returned soldiers are suffering in consequence of its maladministration, and though some of them have been in occupation of their homes for years they cannot get a settlement of their accounts with the Commission. It is not in the best interests of the Federal Capital for us to appoint a Commission. The existing arrangement is quite satisfactory, and it should be allowed to continue. We shall obtain no additional revenue by appointing this Commission, but it is quite possible that additional expenditure will be incurred. A larger staff will, no doubt, be appointed, for experience has proved that immediately a new Department is established- it begins to grow, and the amount placed on the Estimates each year for its maintenance always increases. Like the snowball, these new Departments grow as they go along. In view of our huge war debt, to which we cannot shut our eyes, we should be very careful not to incur unnecessary expense. If we are not careful we shall be overwhelmed by our debts.

In fact, I am so satisfied with the present administration there that I hesitate to alter it. Some of the ablest officers in the Commonwealth Service are engaged in the developmental work there. Mr. Murdoch, the architect, is one of the ablest and most unassuming men in his profession in the Commonwealth. He is not getting anything like the salary which it is proposed shall be paid to these Commissioners. I think he is very much underpaid.

The Prime Minister of the Commonwealth is responsible for much greater public expenditure than will be incurred in the Federal Territory, and his time is occupied from morning to night. His position is a worrying one. Yet we are content to pay him less than it is proposed to pay the chairman of this Commission. It is not fair. Then consider the work done by the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr. Stewart). He has to look after works in all the States. He has to inquire into the construction of railways, telephone exchanges, and other buildings. He does not receive as high a salary as is proposed for the ordinary members of the Commission. There is no justification for the appointment of three men, one at £3,000 a year, and the other two at £2,000 a year each, to supervise work at Canberra. There is another aspect of the of the question that merits consideration. The Commission, as soon as it comes into existence, will create a staff of its own. There will be secretaries, typists, clerks of works, and numerous other subordinate officials. They will constitute a small parliament in Canberra, and will usurp the functions of the National Parliament. It i3 proposed to give the Commission wide powers. It will be allowed to float loans for building purposes without consulting Parliament. Reports on the matter will no doubt be tabled by the Minister, and that will be the end of it. There will be no obligation on the Commission to submit to Parliament designs for buildings. The designs for proposed works are now referred to the Public Works Committee, which investigates them, takes evidence, and makes recommendations to Parliament. Is Parliament willing to re~ linquish its power in that regard? It should insist upon retaining a tight hold on all expenditure, and supervising all .designs. We are asked to hand that power over to a Commission. The Commission should consist of capable men, but however capable they might be, they would not be more capable than the members of the Advisory Committee. I am acquainted with Mr. Ross, who is one of the ablest architects in Sydney. He stands head and shoulders above other men in his profession, and enjoys the utmost confidence of the people of that State. He is a member of the Advisory Committee, and gives his services for a nominal sum. It would be impossible to find a man more qualified for the position. I understand that the Government has already decided UPOn a land ordinance. It has determined the conditions upon which people may lease laud. The ordinance will be issued on a certain date, and by the time the Commissioners can be appointed, the spade work will have been done by the Government. The water supply system is complete, and ample for quite a large city. The sewerage works are almost complete, and light and power are available. Brick-works are in existence, and 70 or 80 houses have been finished. A hostel to accommodate members of Parliament will be ready in three or four months, and another hostel is in course of erection. The roof of Parliament House will be in place by October next. All the large works have been done by the Government and officials of the Works Department, and it is now late in the day to propose the establishment of a Commission. The works to be undertaken in, the future will not be so big as Parliament House or the hostel. I cannot see what the Commission will have to do. All the work at Canberra should be transferred to one Department, and I would be satisfied to hand it to the Works and Railways Department. With the staff now in that Department, the work could be done satisfactorily. It is expected that the next Parliament will assemble at Canberra. Judging by the progress already made, this Parliament should be able to meet there. Surely, with Parliament meeting at Canberra, and the Minister with his headquarters there, it would be easier than it is now for Parliament and the Minister to supervise construction works. I urge honorable members to hesitate .before agreeing to the appointment of the Commission. I have no axe to grind in 'the matter. I am stating ray. candid opinion. Parliament should hold the Minister .responsible for the progress of works. He should be under our supervision, and the designs for all buildings should be placed upon the table of the House for .our inspection. If the Commission is appointed it will be supreme, and the practice of referring proposed works to the Public Works Committee will be discontinued.","Second Reading","SEAT OF GOVERNMENT (ADMINISTRATION) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I cannot support the expenditure of ano the r penny in this Territory, especially in view of the sections of the report recently 'furnished bv the Public Accounts Committee. The remarks of the Leader of the Opposition were illuminating. He referred to the proposal to pay to three members of the proposed Commission very 'high salaries. I remember that, when the 'Minister was introducing the Bill, I interjected that it was proposed bo pay ' the Chairman .of the Commission a higher salary than that received by the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth. I cannot .conceive why we should do such a t'hing, especially when we consider the manifold duties and responsibilities of the Leader of this Government. No man, no matter haw able, is entitled to a salary larger than that paid to the political head of this country for the time being. With the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Charlton). I take exception to the creation of the Commission. One man, if an appointment is necessary, could adequately .discharge its duties. If he needed advice on matters with which he was not conversant, he could do as sis done at present, and pay for the advice of those who are competent to 'give it. We are not justified, in view of- the enormous debt this country is carrying, in continuing -to spend money at .Canberra. When the proposal to establish a Federal Capital passed this House, the re was not the sane objection to. it as the re is to-day. We were the n living in times of peace, and the re was no thought in the mind of any one that we would be involved within a few years in a war which would saddle this community with a debt of between £350,000,000 and £400,000,000. The present condition of Australia does not warrant the spending of money on . Canberra. I wish to make it quite clear that I am not opposed' to carrying out the terms of the agreement; but, in view of our financial position, it should not be prosecuted fur the r until we have relieved ourselves of many of the responsibilities and obligations imposed upon us by the war. If the Commission is to be appointed, I should certainly like to know its' personnel. If, as was suggested by a previous speaker, a certain gentleman is to be appointed, the House should be informed of the fact. I know nothing to that gentleman's detriment. I understand that he is an exceptionally fine officer, but the Government is not justified in creating a position and appointing be it a man who is already in the service of the Commonwealth at a salary of about £1,200 a year. We have evidence on every hand of extravagance on the part of those who have been responsible for what has been done at Canberra up to the present. I find, from the fourth report of the Public Accounts Committee, that a four-roomed house constructed under the most favorable conditions, much of the material being readily available, costs from £955 to £1,076, and that a five-roomed house costs from £1,318 to £1,435. These figures disclose that building costs in Canberra, under the day labour system which the honorable member for Maribyrnong (Mr. Fenton) eulogized so much this afternoon, are excessive.","Second Reading","SEAT OF GOVERNMENT (ADMINISTRATION) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The most significant part of the honorable member's remarks was his reference to the suggestion made by the honorable member for South Sydney (Mr. E. Riley) that Mr. Murdoch , one of the most efficient officers in the Commonwealth Service, should be appointed to the proposed Commission. The honorable member for Corio said that such an appointment would be outrageous. His attitude betrays the intention of the Government and others who are support ing this Bill. I shall not vote for the appointment of the Commission, because I am satisfied that this is merely a move to block the steady construction of the Federal Capital. Those who are opposed to Canberra have in mind the appointment of a Commission composed of antiCanberraites, instead of men who would work effectively to consummate the Capital project.

Thus the Government will be able to remove from the House a severe and dangerous critic, and the Corner party will be gratified with the prospect of effective expenditure at Canberra being discontinued.","Second Reading","SEAT OF GOVERNMENT (ADMINISTRATION) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It proposes the appointment of a Commission to take the complete control of Canberra out of the hands of this Parliament. It will be of no use if they support this measure for those who believe in the establishment of the Federal Capital at Canberra as soon as possible to complain of delays and obstructions placed in the way of the completion of the Capital. They will be met with the reply with which I was met yesterday when I complained of the action of the Commonwealth Shipping Board in robbing workmen of a day's. pay for a day off, which they, were compelled to take to- welcome the; visiting British squadron. The Prime Minister told, me that the Government had no- power in the matter; that it was absolutely in the hands of the Shipping Board, and the Government had no say. So it will be if this measure is carried. The Commission it proposes to create will be the sole authority to decide what works shall goon at Canberra, and what shall not, and what is of more, importance still, to decide the rata of progress at the Federal Capital. I am not prepared to take the risk: of the. establishment of such a Commission. Well may the honorable member for Fawkner (Mr. Maxwell) smite.

This measure represents a serious departure from constitutional practice. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Charlton) has said, Board after Board is being appointed, and scarcely a single Department of the Public Service is being administered by a responsible Minister. If that is to be the policy of the Commonwealth, why have Ministers or a Parliament at all? If that is to be our policy, let a Board be appointed to administer the whole of the affairs of the Commonwealth. The essential principle of British parliamentary 'institutions is that the people by their votes shall send representatives to Parliament to administer the affairs of the country, and that these men shall be responsible to the people. That is the foundation of our British parliamentary system.. Yet we find that it is being undermined day after day by the appointment of these Boards and Commissions'. I strongly object to this Bill, not only on these general principles but because I doubt the sincerity of the Commission to be appointed. I believe that it is being brought into existence purely for the purpose of spragging the wheels of progress at Canberra. I hope that the friends of Canberra, who desire to see progress there, will politely pass this Bill out. We are all satisfied with the way in which work has been progressing at Canberra during the last twelve months. Why alter the present system?

In the first place they will have to convince the people of that State that work has not been going on satisfactorily at Canberra for some time past.

This move is not in the interests of the progress of Canberra, but merely to conciliate the two divergent sections of the. so-called Composite party opposite.  I can see no other purpose for this measure. The members of the party in the Corner prate of economy. What does this measure mean? It means not only the expenditure of £7,000 a year in salaries for the proposed Commissioners, but also the establishment of a huge department. Let honorable members consider for a moment what this proposal involves. The control of works at Canberra is to be taken away from the Works and Railways Department, and this means the building up of another big staff of advisers and employees. Before we know where we are the cost will run into thousands of pounds per annum for the staff that will be required to do the work which is being so effectively and well done by the Works and Railways Department to-day. How can members of the Country party continue to prate of economy if they support such a measure as this? If the measure will not involve the creation of a new staff at Canberra, where is the need for the proposed Commission at all? The department in existence to-day is doing the work and there is no need for the Commission. Let honorable members in the Corner who prate of economy answer this contention.- The people of Australia and not only of New South Wales, and especially the people of the country districts, will ask members of the Country party some pertinent questions on this matter. They will want to know later on when Estimates are submitted to cover the expenditure for the new department, what attitude they adopted when they found that thousands of pounds of additional expenditure per annum was being proposed for the creation of a new department at Canberra. The people of Australia will put the acid test upon those honorable members and upon the Minister for Works and Railways who is one of the Composite party. They will ask these men to put into practice their mouthing of economy and to explain the necessity for the creation of another huge department to do work which is now being well done by an existing department. The Bill provides that the employees and officers of the Commission shall not be subject- to the Public Service Act. It- is perfectly clear from this that it is the intention to bring into being a big army of employees as an administrative staff at Canberra. If that were not so, why provide that the Public Service Act shall not apply to the staff. of the Commission? The whole thing is a. sinister move intended to kill Canberra by loading it up with expense that the place cannot carry. It is playing into the hands of the opponents of Canberra. No man can challenge my honesty as an ad.vocate of Canberra, and as a supporter of that place in season and out of season, I say that this is a dangerous proposal, and one which will do more to kill Canberra than anything else I know of. The Minister has to show the House and the country exactly what the cost of the proposed Commission will be. Further, he has to tell us whom he proposes to appoint to the Commission. I conclude with the expression of the hope that all the friends of Canberra will stand by it in this particular matter, and will not be deluded by this sinister move on the part of the opponents of Canberra to prevent the establishment of the Federal Capital there.","Second Reading","SEAT OF GOVERNMENT (ADMINISTRATION) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","387","FOSTER, Richard","KFP","Wakefield","N/A","N/A","514","I am not now as favorable to the appointment of a Commission to take charge of the construction of Canberra as I formerly was. The idea is not a new one. The proposal was first brought forward by Sir joseph Cook in 1913, and if his Government had been returned to power at the elections in 1914 a Commission would have been constituted almost immediately afterwards to take over the responsibility of administering the Federal Territory quite free from interference by Parliament; except of course that Parliament would always have a certain amount of control by reason of its obligation to find- the necessary money. That Commission was to have been intrusted with the task of financing and supervising the work of construction. However, I am not now anxious for the appointment of a Commission, because such a body ought to have been constituted before the Commonwealth was committed to the expenditure in which it is now involved. As a matter of fact, this Parliament is already committed to almost all the expenditure that will cover the initial stages of the development of the Capital, say, for the next 20 years. I am also opposed to the appointment of three highly paid Commissioners, because the work of supervising the development of the Capital for the next 20 years will not be sufficiently great to justify paying a chairman a salary of £3,000 a year, and two other Commissioners salaries of £2,000 a year each. Such appointments would involve the Commonwealth in an expenditure for supervision equal to that which is incurred in the control of some of the big State railway services, with a capital of over £40,000,000. I have intimated to the Prime Minister (Mr. Bruce) my views upon this point, because I am anxious that my attitude shall not be misunderstood. Unless I can get an absolute assurance that three Commissioners will not be appointed at the high salaries proposed, I ' shall vigorously oppose the Bill, and endeavour to influence every one else to put it on one side. The length to which I would go would be to support the appointment of a permanent chairman, and that I could not do with a great deal of enthusiasm; and I would have him appointed for a period of not more than five years, with, subject to review, a further period of five years. The Government that did not provide an absolutely efficient chairman would find the appointment a millstone around its neck for all time. As a matter of fact, the success of such Commissions as this depends entirely upon their personnel. If an antediluvian Commissioner is appointed, who has never had vision and is never likely to have it, the choice will be bad, and the Commission is not likely to be a success. However, it is quite possible the Government may get a gentleman of the highest financial experience, and with great organizing capacity! Those two qualifications are absolutely indispensable. Such a man would probably save the country a great deal of money. The only assistance he would require for the work in view would be two Commissioners paid by fees whose services would not be required more than two days, and possibly not more than one day, a week. One of the reasons why I favour the appointment of a Commission on the lines I have suggested is that the building of the Capital should be removed entirely from parliamentary influence, and from the possibility of the policy of construction being dragged this way and that way every year through political changes. There should be continuity of- operation and continuity of supervising responsibility. I have no desire to mention names, but there are two gentlemen on the Federal Capital Advisory Committee to-day, representing the architectural and engineering professions, who have done most excellent work in their respective spheres. 'With a good Chairman and with exceptionally good representatives of these professions assisting him, we should have all that is required, and certainly all that is justified. To provide for more would be to incur a shocking waste of money. The honorable member for Corio (Mr. Lister) has spoken about the cost of the work at Canberra. While it is perfectly true that the cost of the work there is high, it is relatively not higher than that of work in almost all the big cities of the Commonwealth. I object, however, to the mad rush to make provision for Parliament meeting at Canberra at the end of this Parliament, if it runs its full term. It is causing a shocking addition to the cost of the work. Moreover, under existing conditions no Government in Australia, in order to gain perhaps eighteen months, is justified in rushing work of this kind, to the detriment of enterprises all over Australia, which cannot develop their factories, through inability to get skilled labour. Here I wish to refer to the recommendation appearing in the report of the Public Accounts Committee upon Canberra housing, in regard to the writing down of the cost of certain buildings at Canberra. While I was Minister, I declared that the cost involved in building houses at Canberra could never be passed on to the public servants who would be obliged to occupy them, and that, therefore, every care should be exercised in the construction of that class of buildings. It would be unreasonable to transfer public servants from Melbourne to Canberra and insist upon them occupying houses at rentals for all time based on abnormal cost of construction. Therefore. I worried the officers of the Public Works Department to reduce the cost of the buildings required for workers and officers who, whether they liked it or not, would be obliged to go to Canberra when Parliament was transferred there. I quite agree with the recommendation that the cost of these buildings should be written down by 25 per cent., but only urgently-needed houses to be provided. The Commonwealth officers transferred to Canberra should not be made to suffer for the peculiarly unfavourable conditions of the moment.","Second Reading","SEAT OF GOVERNMENT (ADMINISTRATION) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If the Government were determined to increase the pace, they should have gone to the Old World, or somewhere else, and brought house-builders into the Commonwealth. If they had brought in 10,000such artisan's, these would have been absorbed by the different States. In fact, they would have been taken from the ships' sides and paid more than the average award rates.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","425","MCDONALD, Frederick","KQS","Barton","ALP","N/A","516","This Bill might very well have been entitled ' A Bill to recognise the incapacity of two Federal Departments - the Works and Railways and the Home and Territories Departments.' Up to the present the two Departments mentioned have been doing the work which under this Bill a Commission is to be appointed to perform. Some people consider that the work has been done satisfactorily, but I make no comment on that. The Minister seems to consider that these Departments cannot carry on the work any longer, and that it is necessary to appoint a most expensive Commission. The public of Australia would be justified in saying that if these Departments are not more capable than is indicated by the action of the Government, it would be as well if a Bill were brought in to abolish them altogether. The control of the Federal Territory is their work, and the work of the Minister controlling them, but it is to be shirked by both. That is a strange condition of affairs. The reason given for the change is that because of dual control the work can not be efficiently carried out. It is remarkable that a Commission to cost £7,000 or £8,000 per annum is necessary to harmonize the work of these two Departments. I object to the appointment of the Commission, on the ground of expense; the work could, and should, be done by the Departments which have been carrying it out up to the present time. I also object to the appointment of the Commission on the ground that it is taking' from Parliament the control of its affairs. It is ail very well to say that the Commission will be responsible to the Minister, but experience has taught us that when Commissions are appointed, and wide powers are given to their members, very little satisfaction can be obtained by members in this House in respect to the matters under' their control. Time after time members have asked, questions, only to be be informed by the Minister in charge that he has little or no power, as the. control is vested entirely in a Commission or' Board. The same thing will occur in regard to the affairs of Canberra, and this  House will have very little control over -the Commission. No matter how incompetent its members might be, not even an adverse vote carried by both Houses of Parliament could remove the Commissioners from office. That is a very serious position. The Bill leaves it entirely to the Minister to suspend one or more of the Commissioners or Deputy Commissioners, but if .he did not feel disposed to .take such .action, not even a vote of both Houses could accomplish it. I take exception, also, to the clause winch provides that the officers of the Commission shall be taken from the control of the Public Service Board. Some years ago £he Government went to the expense of appointing a Royal Commission. In his report, the Commissioner (Mr. McLachlan.) advised that all the officers employed by the Commonwealth Government should be placed under one control so far as promotion and transfer were concerned. His advice was followed by the Government, and the system has acted very well. But now a Commission is proposed which will undertake very important work, and will employ a great number of officers, but for some reason not yet made known to us, the Government proposes to remove its staff entirely from the control of the Public Service Board. Such a proposal is not fair to either the public servants who would be placed under the Commission or those remaining under the Public Service Board. Those of us who have had experience of. Public Service matters know that on many occasions prior to the appointment of the Public Service Board promotion went, not by merit, bub 'according to social or political influence. Public servants generally have been satisfied with the system of promotion and transfer at present in operation. What is the reason for the introduction df this pernicious practice in connexion with this important Commission? Once they are taken over by the Commission, public servants will not have the protection which they now enjoy, as the present system of control insures to them a reasonable chance of promotion by merit. The moment that control is taken away, the old insidious favoritism will creep in, because these things are inseparable from human nature. The man with social or political influence will receive promotion under the Commission which the majority may consider he does not deserve. Does the Minister think that the Commissioners, in addition to being experts in administering the Federal Territory, will be experts in the management of public servants; or does he anticipate., as suggested by the honorable member for Dalley (Mar. Mahony), the appointment of another Public Service Board wider the Commission to manage the public servants who will be taken over? The public servants consider this a matter of great importance. If the Minister intends to proceed with this Bill, I ask him to give this subject careful consideration. The public servants who go to Canberra should .he allowed to remain under the Public Service Board. Why should not the protection .that they now enjoy remain with them when at that city? I see no reason why the powers of promotion, appointment, transfer, punishment for neglect of duty, and so on, should be given to the members of this Commission, unless to emphasize its importance. I hope the Minister will seriously - consider that matter. A great deal of difficulty may arise if this is done, because it is .contemplated that, after the work .of the Commission is completed, a great number of the public servants at Canberra will be re-transferred to the different Departments, and .be again under the Public Service Board. The Minister will surely admit nhat, because -of undue influence, certain public servants may, under. the Commission, rise to high positions to which, perhaps, their merit will not :entitle them.","Second Reading","SEAT OF GOVERNMENT (ADMINISTRATION) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This will give rise to a great deal of dissatisfaction. I am sure that no one understands the reason for this great departure from our ordinary Public Service system.

I do not know for what object this was done, but, of course, there is no doubt that if one throws mud some of it is bound to stick. If, by throwing mud at the Government, the public can be induced to believe that it is desired to give public appointments to members of this House, the honorable member responsible must take the blame. Let me point out to the honorable member that this Bill specifically prescribes that, if practicable, these appointments shall be given to returned soldiers; they are to have preference. I was considerably over the age of enlistment during the war, and therefore I could not come within the cate-. gory of returned soldiers. I do not know whether my honorable friend can make the same excuse for not being one. At any rate, I hardly think that his reference tome was fair. Let me say at once that I am not a candidate for a position on the Commission. After perusing the Bill I really cannot see any necessity for the appointment of a Commission. I hope that, if the House approves of the appointment of the Commission, it will also agree to some slight amendments to the Bill so as not to take away the powers of Parliament to the extent that is proposed. A very firm attitude is now being taken by many honorable members concerning the expenditure at Canberra, and I cannot see that this has anything to do with the Bill.

We have a Ministry in power, and we should at all times be able to place before it our complaints concerning extravagance or maladministration. I am always ready to submit to any decision of Parliament, but I am not prepared to hand over powers - as was done in connexion with the building of the soldiers' homes - to a Commission, thereby making no Minister responsible for maladministration. In the case of the War Service Homes, we know that hundreds of thousands of pounds were wasted in making huge purchases, and no Minister was responsible. 'If the Commission had not been in existence we could have laid the blame upon the Minister himself. We should not give away the powers of Parliament unless it can clearly be shown that we are to gain by it. It is many years since operations were started at Canberra. The water supply there is now completed, and the mains are being laid through the streets. From an engineering point of view, that work is finished. The main sewer is in the course of construction, and nearly completed. No Commission is needed to deal with future house connexions or with the water supply for the town. Most of the work is well in hand. Parliament House, when completed, will last at least 25 years. Applications are being called for competitions for the design of the main administrative building. The staff required for the constructional work has been obtained from the Works Department. If the three Commissioners are appointed, the additional staff will mean a heavy expenditure. We have now the staff necessary to carry out all the work required in the near future. The Minister has in his Department men competent to deal with finance and other matters. The Public Works Committee strongly urged that outside architects should, if possible, be induced to compete in designs for the buildings. That has been done with the consent and approval of the Chief Architect of the Commonwealth. We know perfectly well that if the building of the city had been left in the hands of one man there would have been a uniform design throughout. Even although I have opposed the expenditure of money at Canberra, I hope that whatever we do will be a source of pride when eventually the seat of Government is moved there. Not one member of this House can say a word against my work as Chairman of the Public Works Committee. I have done nothing to thwart the wishes of Parliament in any investigation made by the Committee. Our work has been honest, and we have always desired to carry out the duties that Parliament imposes upon us. What work warranting the appointment of a special Commission, taking great powers from this Parliament, is required at Canberra in the near future? Not only will the Commission have power over the Treasury; but in this Bill it is given power to borrow any sum of money that it chooses; it may be £100,000 or £5,000,000. All they have to do to borrow the money is to get the consent of the Treasurer of the day. Parliament will not be asked to express any opinion on the proposed expenditure.","Second Reading","SEAT OF GOVERNMENT (ADMINISTRATION) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I do not think it is the intention of the Government to go on, at present, with the artificial lakes which are part of Mr. Griffin's scheme; They need not be made for years to come. The report of the Public Works Committee on the railway connexion, will be placed before Parliament as soon as it is printed. The heavy work in connexion, with water supply, sewerage, and the establishment of a power plant has been done. Really, I can see nothing which will require the appointment of specialists. I think it would be advisable to place the Canberra work in the control of one Department, with a special officer to deal with land matters.

Parliament is elected by the people, and it should be supreme. I can see no justification for placing the work at Canberra in the hands of a Commission. Good progress has been made, recently, in developing the Federal territory. The officers engaged in the work are doing very well. They are competent men, and have a grand conception of what the Federal city should be. Why, then, should a Commission be appointed? The Government have given us no adequate reasons for appointing the Commission, and I am sure that the Commissions we have had in the past have been nothing to be proud of. They have prevented, rather than promoted, progress. Parliament has not been supreme, and Ministers have escaped from their responsibilities. Before I entered this House I gave a good deal of study to the subject of parliamentary government. I was convinced in those days that government should be by Parliament and not by Commissions, and I am more than ever convinced to-day that that is the right policy. We have only to look at the work of recent Commissions to see what a mistaken policy it is to hand over our powers to such bodies. Their maladministration is a great barrier to progress. Let honorable members bring to their minds the Cockatoo Island Commission. To think of the personnel of that Commission makes one shudder. Sir William Clarkson is one of its members, and he is the gentleman who wrote some very bitter reports about Cockatoo Island. He was always opposed to the Government doing construction work there, and he wrote a most condemnatory report of the place. Yet he was appointed a Commissioner. In the last few days we have heard the Prime Minister remark, ' The Commission has charge of the work and I cannot accept responsibility for it. We have also a. Naval Board and a Military Board there. During the last few weeks the Public Accounts Committee has been conducting an investigation into the expenditure incurred at the Naval College at Jervis Bay and the Duntroon Military College. We have been informed in the most definite manner that no reduction in the expenditure at these two establishments is advisable, and that if it were contemplated it could only be done on the recommendation of those Boards. Then the members of the Note Issue Board are representatives of the largest commercial interests in Australia, and if an honorable member seeks information from the Government in connexion with the note issue, he is told that that Department is under the control of a Board which was appointed by a previousGovernment, and concerning it we know very little - a position not justified. On the retirement of Mr. McLachlan, the ex-Public Service Commissioner, who efficiently controlled the Comm on wealth Public Service, which is regarded as one of the finest in the world, a Public Service Board was created, the Chairman of which is a military officer receiving a salary of £3,000 a year, while the other two members each receive £2,000 a year. Notwithstanding the expense involved in controlling the Public Service under the existing Board, two Sub-Commissioners or Inspectors have recently been appointed to help them to do their work. The Chairman of the Board is a very able military officer, but the environment in which he has worked for years renders him unsuitable for the important position he now occupies in connexion with our civil life. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Charlton) and the honorable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory) stressed the point that when once Commissioners are appointed it is difficult to say where the expenditure is likely to end. Many years ago, I was a member of a deputation which waited upon the late Sit Henry Parkes concerning the appointment of a Commission on technical education. After I had expressed my views, he said, ' Well, West, you know if I appoint a Board or Commission, every member of it will want a secretary, a clerk, and a messenger, and the expenditure will be much larger than you anticipate. ' He also said during the course of the interview, ' Do not fritter away the power of Parliament which should have absolute control over all expenditure.' I have never forgotten those words. Since the last Labour Government went out of office, numerous Boards and Commissions . have been appointed, and the power of Parliament has been frittered away by its successors. Are the Government placing the responsibility of administration in the hands of Boards and Commissions because they are afraid that a Labour Government will soon be returned to power? It is cruel and unjust of honorable members to shirk their responsibility.","Second Reading","SEAT OF GOVERNMENT (ADMINISTRATION) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I intend to take every possible step to prevent extravagant and unjustifiable expenditure in connexion with the appointment of Boards over which Parliament has no control. Even if administration were cheaper under a system of Boards, I would be opposed to the principle. Parliament is responsible for the taxation imposed, and, therefore, should control all expenditure. Do honorable members overlook the fact that they are sent here by their constituents to assist in controlling expenditure? If the people in New South Wales - I cannot speak for the other States - had the opportunity they would dispense with the Railways Commissioners, and allow the railways to be controlled by a Minister. The action of the Government in appointing a resident Director of Works at Canberra was first suggested by the Public Accounts Committee. Colonel Owen is a capable and enthusiastic officer, and is in every way qualified to carry out the important work which he is now undertaking.  Sittingsuspended from 6.30 to8p.m. -The abrogation of the rights of Parliament is bad enough, but there is a further objection that commissions do not carry out their work efficiently. They do not act in accordance with the. wishes of Parliament. Members on this side of- the House have never been in favour of handing over the destinies of Australia to a Commission. Take, for instance, the War Service Homes Commission. No member of this House, nor of the public, can contradict me when I say that I have as good a knowledge of the maladministration of the War Service Homes Commission as has any man. I have had an exceptionally favorable opportunity to gather information on that subject, and I have exercised my abilities, and used my knowledge as a contractor and journeyman, just as freely as if it had been a business of my own. I, and I think other members of the Public Accounts Committee, have come to the conclusion that, had the War Service Homes administration not been placed under the control of a Commission, but had been in the hands of the Works and Railways Department, greater efficiency would have been secured. The staff of the Department could have been enlarged, and certain men could have been promoted to fill the new positions. We ought to encourage the promotion of men in Government Departments, rather than appoint outsiders to fill important positions. A boy entering a Government Department should have opportunities of promotion. If he is willing to make himself efficient in the Service, the highest positions should be open to him. The best positions should not be reserved for those who are born with silver spoons in their mouths. Members of this House are not fully alive to the danger of handing over the work of the country to Commissions. I have been forced by my knowledge of Commissions to the conclusion that they are a dangerous obstacle to the progress of Australia. I am satisfied that if a change of Government takes place the incoming Government will have to consider very seriously whether it will allow these abominations to continue. I hope that it will abolish them and return to a sane system of government. The honorable member for Corio (Mr. Lister), in his criticisms of the work of public servants, only half stated the facts. That was a dangerous thing for him to do. I advise him that when he wants to make a statement he should get possession of all the facts, and not attempt to manipulate them for his purpose. It is a very serious thing for a member of this House to cast a reflection upon public servants, who have no opportunity to reply. Personally, I shall defend them against every attack made unjustly upon them. I should be unworthy of my position if I did mot. Honorable members will remember that a past Government decided to build Canberra on modern town-planning lines. Designs were called for all over the world, and it was intended that Canberra should be a city second to none for beauty and utility. That action greatly increased the cost, but future generations will commend that Government for its courage and breadth of view. The State of Victoria has at Morwell undertaken a large scheme for the supply of electrical energy. Members of the Public Accounts Committee recently . inspected the works, which are under the direction of Sir John Monash, with a view to seeing whether they could glean any information which would be of assistance in connexion with the development of Canberra. We were told that it was a very costly scheme. The people of Victoria do not know what it will cost. Although the expenditure;.s heavy, benefits will be derived from it in the future. I shall endeavour to explain the facts regarding the cost of houses. Honorable members should obtain correct information on such matters. The Public Accounts Committee has dealt with this subject in its report, which states -","Second Reading","SEAT OF GOVERNMENT (ADMINISTRATION) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[8]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Some loss is inevitable in the initial stages of a scheme of this magnitude designed many years in advance. The Committee is of opinion that, so far as the early residents of the Capital are concerned, they should bear only a pro rata charge calculated on the basis of the population for which the respective engineering works have been schemed.

We were denied that information. I now point out to the honorable member for Swan, and to other honorable members, that I am taking the fullest advantage of this opportunity to discuss the matter, because I fear that a similar attitude will be adopted by the Government when we come to deal with the next Budget. It is the duty of every honorable member to impress upon the Government and their supporters the fact that the public are opposed to the appointment of a Commission with such wide powers as would be conferred by this Bill. Frequently, in reply to questions on important subjects, honorable members are informed by the Prime Minister (Mr. Bruce) that the matters are under the control of a Board, and that, therefore, he can give no information concerning them. If such enormous powers as are proposed under the Bill are conferred upon the Commission, honorable members who subsequently desire to be enlightened concerning affairs at Canberra will be told by the Government that they must shut their eyes, open their mouths, and swallow whatever is given them. The Commonwealth Director of Works (Colonel Owen) is a most efficient officer, and is quite able to undertake the responsibility of supervising the constructional work. After the exhaustive inquiry made by the Public Accounts Committee the Government should have no doubt upon the matter. Colonel Owen has given faithful and assiduous service. I should advise the Government to increase his emolument, and place him in charge of the whole of the works. Does any honorable member support the action of the Shipping Board in. granting Christmas holiday pay to all the permanent officers at Cockatoo Island Dockyard when the labourers in the yard were not granted one day's pay? That is the sort of thing one may expect from administration by a Board. It means class distinction all along the line, and the ' bottom dog ' is not recognised as having the rights of an ordinary human being. I do not think the Prime Minister will have the temerity to admit in this House that he is in favour of such a distinction being made. No member of the Ministry would have the courage to support such a course of action. When the responsibility has been thrust upon a Board, Ministers are glad to brush the matter aside as no concern of theirs. I am afraid that what I have said will be lost on the Government. Members of the Corner party are afraid to take action in connexion with the proposed Commission, and Ministers themselves are nervous lest the members of that party bring them to book. If only the press of Australia would rally to the cause of the people most telling articles could be published pointing out the fallacy of government by Boards.

It was found that a Commission was required to administer affairs at Washington, and for similar reasons it will be impossible to administer the Federal Capital Territory from Melbourne. Centralization in administration is one of the curses of the Commonwealth to-day. An even greater curse is the dual control by the Departments now operating at Canberra. A glaring example of the circumlocution entailed by this control recently came under my notice. A new post-office was required, and a particular design was suggested. The Home and Territories Department purchased the land and submitted the design; but the Works and Railways Department immediately announced that it had its own architects to design such buildings.

Why should every Government work throughout the Commonwealth be referred to the central administration? If we have trained officers who cannot be trusted, they should be dismissed. I have nothing but praise for Mr. Goodwin. He has done good work, and I hope that such officers will remain at Canberra to help consummate the present plan; but there should be some authority at the Federal Capital with power to administer the law. We are dependent, at present, upon New South Wales for the maintenance of law and order there. The Commonwealth is dependent upon the State Departments of  New South Wales for police and educational services. Certainly the teacher at present stationed at Canberra is a credit to the Education Department, and the school is as good as any other State school in Australia. But there are many matters of administration which require quick decision upon the spot. I know of a man living in a Government cottage on the Yass-road whose gate came off its hinges, but he. was not allowed to touch it. He had to refer the matter of its repair to the Department of Home and Territories. A local administrator would be able to deal with this and with many other matters on the spot without any of the red tape incidental to dual and centralized control. There are members on' all sides of the House who have worked hard to consummate the Canberra project, but upon this proposal to appoint a Commission we hold different opinions. And it is well that it should be so, for there would be no progress if we all thought alike. This Parliament is just as big or little as its members and the people of Australia choose to make it. I hope it will always be animated by national ideals, and that it will look at every question with a proper regard for the welfare of the nation as a whole. It is not desirable to bring the Commonwealth Parliament down to the level of a shire council, that attends to roads and bridges, but that must be the effect of bringing all pettifogging details of Canberra administration into this Chamber for discussion. I admit that the time has not arrived for the appointment of three permanent Commissioners, but there should be a permanent Chairman devoting the whole of his time to the administration, of the Capital, and assisted by part-time Commissioners who would be paid fees for their services.","Second Reading","SEAT OF GOVERNMENT (ADMINISTRATION) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[10]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In the meantime a Commission is necessary to administer municipal affairs and the ordinances of the Territory. We all have complained because land ordinances have not been issued, and the land has not been thrown open for selection. I believe the Government were wise in deferring selection. I understand that there will be an obligation on the purchaser of a block of land to commence building within twelve months. It would not have been fair to have allowed selection twelve months ago and compelled the leaseholder to build when there was no population in the city. The Government proposes to auction the leases at an early date, and who will administer the ordinances governing them? Are honorable members satisfied that existing Departments, which already have their hands pretty full of work throughout the Commonwealth, can yet find time to attend to the details of territory administration? Surely a Commission is needed until such time as the population of Canberra is large enough to elect a municipal body. All supporters of Canberra hope that there, will be a big population there at an early date. I expect that there will be 5,000 people permanently residing at Canberra within three years.","Second Reading","SEAT OF GOVERNMENT (ADMINISTRATION) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[10]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

What is the use of shilly-shallying and throwing upon the shoulders of posterity a responsibility that belongs to us? Every member of this National Parliament should take a personal pride in making the Federal Capital the finest city in Australia. It is a project for the service of not only the present generation but of posterity also. This Parliament calls for men of vision. Members who have not vision are wasting their own time and that of their constituents. Let us take the broad Australian point of view. Although I represent a Sydney constituency I recognise that the men who are tilling the soil are the backbone of the country. We are all trying to help the men upon the soil to establish themselves, and by their production make the country more wealthy. Let us help along the Federal Capital scheme in the same national spirit. No city in the world started under such favorable conditions as Canberra. What other city in Australia had electric light, water power, sewerage, and roads provided in advance of settlement? Those services are in existence at Canberra, and some authority is required for the levying of taxation, the collection of revenue, and the control of expenditure. The honorable member for Barton (Mr. F. McDonald) expressed a fear that if a Commission were appointed those public servants who were transferred to its control would lose some of the benefits of the Public Service Act, but a clause of the Bill definitely provides that they shall retain all existing and accrued rights. Apart from that, more Departments and employees of the Commonwealth Government are outside the Public Service Act and regulations than are inside.","Second Reading","SEAT OF GOVERNMENT (ADMINISTRATION) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[10]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I would hold controlling officers responsible for the successful conduct of their Departments, and if a man failed I would sack him and appoint another mau who would make the Department a success. At the present time a Public Service Commission controls all appointments, promotions, and reductions in the Service. . But the person most fitted to judge the worth or worthlessness of an officer is his departmental head. Unfortunately in the service there is dual control and triple control. I do not blame the officers for the faults that are inherent in the existing system. Years ago I was a member of the Public Service; I do not regret the experience, but I shall take care that nobody over whom I have authority shall ever enter the Service. Whilst the public servant is not exactly a slave, it is a fact that the system destroys his initiative. A man's spirit is stifled by red tape before he has been in the Service twelve months. That is the curse of the system. We have an opportunity of removing that curse from the administration of Canberra by placing in charge men to whom Parliament can say, ' You are expected to make a success of this project. Build a city worthy of Australia, and Parliament will .see that your work is recognised.' Of course, Parliament will retain control, for every year the Commissioners will have to submit their estimates and reports to this House. We shall have a perfect right to discuss how they, shall raise and expend money. The Shipping Board, to which reference has been made, is on a footing entirely different from that of the proposed Commission. Certain assets were handed over to the Board, and it was told to make the Commonwealth shipping enterprise pay or it would be wiped out. The Federal Capital Commission will still be under the control of the Treasurer, it will still be supervised by the Auditor-General, and it will have to submit reports and estimates to Parliament every year.","Second Reading","SEAT OF GOVERNMENT (ADMINISTRATION) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[10]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Commissioner's staff will be able to deal with questions on the spot and at once, and matters will not require to be sent from one Department to another as at present. I firmly believe that the appointment of the proposed  Commission will lead to a reduction in the staff at Canberra. A good deal has been said in comparing day labour with contract labour, and as I believe in giving credit where credit is due, I am bound to say that work carried out at Canberra by day labour has been done in excellent fashion, and more cheaply than it would have been done by contract. There is in charge of the sewer channel at Canberra an excellent man named Dillon. He completed the first part of the channel, and then the late Government decided to call for tenders for the second section. The man in charge of the day-labour workers on the job asked to be allowed to submit a price for the second section. That was denied him because he could not be financed, 'but I believe the Minister . for Works and Railways (Mr . Stewart) will confirm the statement that his estimated price for -carrying out the second part of the work was £28,000 lower than the lowest tender submitted for it. He was given the job, and has saved the Department about £30,000. Some of the work done by day labour at Canberra stands to -the credit of those who did it. There are no better bricks made in Australia than those which are produced at Canberra. Mr. Griffin's plans required the removal of a certain hill. It would have cost a great deal to remove the hill, but the Department concerned established the Canberra brick works close to the> hill, and proceeded to make bricks out of material removed from it. The ex-Minister for Works and Railways, the honorable member for Wakefield (Mr. Foster), referred to the cost ' of the carriage of coal to Canberra. Newcastle coal costs, at Canberra, probably more than it costs at Melbourne, because it has to be carried there by rail, and the rail carriage of coal is very expensive. We have a power house at Canberra which is a monument to the people who built it. It supplies power and light to the neighbouring town of Queanbeyan. When our employees go into their houses at Canberra they will find sewerage, light, and water services provided for them. I have only one fault to find with the houses that have been erected there, and it is that they have been built too closely upon an English design, and insufficient verandah space has been provided for. Any one who would find fault with the workmanship put into the buildings must go to Canberra with a view to looking for faults. I believe that the appointment of a Commission, or a Commissioner, to administer Canberra will be a step in the right direction. If we do not appoint a Commission it will be imperative to give those who are now administering the Federal Territory more power than they at present possess. When one visits Canberra and stands on the top, of Camp Hill or Kurrajong, and looks around the Territory, he looks into the future. If he does not possess a national outlook or broad vision he should not be assisting in the building of the city. If a visitor goes to the cemetery he will find that an old lady was buried there 64 years ago, and on her tombstone are the words : ' Here we have no abiding city, but we seek one to come.' Those words are prophetic of the city that Canberra will yet be. The obligation is upon us, as representatives of the people of Australia, to visualize the city to come at Canberra and to build there, not for today, but for all time. We hope that continuous employment offering at Canberra will lead to settlement, and that will be promoted by the appointment of the proposed Commission. I have nothing to say against Melbourne as the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth. I have said before, and repeat now, that if the Seat of Government had been established in Sydney, that probably would have been attended with worse results than have followed its establishment in Melbourne. I say this, because there are bigger financial and commercial interests in Sydney than there are here. This is proved by the fact that between 50 and 60 per cent. of our taxation revenue is derived from New South Wales; 48 per cent of the taxation on land and 46½ per cent. of the income tax comes from that State. These figures speak for themselves, but I hope that in New South Wales we have learned to look upon Australia as our land and not only New South Wales. We look at Commonwealth matters with broad vision. I hope that we shall all view Canberra in the same way, and will assist to make the Federal Capital a city worthy of the people of Australia.","Second Reading","SEAT OF GOVERNMENT (ADMINISTRATION) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[10]/continue[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If we capitalized that £28,000 and put -the money into buildings at Canberra, honorable members would see how much we should have over for administrative offices. By letting land at from1s. to 4s. per acre at present we are receiving a revenue of over £30,000 a year from the Federal Capital Territory. What is the revenue from the Territory going to be when we sell leases of land there by auction? I am reminded of a statement made by the late Sir Denison Miller, whom I consulted on this question. He said, ' Let the Government give me the Canberra Territory for 20 years, and I will build them a Parliament House costing £2,000,000, put up the houses they require, present them with all necessary administrative offices, and at the same time I will make a very good dividend for the bank and will hand the territory back to the Government in 20 years' time.' If we are getting a revenue of £30,000 from the Federal Capital Territory to-day when nothing is being done to develop it, how much may we not expect to get when we do develop it? I believe we shall get such prices for leases of land there that we shall be able to pay more than interest, working expenses, and depreciation on buildings and machinery.","Second Reading","SEAT OF GOVERNMENT (ADMINISTRATION) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[10]/continue[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The cold I intend, if possible, to keep to myself, and the few impressions I shall endeavour to convey to the members of the House, if my limited vocabulary will permit .'me to do so. First of all, I wish to express my appreciation of the services being rendered to Australia by those in charge 'of the operations at Canberra. I was under the impression, from what I had heard from very many sources, that the go-slow policy was being adopted at that city, that there was not very much enthusiasm shown on the part of the workers, and that, as a matter of fact, it was a general ' take-down.' Quite the opposite is the case. I believe the directors of the operations at Canberra are unitedly and enthusiastically working to carry out their duties in the interests of Australia. I. was delighted with the enthusiasm displayed by the foremen. Although not an eavesdropper or a spy, I watched and spoke to the men at work, and found that every one of them was honestly trying to do  Iris duty by the Parliament and the people of Australia. That being so, 1 cannot see the necessity for the appointment of the Commission. I know that some people see- visions. The honorable member for Parkes (Mr. Marr) said that I lacked a broad vision. I am not old enough, I suppose, to have a wide vision, but probably when I am older my vision will expand; but at present I cannot visualize with the honorable member. The appointment of the Commission seems to me to be absolutely unnecessary and dangerous. Appointing a Board or Commission is very much like getting into debt. It is a very pleasant operation up to a point; but the getting rid of a Board, like getting rid of a debt, is often unpleasantly difficult; and possibly the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr. Stewart) may find it so in the near future. There is another analogy bet we en the appointment of a Board and getting into debt - both have great aptitude for throwing out a bay window here and a buttress there, an extension here and an extension there, and before long they assume very serious proportions. At present there is no necessity to appoint a Commission to carry out the operations at Canberra. I wish to pay a ' tribute to the Minister. I found that the utmost good-feeling prevailed among all the people at Canberra. I did not hear one man speak a derogatory word respecting another man, and I saw a good deal of the people while I was there. The directors we re delighted with the foremen, and the foremen we re delighted with their workers. It is a great tiling to find men pleased with their ' bosses.' The work is being carried on effectively. I feel that it is only just to the Minister for Works and Railways to congratulate him upon his administration. He is not a friend of mine. I do not think that he and I altogether harmonize, but that shall not prevent me from paying my tribute to his work at Canberra. I have methods of investigation of my own. I walked round a good deal during my stay in the Territory. As a matter of fact, I am usually rather om fail with workmen, possibly because I was once a worker myself. Perhaps it would be better for the country if I we re still one. It was a pleasure to find such a spirit of hearty co-operation. Everybody seemed to be pleased with, and to have confidence in, the Minister. They believed that lie wished to give them a fair deal, and they said,' ' We want to give him a fair deal in return.' Respecting the day-labour system, my experience has been that under good control men will do more by the day-labour system than they will do by the contract system. I do not care whether the leader of the men be called a Minister, a foreman, or a director. If he is the right man lie will get good work out of the men. The honorable member for Maribyrnong (Mr. Fenton) said today that the contract system was simply the day-labour system, plus the contractor's profits, and I believe, in some instances that that is so. It is a great thing that the directors of the work at Canberra have confidence in the Minister. It is a still greater thing that the foremen have confidence in the directors. The greatest thing of all is that the workers have confidence in the foremen. I am opposed to the appointment of this Commission, because I think it is quite unnecessary, and is an altogether useless expense. It may kill the enthusiasm at present being displayed. The work is being carried on more economically than would be possible under a Commission. The suggestion that the officers at present in control should be given a little more po we r may be wise. Perhaps it would be advisable to give them the status of Commissioners, and appoint a Chairman with some financial ability to guide the destinies of the Federal Territory. That might relieve the Minister for Works and Railways of a good deal of detail work. But I am positive that it would not be in the best interests of Australia to create a Commission with the po we rs set out in this Bill. Therefore, I shall vote against the measure. I had nothing to do with making the compact to build the Federal City, but no one would be more loth than I to break such a compact. Unquestionably a compact was made with New South Wales at the foundation of Federation that the Seat of Government should be in New South Wales, but not less than 100 miles from Sydney. We must honour the compact. I do hot think, ho we ver, that there is any obligation upon us to build an ornate city. Though I was so delighted with the surroundings and work °at Canberra 'the whole thing seemed to me to be the wild phantasy of a disordered dream. That is my set opinion, and I shall require good reasons for altering it. One cannot help admitting that the surroundings and design of the city are delightful. It might we ll be called the city of a thousand hills, for ranges of mountains and hills surround it. The climate is good and the situation beautiful. The productive capacity of the Territory is limited to sheep-raising. Very little of the land is suitable for agriculture. The Territory cannot produce new we alth for Australia, and the Australian people may as we ll realise that at once. It may be true, as the honorable member for Parkes has said, that we shall get back from the Territory, by way of city rentals, all the money that we spend upon it, but we shall never get new we alth from it. _ The country cannot produce new we alth. All that we can expect is to obtain from the lease of the land and in other ways some return of the large expenditure that has been incurred. A remarkably fine water service has been provided, and the se we rage scheme is excellent. I know a little about that class of work; and I think the Minister for Works and Railways has placed the very best man possible in charge of that department. I knew him years ago on the Kalgoorlie goldfields. He is earnest, capable, and enthusiastic, and I think he has done his work at Canberra at a wonderfully low cost. In view, ho we ver, of our enormous national debt I do not think that Ave should have embarked upon the construction of a wonder city such as we are told this Will be. Who can deny that Australia is labouring under an enormous national debt - a greater debt than the British national debt before the Avar?","Second Reading","SEAT OF GOVERNMENT (ADMINISTRATION) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[12]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Our country is largely undeveloped, and our railway systems need standardizing. If  Australia were invaded avc could not expeditiously move our troops from one part of the Commonwealth to another, owing to the different gauges in use in the various States, and in these circumstances the expenditure of large sums of money at the Federal Capital is premature. In discussing this matter Avith some of my more able confreres, I was informed that the establishment of a Federal Capital would be the means of creating a national spirit. Heaven only knows Ave need it badly enough, and the creation of such a spirit may be the means of developing our potential wealth. When inspecting the Federal Capital, I was reminded of a person named Jim McGregor. Jim had been left, either as a legacy or for some meritorious services performed, a large tract of undeveloped land which. he never troubled to fence, clear, or cultivate. The first thing he did Was to erect a mansion in the centre of the property, in which he entertained his friends most lavishly. He borrowed money on the title to construct the house, and tried, so far as was possible, to create the impression that all was well. He certainly created the impression that he was a man of some importance, because as little ' kids ' we were told to call him 'Mr.' McGregor, and not ' Jim.' It was not long, however, before the mortgagee foreclosed, and Jim spent the rest of his days in tramping from one hotel to another living on counter lunches. Canberra resembles the house which McGregor built, in that it is quite unnecessary to expend on a Federal Capital large sums of money which could be wisely expended in other directions.' If the transfer of the Seat of Government to Canberra W111 be the means of creating a national spirit, and prevent the representatives of the people from calling each other bad names, and put an end to party bickering, I shall support its construction. But Ave do not Avant an ornate building in ideal surroundings to create a national spirit. In another 100 years, when Canberra may be a city, the largest portion of Australia's population will be in Queensland or Western Australia. It is deplorable to think that the people of New South Wales would not enter the Federation until it was decided that the Federal Capital should be in that State. Victoria fought hard for the Seat 'of Government to be in Melbourne, and the people of New South Wales firmly stipulated that it should be in their State. Can that be regarded as an exhibition of a national spirit? The erection of the Capital is at present being carried out in the most expeditious way, and there is no need for the appointment of a Board of Commissioners. If I can be persuaded that if the Seat of Government is transferred as is suggested, a national Australian sentiment will be created in such a way that we will be able to rise to the occasion, shoulder our responsibilities, and dispense with party bickering, I shall be one of the most enthusiastic supporters of the project.","Second Reading","SEAT OF GOVERNMENT (ADMINISTRATION) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[12]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

A compact was entered into with the State I represent to do something for the benefit of Australia, and to protect it against invasion. What can the Federal Capital, on its proposed site, ever be? It will be an exotic growth. I stood on Mount Stromlo a few weeks ago. I went, there at the invitation of those who thought I was talking from want of knowledge. I first visited Canberra, however, when General Bridges was buried, and I stayed there a week. I saw little to impress me. I was told previously that I did not know what I was talking about, and that if I could see Canberra again I would change my opinion. I have seen it again. I have noted the development that has taken place. I have seen this mighty city of little humpies and ' wigwams.' They have there a building which they call a hostel. In the village from which I came in England the boys used to put their knuckles on the edge of the gutter, and were declared clever if they could fire an alley over the little country 'pub.' It would be almost as easy to fire an alley across the hostel at Canberra. We are told that the city of Canberra is being. built by men who arc big and broad-minded, and have visions. There is no doubt that they have ' visions.' Posterity will want to know how they applied those visions, and where they got them, They did not get them from common sense. I am prepared to make that assertion. I ask any one to go to Canberra with me and show me where there is any justification for the expenditure of the taxpayers' money. Some people say we must 'honour the compact.' Why should we be governed by the dead hand of the past, by the petty little State ideas of those who were in power when Federation was consummated, I do not mind the Federal Capital being in New South Wales if we can create a broad, national spirit in New South Welshmen. If I give them a capital, . I want a quid pro quo for the taxpayers, who will have to pay for it. In that regard we must consider the circumstances of the selection of the site. Can any one show me a more awkward site for a capital? When I stood on Mount Stromlo with the Minister for Defence, I asked him to view the contour of the country. It consists of little hillocks surrounded by big mountains, some rising 6,000 feet above the sea level. I said to him, ' Show me where the revenue can come from to finance a Capital City here. If you can show me that this place will pay for the money already spent, I will admit that I know nothing about it.' He could not do it. No man in this House can tell me where the revenue can be obtained in the Capital  Territory to maintain the projected city. It is nonsense to say it will te obtained from land values. The reason given by the Minister for the high cost of bricks at Canberra is that the cost of coal is excessive owing to the cost of transport. In the light of that statement, Canberra can never - be a manufacturing town. Rural industries will be its sole support. Every town and city in Australia to-day is living upon the productivity of the State in which it is situated. The prosperity of any town is dependent upon the prosperity of its hinterland. There are the mining towns which rise and flourish, and become large cities while they produce the wealth that sustains them. As soon as the source of that wealth is exhausted they wilt and die, unless, as in the case of Ballarat and Bendigo, there is agricultural country surrounding them. In Silverton, near Broken Hill, large buildings .can be bought to-day, but no one will- buy them because there is no use for them. I was in Coolgardie some time ' ago, and saw large buildings - hotels, banks, and other structures - from which everything useful, including the iron roofs and wooden rafters, had been removed. This condition of affairs had been reached because the industry that formerly kept the town going had wilted and died. The town is no longer there. Those facts prove that every town is maintained by the productivity of the country around it. I ask' the' Minister and any other enthusiastic supporter of Canberra, 'What will keep Canberra going? Is there any possibility of mining development? Is there any possibility of trade filtering through to Jervis Bay from any portion of New South Wales not provided for by Sydney? Is there any possibility of Canberra becoming a commercial or manufacturing centre?' It cannot be said that Canberra will be an important centre because we take Parliament there and transport administrative offices and officers. The result of that may be that we will have there a few boarders, who will survive as long as the people in the other States pay for their upkeep. In other words, Canberra will be a Commonwealth country residence, and very few people have a country residence and support it by revenues from the same district. In Adelaide people go to Mount Lofty for country residences. The productive parts of that district are occupied by market gardeners, .and their produce goes not to the country residences but to the city. That is what we shall have at Canberra. No one- knows how this city will grow. I suggest that it can only grow from the expenditure of the taxpayers' money, which must be drawn from revenues derived from the productivity of other portions of the continent. I am of opinion that Parliament should not give' away the power and responsibility that rest upon it. We should ' carry our own baby,' which we have brought into existence in the shape and form of this city in the making. Some honorable members have spoken of the great progress made there. I was somewhat astonished, in view of all that had been said, to find that after so many years the city had not progressed to a greater extent. Judging by the progress made up to date, it will be very many years before Canberra is anything like a city. It will not in our time be equal to .a decent suburb of one of the capital cities of the Commonwealth. The object of my remarks is to try to get members of Parliament to recognise their responsibilities to the people of Australia, and to stop filling them up with the idea of developing a big city. The sooner we get the taxpayers to realize the waste off money that, is taking place, and wake them up to the fact that they are tied down by enactments made years ago, which are not justified to-day, and set about revoking what has been done, the better it will be for all. In that way we would be doing the honest thing by the electors who ' return us to this House. It is easy to go on the hustings and speak to the uninitiated electors of the high ideals of a capital city, but it is by no means fair that support should be obtained in that way. If the capital city had been placed in a situation that could be justified, it would, perhaps, not be possible to level so many complaints against it to-day. If any honorable member can justify it I shall be pleased to hear him. Where is the wisdom and common sense in putting the city where it is? Provision has been made for water supply, sewerage, and electric light. Let us consider .-the water supply first. Can any honorable member justify what has been done there? They have put a' dam across the Cotter River, just above the junction with the Mumimbidgee. The water, having been dammed up, is taken half-a-mile through an immense hill, then under the Mumimbidgee, and finally is pumped to the top of Mount Stromlo, whence it is reticulated through the Capital City area. No doubt it is a marvellous engineering feat, but would have been entirely unnecessary if a suitable site had been selected. Of course, it may be said that there is only one lift, but for how long 1","Second Reading","SEAT OF GOVERNMENT (ADMINISTRATION) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[13]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

There were at least a dozen other places in Now South Wales where the Capital City could have been built just as well as at Canberra, and the available water supply used for power purposes. Of course, this could have been done also at Canberra, if they had taken the dam wall up another 100 feet.","Second Reading","SEAT OF GOVERNMENT (ADMINISTRATION) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[13]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

That has not been done, and now high prices have to he paid for coal for the power-house. Whenever any one talks about cutting the loss and stopping further expenditure of public money on Canberra one is looked on as a 'Little Stater ' - a man without vision or a national outlook. The real truth is that the electors, who sent us here, do not know the extent to which money is being wasted at Canberra. I have no desire to criticize the general lay-out of the city. It may bc all right, but when I was there the section of the Molonglo River, forming part of the artificial lakes scheme, was a series of little billabongs, and there was about as much water in them as one sees during the summer in the River  Torrens in Adelaide, when the sluice gates are opened for cleansing purposes. There we have also a dam and an artificial lake, and lately the authorities have been pumping away deposits of silt known as Cohen's Island and Frank Moulden Peninsula, names given to these deposits of silt because civic fathers of that name allowed them to appear in the river. I feel sure that the same problems will present themselves in an aggravated form in connexion with the ornamental lake scheme at Canberra. In my opinion, the whole scheme is something in the nature of a bad dream, and the sooner we get rid of it the better for the people of Australia. Turning now to the sewerage system, I admit that the engineers have carried out a big job. There is no doubt that they have provided for posterity. The system is big enough to deal with the sewerage of almost any city in Australia. The main sewer is 5 ft. 6 in. high. I went down it. It is egg-shaped. Everything is up-to-date. All that is wanting is enough water to flush it. Heaven only knows what will happen if it is flushed frequently; I. am afraid the reservoir will be emptied. I cannot see any justification for that expenditure. I went down one of the sewer tunnels for about 200 yards. On the rock face side they have simply cemented the sides of the rock, but on the alluvial side the sewer is all timbered up, and the cement has been put over the timber. It is a costly job, but what is a million when you hare got a good sewerage system?","Second Reading","SEAT OF GOVERNMENT (ADMINISTRATION) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[13]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
