It provides for the payment of a bounty of 4d. a gallon on power alcohol derived from certain cultivated crops, namely, cassava, sweet potatoes, arrowroot, or other approved starch-bearing plants. In view, of the potential importance of this subject, I make no apology for giving the House as much information as is in the possession of the Department respecting the position of this proposed industry and its needs. It is not proposed to include in the provisions of this measure power alcohol made from molasses, a substance which is at present being used to a certain extent for making power alcohol. The evidence indicates that the production of fuel alcohol from this source costs less than that from cultivated crops. The available supplies of molasses, however, are not sufficient to form an adequate basis for a scheme which aims eventually, I hope, at the substitution of Australian power alcohol for imported petroleum liquid fuel. While it is intended to use molasses so far as possible, yet a substantial development of the power alcohol industry can be achieved only by the cultivation of suitable crops grown for the purpose. It is only by this means that a supply of material commensurate with the requirements of the industry can be provided. The bill limits payment of the bounty to a period of five years from the 1st of January, 1926. The amount of bounty payable in any one year must not exceed £5,000. In the event of this amount not being expended in any year, the unexpended balance will be made available for the subsequent year, in addition to the stipulated amount of £5,000. The total amount of bounty payable during the period of five years cannot, however, exceed £25,000. In order to safeguard the interests of the growers, the bill contains a provision to empower the Minister to withhold payment of the bounty unless he is satisfied that the growers of the crops have received a reasonable price for their produce. It is also provided that a proportion of not less than half of the bounty must be passed on to the growers, in addition to the price which the industry could reasonably pay for its raw material without bounty. The usual provision is inserted to authorize the Minister to refuse payment of bounty unless the persons employed in the industry are paid the rates of wages prescribed by the competent industrial authority. The position will be, therefore, that not less than one-half of the bounty - that is, not less than 2d. per gallon - will be an additonal return to the grower. The cost of methylation will be covered by1d. per gallon. The remaining1d. per gallon of the 4d. per gallon bounty will also be available for the remuneration of the growers if this is necessary to ensure them a reasonable price. The employees directly engaged in the industry will also be sure of payment for their services at the prescribed rates of wages. The bill provides the powers necessary for the protection of the revenue, and for compelling compliance with its requirements, and the regulations made under it. I might here mention for the information of honorable members that power alcohol is classed as methylated spirits under the excise tariff, and is not liable to the payment of excise duty. The import duty upon petrol and similar liquid fuels is1d. per gallon. Before delivery from Customs control the power alcohol produced must be denatured in accordance with standards prescribed for the purpose under the Spirits Acts by the admixture of methyl alcohol or wood naphtha to render it unfit for human consumption. The power alcohol so denatured is for use a3 a fuel in internal combustion engines. While it is possible to use the denatured alcohol as alcohol in engines designed for the purpose, it will be necessary to mix' with it a proportion of petrol or a similar petroleum spirit oil before it can be used for the ordinary engines. The mixture will contain from 60 per cent, to 70 per cent, of alcohol. It is quite unnecessary for me to. dwell at any length on the vital part which liquid fuel plays in the industrial life of all nations, and of its still more vital importance in times of national crisis. . One of the most striking characteristics of these times is the intense rivalry which exists between the nations to gain possession or control of existing oil-fields, and to discover fresh deposits. The keenness displayed by practically all the nations of the world in this matter bears manifest witness to the essential importance of liquid fuels for national wel: rare, progress and security. It also implies a' keen recognition of the fact that the known deposits of well oil are not unlimited, and that, with the rapidly increasing rate of world-wide consumption, the exhaustion of the existing deposits looms up as a decided possibility within a measurable period of time. This possibility has incited a keen application of experimental research with the object of discovering a satisfactory substitute for petroleum fuel oils.","Second Reading","POWER ALCOHOL BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/para[3]","N/A","N/A"

The unlimited supply of material available for the production of alcohol has led to extensive investigations of the practicability of its use as a suitable substitute. The United States of America is specially active in this field. Great Britain has also been devoting special attention to the subject. Among the British concerns which have taken up the matter is the International Sugar and Alcohol Company of London, a branch of the Distillers Limited, which is a very powerful company in the distilling industry of Great Britain. This company, with its parent company, has been associated for some years with the production of alcohol for power purposes, and its investigations have extended to the experimental production of suitable crops in different countries. These operations have necessitated the organization of technical staffs of highly-trained experts, and the company is, therefore, thoroughly equipped with complete information regarding the most suitable crops and the best technical methods for their conversion into alcohol. A representative of the company has carefully investigated the possibility of establishing the power alcohol industry in Australia, and as a result of his investigation, his company has decided that Queensland offers the most favorable opportunity for conducting,- on a sufficiently large scale, an experiment for the purpose of ascertaining whether, as a practical fact, fuel alcohol can be produced in Australia at a cost which will enable it to' compete with petroleum fuel oils.","Second Reading","POWER ALCOHOL BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","81","PRATTEN, Herbert","K1J","N/A","N/A","N/A","499","I shall deal with that later. An arrangement has been made for erecting a plant at Sarina for making conclusive experiments. The sugar industry of Queensland offers special facilities for initiating the industry, as it will supply in the form of molasses a proportion of the raw material required. The erection of a distillery in conjunction with the existing sugar mill at Sarina will enable part of the sugar milling machinery to be utilized in the production of the alcohol at a period of the year in which the machinery is at present idle. Tha cultivated crops- in the first place, cassava, which I understand is a sago-like root plant - can be more economically and more abundantly produced in a tropical climate. The Queensland Government, after examining the scheme, was so satisfied with the possibilities that it offered for extending agricultural settlement in the state, that it undertook to advance the sum of £25,000 to enable a Queensland sugar refining company to enter into an agreement with the International Sugar and Alcohol Company to erect a distillery at their mill for the production of power alcohol from their waste molasses and from cassava crops grown on the adjacent lands. The British Company proposes, for a start, to invest at least £50,000 in the enterprise. If the experiment is as successful as their investigation leads them to expect it will be, their representative states. tha>t the capital- eventually invested will not be less than £1,000',000. I wish fo make it quite clear to honorable members that thi3 is only an experiment - an ambitious one, it is: true, boat, still,, only that. I am confident that honorable members will recognize that the proposal to establish tie production in Australia of fuel alcohol from crops specially grown for the purpose, and thus to> make- Australia less- dependent on Overseas supplies of liquid fuels, merits full consideration and every assistance that can- reasonably be offered. Although our dependence on oversea supplies is' unfortunate;, it is unavoidable' at present; but we cannot as good Australians regard! the fact with any feelings of satisfaction. Apart from considerations of national security, the fact that we are paying, abroad many millions of pounds a year for our supplies of this, essential commodity should incite us to leave nothing undone in the endeavour- to meet our requirements by the- utilization of our own- resources. In the year 1923-24 our. importations of petrol and similar petroleum oils amounted, to about 67.000.000 gallons, for which we paid £4,200,000. Those figures were greatly exceeded in the six months following the close of that- financial year. In reply to a question asked in this House the other day,. I stated the importations for the calendar year 1924, which included' six months of the financial year 1923-4, and six months of the uncompleted financial year 1924-25. The importations, for that period amounted to the extraordinary total of nearly S2,000,000 gallons. The importations of this commodity into Australia in 1921-22 were only 34;000,000 gallons, of a value of. £3,100,,000, so that it will be seen that in- a little over two years the quantity of petrol and similar commodities inn ported increased by nearly 150- per cent. It is quite unnecessary for me to point out the very great advantage .that would accrue to Australian, land settlement if the money spent on imported petrol were employed in the production of crops for conversion into fuel alcohol.. While we cannot expect that in th© immediate future fuel alcohol will be produced: in1 Australia in sufficient quantities te replace a substantial proportion, of the importations- of petrol, it will be readily recognized! that the success of the experiment which this bill' is designed) to- assist will open the way to supplying an ever-increasing proportion of our requirements of liquid fuel. The benefits of such a. development can scarcely be over-estimated1. The company purposes- to distil, after using up the. whole of the molasses available within transit area of the distillery, from cassava-, a crop which has been grown in Queensland in' the past, and for the cultivation of which that state is eminently suited. To produce sufficient cassava to provide material for, say, 81,000;000' gallons- of liquid fuel, which is the quantity we at present import, would necessitate the cultivation of over 150,000 acres of land. Even if only a considerable proportion of this area were thus utilized, its use would be a very valuable contribution to the solution of the problem of settling the tropical parts of our continent. The known supplies of well oil are not inexhaustible. Experts even now are considering the date when this source of power will be exhausted, but the production of fuel alcohol from annually grown crops is limited only by the extent of suitable land available, a limitation which is scarcely likely to affect Australian production. Our almost total 'dependence on foreign countries for a commodity so vital to the defence and industrial systems of the Commonwealth as liquid fuel can only be- acquiesced in- by the people of Australia after every avenue has been explored which gives a chance of relief from such an unsatisfactory position. On this ground alone, if on no other, any reasonable assistance that can be given to the industry in its initial difficulties is fully justified The proposal to pay a bounty of 4d. per gallon- on fuel alcohol is entirely in accord with the past policy of Parliament. In pursuit of the same objective,, a bounty, of SiA. per gallon has- been paid for some years on crude oil derived from Australian shale deposits. The amount of bounty paid during the last five years has been £68,000. During the war, the shale oil industry was of very material benefit to this. community. Boring operations for well oil in Papua have been subsidized,. and the Government's offer of an amount of £50,000 stands as a reward for tha discovery of well oil. in Australia. In addition, the Common-wealth Government has entered into a partnership agreement with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company for the purpose of establishing refineries in the Commonwealth for the treatment of imported crude petroleum oil, thus making provision for stocks being available in times of national crisis. In reply to the interjection of the honorable member for Hindmarsh (Mr. Makin), I should say that the question of the production and suitability of power alcohol for use as an engine fuel was extensively investigated in 1917 by a special committee of the Advisory Council of Science and Industry. In the course of its report, the committee declared that alcohol was in every way suitable as a liquid fuel, and possessed certain advantages over petrol. Its report contained the following statement relating to the production of power alcohol from cultivated crops : -","Second Reading","POWER ALCOHOL BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","81","PRATTEN, Herbert","K1J","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","The committee recommended that, a:? an offset against the extra cost caused by fiscal restrictions on the manufacture of alcohol, an allowance at the rate of 3d. per gallon should be granted by the Commonwealth Government on power alcohol denatured by certain prescribed methods, and that, in addition, a bonus of 3d. per gallon should be paid to encourage its manufacture and to develop the primary industries on which the supply of the necessary raw material depends. After this exhaustive investigation and recommendation, relating to a total bounty of 6d, per gallon on power alcohol made in Australia, the proposals have crystallized into tha bill now before the House, which provides for a bounty of 4d. per gallon, of which Id. per gallon will be for denaturing, 2d. per gallon will go to the growers to encourage them to cultivate and develop the crops, and Id. will be retained, probably, for the further encouragement of the growers in that directum. This is no airy scheme or mere pious aspiration. A representative has come to Australia from one of the strongest financial corporations in the United Kingdom. The Queensland 'Government has investigated the scheme, and. is prepared to assist the industry by advancing £25,000 to the sugar-mill where the first distillery will be erected. The company has offered, after an exhaustive investigation of the proposition, to invest £50,000, and has said to the Commonwealth 'Help us in this great experiment, and if we do not produce, you, of course, do not pay.'  I should like to say a word or two with regard to the position of the mills, .and to explain to the House why the experiment is not based upon molasses instead of starch-bearing crops. The question naturally arises, is not molasses the material on which the industry should be established, and should not the bounty be paid on spirit produced from molasses? I know, that this view has been strongly stated by gentlemen connected with the sugar industry, and I shall endeavour to clear up some misunderstanding.: regarding it. The Australian production of sugar last season was approximately 500,000 tons. That quantity would produce about 125,000 tons of molasses. As 1 ton of molasses will produce 65 gallons of 95 per cent, alcohol, the total possible production of power alcohol from molasses is 125 multiplied by 65, or a little .over 8,000,000 gallons. The quantity of petrol and other petroleum spirit imported into Queensland last year was nearly 9,000,000 gallons. If, therefore, all the molasses produced were available for distillation, the quantity of fuel alcohol that could be distilled would be about equal to the quantity required in Queensland alone. But owing to the distribution of the sug a r mills the production of mol a sses is spre a d over loc a lities sep a r a ted from e a ch other by hundreds of miles; a nd it is necess a ry th a t the distilleries should be situ a ted in the loc a lities where the r a w m a teri a l is produced, for the high freights ch a rged for tr a nsport over long dist a nces effectively limit the a re a from which it c a n be dr a wn. Only a very sm a ll proportion of the tot a l qu a ntity of mol a sses produced is a v a il a ble for distill a tion a t a given point, a nd no request h a s been m a de for the p a yment of a bounty on power a lcohol produced from mol a sses, bec a use when the distillery is erected it will consume, without cost to the Feder a l Government, the whole of the mol a sses a v a il a ble within the district. The comp a ny th a t proposes to expend £50,000 in erecting a distillery for the production of this spirit intends to st a rt oper a tions in the neighbourhood of M a ck a y. It is estim a ted th a t in this district 10,000 to 15,000 tons of mol a sses a re produced, or a bout 10 per cent, of the tot a l production this se a son in Queensl a nd. As much of this m a teri a l a s is a v a il a ble will be used for the production of a lcohol, but no bounty will be p a y a ble for power a lcohol produced from mol a sses, nor h a s a bounty been a sked for: presum a bly it is not required. If the production of this spirit is ever io re a ch a st a ge when it will displ a ce a ny consider a ble proportion of the present consumption of petrol, it must run into m a ny millions of g a llons. It is cle a r, therefore, th a t the supply of mol a sses must be supplemented by a n a bund a nt, production of st a rch-be a ring m a teri a l grown for the purpose in the immedi a te vicinity of the distillery. If the industry h a d to rely on mol a sses a lone its scope would be so limited th a t the enterprise could not be other th a n a f a ilure. It m a y a lso be pointed out th a t it would be quite a n unp a y a ble proposition to grow sug a r c a ne speci a lly for .the production of spirit. The Queensl a nd Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Forg a n Smith) recently st a ted th a t the estim a ted cost of producing a ton of c a ne w a s £1 17s. 2d., while the estim a ted cost of producing a ton of c a ss a v a w a s £1 7s. 2d., the rel a tive v a lue of c a ss a v a a nd sug a r for the production of a lcohol being two to one in f a vour of the former. Honor a ble members will see, therefore, th a t on th a t a ssumption 1 ton of c a ss a v a , so f a r a s the production of power a lcohol is concerned, is worth much more, a nd costs much less th a n a ton of c a ne. Since sug a r c a ne must be prim a rily grown for the production of sug a r, the production of mol a sses is necess a rily proportion a te to the output of sug a r, while the production of c a ss a v a will be limited only by the consumption of the fuel a lcohol obt a ined from it. It c a nnot, however, be too strongly emph a sized th a t the profit a ble production of fuel a lcohol in Austr a li a is still in the experiment a l st a ge. I a m informed th a t the distillery to be erected a t the Pl a ne Creek Sug a r Mill, in the vicinity of M a ck a y, if it proves profit a ble, will be the forerunner of m a ny simil a r pl a nts. I now intend to say a few words as to why alcohol manufactured from prickly pear has not been included . in the bill. Most honorable members will realize that it is highly desirable to make power alcohol from indigenous plants. The whole proposal has been carefully examined by the Tariff Board, and the original scheme of the International Sugar and Alcohol Company has been somewhat modified. The company originally asked for a bounty of 4d. a gallon, allowing Id. for methylation, and 1½d. to the grower, the remaining lid. to be kept in hand.","Second Reading","POWER ALCOHOL BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

The experiments in the production of the spirit from prickly-pear have been limited to laboratory tests.

In the circumstances, of course, the board was unable to make any definite recommendation, but it may be taken for granted that, should an3' definite commercial proposition be placed before the Government by any company or as so ciation of individuals, it will receive the most sympathetic consideration of Ministers and honorable members generally.

It will be obvious to the honorable member that, if the estimate of the cost of production of cassava is about £1 7s. 2d. a ton, ordinary potatoes cannot be profitably grown for the manufacture of power alcohol.  I have a few figures that may interest the House regarding the 'present production of motor spirit in Australia. The estimated importation of petrol and similar fuel oils in this country for the year ending 31st December, 1925, is over 80,000,000 gallons, and the quantity of benzol to be produced from coal this year by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company is estimated at about 1,500,000 gallons. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company makes a small quantity which may be put down at an average of 25,000 gallons a year. Our acetone factory also makes a small quantity of power alcohol which may be put down at 10,000 gallons. Mr. John Feil has great hope in connexion with the new development of his shale industry at Newnes that he will be eventually producing 4,000,000 gallons of motor spirit in a year. The Commonwealth Oil Company hopes to increase its production this year from 3,000,000 to 6,000,000 gallons. If all these hopes are realized we shall have a production within Australia next year of, say, 10,000,000 gallons of liquid fuel. Honorable members will see what great possibilities there are in this proposed development. I feel that each of us is prepared to wish the enterprise well, and hope that it will be successful. I believe it is a reasonable thing for the Commonwealth, acting with the distillery people in Great Britain, and the Queensland Government to give the assistance asked for after the expenditure of £75,000 has been made, and power alcohol has been produced as a result.

This is a measure to amend a section of the Export Guarantee Act which was passed last session.It will be within the recollection of honorable members that the purpose of that Act was to assist the exportation and marketing of Australian products. The sum of £500,000 was set aside out of the preceding year's surplus, and made available for that object, and in addition power was given for the guaranteeing of advances made in respect of produce put into the hands of any export control board that might be established. But in the operation of the Act a serious difficulty has arisen. Last year the position of the growers of doradilla grapes was found to be a very difficult one , and certain assistance was granted to them. As a result of that assistance the doradilla grape-growing industry was benefited to a great extent. A large quantity of spirit was made from the grapes, but it could only , be sold, at a reasonable price, by an increased production of sweet wines requiring it for fortification purposes. An expansion in the production of sweet wine has been brought about, and there is a bigger market for such wine today as the result of a bounty given under another Act. It is hoped that the trade will be further expanded, as a result of preference shown bo this product on the British market. The assistance to be given to the doradilla grape-grower was dependent upon the marketing of his produce overseas, but when an endeavour was made to obtain that assistance, it was held by the Law Department that it was not the produce of the doradilla grape that was being exported, and that it was not for the marketing of the spirit made from the doradilla grape that money was being asked, because that spirit 'had gone into the sweet wine, which it had been used to fortify. It was held that a product forming part of some form of production on the marketing of which we were expending money, could not benefit from the moneys available under the Export Guarantee Act.","Second Reading","EXPORT GUARANTEE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

That amendment will give us the power to make these payments out of the funds available. It gives effect to the intention of the act by making it of assistance in bringing about the production of commodities to be used in connexion with the manufacture of other commodities suitable for export. The assistance to be given amounted to about £24,000, and the growers of doradilla grapes would have been in a very embarrassing position if they had been unable to receive that assistance. We believed that there was power under the act to pay this money, but it having been found that there was not that power, we now desire to amend the act to enable us to make these payments.

It now seems certain that, following the acceptance by Germany of the experts' plan of reparations known as the Dawes report, the Commonwealth may rely on receiving regular cash payments as its share of reparations. It is the aim of the Government to reduce as speedily as possible Australia's large burden of war debt, and it is considered that extraordinary receipts arising out of the war should be hypothecated to that purpose. Indeed, it is .singularly appropriate that reparation moneys received from ex-enemy countries should be applied towards the extinction of the debt created for the purpose of prosecuting the late war. Honorable members will recollect that a committee of experts was appointed to suggest a practical plan which would enable Germany to balance her budget, stabilize her currency, and meet her obligations to the Allies under the Treaty of Versailles. The determination of the amount to be paid annually by (Germany involved two leading considerations; first, how much could be raised and set aside in Germany for the .Allies without imperilling the country's financial position, and, secondly., how much would it be possible for Germany to transfer to- her creditors abroad. The experts came to the conclusion that, following the arrangements made for floating a German loan -abroad, the establishment of the Reichsbank and the return of the currency to a gold basis, Germany would be able to pay the following amounts during the first five years.:- 1924-25, £50,000,000; 1925-26 £61,000,000; 1926-27, £60,000,000; 1927-  28, £87,500,000; 1928-29, £125,000,000. It is calculated that the annuity for 1928- 29, namely, £125,000,000, will become the standard annual payment .thereafter. This payment, however, is subject to increase if the index embodied in the experts' report shows that the prosperity of Germany has advanced. The reparations are payable in German currency, and the Reparations Transfer Committee has the responsibility of deciding to what extent the amounts can be transferred to the Allies by deliveries in kind or in cash, without endangering the stability of the German currency. In sonic quarters it is believed that it may not be possible to transfer mors than £50,000,000 annually, at _ any rate for some years. The annual payments by Germany include all Treaty charges which, in addition to reparations proper, inclu de the cost of armies of occupation, the Belgian war debt, expenses of control commissions, clearing-house char,ge3, restitution of identifiable objects, &c. The amount applied to the Treaty requirements other than reparations proper is to be a first charge upon the annual payment by Germany. These .are to be allotted by the Reparations Commission, and the balance remaining will be distributed to the Allies on a fixed basis. Great Britain's share will be 22 per cent., and the Commonwealth will receive 4.35 per cent, of the amount allocated to the British Empire. The annuities will be paid by Germany either in cash or delivered in kind. During the earlier years, when deliveries in kind will predominate, the Dominions will be paid their proportions of cash available, and credited with their proportion of deliveries in kind. The latter credits will :be paid in later years as cash reparation receipts are available. Honorable members will realize how difficult it is to estimate the amount that will he credited to the Commonwealth in respect of reparations. However, making a reasonable allowance for, alternatively, the minimum and maximum non-reparation charges, the share of reparations to be allotted to the Commonwealth will be - Having made a rough estimate of the amount of reparation moneys to be credited to the Commonwealth, it is quite impossible to forecast in what periods, and in what amounts the cash will be paid. As I have already stated, we have received two amounts this year, totalling £.257,000.","Second Reading","NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

But in lieu of a fixed sum, the Dawes' plan provides for a definite annual payment extending over a term of years, which has not yet been determined. This bill is to giro authority for the payment of the3e reparation receipts into the national debt sinking fund. That is the main purpose of the measure; but advantage is being taken of the opportunity to make two other amendments of the act to provide for the payment into the sinking fund of (a) all moneys received from the states as sinking fund contributions in respect of. loans by the Commonwealth to the states; and (b) such moneys as the Treasurer may determine to pay out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, in addition to the regular annual contributions already provided for in the act. During this financial year the Commonwealth borrowed £10,300,000 for the states, and it was agreed between them and the Commonwealth that all future loans shall be subject to a sinking fund contribution of 10s. per cent. per annum. This amendment will enable us to pay that contribution into the national debt sinking fund, so that there will be unified control by the trustees of that fund. In regard to the second provision for payments into the sinking fund out of revenue in excess of the annual contributions provided for in the act, the Government last year applied £4,915,755 of the surplus revenue to debt redemption. That was done under the authority of the War Loans Redemption and Conversion Act and the War Gratuity Act. But it is highly desirable that such moneys shall be handled by the National Debt Commission, so that there shall be only one authority operating the fund and repurchasing securities. The proposed amendment of the law will enable that to be done.","Second Reading","NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We all are glad that a certain amount of reparations money is being received from Germany, but the Treasurer made it clear that these payments may be made either in cash or in kind. If, as is probable, we receive future payments in kind, the benefit to be derived by Australia will be questionable. The receipt of large quantities of goods from Germany will involve a corresponding diminution of work in the production of similar commodities in Australia. Therefore, reparations may not be as good a windfall as they appear at first sight. Australia is to receive a certain proportion of all reparations paid to Great Britain. Of course, if Great Britain paid the Commonwealth its share in cash, we should be very glad to receive the money. But if the Mother Country has to accept from Germany millions of pounds worth of goods, what will happen to the British worker? Nobody imagines that Germany will pay all the reparations in gold. It will pay in manufactured articles which the Allies will be compelled to receive. When I was in England last year millions of people were unemployed and dependent upon the Government dole, largely because of the use of German goods, and' the consequent depression of British industries. That state of affairs must continue if reparations amounting to millions of pounds per annum are to be received in kind. The disability experienced in Great Britain will be felt to a more limited extent in Australia if it too receives reparations in the form of manufactured goods. We hold Germany to account for the great burden imposed upon us in connexion with the war, but it is doubtful whether reparations will be to us the advantage that wo anticipated. Certainly if they cause stagnation in local industries and unemployment throughout the country, Australia will not benefit from such payments. Of course, I am anxious that the Commonwealth shall receive all the reparations money that is available, but if it is not received in cash it may be a danger, rather than a comfort, to the Commonwealth. I doubt whether reparations in kind would be helpful to the primary producers. A certain quantity of goods must be sent from Great Britain to balance our exports, and if, in addition, we have to receive large quantities of goods from Germany as reparations, the balance of trade will turn against the Commonwealth.","Second Reading","NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Dawes report does not specifically provide for cash. If Germany can pay cash, well and good; but I venture to say that she will not pay cash, and that the reparations will eventually be received in the form of goods. I have no idea how we came to receive cash payments for the first two instalments. Possibly Great Britain received goods from Germany and forwarded cash to us. Everybody knows that German iron and steel is being imported into England in ever' increasing quantities. The future will reveal whether we shall have to accept reparations in kind. The Treasurer has forewarned us by stating this may later be the case. 1 have nothing to say against the principle embodied in the bill. It is necessary that we should have a sinking fund and that any sums received by the Commonwealth should be paid into it. But it must not be taken for granted that, because we are paying so much annually into the fund, we are reducing 1he national debt. Although 'we are providing a sinking fund to meet the existing national debt, yet at the same time we are increasing that debt by borrowing further sums of money. The Treasurer stated recently that the Government had proposed the national debt sinking fund. As a matter of fact, Mr. Watt, when Treasurer, in 1918, established the loan sinking fund. The measure then introduced into the House provided for the payment of 10s. per cent, to the sinking fund. The National Debt Sinking Fund Act . repealed the original act, but made no difference in the amount of money that had to be paid into the sinking fund. The credit for establishing the sinking fund cannot, therefore, be claimed by the present Government. This sinking fund has been in existence for a number of years, and large sums of money have been paid into it. In 1920-21 the payment to the sinking fund was £3,211,460; in 1921-2, £3,042,388; in 1922-3, £2,494,202; and in 1923-4, £2,547,823. The estimate for 1924-5 is £2,759,318. The total is, approximately, £13,000,000. The Commonwealth debt on the 30th June, 1921, was £401,720,024; on the 30th June, 1922, £416,070,509; and on the 30th June, 1923, £410,996,316. The present Government came into office in February, 1923. The amending National Debt Sinking Fund Bill was introduced by the Treasurer in June of that year. Yesterday the Treasurer stated that, owing to the operations of the Government, the national debt had been reduced during the last two years by £6,000,000. The Government took office in February of 1923, but the Treasurer cannot lay claim to any reduction of debt that took place prior to June, the end of that financial year. The public debt at that- time was £410,996,316. The following year it was £415,600,099. Notwithstanding the provision of the sinking fund, the public debt continues to increase. Up to the 31st March, 1925, the debt was £431,883,235, showing an increase of £20,000,000 in the indebtedness of this country over a period of two years. It is difficult for me to understand how the Treasurer arrives at a reduction in the national debt of £6,000,000 in two years, when during that period the total indebtedness of the Commonwealth increased by £20,000,000. There is room for explanation. I do not follow the Treasurer's reference to the net national debt. Is he taking into consideration advances made to the states during his term of office, these sums to be eventually refunded? If that principle is applied now, ib should have been applied to the period prior to this Government coming into office. If that had been done, I venture to say it would have made a material alteration to the figures supplied by former Treasurers. We must be guided by the figures made available respecting the national debt. These show clearly that from June, 1923, to March, 1925, the national debt has increased by £20,000,000. I place those figures before honorable members so that they may know the exact position. Many people who have read statements made in this House have come to the conclusion that the payment to the sinking fund is reducing the total debt of the Commonwealth. It reduces the existing debt, but it should be definitely understood by the, people that owing to the Government continuing to borrow money, the national debt is being considerably increased, and from present appearances will continue to increase for some time.","Second Reading","NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I should like to know how the Treasurer arrives at his statement thai the indebtedness of the Commonwealth had been reduced in the last couple of years. by £6,000,000. I fail to find that information in the official record. It appears to me that our indebtedness has increased rather than decreased during the last two years. Therefore, the Treasurer's statement does not appear to reveal the true position. Under the bill, moneys that are returned by the states shall be paid into the sinking fund. This is the proper course to pursue, and this provision will meet with the commendation of honorable members. It is absolutely necessary that moneys received by the Commonwealth and paid into the sinking fund should be controlled .by the board appointed for this particular purpose. A reduction in the national debt would be appreciated by every one. It is intended that .the -.existing debt shall be wiped out in 50 years. That is, I .suppose, an actuarial estimate which will probably work out in practice. But ,as we are constantly borrowing additional moneys the national debt is not .being reduced. The Treasurer has stated that if we increase the national debt proportionately with the increase in population, there will be nothing much to complain about. I do not agree with him. I probably would agree if times were normal. During the war we had to borrow millions of money, and the national debt was consequently considerably increased. It would be interesting to know exactly what the national debt was prior to, and at the conclusion of, the war. The suggestion that we should increase the national debt in proportion to the increase in population does not appeal to me, especially in these abnormal times. We should endeavour to reduce the national debt, and this can be done only by exercising strict economy. Yesterday the honorable member for Dalley (Mr. Mahony) referred to the building of the railway from Yass to Canberra. I would point out that that railway .could be built and paid for out of revenue. We have had surpluses of £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 during the last few years, and there is no reason why this money should not be utilized to build this railway. The Treasurer, in every financial statement submitted by him, has indicated that the peak of the Customs revenue had been reached, and was certain to fall.","Second Reading","NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I suppose that most Australians are anxious to receive as much as possible in reparations from Germany, but, like the Leader of the Opposition, I am rather apprehensive as to the form which these reparations will take. If the arrangement is made that we are to receive goods, I trust that goods of a kind that are not manufactured in Australia will be sent. I hope that we shall be able to exercise some discrimination in this matter. If goods of a kind that are manufactured in Australia are -sent here by Germany, our .own industries, will suffer seriously. I should like to .know whether such .goods would come through the British Government, which, as the principal party concerned, may receive all the reparation payments, and afterwards distribute to the dominions their respective proportions; or whether they would come to us direct from Germany. Whether they came direct or through the British Government, would they be dutiable like ordinary imports? These are aspects of the reparations problem which an alert Treasurer, and particularly an alert Minister for Trade and Customs, should be watching. Although the Treasurer is inclined to place a halo around his head for having made the Commonwealth Bank, as he says.. ' a bank of banks,' I wish, to remind him that, iu consequence of the present policy of its board of management, the Bank is making only very small contributions to our national debt sinking fund. Had it been permitted to carry on its business .om similar lines to those adopted by other banks, its profits would have been .much greater .than they have, been in the last few months. We have to remember that while Parliament provided that half the profits of the Bank should be paid into the national debt sinking fund, ait has since practically crippled the Bank .as a profit-making institution. I cannot understand why the Treasurer always hesitates to give credit to two institutions which, have made considerable payments! to the national debt sinking fund. One of these is the Commonwealth. Bank, and the other is the Notes Issue Board. The latter authority pays something like £1,100,000 annually into the fund.","Second Reading","NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Subsequently, by the turn of the political wheel,- he became Commonwealth Treasurer, and on one occasion he was able to make the pleasing announcement in this House that he had discharged from the accumulated profits of the Notes Issue Fund a loan of £7,750,000 which had become due. Had the Commonwealth Bank and the Notes Issue Board been, permitted to work according to the intentions of their founders, we should have been able in time practically to cease contributing, from the general revenue to the national debt sinking fund. I trust that when more prosperous times arrive, we shall increase the 10s. per cent, payments to the national debt sinking fund that have been provided for. I shall take every opportunity that presents itself to protest against the way in which the Commonwealth Bank lias been crippled as a profitmaking institution.

I do not desire to suggest anything, that will lessen the value of our notes;, but I know that business men frequently complain that insufficient currency is available. I believe that the Treasurer wishes to do what is best in the interests of the Commonwealth; but I ask whether he considered the wisdom of using these reparations payments as backing for an additional issue of notes?

Those portions of the reparations payments which cannot be paid in cash, but which must be paid in kind, may involve goods which Germany cannot export at present. Credits will be given in regard to them, to be adjusted later. We shall be able to use whatever credits are made available in London to meet our own London payments. These remarks, of course, answer the questions asked by the honorable member for South Sydney (Mr. E. Riley). If gold had been sent to this country it would only have been paid out by the Commonwealth for some definite service, in which case there' would be no inflation. But if notes were issued against it at the rate of £4 for every sovereign, there would be an inflation, of the currency, which would lead to increased prices, and lessened effective value of wages, and so a vicious circle would be set up. While our local holdings of gold against the note-issue only need be in the ratio of one sovereign to four £l-notes, I am glad to. say that, roughly, we hold one sovereign against every £2 in notes in circulation, or 48 per cent, in gold of the value of the notes issued. I should like to see the reserve made even stronger, because a time may come when it will be necessary to issue additional notes for some temporary purpose. If our holding of gold against the note3 already issued is substantial we should be able, in such circumstances, to issue additional notes without danger. Honorable members must recognize that we cannot safely increase the issue of notes unless we create more wealth; in other words, we must increase our production before we can safely increase our notes- issue. That is the only way in which we can keep prices stable, and ensure that the working man's wages shall be effective,' and without change in value.  As to the profits of the Commonwealth Bank, I point out that the bank was able to make huge profits during the war, and immediately afterwards, for the reason that it then held very large sums of Commonwealth loan money. Frequently large amounts were in it3 hands for many months, and it was able to use them without paying interest on them. Practically all our war borrowing has ceased since 1921. The bank is now only dealing with what are essentially its on funds. Sometimes the balance of Commonwealth money available to it is large, and sometimes it is small. The bank, of course, usually has a pretty good idea when the money will be required by the Government. That is' one reason why the profits are actually smaller than formerly. There is another reason why the published profits and the profits that are being divided between the bank's general reserves and the Commonwealth Sinking Fund are smaller. The present governor and the board of the bank, after the board's appointment, examined the position, and decided that the bank ought to hold a special reserve against the risk of losses on certain kinds of business. They consulted me and the Auditor-General as to whether it was competent for them to establish that special class of reserve, and they are now building up a reserve that will enable the bank to function with its possible losses covered much more than it has done hitherto. The fact that £100,000 or so less is being paid into the sinking fund is, to my mind, much less important than the securing of the utmost stability of the bank. The Leader of the Opposition (Mi'. Charlton) again emphasized this morning his views on the public debt. I said last night that, in my opinion, Australia should not borrow more money than we have the productive capacity to use, and that, if we borrowed more money than the increase in our population or of the labour available in this country would justify, we could not get more work done unless we increased mechanical power, or the number of hands available. That statement i3 generally true. In the ordinary course of things there must be a certain amount of unemployment, due to the uncertainties of ordinary business life, but the restriction of borrowing within the limits I suggest would tend to minimize it. The honorable gentleman said that- that would, only keep the public debt at the present rate per head of population. I admit that the present per capita rate is high, and I should like to see it much lower. One way to lower it is to secure as many migrants as possible. Our public debt, per head of population, however, is not stationary. The borrowing of State Governments during the last few years has increased the per capita debt considerably. Last year I brought forward a proposal to be discussed at the Loan Council to reduce the loan proposals to an amount that would ensure that there would be no increase in the debt per head of population, which would mean that the total annual interest bill would remain about £20,000,000. Although it is more desirable to reduce the debt per head, it would still be a good thing if we could at least keep it stationary. To do so has been the constant endeavour of this Government. The Leader of the Opposition asked for certain information bearing upon the statement I made last night as to the net debt of the Commonwealth. I agree with him that the gross figures as published by the Commonwealth Statistician, and generally by others who make statements on the subject, are misleading, because some of the debt is duplicated, being attributed to both the Commonwealth and the states. This duplication amounts to £60,000,000 or £70,000,000. In every budget speech, however, since 1922. at any rate, the position has been made quite clear. The right honorable the Prime Minister, when he was Treasurer in 1922, pointed out in his budget speech that the gross debt was £416,000,000, and he explained that from that total the indebtedness of the states to the Commonwealth in respect of loans raised by the' Commonwealth on their behalf in the early part of the war, and loans made by the Commonwealth to them on account of land settlement, should be deducted. That deduction makes a considerable diminution of the net debt of the Commonwealth. Next year it will be necessary to deduct a sum of £10,800,000 that the Common wealth raised for the states, and for which they have given us bonds, and arc finding both interest and sinking fund. This is a Commonwealth stock, but it is essentially a state debt. Events have indicated that the states will honour their obligations, for although they sometimes dispute the amounts charged on certain items they have always paid. The relations between the Commonwealth and the states in (hat regard have been entirely satisfactory, and I believe will remain so. No Government could afford to repudiate its debts.","Second Reading","NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I have said that the net national debt of the Commonwealth on the 30th June, 1922, was £341,000,000, and that on the 30th June, 1924- or two years later - it was £335,000,000, that is £6.000,000 less. During the years 1922-23 and 1923-24 the sum of £7,000.000 was spent on reproductive works, and that money is included in the second total of £335,000,000. That expenditure is earning more than the interest payable on it. and did not increase the dead weight of public debt. I am very glad that the honorable member for Bourke has enabled me to make that quite plain to the House, and to have it recorded in Hansard. If honorable members will recall what has been done in the conversion of our war loans, they will see that I have correctly stated the position. About £40,000,000 of war loan money fell due in 1923. This  Government paid to the public that £40,000,000 in September, 1923, but we issued only £32,000,000 of stock, £8,000,000 of the loan not being re-issued. In 1924 a Avar gratuity loan was issued. We paid to the gratuity-holders £13,000,000, and Ave issued new stock to the amount of only £11,000,000. When this Government took office £72,000,000 was owing to the public for repayment this year, but now only £65,000,000 is owing. Let me conclude my speech by explaining the last method by which the public debt has been reduced. We have a sinking fund operating in respect of the British Avar debt, whereby, in two years, that debt has been reduced by £2,290,000 in all. If honorable members will add those figures together they will see clearly what has been taken off the dead weight of debt that earns nothing. On the other hand, we have expended about £7,000,000 on reproductive works, and that money is earning interest. In the two years from 30th June, 1922. to 30th June, 1924, there has been a definite reduction of the real net debt of the Commonwealth by £6,000,000. The Leader of 'the Opposition raised the question of the sinking fund. There is a great difference between the sinking fund now in existence and that created by Mr. Speaker when he was Treasurer. He made a very notable effort to pay off the public debt by a process of simple interest payments at the rate- of 10s. per cent. The present sinking fund explained in the budget speech of the Prime Minister, and subsequently by me in introducing the Sinking Fund Bill, is a fund built up on a compound interest basis, and it will automatically extinguish the debt in 50 years. We make no claim that this sinking fund is extraordinary or novel, but we claim that it is extraordinary in the history of the Commonwealth to reduce taxation and debt at the same time. That is a record of which few Governments in this country can boast, and one for which the people will give this Government credit. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and reported from committee without amendment or debate; report adopted.

The tendency nowadays is for the interest' rates to be reduced. In many actions unsuccessful litigants may be unable to' satisfy judgments of the court owing to their financial position, and they should not be penalized on account of their unfortunate predicament. Perhaps on looking, closely into the matter the Prime Minister will agree to reduce the interest rate. :- The bill deals only with a defect that has been discovered in the' act of 1921. Parliament then deliberately decided, after full consideration of the matter, to provide for the payment of interest at the rate of 7 per cent. I cannot accept any amendment in the direction suggested by the honorable member.","N/A","HIGH COURT PROCEDURE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I am sorry that this measure is brought on so hurriedly. I have not had time to study it properly or to get the views of those engaged in the sugar industry on it. It is undeniable that substantial benefits will follow from the successful establishment in Australia of the manufacture of power alcohol. The industry is one which should be most attractive to honorable members, no matter from which state they may come or to which party they may belong. The petrol used to-day in Australia comes to us from other countries. Australia depends for its supply of petrol almost exclusively upon imports, and we pay something like £7,000,000 per annum for approximately 70,000,000 gallons of petrol imported. We have to recognize the position in which Australia would be placed if the world's supply of motor spirit were to give out, or if, in the event of war, the supplies we require, to the extent of from 60,000,000 to 80,000,000 gallons a year, were cut off. As Australians, we should strive to establish this industry in our own country on a sound basis. This is the first concrete proposal brought forward with that object in view, though suggestions have at times been received from different men concerning the manufacture of power alcohol in Australia, but nothing practical has been done. I must at this juncture give credit to Mr. Theo- doro, the ex-Premier of Queensland, who, when last in England, discussed this matter very fully with Mr. Board, the representative of the International Sugar and Alcohol Company Limited. At the instigation of Mr. Theodore, Mr. Board visited Australia with a view to inquiring personally into the manufacture of power alcohol in this country. When addressing a meeting of sugar-growers in Brisbane in February last, he gave credit to Mr, Theodore in this connexion in the following terms : -","Second Reading","POWER ALCOHOL BOUNTY BELL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Queensland Government has since granted the loan, or has made a promise to do so when called upon. In February of last year Mr. Theodore wrote a letter to the Federal Government to bring under the notice of the Minister concerned the fact that Mr. Board was in Australia, and expressing a wish that the Commonwealth Government would assist him in any way possible. I am pleased to see that the matter has been taken up by the Minister for Trade and Customs. While I can give general support to the bill he has introduced, I disapprove of certain of its details. My objections to the measure will be stated more fully when we reach the committee stage of the bill. At this juncture I meant to make it clear that I believe the bounty should not be limited to £5,000, which will only cover 300,000 gallons, and furthermore, it should be paid on power alcohol made from molasses. I think that more consideration than is proposed must be given to the growers of cassava, which, according to the Minister, will be the chief crop utilized in the manufacture of power alcohol, although there will also be available for the purpose about 125,000 tons of molasses per annum. Under clause 10 it is provided that-","Second Reading","POWER ALCOHOL BOUNTY BELL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","155","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","I consider that provision should be made in the bill giving the. Minister power to withhold the whole or any part of the bounty unless he is satisfied that the growers of the crop used in the manufacture of power alcohol are given a price based on the cost of its production. I trust that members of the Country party and certain other honorable members opposite will be prepared to support such a condition for the payment of the bounty. For too long a time assistance has been given to manufacturers and wealthy companies without definite provision having been made for a price based upon the cost of their production to be paid to the growers of the materials used in manufacture. I know, through traversing the country districts of Queensland where sugar is grown, that one of the chief causes of anxiety for the success of this scheme is that the sugar-growers will not grow cassava at the price which they are likely 'to be asked to accept for it, namely, 19s. 6d. per ton. They say that such a price would not pay them, and they demand that the price they will be paid shall be based upon the cost of production. The Minister pointed out that it is proposed tinder the bill to give a bounty of 2d. per gallon to enable the distillers to pay the farmer an additional price for his crop; Id. per gallon to cover the cost of denaturing the alcohol; and Id. per gallon to be kept in hand by the company for payment to the farmers in the event of the price they have received being below the cost of production of the special crop selected for conversion into power alcohol. While I am glad to see the bill introduced, and have no desire to hinder its passage beyond widening its scope to include molasses, I recognize that the interests of the people in my electorate who will be growing cassava must be safeguarded. I hope that honorable members on both sides will lend their assistance to secure this. I think that at least 3d. per gallon should be granted to the farmer as an additional price for his crop. I understand that from 1 ton of cassava 39 gallons of power alcohol can be manufactured. It is considered that the highest price that can be paid for cassava without a bounty is 19s. 6d. per ton. Twopence per gallon on 39 gallons would amount to 6s. 6d., and that amount added to 19s. 6d. would bring the price to be paid to the grower of cassava up to £1 6s. per ton. Without a bounty it is considered that power alcohol could not be manufactured from cassava if the grower were granted any price higher than 19s. 6d. per ton. The Queensland Minister of Agriculture ( Mr. Forgan Smith), in a statement, definitely asserted that the cost of producing a ton of cassava is £1 7s. 2d., as against £1 17s. 2d.; the cost of producing a ton of sugar cane. Certainly the farmers will not be satisfied with anything less than the cost of production, and according to the figure quoted by Mr. Forgan Smith a bonus at the rate of 2d. per gallon would not be sufficient to cover that. I think the farmer should be assisted by giving a bonus of 3d. per gallon, that will enable £1 9s. 3d. per ton to be paid to the grower; but this is a matter which can be settled when we get into committee. I know only too well the conditions prevailing in the sugar industry of Queensland when the milling companies were able to dictate to the sugar-growers the price they should accept for their cane. They fixed it as low as 10s. per ton, whilst to-day the average price paid throughout Queensland is 47s. per ton. This advance in the price paid for sugar cane is largely clue to the action of the Queensland Government in establishing cane price boards on which there are representatives of the sugar-growers and the millers, with an independent chairman.","Second Reading","POWER ALCOHOL BOUNTY BELL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/para[2]","N/A","N/A"

More consideration than is proposed in the bill must be given to the growers of cassava. A bounty of 4d. per gallon should not be paid to a wealthy company unless attached to it is the definite condition that at least 3d. per gallon shall be paid to the growers of cassava. Moreover no monopoly should be given to any one company. The Minister for Trade and Customs said that under this measure no bounty will be paid in respect of power alcohol manufactured from molasses, and that he had received no request for such a bounty. At the present time I am awaiting information from the sugar interests of Queensland in regard to the matter, and when the bill is in committee I hope to be able to reply to that statement. As the bill was introduced only to-day, I have not been able to get a reply to my inquiries. The Minister stated, also, that the sugar mills in Queensland ask for a bounty only on power alcohol manufactured from cassava, sweet potatoes, or arrowroot. My opinion is that the bounty should apply to alcohol produced from molasses, because it is useless to deny that on account of over-production the sugar industry in Queensland is not in. a flourishing condition. Honorable members opposite may laugh at that statement, but they know nothing about the sugar industry. They believe all the misleading statements by Mrs. Glencross and others. I cannot understand why any honorable member should object to the Commonwealth paying a bounty of £5,000 per annum, or more, in order to establish the power alcohol industry.","Second Reading","POWER ALCOHOL BOUNTY BELL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If we pay to the grower of cassava a price based on the cost of production, sufficient of the plant will be grown to supply an additional crop to all the distilleries that may undertake the production of power alcohol in  Queensland. The Minister rightly stated that this is merely an experiment. If it proves successful, many distilleries will be established throughout Queensland, and, as the company represented by Mr. Board is prepared to invest £50,000 in the industry, and the Queensland Government is willing to lend £25,000, this Parliament should not hesitate to grant a bounty of £5,000 per annum. Unfortunately, that is not enough, and I think it would be wise if the whole matter were referred to the Institute of Science and Industry for report.

We hope that when Inspector Brookes returns from Java he will be able to instruct the farmers of Queensland in regard to the cultivation of this crop. It is estimated that the average yield will be from 8 to 12 tons per acre, and that 1 ton of cassava will produce about 39 gallons of power alcohol. One ton of sugar cane yields from 20 to 22 gallons of power alcohol, whereas 1 ton of molasses produces about 65 gallons of 95 per cent, power alcohol. From every ton of sugar cane about 5 cwt. of molasses is obtained. The estimated cost of producing sugar cane is £1 17s. 2d. per ton, and as it is estimated that the company will not be able to pay more than 10s. per ton for cane to be utilized in the manufacture of power alcohol, it is obvious that cane cannot possibly be grown for that purpose at the price mentioned. The estimated cost of producing a ton of cassava is £1 7s. 2d., and it is twice as valuable for producing power alcohol as is sugar cane. The entire molasses yield from the 1925-6 crop will be about 110,000 tons, which would- produce 7,200,000 gallons of 95 per cent, power alcohol, equal to about 17 per cent, of the present requirements of Australia. Molasses is produced in Queensland over an area 800 miles in length, and it will be impossible for the whole of it to be distilled at the Plane Creek mills at Sarina. Therefore, only so much as is produced in the vicinity of Mackay, estimated at between 10.000 and 15,000 tons, will be utilized.  A considerable acreage of cassava will have to be grown for the manufacture of power alcohol.

Even adding them on, they reached a maximum of 22 gallons per ton of cane, with the tops-say 20 gallons for convenience in calculating, and they would find the expense of the raw material thus used would be 2s. per gallon of alcohol. Adding on the other costs already enumerated, they would have to sell the spirit made from sugar cane at 3s. 9d. per gallon, which, of course, was impossible, unless they could get the Government to grant a bonus of 2s. per gallon on the product. Even with cane at 30s. per ton the cost of raw material would run out at ls. 6d. per gallon of spirit, which was three times the cost that they could afford to pay, and sell at 2s. 3d.

Baw sugar in North Queensland contains 46 gallons of alcohol to the ton, equal to 19.2 gallons per ton of cane. In the manufacture of sugar 580 lb. of molasses are produced, which contain 65 gallons of alcohol per ton,' equal to 2.2 gallons pelton of cane, a total of 21.4 gallons. This is worked out on cane containing 14 per cent, of cane sugar. Cane testing 15 per cent, of cane sugar gives a return of 23 gallons.  On the Minister's own figures, taking cane at 20 gallons, it is worth 45s. a ton of cane on the basis of 50,000 tons of molasses to 750,000 tons of cane treated in conjunction. Six shillings and fivepence a ton of cane, plus the suggested 4d. a gallon bonus, equal to 9s. Id. on the total spirit from combined treatment of cane and molasses, is equal to £3 0s. 6d. a ton of cane. If the Government cares to hold an open inquiry in the North it will be proved to them that at the above prices a farmer can be paid fully 40s. a ton, and as there is a surplus of over 1,000,000 tons in sight for 1925, and half as much again for 1926, that will be treated at a loss of over £2,000,000, if treated at all.

This proposed industry will no doubt remain for some time in the experimental stages, and we cannot hope for any extensive results until the next eighteen months or two years. I ask the Minister to make more adequate provision in clause 18 to safeguard the interests of the growers of cassava. I am told that it cannot be grown for less than £1 7s. 2d. a ton, and that the highest price that the' company can pay for it is 19s. 6d. a ton. This price, even with the bounty of 2d., will not return to the growers the cost of production. I also invite the Minister's attention to sub-clause 3 of clause 13, in which it states that every person who claims a bounty payable under the act shall, in making his claim, certify to the Minister the conditions of employment and the rates of wages paid to any labour employed by him other than the labour of members of his family. In arriving at the cost of production, provision should be made for the payment of a fair wage to every member of a family working on a farm. If the bounty is applied to molasses, I can see in the proposal a means of assisting very substantially the Queensland sugar industry. Sugar mills which mow work four or five months in the year will be utilized for the remainder of the year in the manufacture of power alcohol. This will mean employment for thousands of men in Queensland, and also will keep m Australia the £7,000,000 that is sent overseas every year for petrol supplies.

One reason why I ask honorable members to support the bill with certain amendments is that the Queensland sugar industry will receive a decided benefit at times when it is threatened with an over-production of sugar and low prices. The molasses obtained from 15,000 tons of sugar cane produced in the vicinity of Plane Creek Sugar Mill will be utilized within the next twelve months in the manufacture of power alcohol. A number of small growers in the Carmila district, near Sarina, would be able to grow cassava if they were assured of a reasonable return just above the cost of production. Of the 4,604 sugar-growers in Queensland, 3,394 grew less than 500 tons of cane each last year; 712 grew between 500 tons and 1,000 tons each; and only 498 grew more than 1,000 tons each. ' As the profit on production is only about 10s. per ton, 4,106, or S9 per cent., of these growers only earned about £250 each last year. That cannot be called an excessive income. The sugar-growers, if it were made payable, would gladly cultivate cassava to supplement their earnings. In the 1923^24 season 77 per cent, of the cane grown in Queensland was produced by BritishAustralian growers. It will be seen, therefore, that the industry is largely in the hands of British or Australian-born people. If this power alcohol proposition develops it will give a valuable fillip to the sugar industry. Every honorable member can unhesitatingly support the bill, particularly if he is opposed to the importation of sugar from black labour countries, where the wage is about ls. per day. It is less than that in Java, and in Europe it is about £1 per week. I confidently expect honorable members who believe in supporting Australian industry to vote for this bill.","Second Reading","POWER ALCOHOL BOUNTY BELL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[13]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If its purpose is achieved, not only Queensland but the whole of Australia will be benefited. The .measure should bo particularly beneficial to the Queensland sugar districts. Honorable members know that one of the difficulties of the sugar industry which explains, to some extent, the high wages that prevail in it, is that it provides only seasonal employment for the workers. The introduction of a new industry into the north of Queensland which would result in the workers being employed for the full twelve months, would accomplish a great amount of good. I understand that the company which proposes to establish the power alcohol industry in Queensland intends to work in conjunction with the proprietors of an existing sugar mill. They hope, eventually, to go so far as to secure complete control of trie mills. They purpose using those portions of the sugar-milling machinery which are suitable for handling cassava in the period of the year when the mills are not crushing cane. The honorable member for Capricornia (Mr. Forde) seems to - be fearful that the price proposed to be paid for cassava would be insufficient to meet the cost of production, and leave a fair margin of profit to the growers. I point out to him and to other honorable members that it is anticipated that at least 500 gallons of power alcohol will be produced from a single acre of cassava. It is also estimated that 39 gallons of power alcohol may be obtained from a ton of cassava. The honorable member for Capricornia suggested that 19s. 6d. would have to be the minimum allowed as the cost of production per ton, and the Minister took 20s. 7d. as the figure. I have taken the average of those two figures, and allowed 20s. per ton. The grower would average a return of 12 tons of cassava to the acre. At 20s. oer ton his return would be £12 per acre, and the proposed bounty of 2d. per gallon, taking 39 gallons as the product of a ton, and 12 tons to an acre, would make his gross return £15 18s. an acre. Allowing £7 an acre for working expenses, which , I think, would be a fair thing, his net return would be about £818s. or £9 per acre. I am sura that that would be sufficient to induce the people of north Queensland to devote a portion of their land to the cultivation of cassava. This by-product crop would be very useful to the sugar industry. I have no doubt that if this scheme is as successful as we hope hundreds of thousands of acres in the sugar belt of North Queensland will be put under cassava. Cassava, of course, is only one crop that is useful for the production of power alcohol. A very much greater return than 39 gallons to the ton can be obtained from some other crops. Grain sorghum, for instance, yields as high as 87 gallons to the ton. Victoria is at present producing a certain amount of grain sorghum on an experimental basis, so we have evidence that it can be grown here. Wheat, barley, and maize would also produce power alcohol. Eighty-five gallons to the ton can be obtained from maize, but as only about1s. l3/4d. per bushel could be paid for maize for this purpose there is no prospect of producing maize for power alcohol purposes on a commercial basis. The same thing can be said of wheat, which would produce. 83 gallons to the ton. But1s. l3/4d. per bushel for wheat for that purpose is out of the question. Sweet potatoes are also useful for the production of power alcohol. I trust that the bill will receive sympathetic consideration. I must remind the Minister, however, that while he is giving with one hand he is taking away with the other. He is proposing a bounty of 3d. per gallon for power alcohol made from certain starch-producing products but the distillers are compelled to pay more than 3d. per gallon in denaturing costs, and in expenses they are put to under the excise regulations. From time to time requests have been made for a modification of our excise regulations and denaturing requirements. We, in Australia, are in the unenviable position of having the highest and most stringent excise regulations in the world. Great Britain,  France, the United States of America, and other countries, have modified their denaturing conditions, and I suggest that the Minister for Trade and Customs should examine the position with a view to altering our standards. It seems to me to be an unwise policy for the Government to lay a heavy burden on the manufacturers of power alcohol. I hope that later on the Government will introduce a bill for the purpose of increasing the bounty payable for the production of benzine from our oil shales. Although the present bounty has been available for some years the fact that the oil-shale industry has not grown is proof positive that there is something wrong. Between the value of the two industries - the production of power alcohol from cultivated crops and the production of benzine and oils from shale - there is no comparison. Power alcohol produced from crops is only a substitute for petrol, but in times of stress this country will sorely need local supplies of lubricating oils and heavy fuel oils, which cannot be obtained from root crops. I suggest to the Minister that he should carry on the good work he has started, and bring before the House a bill to foster what may be termed the infant industry, although it has been established for a number of years, of obtaining benzine, fuel, and crude oils from our shale deposits.

If the Minister can show that I am wrong in these statements, I am prepared to apologize to Mr. Story publicly and frankly. On the other hand, if the Minister is wrong, and has misled the House, I think an apology is due from him to the House. My information i3 so. substantiated that I suspect an attempt is being made to sidetrack the charges I have made, just as the charges made by Brigadier-General Elliott in another place were sidetracked. I think honorable members will agree that Brigadier-General Elliott would not make statements in another place for personal gratification or from spleen. His reputation should, at least, have given whatever charges he made the hall-mark of sincerity; yet they were sidetracked by misstatements and by a perversion of the facts. I refer the Minister to Brigadier-  General W. , Ramsay McNicol for proof of my charge in regard to the conduct of Mr. Story at the battle of Messines. No soldier would doubt the qualifications and integrity of such a distinguished officer as he was. General McNicol is now in Goulburn, New Souh Wales, and I have not been in communication with him, either by word or in writing. I appreciate the action of the honorable member for Bendigo (Mr. Hurry) in rushing to the assistance of a fellow soldier. It stands to the credit of his battalion - the' 38th - that it took the first objective at the battle of Messines; but, as Major Story's battalion was allotted the last objective, I fail to see how the honorable member for Bendigo could have had first-hand knowledge of how Major .Story failed to hold the last objective.","German National Currency - Inaccurate Newspaper Report - Major Story - Labour for Canberra - League or Nations","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I think the honorable member will give those I have named the credit of being honorable men, who would not cause statements to be made concerning a fellow officer unless there was some truth in them. I hope the Minister will lay the files on the table.

It had not been the practice in the past to approach the Department of Labour and Industry in all cases where employees wore required for the Federal Capital, but the commission adopted the policy of notifying that department; and in the specific case under notice application was made to the Department of Labour and Industry, but it was unable to provide urgently the assistance required. Inquiries had been made, in addition, through other channels - with successful results The advertisement quoted as appearing in the Sydney Morning Herald was not authorized by the commission, and the commission did not pay any fee to Miss Layard's agency in respect to the engagement of any employee. Miss Layard evidently inserted the Advertisement as a matter of .business, bear ing that inquiries were being made on tha commission's behalf. It will %e seen, therefore, that the Government Bureau has not been overlooked, and no practice has been established of utilizing private agencies to the .exclusion of the Bureau, as implied in the parliamentary reference.- The commission will continue to use the resources of the Department of Labour and Industry as far as possible, but. obviously, it cannot!be expected to confine its inquiries to one source, as this might often cause delay and inconvenience.","German National Currency - Inaccurate Newspaper Report - Major Story - Labour for Canberra - League or Nations","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/quote/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

In the interests of honest administration in the Northern Territory the file asked for should be placed on the Library table. Since the accuracy of the Ministerial statement has been challenged, the full facts should be made known to honorable members.  I was under the impression that the appointment of the delegation from Australia .to .the League <o£ Nations Assembly at Geneva was to be a non-party matter. We were told twelve months ago thai the Leader of the Opposition {Mr. Charlton) had been appointed a delegate in pursuance of that policy, but this year the Government lias -made appointments of a distinctly party character. Owing .to the difficulty of the Nationalist and Country parties in Western Australia somebody, we are told, had to retire from the Senate, and we were informed recently that Senator Drake-Brockman was willing to efface himself in the interests of his party. Now it transpires that he has been appointed a member of the delegation to Geneva. I venture to say that too honorable senator knew that he was to be selected, and that a promise from the Government prompted his retirement. Then we are told that Mr George Swinburne^ a discredited Nationalist politician, who was defeated at the last federal election, has also been chosen. Mr. Swinburne would also be in the way when the time came to select four Nationalist candidates to contest the next Senate election for Victoria. That gentleman is now out of the way.
