Yesterday, there was a meeting between Mr. Hanlon and representatives of the unions involved in the present industrial trouble in Queensland. T do not think that I ought to discuss the details because they come within the province of Mr. Hanlon, the Queensland Government and the Queensland Arbitration Court. The report of the Minister was to the effect that, in his opinion, some progress was being made in the negotiations, if I may put it that way, but there is not likely to be any further conference until to-morrow morning, as union meetings are being held this morning, also a meeting of the State parliamentary Labour party which, presumably, will discuss the situation. As I have said, the matter is within the province of the Queensland Government, and I do not intend to intrude except in a friendly manner, and when I think I may be of some help. So far as I can remember Mr. Hanlon has made three requests of the Australian Government in connexion with the dispute, and each of them has been granted. The day before yesterday I received a telegram from Mr. Hanlon stating that certain areas in Queensland were short of food, because floods were preventing trains and road transport from, getting through. I discussed the matter with the Minister for Air, who has done whatever was physically possible to make aeroplanes available to carry food to those areas. The arrangements are in his hands, and he probably could say more on the subject than I can at the moment. The point is that the aeroplanes are being used to carry foods to areas which have been cut off because of floods.","TRANSPORT SERVICES","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[1]/answer[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We believe that in order to provide proper medical services for the people and to enable medical practitioners to enjoy reasonable hours of work, instead of having, as so many of them do, to work unduly long hours day and night, a greatly increased number of medical practitioners is required. In addition, it is a part of the Government's plan to encourage, in co-operation with the States, a campaign for the elimination of tuberculosis. Proposals to that end will be placed before State Ministers for Health at an early date by the Minister for Health and .Social Services. That opens up a wide field for the employment of medical practitioners and it is anticipated that greatly increased numbers will be actively employed upon it. We hope that when the Government's health scheme is in operation medical practitioners will be able to carry out their work with much more convenience to themselves and will not have to work excessively long hours.","MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[2]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","91","ABBOTT, Joseph","JLL","N/A","N/A","N/A","429","I am being jeered and laughed at by supporters of the Government for bringing the condition of this small primary industry before the Parliament, but I regard the matter as a very serious one. I remind honorable members that the net value of the industry's production in 1944-45 was £14,800,000. Tt is an industry which affords an opportunity to people of small means to embark upon primary production, an opportunity which they would not otherwise have. Many thousands of farmers were enabled to enter the field of primary production because only a small amount of capital is required to become a poultryfarmer. That is another reason why the poultry industry is of great importance and should be encouraged by every means possible.  The sale of eggs within Australia is controlled by State marketing boards, but the export of eggs and egg products is under the direction of the Australian Government. Therefore, I propose to direct my remarks in the main to the recent contract made between the British and Australian Governments for the export of eggs to Great Britain during the next three years. That contract contains a provision whereby the export of eggs to Great Britain may continue for a further period of two years after expiration of the contract following a review of its operation. Details of the contract were released by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr. Pollard) in a statement which he made to the press on the 9t.h February last, and I propose to recall some of those u.tails in order that honorable members may 'understand the criticism of that contract which I shall offer. The existing contract was to operate until the 30th June, 195.0, but it will now terminate on the 30th June of this year. The new contract will cover the period from then to the season of 1952-53. The object of the contract, as stated in the Minister's announcement, is to encourage a large increase in the production of eggs in Australia for export purposes, by increasing the price paid to poultry-farmers of Australia by 3d. a dozen. The contract envisages yearly progressive increases, commencing in 1948-49, in order to reach a target increase of 3,500,000 cases. If the output of the industry is not expanded by an average of 2,250,000 cases a year by 1950-51, the British Ministry of Food may call for a revision of the quantities it is committed to accept. According to the Minister's statement, the increase in poultry flocks required by 1952-53 is 5,500,000 birds. The prices shown in the contract apply to the seasons 1948-49, 1949-50 and '1950-51- further negotiations may be entered into for an alteration of the price in the remaining two years. The prices are based on sterling, free on hoare! at port of shipment. The price for eggs in shell is 2s. 4d. a dozen. This sale was apparently made by the Minister by virtue of the authority vested in him by the Egg Export Control Act 1947. That act says that the Australian Egg Board, subject to any directions of the Minister, shall have the power to sell eggs purchased in accordance with section 13 (e) (i). The poultry-farmers complain that no notice was taken of the representations made by their representatives on that board! The price of 2s. 4d. a dozen for eggs includes the cost of oiling them, and the packing period is to extend from the 1st June to the 24th December, in each year. The poultry-farmers strongly criticize this contfa.pt. They say that, because of the low price offered, the increased production will not be achieved. That view is supported by a statement in a letter' written by the New South. 'Wales Egg Board. It should be borne in mind that New South Wales produces 40 per cent, to 45 per cent, of the total quantity nf eggs produced in Australia and is the greatest egg exporting State of the Commonwealth. In a letter to the Australian Poultry Farmers Association the members of . the New South Wales Egg Board stated that they took advantage of the opportunity afforded to meet Mr. J. Peacock and Dr. Brookes of the British Ministry of Food, that they advised those gentlemen of the conditions obtaining in the poultry industry in New South Wales, and made it perfectly clear that a considerable increase of the existing contract rate was necessary to ensure an adequate increase in egg production. I propose to i nf onn the House of some of the difficulties with which poultry-farmers are faced. The administrative costs of the Australian Egg Board amount to £d. a dozen, the increased price of food amounts to ltd. a dozen, whilst the maximum cost of oiling the eggs is Id. a dozen. That absorbs the whole of the increase of 3d. a dozen alleged to have been given to the poultry-farmers. That brings the price back to 2s. Id. the same as in the existing contract. In addition, they are faced with increased packing costs and a rise in the prices of bran, pollard and mashes owing to the operation of the 40-hour week. If the number of birds is to be increased to 5,500,000 by 1952-53, the poultry-farmers will have to provide more accommodation, and build more sheds. However, on the prices which they will receive under the contract they will not be able to afford this expenditure. The contract has been drawn in the loosest possible terms. I cannot imagine any private person, while currencies are so unstable as they are at present, making a. long-term contract for payment in the currency of another country when, according to the Prime Minister (Mr. Chifley) himself, there is considerable prospect of that currency being devalued in relation to our own. If our currency approaches closer in value to sterling, the contract which, on the present basis, is not payable,, will result in great hardship to the poultry-farmers. There has been much talk about the difficulty of getting dollars, but all our problems in that respect would be solved if only the American Government were to do what the Australian Government has done, and contract to sell us motor cars and other commodities in terms of Australian currency. I do not think that any government in the world, except the Australian Government, would make such a stupid contract as the one under discussion, especially at a time like this. The contract is for three years' duration, and contains no provision for an adjustment of prices in accordance with variations of the cost of production in Australia. In other words, the price is to remain constant, while costs may vary. With feed costs rising and supplies short, poultry-farmers are faced with ruin during the next three years, and Britain will not get the eggs which it needs. The poultry-farmers have no wish to injure the wheat-farmers, but they claim that the price of eggs should have been fixed at a level which would cover the increased cost of feed which has already taken place, and other increases which art; likely to take place in the future. Australian wheat was sold to New Zealand at a very low price, but the Government, under pressure from honorable members on this side of the House, made up to the wheat-growers the difference between the price to New Zealand and the price at which the wheat could have been sold on the open market. If the hens which produce the eggs that will -be exported under this contract were in Britain, the wheat used to feed them would be sold at 18s. a bushel under the contract with the British Government. Therefore, because the wheat is consumed by hens in Australia, the wheat-farmers should not be deprived of the higher price. It is not right that the wheat farmers should be penalized so that the poultry-farmers may get wheat, at a lower price. The Government should make up the difference to the wheat-growers. There is a precedent for this, because the Government subsidizes the price of wool used in the manufacture of material for home consumption. However, when the cloth is exported, the subsidy is withdrawn, and the full price obtained overseas is paid to the Australian Wool Realization Commission for distribution among the growers. Thu poultry-farmers also complain that, although they have asked time after time to bc placed upon the same footing as poultry-farmers in. other dominions in regard to the price of eggs, this has not been done. For instance, the price of Canadian eggs, spring shipment, sold to Great Britain, is 3s. a dozen Australian, and of the fall shipment, 3s. 4£d. a dozen, which works out at 10£d. a dozen more than the contract price for Australian eggs. Taking into consideration the increased costs, the new contract price is no better than the old one, and the poultry-farmers are bound for three years, without any possibility of an increase. The Minister entered into the contract without even discussing the Katter with the Minister for Supply and Shipping (Senator Ashley). Thus, although the poultry-farmers are expected to provide accommodation for increased flocks, all the material required, such as iron and steel, has been given a number 3 priority only, which makes it practically unobtainable. I again draw attention to what I protested against when the Egg Export Control Bill was before the Parliament. The producers' ownership in their own property is denied to them. The eggs are taken in bulk, and disposed of on ministerial authority, without due regard being paid to the wishes of the producers' boards, which are supposed to control the industry. Ostensibly, the boards are there to give effect to the will of the producers, but, in fact, they are mere marionettes under the control of the Minister. The poultry-farmers work right round the clock, but the eggs are taken under the control of a Minister in a socialist government, which has no sympathy with the primary producers. The Government has entered into a contract to sei] the eggs at a low price. It is, in fact, betraying the trust placed in it by the Government of the United Kingdom, because the Minister must be well aware that the poultry-farmer cannot, on the prices offered, raise the number of hens to produce the eggs which Britain needs.","N/A","POULTRY INDUSTRY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[3]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We all appreciate the importance of the poultry industry to Australia. The honorable member for New England (Mr. Abbott) criticized the contract with the British Government for the sale of eggs. He should realize, however, that if no contract wore entered into at all, and if all the eggs produced in Australia were placed upon the Australian market, the poultry-farmers would not receive for them anything like as much as they are now getting. Honorable members opposite must in justice recognize the fact that unless the Australian poultry industry is able to find an overseas market for a large proportion of its product it will be impossible for poultry-farmers to carry on. I cannot understand the reasoning behind the criticism of the honorable member for New England in relation to this contract for the supply of eggs to the United Kingdom for a period of three years at 2s. 4d. a dozen f.o.b. The people of the United Kingdom, in the last two years particularly, have been willing to pay very fair prices for all their requirements of primary commodities. They have willingly increased the prices paid for their purchases from Australia. I cannot understand the reason for the honorable member's claim that the making of this contract will bring about the ruination of the Australian poultry industry within the next three years. He endeavoured to link up this claim with the price of wheat sold to the poultryfarmer. He says that the poultryfarmer does not want to obtain wheat at; a low price at the expense of the wheat farmer and that the difference between home consumption and export prices should be met by the taxpayers. It is remarkable that honorable members opposite should clamour for the lifting of restrictions, favouring a return to the old system of trade on the basis of supply and demand, while at the same time they should seek to mulct taxpayers in respect of the difference between the export and home-consumption prices for wheat. The honorable gentleman's proposition, as 1 see it, is that the wheat-farmer should obtain the same price for his wheat whether it be sold to a poultry-farmer in Australia or on the export market, and that the difference between the home consumption price and the export price should be made up by the taxpayer.","N/A","POULTRY INDUSTRY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

As recently as three weeks ago a prominent poultry-farmer in my electorate told me that he was unable to obtain wheat for 6s. 6d. a bushel. He said that if he could do so, he would consider himself fairly well oft. He cannot obtain wheat at that price because his poultry farm is not sufficiently large to justify the ordering of wheat by the truck load.

If he has to pay several shillings more than 6.*. 6d. a bushel he suffers great hardship. This contract has been made at a time when the price of wheat is abnormally high. There is no certainty 'that the existing price will be maintained even for .two years. Honorable members opposite have based their criticism of this contract on the false assumption that the price of wheat will remain at its present level indefinitely. At the moment, so great is the need for wheat in Europe, that certain countries are willing to pay almost any price to obtain it. That state of affairs may continue as long as they are able to pay cash for their requirements or to obtain loans from the exporting countries to finance their purchases. I am of opinion that the existing high prices of export foodstuffs will not be maintained during the next three years. In order to judge whether my estimate is sound, honorable members opposite have only to consider the rate at which the proceeds of the American loan to Great Britain have diminished. The dollars secured by Great Britain under the terms of that loan are being expended at three times the anticipated rate. As Great Britain's supply of dollars diminishes and it can no longer supply sterling exchange to other countries, there will be a corresponding falling off in export prices. The price of wheat, in common with other primary commodities, will rapidly decline. In view of that, honorable members opposite will surely 'agree that the Government was wise in making this contract to establish a fixed export price for eggs for the ensuing two years. The contract will, I am sure, be to the advantage and not to the disadvantage of our egg producers. Naturally, the honorable member for New England wants to get all he possibly can for the egg producers in his electorate. Undoubtedly, the big poultry-farmers in his electorate are able to buy wheat in large quantities at 6s. 6d. a bushel.

The Minister said, rightly, that this contract would be the means of greatly expanding the industry. It is anticipated that the industry will double its present export of eggs, whilst, overall, it will involve an increase of over 5,000,000 of the total number of birds. Obviously, such expansion will involve considerable additional capital expenditure; and with that expenditure, of course, producers must run risks. The price stated in the agreement is 2s. 4d. a dozen, and the agreement is to operate for a number of years. The net return to the grower will be approximately 2s.1d. a dozen. Any one familiar with conditions in this industry knows that that price is uneconomical and that growers must continue to produce at a loss. When speaking in this chamber about eighteen months ago I dealt comprehensively with this matter. I showed that the cost of production of eggs at that time was about 2s. 0½d. a dozen. However, costs have increased considerably in the meantime. Whereas wheat at that time was sold to the industry at 6s. a bushel, it is now 7s. 9½d. a bushel. As a poultry-farmer on a small scale myself, I know that it is almost impossible to obtain one's full requirements of offal; hut the price of offal was increased only last year. Whereas, in February, 1947, bran cost £6 3s. 4d. a ton it now costs £8 5s. 3d. a ton, or an increase of 33 per cent. Pollard has always been a very expensive item, and very often it is not worth the cost; but its price has risen from £6 18s. a ton to £10 15s. 6d. a ton, or an increase of 40 per cent. All other items entering into the cost of production, such as wire netting, wood, packing cases and various utensils, have also increased in cost. When the industry is expanding in order to fulfill our commitments under this contract, it will be saddled with the increased capital expenditure reflected in those additional costs. This has been brought about by the fact that this contract has been entered into without due regard to the interests of the industry, and because no approach has been made to those who are aware of the disabilities confronting it. It is extraordinary, although, perhaps, not surprising, that the Minister should have entered into this contract entirely 'off his own bat '. One would have thought that, at least, he would have consulted the Australian Egg Board; but he failed to do so. No approach whatever was made to any representative of the producers. The Minister acted solely on his own initiative; or, if he has taken any advice at all. he has taken it only from officers of his department. Such action on the part of the Minister is not surprising. For instance, when he appointed the Victorian producers' representative on the Australian Egg Board, he acted contrary to the procedure laid down in the Egg Export Control Act.","N/A","POULTRY INDUSTRY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[6]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Consequently, further attempts should be made to remedy the complaints. 1 1 is admitted that the halfpenny referred to by the honorable member for New England (Mr. Abbott) is counter-balanced by many things, but if the 3d. had not been gran'.ed, the poultry-farmers would have been much worse off. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr. Pollard) can detail the costs covered by the halfpenny. They include cold storage and grading. I must say to the Minister, however, that the poultry-farmers have a genuine complaint against, not the Australian Egg Board, but the Egg Marketing Board in New South 'Wales. The Egg Marketing Board should improve the system of transporting eggs from the forais to cold stores pending grading and shipping, which is its responsibility. The poultry-farmers are charged for cartage, but farmers outside the areas that carters contract to serve have to transport their eggs to cold storage at their own cost or to a place where the contract carters will pick them up, notwithstanding that they are levied for the cost of the contract transport service. I have negotiated with the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture and the State Egg Marketing Board on that matter, and arrangements have been made for the picking up of eggs at certain points, but I do not see why some allowance should not be made for the cost incurred by farmers in transporting eggs to the cold stores on the ground that often the eggs are taken a double journey, from the farm to the cold store and then back over the same route to neighbouring hospitals and co-operative stores for sale, which could be served direct by the farmers, as was the practice before legislation was enacted in the State compelling producers to sell their eggs to the Egg Marketing Board. If the previous procedure were reverted to unnecessary cartage would be avoided, with a consequent saving of petrol, which is an important consideration these times when we are so short of dollars. It would also give the farmers a fairer deal than they now receive. In my district, poultry- farmers have been heavily fined for having sold eggs direct to co-operative societies instead of to the Egg Marketing Board. One farmer at Weston, in the  Kurri Kurri district, was fined £25 for one offence. I contrast that with a fine of £5 imposed on a poultry-farmer in Werribee, Victoria, on three similar charges. I concede that the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) made representations on my behalf to the appropriate authority with the result that £20 of the £25 penalty was remitted. I do not see why poultry-farmers at Cessnock should have to send eggs 35 miles to Hexham for cold storage when those eggs have to Jio brought back over the same road to be sold to the mining community. A more convenient arrangement would be to decentralize egg storage. As the Minister knows, another serious complaint of the poultry-farmers is the lack of essential materials. I know men who have been waiting for twelve months or more for the fulfilment of orders for galvanized iron with which to erect hen-houses. They are loosing their flocks because they cannot adequately shelter them, being limited to bagging. The blame for that is not attributable to the Australian Government, because the distribution of materials within the States is under the control of the State governments. I have always believed that to be the wrong policy. Distribution should be finally controlled by the central authority. Under the present system, it is difficult for a State where supplies of materials are inadequate to obtain supplies from other States that may have surplus stocks, whereas, under a central control, that could be easily arranged. The Australian Government has tried to rectify that disability so far as it can within its constitutional powers, but if it had sole control over eggs I believe that the difficulties of the egg industry would disappear. The same trouble arises in every field where administration is shared by the Australian Government and the State Governments. I am sure that the poultry-farmers' disabilities would be removed if control of their industry were uniform. The honorable member for New England, who is trying to make political capital out of the poultry farmers' troubles, supports a party that, although it shared power in the Parliament for many years, did absolutely nothing for them.","N/A","POULTRY INDUSTRY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","140","CORSER, Bernard","K6Q","Wide Bay","N/A","N/A","435",". - This morning, honorable members have an opportunity to discuss, in the interests of the Australian poultry industry, the recent contract signed by the Australian Government and the Government of the United Kingdom for the sale of export eggs or egg products, and whether the terms of the contract can be carried cut by our poultry-farmers. The poultry industry is most valuable to the Australian economy, and is one of our great export difficulties. Many of the difficulties which the industry is now encountering have been caused by Government interference, and refusal to allow poultry farmers to control their own industry. In Queensland, commodity boards are essential, and they are controlled by the producers. One of the principal causes of the difficulties of the poultry industry to-day appears to be that the egg producers do not control the operation of the Australian Egg Board. As the result of government control, the future of this important industry is endangered.  Our principal export market for eggs is the United Kingdom, and members of the British Food Mission, who have been in Australia, have claimed that there is no danger of Australia overproducing eggs for export. They forecast years of good marketing conditions and prices in the United Kingdom. At the same time, they emphasise that quality is essential. Australian experts have stated that a surplus of eggs is sometimes caused, not because of the inability of the United Kingdom to take all our eggs available for export, but because too great a proportion of our egg production is below the export standard. Particularly since World War TI, the United Kingdom has been a most valuable market for our eggs. During the war our armed forces took a substantial percentage of our egg production, and shipping difficulties prevented the export of large quantities. To-day, however, conditions have changed, and members of the British Food Mission urge Australian poultry-farmers to increase egg production. Unfortunately, the Australian Government has adopted the wrong approach. The contract price for export eggs for the next three years is 2s. 4d. sterling a dozen. If sterling falls, the effect will be reflected in lower payments to Australian poultry-farmers. As the honorable member for New England pointed out, certain deductions will be made from this price. They are: - an export charge of |d. by the Australian Egg Board, a charge of Id. for oiling, and lid. representing the increased cost of feed, making a total reduction of 3d. a dozen. I regret that the Australian Government did not secure better terms for this industry, because the representatives of the United Kingdom were prepared to concede to the egg producers of Other countries a substantially higher price than that which Australia agreed to accept. Unfortunately, Australian poultry-farmers and even the Australian Egg Board, it is claimed, had no voice in the fixation of the price. Canadian producers receive lOd. a dozen more than the Australian contract price for their eggs, and, in addition, they will be permitted in 1949 to review the price if they consider that it is too low. But Australian poultry-farmer,?, under this agreement, will be bound by the contract for three years, and in the circumstances they have -justifiable grounds for complaint. If it is not too late, the Australian Government should have further discussions .with the representatives of the United Kingdom, as has been done in connexion with other contracts on other occasions, for the purpose of ascertaining whether a higher price can be obtained for our eggs. Previous speakers have referred to the great difficulty which poultry-farmers are experiencing in obtaining galvanized iron and other building materials required for the expansion of the industry. It is impossible to secure these materials. Poultry-farmers have been allocated priority No. 3, but even those persons with priority No. .1 must wait for a period of six months before they are able to obtain supplies. One honorable member claimed that two years have passed since he lodged an application for certain galvanized materials. Most honorable members know that some of their, constituents have had a similar experience of long delay. The honorable member for Hunter attributed . this to the fact that the Australian Government had handed over to the States the distribution of galvanized materials, and he blamed the States for the delay. That is wrong. The responsibility must rest with the Australian Government in condoning the action of the Communists in regarding to work, or to transport the galvanized materials and the basic materials required in manufacture. Any other reason or excuse for this deliberate ' hold-up ' of production and of the expansion of an important industry must be rejected. 1 sincerely hope that the Government will reconsider this contract. As the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr. Pollard) is doubtless aware, egg producers have scarcely criticized the Government for having agreed to the terms of the contract, and I shall be interested to hear his reply. They also criticized the haste with which the Government nominated a panel of persons from whom ite delegate, or mouth-piece, on the board was chosen. Writing in the Sunraysia Daily on the 19th February last, a poultry-farmer stated that egg producers were receiving such a meagre supply of poultry feed that they were being forced to sell all their birds. He said that a week before ho had had 900 birds. At the time of writing, because of the shortage of feed, ho had reduced his flock to 120 birds, and within the next fortnight he expected that he would be compelled to sell them if adequate supplies of feed were not made available. These conditions are detrimentally affecting the poultry industry in many parts of Australia. The honorable member for Swan (Mr. Hamilton) pointed out that some poultry farmers in Western Australia were selling for 2s. 6d. birds which were worth 10s. each.","N/A","POULTRY INDUSTRY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Whether it is a good contract or not is open to argument. The honorable member for New England (Mr. Abbott) has advanced his views, but T consider that the .whole basis of the difficulty is to be discovered in the history of poultry-farming in Australia, My knowledge of the industry in New South Wales was obtained some years ago in association with my father, and I know that if it were not for assistance given by governments of various political beliefs in the past the industry would have been pushed off the earth long ago. From an analysis of the agreement, which I have read, I believe that poultry-farmers are on a pretty fair _ wicket. If they are hopeful of getting the ' famine ' prices that wheat-growers are receiving to-day, or wish to attempt in their limited industry, to get into the fields where the big money is, such as wool-raising, they should realize that poultry-raising as a general rule must be regarded as a supplementary industry. In America, of course, it is of great importance, being in California second only to the motion picture industry. In Australia, poultry-raising has had a very chequered career, and poultry farmers themselves have contributed in some measure to that state of affairs. Twenty years ago the industry was totally disorganized, but to-day, thanks to government assistance and particularly to the setting up of State egg marketing boards, quite good prices are received by poultry-farmers. We must face the position that when wheat and offal are expensive the poultry-farmer is confronted with considerable difficulties. The fact that consideration has been given to a subsistence rate and a price that will enable poultry-farmers to make a profit is a substantial advance on the days when the industry was left to wilt and die, or to struggle through. The poultry industry is vulnerable in that a glut can be caused by backyard poultry raisers, although in New South Wales, at least, these are now controlled to a certain degree. Generally speaking, egg markets in the past have been poor and poultry-farmers have been the victims of avaricious merchants although the activities of these merchants have now been curbed to some degree by government control. One of the greatest scandals that ever occurred in New South Wales related to the settling of ex-servicemen on poultry farms around Sydney on land which could hardly grow enough feed to support a rooster. Another factor was the high cost of installing modern equipment. Naturally, the scheme failed entirely. Over the years, the ' poultryfarmer himself has been the most apathetic supporter of his own industry. In his view the industry is always in its darkest day, and the future is always dreary. That is a poor attitude to adopt because, in fact, there has been considerable planning in the industry, and I am  Hire that in New South Wales at least, poultry raising wall find an important place in the economy of the nation. I believe that there should be a closer investigation, not so much of the question whether poultry-farmers are paying too much for feed, but of production methods. Undoubtedly, if feed were a little cheaper it would assist the achievement of the laudable ambition of providing more food for Great Britain, but the poultry industry is most vulnerable on the production side. A slight change of wind can cause moult; a scarcity of green feed can put fowls off the lay; and in the past the feeding of smutty wheat to fowls has had serious consequences. The provision of balanced rations and scientific care has been regarded as a rather lady-like avocation, or as coming only within the province of backyard poultry-raisers or retired miners and other workers who have decided to foresake heavy manual labour and live a few miles from a capital city. This view, however, is largely disappearing and the poultry industry has assumed much more stability. But with the question of stability arises the important problem of the future of the industry, and that, in turn, involves considerations such as types of farms now used for poultry raising, the kind of individuals who are running the poultry industry, the influence of backyard poultry-raiser? , and what can be done to combat diseases by scientific methods. As I have said, poultry raising is a Cinderella industry. Why, even in this House, talk about fowls causes a laugh. But this industry already contributes substantially to our national income and is destined, if guided on the right lines, to assume a position of great value in our economy. The honorable member for Now England debated only invalid issues relating to prices. Th, poultry-farmer who consistently complains of the bad deal that he is getting gives no recognition to the organizations that have been created to assist him. Originally, poultry-rakers were a disorganized group of individuals in which the consumers were completely disinterested, but to-day the industry occupies a position of importance in this country. We have solved the problems of where and how to raise better poultry, and of how to ensure the best production of eggs. The establishment of State egg marketing hoards h,i« been Mig salvation of the industry. The fact that the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr. Pollard) and his departmental advisers have interested themselves in securing equitable contracts for Australian egg producers is another indication that the future of poultry-farmers is being watched carefully. In these circumstances, the reading of long-winded statements from local newspapers to the effect that the poultry-farmer is being ruined leaves me quite unmoved. If he is being ruined, it is because of his own inability to organize his industry and to understand, its place in the national economy. Also, it is the most protracted ruination of which I have ever heard. For the last 25 years I have been hearing that the poultry industry in this country is going out of existence; but statistics show that as one poultryfarmer leaves the industry another takes his place. With the exception of perhaps 40 or 50 poultry farms in New South Wales to-day, any inefficiency that exists in the industry is on the farms themselves. Too little attention is paid to the maintenance of flocks of the most economic size, and the efficient culling of flocks. Very little scientific culling is done on many farms to-day, with the result that hens that are no longer laying, or whose production is diminishing, are still being fed. Largely because of the poor land on which they are established most farmers make no effort to grow their own green feed, but attempt to get a balanced ration out of a bag.","N/A","POULTRY INDUSTRY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Probably he has only raised this matter to-day because he has poultry-farmers in his electorate. The greatest need to-day is for a more scientific approach to poultry farming. On the marketing side, too, there is some room for complaint. For instance, there is far too great a tendency to sell pullet eggs as hen eggs. More efficient grading is required and that is something that the Minister might discuss with his State colleagues. The point that I wish to make after having investigated this matter is that the prices that poultry-farmers are receiving to-day are fair. I have no fear that poultry-farming will disappear from the economy of the nation. But there are many things that producers must do if they want to become as important to this country as the American, poultry-farmers are to the United States of America. I trust that exaggerated statements about the alleged imminent dissolution of the poultry industry will not be given too much attention. They are quite wrong, and! in many cases, insincere. It is true that because of the price of wheat and offal the poultry-farmer to-day is enduring certain irritations, but also in the story is the fact that he is getting good standard prices. If he is efficient he will not be thinking of leaving the industry, but rather of consolidating his undertaking. At present, he is making money, and is better off than at any time in the history of the industry within the last twenty years.","N/A","POULTRY INDUSTRY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[9]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","154","HUTCHINSON, William","KIX","Deakin","N/A","N/A","439",". - The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr. Pollard) has many industries under his control, and it is not to be expected that he could have an intimate knowledge of all of them, but he must know that the poultry industry is seething with discontent. A great deal of this discontent certainly arises from the operations of the egg boards in the various States, but much of it is also due to activities in. the Commonwealth sphere. The motion now before the House arises from an unwarranted act committed by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. Some time ago I wrote to the Minister asking whether the Australian Government still controlled an amount of about £500,000 which was said by the poultry producers, rightly or wrongly, to belong to them. I asked, further, whether the Government intended to make a demand on the egg boards for an amount of about £200,000, representing sums said, to have been expended by the Australian Government during the war on plant for the pulping of eggs. I have had no reply to that letter. I hope that Minister will take the opportunity provided by this debate to give me an authoritative reply for the information of the people on whose behalf I wrote to him and of all other egg producers in Australia.  The subject before us at the moment is the new contract for the supply of eggs to the United Kingdom, the terms of which apparently were decided chiefly by the Minister without proper consultation with the egg producers' organizations or with people in whom the producers have confidence. The value of the export trade is well recognized. Great Britain wants eggs badly, and Australian producers are anxious to deliver the goods. But, in order to enable them to do so, they must be paid a profitable price. In considering .the terms of the contract negotiated with the Government of the United Kingdom, one reaches the extraordinary conclusion that, after allowance has been made for increased costs of production and for the cost of oiling, the price received by the growers will be the same as the price which they have been receiving for a considerable time past. It is useless to assume that producers can maintain profitable production while costs are still rising and while materials, required for the expansion of their poultry farms are almost unprocurable. They must look ahead. In order to fulfil the contract, the industry must be expanded by increasing the number of fowls in production by about 5,500,000. Yet producers are expected to carry on for the same return as they have been receiving up to the present. The Minister will surely not deny that the price provided under the contract, taking into consideration the effect of increased costs, will be approximately the same as the. price which has prevailed for some time past. Thb increasing of flocks by about 5,500,000 fowls will require the provision of extra accommodation and new equipment on poultry farms. As far as we can see, the farmers will have to recoup this additional expenditure within a matter of a few years. This fact was made plain by the Minister in the statement which he made on 'the 9th February, when he said -","N/A","POULTRY INDUSTRY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[10]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","164","HUTCHINSON, William","KIX","N/A","N/A","N/A","439","That may be so, but the Minister's statement indicated that he was looking ahead. He said that, at the end of the contract period, an expanded industry would not be left without an opportunity to step down production progressively. It is perfectly clear that there is no guarantee whatever that the level of production aimed at by the Minister will be permanent. He has said distinctly that there may have to be a stepping down of production. That means that the industry, if it is to expand and fulfil the contract - and I hope that it will be able to do so - must have some degree of certainty that it will be able to recoup the additional expenditure involved in the expansion within a limited period of years. The Minister has entered into this contract at a time when he knows that the industry is not in a satisfactory position. He has done so without proper advance consultation with the producers' organizations, and has agreed upon a price which is approximately the same as the present price. Such a method of doing business is inexplicable. I cannot understand it, nor, indeed, can the producers do so.  Another objection to the agreement is that it is on a sterling basis. That fact has been mentioned by the honorable member for New England (Mr. Abbott). It is most extraordinary.We are living at a time when no currency is on a stable basis. The world is definitely in a disturbed economic condition. Yet the Minister has entered into an agreement on behalf of an Australian industry on a basis of sterling. Nobody can tell whether sterling will retain its face value beyond the next few months, because Great Britain's economic condition is indeed parlous. If there should be any devaluation of sterling, the Australian egg industry will he asked to bear the loss. It is being asked to expand and incur additional costs in order to satisfy Great Britain's need without being given a guarantee that the price fixed in the contract will retain its already unsatisfactory value for more than a few months. When this Government negotiates contacts on such a basis, is it any wonder that industries, particularly primary industries, are wary indeed of anything that it does? Egg producers are having great difficulty in obtaining sufficient feed even for the fowls already in production. Every honorable member whose electorate includes poultry farms must know that producers have great trouble in obtaining offal and wheat in sufficient quantities to maintain the present level of production. Yet the industry will have to be expanded considerably if the contract is to be made good. When the Minister replies, I hope that be will explain how he arrived at the price which is provided in the contract. Whom did he consult? Why did he refuse, as I am led to believe that he did, to consult representatives of the various egg producers' organizations? This socialist Government apparently believes that the proper way to fix prices for our primary commodities is to negotiate directly with governments and that all the wisdom pertaining to any industry, large or small, primary or secondary, reposes in its departmental advisers. For example, it has made agreements in respect of Australian wheat without seeking the advice of the Australian Wheat Board. It places its faith purely and simply in government-to-government negotiations as a means of fixing prices. The egg contract provides another example of such methods. It is disgraceful that the price agreed upon is not based upon Australian currency and has no relation to production costs or the expense that must be incurred in expanding the industry sufficiently to satisfy the terms of the contract. Apparently this arrangement has been made entirelyor the advice of some departmental officers.","N/A","POULTRY INDUSTRY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[10]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

They are experiencing considerable difficulty in obtaining sufficient supplies of bran and pollard to increase their flocks. They complain that whilst retailers say that they have not sufficient bran and pollard to supply their needs, the retailers have adequate supplies of expensive mashes and mixtures. They also complain that price controls do not apply to the sale of the ingredients of the ready-mixed preparations, and I particularly direct the attention of the Minister to that complaint. The deputation produced for my inspection some letters from poultry-farmers located in various parts of South Australia cancelling orders for the purchase of chickens. The reason that poultry-farmers were impelled to take such action was that the price of poultry feed is too high, and they cannot obtain offal to enable them to prepare their own feed. The contract under discussion expires in 1953, but contains provision for its extension beyond that time. However, the poultry farmers who interviewed me fear that because of the decrease of poultry in this country in the next few years, Great Britain may go elsewhere for supplies after that time. That would, of course, be a very serious blow to the industry in this country. The prices charged for poultry feed . were quoted to me as follows : - Bran £8 a ton, pollard £7 a ton, and pelletts, which are supposed to be prepared from those ingredients, £12 18s. 7d. a ton. Can the Minister give me .any satisfactory answer to the complaints of South Australian poultry farmers?","N/A","POULTRY INDUSTRY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[11]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In view of the general attitude adopted by the Opposition parties in regard to the supply of food for Britain, I am surprised that they should attack the contract which we have made with Great Britain for the supply of eggs to that country during the next few years. Had any poultry-farmers been present during this morning's debate, or had they listened to the broadcast of the proceedings; they would have been greatly discouraged by the speeches of members of the Opposition. So far from being impelled to maintain their present rate of production, or even to increase it, they would have had every reason to diminish their effors. Of. course, the comments and criticisms of honorable members opposite are entirely contradicted by the facts. Compared with other primary industries the Australian poultry industry is in a favorable position to-day; in fact, its present position is nothing short of marvellous when one recollects the condition of the industry at the time the Curtin Government assumed office, whilst its plight during the regime of the Composite Government was almost hopeless. For verification of my contention, one has only to look at the statistics of production and prices.

The industry w a s in a p a rlous position . in those d a ys, a nd it did not recover until a L a bour government c a ine into office.

In 1942, the Curtin Government a pproved the s a le of whe a t, to poultry-f a rmers a t 3s. '6£d. a bushel, which represented a ' concession of 6d. a bushel.

Bec a use of th a t a ssist a nce the industry developed a nd prospered.

Despite wh a t m a y be s a id by honor a ble members who profess to be experts in this m a tter, the terms of the contr a ct a re exceedingly generous. So f a r a s the United Kingdom w a s concerned, there w a s a current contr a ct, with a further two ye a rs to run, providing for a price for eggs in shell of 2s. Id. a dozen f.o.b. Soon a fter the end of the w a r, we fe a red th a t our egg industry might perish. It w a s re a lized th a t Egypt, Chin a , Denm a rk a nd other countries h a d previously supplied subst a nti a l qu a ntities of eggs to the United Kingdom a nd a situ a tion w a s visu a lized in which those countries would a g a in be in a position to sell eggs a nd egg products to the United Kingdom m a rket a t a price lower th a n th a t a t which they could be sold by Austr a li a n poultry f a rmers. It is s a id th a t the new price is uns a tisf a ctory, but in my opinion it is a p a y a ble one a nd the poultry industry will prosper a s a result of it. Brit a in, volunt a rily relinquished its right for the next two ye a rs to obt a in eggs from Austr a li a n poultry-f a rmers a t a price of 2s. ki. a dozen in shell. It is true th a t its negoti a tors hoped to obt a in seine a dv a nt a ges by the a b a ndonment of th a t contr a ct right. The situ a tion in the United Kingdom h a s developed b a dly for the people of th a t, country, but in the sense th a t it will help our poultry industry it is perh a ps fortun a te for us. Brit a in desires, a t le a st for the next few ye a rs, to be a ssured of subst a nti a l a nd incre a sing qu a ntities of eggs from Austr a li a a nd a s a result its negoti a tions were prep a red to a b a ndon a n existing contr a ct right. On our p a rt, we looked for some compens a tion in the form of a n incre a sed price to the industry to offset recent incre a ses in the cost of feed a nd other things. After lengthy negoti a tion a nd discussion, the present contr a ct w a s concluded. The United Kingdom negoti a tors pressed for a price less th a n the existing contr a ct r a te a nd I w a s pl a ced in a position in which I h a d to press for a higher price th a n they were prep a red to p a y. I re a lized th a t the United Kingdom Government w a s the purch a ser a nd th a t, in the a bsence of a contr a ct, the Austr a li a n poultry industry might be f a ced with competition from other countries a nd lose a lmost the whole of its export tr a de. It is unfortun a te when one h a s to b a rg a in with people who a re a lre a dy suffering h a rdships.  On the one hand, the accusation is made that we are not interested in the people of the United Kingdom and do not desire to assist them in. their hour of need. On the other hand, honorable members opposite make speeches that tend to lower the morale of those engaged in the poultry industry and to encourage them to believe that they are not able, economically, to produce eggs at this price. Unfortunately, as in many other contracts entered into with Britain, a harder bargain was driven than would have been driven by a private seller. In my opinion, the price fixed is sufficient to enable our poultry-farmers profitably to supply these eggs. The United Kingdom expects a three-fold increase in our egg exports, and I believe the industry can expand its production to allow that to be done. It will entail only a 40 per cent, increase in our production. I have praised the poultry industry before and will continue te? do so, but I say that this price will be much more attractive if the industry improves its methods of producing and marketing eggs. The United Kingdom Ministry of Food recently found it necessary to impose a condition that eggs should only be accepted for export if they w«;re unwashed, but the response from the Australian poultry farmers was not good. There was placed upon the Egg Boards, the Federal Egg Controller, and everybody associated with the industry, the task of encouraging and educating the poultry-farmers to adopt the proper technique, but it became so difficult that, eventually, it was necessary to impose a penalty rate of 3d. a dozen to ensure that eggs for export were unwashed. Only 30 per cent, of our vast egg production to-day is of a standard high enough to meet export requirements, but if the industry applies itself to this problem it will shortly be in a position to produce eggs of such a quality that it will be able to export 50, 60 or even 70 per cent, of the entire production. The honorable member for New England (Mr. Abbott) complained that the industry was not consulted before this agreement was concluded. There are so many . organizations that claim to represent the poultry- farmers of Australia, that if this or any other government wanted to consult the industry it would not know who its representatives were. There is the Australian Poultry Farmers Association, the National Utility Poultry Breeders Association and many other organizations, all of which claim to represent this industry. I suggest to the honorable member for New England that the Australian poultry-farmers to-day are in a much better position regarding contracts entered into on their behalf than they were in the days when governments supported by the honorable member left the industry in the hands of speculators in this country and in the countries purchasing the products. The present position is that the contracts are made between governments and that no speculators or dealers are interposed. Those speculators did not confer with the industry, but formed rings and offered prices that the poultry industry was forced to accept. It can at least be said of contracts entered into between governments, that as far as the government of the vendor country is concerned it drives bargains that will give to the producers an adequate remuneration for their products. In one sense, the industry was consulted in this case. Mr. Peacock and Dr. Brooks, the representatives of the British Ministry of Food, toured Australia. I think it is correct to say that they met the members of every State egg board except that of 'Western Australia; that they informed the members of those boards of the present situation in the United Kingdom and of the outlook for the future, and that they informed them of the requirements of the United Kingdom Ministry of Food. They were very well received and obtained an understanding of the difficulties confronting the industry in the respective States.' Finally, they came to Canberra and, after negotiations with myself, the officers of my department, and the chairman of the newly constituted Australian Egg Board, arrived at a decision which made the present contract possible. That decision was approved by Cabinet as a whole. In those circumstances I suggest that a reasonable arrangement has been entered into on behalf of this great industry. The honorable member for Flinders (Mr. Ryan) referred to people leaving the industry. He made a similar statement in the debate on. the Egg Export Control Bill, but inquiries ' that I have made reveal that production has increased in the areas represented by the honorable gentleman.","N/A","POULTRY INDUSTRY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[12]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The honorable member for Flinders has proved to be a false prophet in the past, and will no doubt be proved false in the future. Honorable members opposite complain of increasing costs, and say that the price of wheat has gone up. That is quite true. On the other hand, those who represent the wheat-growers wish to be paid export parity prices for all wheat they produce. Members of the Opposition want a ' bob ' each way. They want the wheat-growers to be paid the export parity price, which is nearly fi a bushel, for all their wheat; but, on the other hand, they want the poultry-farmers - many of whom are also wheat-growers - to get their wheat at reduced prices. This attitude emphasizes the wisdom of the Government, which has ruled that enough wheat must remain in the country for all purposes, whether to feed fowls or human beings, and that it must be available at a price based on the cost of production. This system will stand us in good stead whether a wheat stabilization scheme is put into effect or not. It will prove our sheet anchor in the days - perhaps not so far ahead - when world prices for wheat will collapse. Wheat-farmers will then be glad that a home-consumption price has been established.  There is already evidence that the Government's scheme for increased egg pro- duction is getting under way, because I nin being plagued by applications for more feed. It is estimated that, when the scheme is in full operation, there will be an additional demand for 2,000,000 bushels of wheat for poultry purposes. The poultry-farmers will be able to buy' this wheat at a price which will reflect the Australian economic cost of production. That ic as it should be. To those poultry farmers who fear that they will not be able to get enough wheat, I say that wheat will be available for all necessary purposes.","N/A","POULTRY INDUSTRY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[12]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

For too long they have been misled by people of the ilk of the honorable member for Wimmera (Mr. Turnbull). He should realize that, there are a great many people in Australia other than wheat-farmers. There are, for instance, consumers and poultry farmers. The wheat-growers must understand that they have often been greatly helped by the Government and the taxpayers. Superphosphate subsidies and drought relief are two instances. The industry will receive in the future the same generous assistance as in the past, when it. becomes necessary, but producers must be prepared to do the right thing by others. [Extension of time granted.} If the State governments co-operate, as we hope they will, the poultry industry will be placed on a stable basisAll the moaning indulged in by honorable members opposite, and all this talk of unprofitable prices, is calculated, in the final analysis, to deprive the people of Britain of the eggs they need so much. Let us compare the position of poultry farmers to-day with their position in the. thirties, when the right honorable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) was a. member of the Government. In 1935-36, the export price of eggs was 12.59d. a dozen. It is true that wheat at that time was selling for about 2s. lOd. a bushel, but other items of cost were such that the position of the poultry-farmers was very unsatisfactory. Indeed, the industry was declining. In 1936-37, the position improved somewhat, the export price being 15.93d. a dozen. In 1937-38, it was 15.10d., and in 1939-40 it was 13.96d. During all that time, the exports were negligible. They have been increased to the present satisfactory level because of the attractive prices offering, and because of the subsidies for wheat, which have cost the Government over £12,000,000. It is obvious that the poultry industry has a bright future, though there may be difficulties ahead. Poultry-farmers should be encouraged, instead of having their morale weakened by propaganda of the kind indulged in to-day by honorable members opposite. The Government will assist, and nurse and encourage the industry, in every way possible. We know that there is a shortage of building material. We hope that the position will improve, and the Government will do all it can to help. We know that there is a shortage of protein feeds, and that there is a tendency on the part of some grain producers to withhold a proportion of their production. That is unfair to the industry, and an attempt will he made to make other kinds of grain available in adequate quantities.

At that time a prototype aircraft - the Convair model 110 - had flown successfully and been demonstrated to the domestic airlines in the United States of America. Construction of the production model 240 was well advanced and orders for a, considerable number had' been placed by other airlines. 2 and 3. No. Convair 240 has completed all the flying tests prescribed by the United States civil aeronautics demonstration and a full certificate of air worthiness including de-icing equipment and pressurization has recently been granted. 4.No. Convair 240 was designed for the operation of major main lines internal services as a modern replacement of the pre-war types of aircraft hitherto used for such operations in the United States of America, Australia and other countries. The Convair 240 is in an entirely different category to aircraft required and designed specifically to give maximum economy of operation of long range transcontinental and trans-ocean services. 5.The estimated cost of the five Convair 240 aircraft on order to Trans-Australia Airlines is approximately 1,569,300 dollars. The above information has been furnished by the Australian National Airlines Commission. I do not propose to comment further on the various statements appearing in the newspaper article except to state that I am informed by the commission that its requirements which are covered by the Convair 240 contract require the aircraft to have a payload for its full complement of 40 passengers and baggage and fuel (including fuel reservation as required by Civil Aviation Department regulations) for operations over the MelbourneSydney route and similar stages.","Civil Aviation : Trans-Australia Airlines ; Convair Aircraft","ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS","/hansard/answers.to.questions/debate/subdebate.1[1]/answer[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The department is not aware of the number of the parcels included in the posting which have actually been delivered in Great Britain, but seven parcels, which, evidently, were portion of the consignment, were' returned by the British Post Office in October, 1947, marked ' Insufficient address. Returned to Australia '. I am. informed that four further parcels from the same sender and bearing a similar reason for non-delivery were returned during January. 1948. Although it is understood that the parcels were intended to be forwarded to the secretary, British Empire Service League, 13 Manchestersquare, London, the address actually appearing on those which have been returned is ' The Secretary, Head-quarters, British Ex-service League, London ', and it is probable that the seeming inaccuracy in the designation of the league concerned and the omission of a street address has led to the non-delivery of the articles. The charge for the return of the parcels from Great Britain was 5s. lOd. each and a similar fee would be incurred if the same parcels were re-posted, subsequently, to a corrected address as, in either case, the usual sea conveyance charges and handling costs in both Postal Administrations are involved. Apart, however, from the fact that the department has not the power to grant free postal transmission in respect of undeliverable parcels returned to the sender or of such parcels if re-posted, it is clear that the nondelivery of the articles was duc to no fault of the Australian Post Office. I might add that, under a special arrangement with the British authorities, uninsured food parcels posted after the 31st August, 1947, which prove to be undeliverable in Great Britain are not returned to the sender, but are treated as abandoned and the contents distributed to the best advantage in Great Britain.

I have had this matter investigated and find that the Commonwealth car was utilized by the permanent head of the Department of Transport, who is also the chief executive officer of the Australian Transport Advisory Council, for the purpose of attending such a conference in Adelaide. The head of the Department of Transport has been making, in conjunction with the technical officers of that department, a comprehensive survey of the general transport position in Australia, covering rail, road, air and sea. It was agreed that the section between Melbourne and Adelaide provided an excellent cross section in which the transport facilities could be examined in relation to one another, and, as the department has considerable data on the transport volume in this area, it was considered desirable for the officer concerned to be in a position fully to appreciate the problems involved. Knowing that the next meeting of the Australian Road Safety Council had been fixed for the 23rd-25th February, in Adelaide, and that as chairman of the council he would be visiting Adelaide, the officer arranged to travel by car. This journey by car enabled him to gain first-hand knowledge of certain transport aspects which could not have been fully appreciated otherwise.","Petrol","ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS","/hansard/answers.to.questions/debate/subdebate.1[5]/question/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
