The Labour Party propose to run candidates in all the divisions of the Commonwealth, and they are even setting up opposition to the candidature of Mr. Speaker. In my view, that is a. most unworthy thing to do. It is never done in Great Britain. Last year a friend of mine entered upon a contest for the Carlisle seat against Mr. Lowther. He had been working for many months, and had spent considerable sums, of money, when the retirement of Mr. Gully from the Speakership of the House of Commons led to the appointment of Mr. Lowther.

In my district last year a considerable number of persons refrained from going to the poll because of the inconvenience and possible loss that would have been involved if they had left their homesteads at that time. A. few months later, when the harvest was over, and a general election was held in New South Wales, the Labour candidate in my constituency polled 5,000 more votes than were recorded in my favour in the previous December. It seems to me that there is not much comfort for the honorable member for Echuca in these facts. ' ' For a considerable time past, it has seemed to me that it is altogether undesirable to hold the elections at any time during the latter half of the year. No matter what period you fix between June and December, you will disfranchise some large section of the community. At any rate, if you do not dis- f ranchise them, you will cause them serious inconvenience. In Queensland, the sugar harvest has commenced', and men are engaged in cutting cane, or are otherwise busily occupied in work just as urgent as. that which has to be done when Che wheat crops are ripe. From what I can understand, sugar cane cannot be allowed to stand for any considerable time after it is ripe, and, therefore, the work of cutting it is a matter of urgency. In the pastoral' districts of Queensland, shearing is now proceeding, and a little later, the shearers will be moving down to New South Wales, and still later to Victoria. So that during the latter half of the year, the harvest is being gathered in some part of Australia, and a large section of the electors would be seriously inconvenienced if they had to attend the poll. I trust that the honorable member who tabled the motion' will be disposed to give some consideration to classes other than those who are most numerously represented in his own constituency.","N/A","GENERAL ELECTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[2]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It has been urged that the adoption of the plan suggested would not insure the holding of all subsequent elections at the same period of the year. But we could at least insure that, unless there were a penal dissolution of both Houses, under the deadlock provisions of the Constitution, the elections for the Senate would be held at a much more convenient time than they are at present. So far as this House is concerned, penal dissolutions are always possible, but we are at present under just as great a liability to have the elections of the two Houses separated as we would be then. To insure that in future the inconvenience to which allusion has been made shall be minimized as much as possible, the effort, I think, is worth making. So far as the present position is concerned, I quite agree with the honorable member for Echuca, that the Ministry and the Department of Home Affairs should be expected to use every means in their power to put the electoral machinery in order at the earliest possible moment. At the same time, I am inclined to think that the honorable member his overlooked the immense distances which exist in Australia. The Department has to deal, not merely with the electors of New South Wales or Victoria, but with those of the Northern Territory, the northwest corner of Western Australia, and the far north of Queensland with which places communication is not frequent. Though an earl v election might not inconvenience the voters resident in' these remote portions, of the Continent, their distance from the centres of population increases the difficulties of the Department in getting the electoral machinery to work. That machinery is more difficult to work in respect of the places I have mentioned than it is in respect of places like Echuca or Wagga. I think that the Government should strain every nerve to enable the forthcoming elections to be held at the earliest possible moment. I Quite agree with the honorable member for Echuca that if it can be done it is' desirable that the next general election should take place earlier than did the election of three years ago. I believe that a few weeks can be saved in that way, and I hope that the Government - without any instructions from the House - will use every possible effort to permit of the elections being held at such a time as will minimize the inconvenience that must inevitably attach to their conduct, no matter at what period of the year they may be held.","N/A","GENERAL ELECTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[2]/continue[10]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Since then three years have elapsed, but though we are within a few months of a general appeal to the people, we are told by the Minister that he cannot say when the necessary machinery for the conduct of the elections will be in readiness. That is a condition of things that ought not to exist, and the sooner it is remedied the better it will be for all concerned. Let us suppose that something occurred which necessitated an immediate appeal to the country. What would be the position? Would the Government say, 'We cannot settle these issues'? Let us suppose that upon some vital question - going, it may be, to the very existence of our national life - a dissolution took place, would the Government come to the House, and exclaim. 'I do not know when we shall be ready to make this appeal to the country'? All this is a confession of Ministerial weakness, and of departmental inefficiency.

According to the dictum of the Minister, a period of six months must elapse before the electoral machinery can be ready. All this is neither more nor less than a reflection upon the condition of things which obtains in the Department in regard to matters most vitally affecting this Parliament and the interests of the people. My own impression is the same as that of the honorable member for Bland, and I 'believe of honorable members generally, that the December date fixed for the Senate is the most inconvenient that could possibly be fixed. I urge upon .the Government the advisability of submitting a simple constitutional amendment fixing the date of the termination of a Senate term earlier or later than that now provided for. In all the circumstances it would seem that a later date is preferable to an earlier one - that is to sa.v. that a date in February. March, or April, would best suit almost the whole of the people of Australia. It is impossible to fix a date which will suit the interests of all the people, but we mav have a fair idea of what will suit the great majority, and in all these questions, which are matters of expediency and administration, it is the interests of the great majority that we ought to consult I am not quite sure whether what I have suggested should not be done at the forthcoming elections. Certain it is that until it is done we shall have to continue the holding of elections at a time when a great proportion of the people - for whom, in view of the natural disabilities under which they labour, the electoral machinery should be stretched if* possible - will be unable to record their votes. They are under natural disabilities in this regard, arising from their remoteness from the polling booths and centres of population, and from the general conditions under which they live, and we should endeavour to modify and remedy those disabilities as far as possible bv means of our electoral machinery. Every one knows that some of our farmers must go from 10 to 20 miles to record their votes.","N/A","GENERAL ELECTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[3]/continue[12]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is difficult in their busy_ seasons to get farmers to give attention to political matters, and I suppose it is the more difficult where they have confidence in their representative. One of the men who attended the meeting to which I have referred told me that the small attendance was a vote of confidence in me rather than otherwise, and so it turned out on the polling-day. I have mentioned this matter to show that natural difficulties are always dogging the farmer's life, subject as he is to seasons and climatic conditions. It is not fair that, in addition to natural disabilities, we should impose disabilities upon country voters arising from defects of our legislative machinery. It is just the same as if we imposed legislative disabilities upon them. Under the Constitution as it stands, a legislative restriction is necessarily imposed upon these electors, and the sooner we can remove or modify it the better for the country as a whole. There is, I think, a consensus of opinion at the present time that the sooner an appeal to the people is made the better.

On the face of it the motion is certainly inoffensive, and should not necessarily introduce party politics; but under cover of it the honorable member has made a few remarks which seem to indicate that it has been introduced from his own political stand-point.

In Queensland a collection has recently been made, and we find that many additional names can be placed upon our rolls. We find that in Tasmania there are many additional names on the State rolls, and we have asked the assistance of the -police in the compilation of our rolls, in order that they may be rendered as complete as possible. In every State we are endeavouring to make the rolls as perfect as possible. All this is causing a very heavy strain on the Department, and extra work beyond anything that was contemplated. We hope that when we arrive at electoral uniformity, and the State and Commonwealth authorities are able to co-operate, there will be an annual collection throughout the Commonwealth, as is now the case in New South Wales. I am merely mentioning these facts to enable honorable members to realize the enormous difficulties in the compilation of the rolls, and in the readjustment due to the desire on the part of the Government to give each State the representation to which it is entitled. The officers of the Department have had to work extremely hard, and the Acting Chief Electoral Officer, Mr. Bingie, who has been doing the electoral work, in addition to discharging his duties as chief clerk, has laboured so assiduously that he has injured his health. I think that it is only due to that officer, who has been working admirably, and w.hose reputation may be affected if the Electoral Department has not accomplished all that has been expected of it, to mention what has been done.

He was carrying out the work efficiently, but he was unable to continue to do so without interfering seriously with his ordinary duties. It was, therefore, necessary to appoint a man who could' devote the whole of his time to the work. I found it necessary to have a Chief Electoral Officer, and to appoint in three of the States Commonwealth permanent electoral officers. These appointments would have been necessary even if the Electoral Office had been administered through the Postal Department. We still hope that the States Governments will come into line with us, and do away with the necessity for two sets of officers to perform practically the same work. We have been in communication with the States Governments, and a Conference of the States and Commonwealth electoral officials has been held, with a view to ascertaining if we cannot harmonise our arrangements;and save a large sum of money. If we succeed in this direction, we shall have a more efficient system of registration, and better rolls, and also effect considerable economies.

Since then the necessary legal basis has been sup- . plied. Last year the honorable member for Echuca asked that we should arrange to hold the election at the earliest possible date. I promised the honorable member that I would endeavour to do so, and I think that I have given sufficient evidence to show that that promise has been kept, and that it will be honoured. As we move forward we shall endeavour to arrange for the holding of the election at the earliest possible date. In fixing the date, we shall1 have to look at the matter from an Australian stand-point, and must not be unduly influenced by consideration for Victoria, for New South Wales, or for any other State. If it is found that owing to the harvest in Victoria it ,is impossible for the farmers to go to the poll upon the date of election, it will be a matter for consideration whether some system should not be devised to enable them to record their votes by the machinery of the ballot. The honorable member for Echuca is not the only champion of the farmers. There are honorable members on this side of the House who are direct representatives of the farming section of the community, and who have studied their interests perhaps even more closely than the honorable member has done. It would be well for the honorable member to consider whether his present course of political action is likely to conduce to the interests of those whom he is desirous to serve. We have always borne in mind the interests of the farmers, and will continue to do so, because we recognise that they form one of the most deserving sections of the community. We have, however, to consider the interests of the whole of the electors, and have to fix a date that will be best for all concerned. That matter is now receiving consideration. If honorable members express the opinion that the election should be held at the earliest possible date, they will merely be declaring themselves in favour of that which has already been done, and is still being carried out bv the officials administering the Department, both at the head office and at every branch throughout the Commonwealth.","N/A","GENERAL ELECTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[4]/continue[30]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We are all familiar with the formal matters to which the Minister has referred, and we know that they can be attended to simultaneously in all the States, and that the great distances to which reference has been made do not impose insuperable barriers to reasonable expedition. When I was at the head of the Customs Department, I used to receive telegrams, from the most remote parts of the Continent, and I must confess that I never experienced the slightest difficulty in replying, to them by wire upon the same day. Surely the same expedition can be observed in giving instructions - by wire or otherwise - to officers in different parts of the Commonwealth. If the Government desire to hold the general elections before the middle of November, we all know that it is quite possible for them to do so, and I think the necessity for doing so has been pretty well emphasized already. I have given a good deal of consideration to this matter. I am not one who would advocate the granting of facilities to farmers which are denied to any other section of the community. I merely wish, as far as it is practicable, to place the farmers upon an equality with other sections of the community. We know that in spite of anything that we may do we cannot place them upon exactly the same footing. They have to contend with many difficulties which are not experienced by any other class. A good deal has been said in reference to the shearers-. I am as much interested in extending to the shearers facilities to vote as I am in granting them to the farmers. But the obstacles in their case are of an altogether different character. If a shearer leaves his own State, and goes to another to pursue his avocation, there is no practical difficulty in the way of him availing himself either of the 'Q' form or of the postal vote.","N/A","GENERAL ELECTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[5]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

For instance, if I may be permitted to refer to it, one question which is almost sure to be a prominent feature in the campaign, and one which affects the interests of the farmers vitally, is the proposal to impose an additional land tax. It appears to me that very few honorable members realize the present condition of taxation as between country and city. I will give a very simple illustration of my meaning, and one which will serve to convey to honorable members an accurate idea of what exists at the present time in Victoria. Let us assume that two brothers start life, each being worth £1 0,000. Let us further suppose that one embarks upon a business in the city, and that the other purchases 1 0,000 acres of land at £1 an acre. The outside rental value of that land, at 5 per cent., is £500 annually, but it would probably be much nearer 4 per cent. Assuming that the brother in the city earned £500 gross from his business, he would be called upon to pay an income tax of £5. That is the rate ruling in Victoria. But what would the country man have to pay? Out of his 10,000 acres, which are worth £1 an acre, there would be 2,500 acres exempt from taxation. The balance of 7,500 acres would bear a tax of 3d. in the £1 , or 3d. per acre, which would amount to £93 15s. The local rate for making roads, not exclusively for his own use, but for that of the general public - I am taking the lowest rate prevailing in Victoria - would be , £25. His income tax on a rental of £500 would be just double that levied upon the business man in the city. In other words, it would be £1 0. He would thus have to pay a total of £1 28 15s. in taxation, as against his brother's £5. Yet, what are the questions which are likely to be submitted for decision at the next election? From all that we can judge at the present time, one of the proposals will be more land taxation for the country yokel and more protection for the city man. I have always been an advocate of protection, but I believe in a little modicum of justice. We have been told by the Minister that there are a number of farmers' representatives upon the other side of the House. I do not doubt his statement for a moment, and I do not doubt that they will vote for this motion. I am not particular whether the motion be carried or not, so long as the Government will agree to hold the elections at the earliest possible moment. They can do it, as we all know, and I sincerely hope that they will.","N/A","GENERAL ELECTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[5]/continue[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I informed the House, when I had an opportunity of speaking on the proposals submitted by the Minister in connexion with the Electoral Bill - which proposals were largely amendments which I had previously adopted - that I was satisfied that no reorganization on the present lines will achieve what is necessary, in the case of an electorate so large as all Australia, to secure the efficient, speedy, and successful carrying out of elections. I was then convinced, and I am still more convinced by what we know to-day, and bv the remarks of the Minister, that when we have to reach the remote confines of Australia with our electoral administration, and must control such an enormous area from one centre, the Department operating over all that area must be handling the electoral administration, not merely at the time of an election, or suddenly when the rush of an' election comes on, but day by day and hour by hour during the whole period between elections. That can only be accomplished by a staff so large and so permanent in character as that represented by the staff of the Commonwealth Post Office Department, assisted - and that could be arranged - by the States police forces and bv States school teachers in remote districts. With a reorganization of the Electoral Department on those lines, we should have the strongest electoral staff in the world. In conducting the business, on the lines at present adopted, there will always be weaknesses, because we are depending upon men in remote districts who are not permanent officers of the Commonwealth.  They are men in receipt of small salaries, and liable to be removed from time to time. They constitute weak links in the chain; some of them give way and then the whole system breaks down.","N/A","GENERAL ELECTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[7]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I had come to the conclusion, in which I have been confirmed by the remarks of the Minister to-day, that if the work of the Electoral Department is to be done thoroughly, it must be in hand all the time. Honorable members will see that if a returning officer is removed from his position, there is an electoral chaos in his district for a time, because his successor will know nothing of the work. If it were the work practically of a permanent Department, every boy and youth in it would come in contact with that work day by day, just as they do with the money order business of the Post Office Department at the present time, and in the event of vacancies arising there would be an enormous staff of persons competent to undertake the conduct of the business, from which they could be filled. I repeat that there is no reorganization attempted now. There has been merely the placing of one officer, who in his position in Tasmania was a very good officer, and who, I hope, will prove to be a good officer in the position to which he has now been appointed. In the coming elections other officers in the Department will naturally, from their previous connexion with the work, be more useful for the time being. I have no desire to unduly criticise the Department or the Minister. I am aware that the officers in the Department work their very hardest, and, indeed, overwork themselves in their endeavours to carry on the necessary electoral work. I have every sympathy with them. I know that the Minister will also have to overwork himself in connexion with the coming elections. But I do say that there has not been that anticipation of difficulties which might be expected. For instance, I may refer to the measure which created a difficulty in the first instance, and to which the Minister has alluded. It fixed the occasions for the redistribution o'f State representation. The result attained1 by that measure was just the same as that -which would .have been obtained by the process which the previous Ministry desired to adopt, and which was ' the very process which had already been adopted by the Barton Government, of which the present Prime Minister was the Attorney-General. It seemed to me that that measure was brought in by the present Government to save its face, or to save the face of some of its members. Some of them having said in the press, before they became Ministers, that the process proposed by the late Government was not right, they had to do something, or it would have been an admission that they had been incorrect in their statements. That delayed matters; but we have passed that, and have come now to the position after the last redistribution. I quite agree that an enormous amount of work had to be clone after that. In some cases the whole of the voters in certain polling areas had to be transferred from the old electorate into a new electorate. That is not a very difficult task where there is no division of a polling area by the alteration of a border line.","N/A","GENERAL ELECTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[7]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The information might have been obtained from the central polling places, comprising the bulk of the electors. If the registrars were asked to send in the latest information as soon as the Commissioners' reports were received, that information should be in now for many of the city and suburban electorates, and for the nearer country districts. If they have sent that information in, the necessary alterations can be made, and all the rolls except those for the border line polling areas for- warded to the printing offices. A great deal of time is always taken in printing the rolls, and a hitch of some kind or other may happen at any time; but if a great many of the rolls are dealt with now, there will be .an opportunity to rush the others through later on. I am in sympathy with the object of the honorable member for Echuca, though, knowing the difficulties with which the Department has to contend, I think, after what the Minister has said, that the officers will have great trouble in getting everything ready for elections even so late ais the 31st December. It will be only by adopting the best methods that the elections can be held at an earlier date, though in saying that I am. not criticising the Minister, or questioning his sincerity. Every week by which the time between now and the date fixed for the elections is diminished will serve to prove the increased) activity of the officers of the Department, who are now, I know, working very hard. We have not yet faced the problem of organizing a Commonwealth electoral staff, but I feel that at some future time Parliament will be compelled! to do so. I hope that when that is' done means will be taken to keep the rolls complete from day to day by the assistance of the letter-carriers throughout the various States, instead of, as now, getting them as complete as possible for an election - they are often even then very incomplete; - and then allowing them to fall back until they can be got ready again. for a new election, not in a month or two, but after a frantic rush during five or six months. I agree with the honorable member for Echuca that, in fixing the date for a general election, the convenience of the electors should be studied, and that, whenever possible, loss should not be entailed upon them, by requiring them to record their votes at a busy period of the year. But we have no right to consider how one political party or another will benefit by the fixing of the date of the elections in a particular month. The honorable member for Echuca may have suggested that it would be to the disadvantage of the Labour Party to hold the elections on the date he proposes, while the leader of that party may have said that it would be io its advantage to hold them then, because it would give the employes of the farmers an opportunity to vote. The real, question, is, what is the best date to fix to prevent interference with the occupations and avocations of the electors. I trust that the Government will expedite the holding of the coming elections. The later in the year that the elections are held, the greater will be the number of persons penalized. I agree with the honorable member for Bland that it might be a good thing to hold the elections in the first half of the year, but the forthcoming elections must, of course, be held before the end of this year, and as soon as possible. If, by extra exertion - and a great deal of extra exertion will be needed - the elections can be held on the date named by the honorable member for Echuca, that date should be fixed.","N/A","GENERAL ELECTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[7]/continue[17]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The farmer may be put to some slight inconvenience in proceeding to the poll at harvest time; but, unless the weather conditions are quite exceptional, he runs very little risk of loss. The farm labourer, who has to stop work in order to record his vote, loses his pay, and that is an important matter to him. In these days of improved machinery the farmer runs little or no risk. Then, again, we know very well that a comparatively small number of crops ripen simultaneously, and therefore only a small percentage of farmers would be harvesting on election day. In fact, if the Government could arrange for the election to take place on a wet day, the farmers would have no right to complain. The Government, in dealing with this matter, must consider the whole of the Commonwealth, and not take into account the conditions which prevail in any particular district. The harvesting season varies in different parts of the Commonwealth, and a date that would be convenient for the Victorian farmers might be extremely unsuitable for those located in other places. If the elections are held at an early date, as has been suggested, thousands of shearers - there are 16,000 shearers in the New South Wales union alone; - will be disfranchised.","N/A","GENERAL ELECTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[9]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I am sorry that I should be called upon to act: as a missionary in any endeavours to enlighten him. T. say that if the elections are held in October, more persons will be disfranchised than if they are held later in the year. I have not heard that any large number of farmers were prevented from voting at the last election, although I am aware that some of them were very apathetic about the exercise of the franchise. I trust that the motion will be rejected. The honorable member who brought it forward should be content with having had the matter ventilated. I quite admit that the most suitable period for all parties at which to hold the elections would be about March. Taking the Commonwealth as a whole, it will be found that a considerable number of electors will be disfranchised, no matter when the elections are held. I hope that this matter will be left entirely in the hands of the Government. Assuming that the motion be carried, what effect can it have? It seems to me that, having ventilated the 'matter, the honorable member for Echuca might well withdraw his proposal. He must know that the Government will select the most suitable date upon which to hold the elections. The brunt of the attack made by members of the Opposition this afternoon has been directed, not against the Ministry, but against the Labour Party. If the Opposition wish to see only two parties in this House, why do they not join the Labour Party and wipe out the Government? We have heard of such things having been done in connexion with the States Parliaments in the past, but I hope that in the higher and purer atmosphere of Federal politics, of which we heard so much in pre-Federation days, no such suggestion will be made. Hence my protest against these references to party views. We should, I think, make ready for some change in the Constitution, fixing the election at an earlier period. I shall not go info that matter, which involves very much more than the mere alteration of the date of the election. Honorable members will agree that it would be necessary to alter the time when a senator should be assumed to have taken his seat. It would be manifestly unfair that a senator elected in March should be unable to take his seat until the following January and that in the meantime, the State concerned should be represented by a man who might have been rejected by the electors. There are bigger questions involved than the mere date of election, but the matter is one which we must face, if we do not desire that the elections shall continue to be held at a most unsuitable time. Honorable members know that at one time we gave up nearly six months of our legitimate term of office, and it is now agreed that we were rather foolish to do so. The elections were first of all held in March, and that practice should have been continued. We took the course we did in order to save the money of the people of the Commonwealth, but we have never had any thanks for doing so. On the contrary, complaints are frequently made that our expenditure is extravagant. It would be wise, I think, for us to revert to the previous position, and the necessity for some alteration should not be lost sight of by the Government. I have suggested what I believe would be a remedy for a condition of things which is admittedly unsatisfactory, and which would enable the elections to be held at a time which would be convenient for the majority of the electors.","N/A","GENERAL ELECTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[9]/para[2]","N/A","N/A"

I have every consideration for the farmer. I believe that, in common with other people, he should be able to have his opinions voiced in this Chamber, and impressed upon the legislation that is passed; but the choice of representatives by the farming constituencies is scarcely consistent with the arguments we have heard this afternoon. We are told that the farmer clamours for certain consideration, and' when he is given the opportunity he selects a city lawyer as his representative. I have not the slightest objection to that. If the farmers of Wannon prefer the present hon- ~orable and learned member for that constituency to a practical farmer, that is their look out.

The low percentage of voters on the rolls who cast their votes at the last Federal elections in Western Australia is notorious. In many of the outposts of Western Australia a few. people were gathered together, but, as in such places, men do not remain for any very considerable time, very many electors were disfranchised at the last elections. Instead of being able to record a vote of over 60 per cent, of the electors on the rolls, as was done in the Corangamite division of Victoria, the number of voters recording their votes at the elections in Western Australia was not more than 26 per cent, of the number on the rolls.

There has been a good deal of talk on this point this afternoon, and I hope that it will not be without a good practical result. I feel that it would be a very simple matter, after the expression of opinion which we have had, to secure an- alteration of the Constitution which would bring about what is desired. But the matter should be taken in hand1 at once, because such an alteration requires, not only that majorities in the two Chambers of the Legislature shall vote for it, but that it shall be before the electors for at least two months before they are called upon to express their opinion in regard to it. If the people are not asked to express their opinion on this matter at the next general elections, they cannot, unless a special referendum is taken, be asked to do so before 1909, so that it wiLl be impossible to effect before 1912 the change which we wish to bring about. The honorable member for Darling somewhat overstated the case when he said that some shearers have more difficulties to face in going to the poll than have the farmers. It is easy to say that the farmers may vote by post, but that can be done only when electors live seven miles away from a polling-place, and, if a farmer requires all his time for the harvesting of a valuable crop, he will not go to a polling-place which is only three or four miles away. I remember that, during the last elections, I heard of, not one, but several, electors who would! not take the trouble to vote, although they were within sight of a polling-place. However, as I said at the commencement, the disabilities of the farmers have been fully placed before the House, and I rose only to ask the Minister to consider seriously whether steps cannot be taken at once to provide for the alteration of the Constitution which has been suggested.","N/A","GENERAL ELECTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[11]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","278","MCCAY, James","KPM","Corinella","N/A","N/A","578","I wish to point out, in connexion with, the suggestions of the honorable members for Bland and Darling, that, although there seems to be an unanimous opinion that the latter months are more unsuitable than the earlier months of the year for an election, the worst month of all is December. Our experience in 1903 showed that to be the case. It is impossible, of course, to fix a date for the holding of the elections which will inconvenience no elector; but it is our business, so far as we can, to ascertain, and to fix that date which will be least inconvenient to the majority. So far as those engaged in agriculture, whether they be employers or employes, are concerned, the nearer the date of the general election to the end of the year the more marked will be the inconvenience to which they will be put if they wish to vote, because at that time climatic conditions are often unfavorable, and there is consequent risk of great loss from the cessation of work for even a few hours. Although a certain number of electors would be inconvenienced by the holding of the elections in November, most of them are electors who could vote by post. The cases in which three weeks would be taken for electors to send and get an answer to letters are, of course, abnormal, and by the middle of November the shearing iti the more northern parts of the Commonwealth has been finished, and those who have been engaged in it are back in their homes, or living again within comparatively easy reach of postal facilities. When the choice is between those who can, with nothing more than a little inconvenience, record1 their votes through the post-office, and those who cannot record it at all without risk of material financial loss, the latter should Le considered first. To hold, the elections not later than the middle of November would inconvenience fewer persons than to hold them in December, when, in some cases, electors would be altogether prevented from voting. This is an instance in which, as we cannot find a course of action altogether free from inconvenience, it is our business to choose that which is least open- to criticism. The experience of 1903 shows that December is the worst month for the holding of an election, because at that time of the year many electors are prevented from voting, not by reason of their negligence, carelessness, or indifference, but because of the risk to their financial well-being in ceasing from work to go to the poll. I am very glad that the Minister has instructed! his officials to have in mind the middle of November as the date for the holding of the elections. It is not merely the farmers, but their employes as well, who have to be considered. Every adult elector should, if possible, be afforded an opportunity to vote, and no elector should be prevented, by the risk of loss, from recording his vote. In view of the statement of the Minister, I cannot understand why the Government will not accept the motion, because all it declares is that, in the opinion of the House, the general elections should be held not later than the 15th November, and. if possible, earlier. Of course, if it is impossible to hold them earlier, it is useless: to discuss the matter. After what the Minister has said, I see no reason why the arrangements for the holding of the elections should not be completed1 by the date mentioned. The motion is couched in language to which no exception can be taken on the ground that it is an attack upon or a challenge to the Government, and as both the Ministry and the Labour Party have expressed concurrence with the proposal that the elections should, if possible, be held at the date fixed, I shall not hesitate to vote for the motion if it is pressed to a division.","N/A","GENERAL ELECTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[12]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The honorable member for Darling sought to show that the farmers were not deprived of the opportunity to vote, and that they were too apathetic to go to the polls. No doubt the charge of apathy as applied to some farmers is to some extent, perhaps to a large extent, true, just as it is true as applied to many other electors, but we know that there were other reasons why such an enormous number of those who were on the rolls failed at the last general elections to exercise the franchise. It is, I think, the duty of those responsible for our electoral administration to see that every facility for voting is given to electors, irrespective of their occupations. It is hardly fair to charge the farmers with apathy, when we fix a date upon which it is practically impossible for them to leave their homesteads. A farmer may, by going to the poll a long distance away, in harvesting time, risk the loss of his crop, and, however strong his political views may be, he cannot afford to take that chance. I do not think that there is a tittle of evidence to support the view put forward by the honorable member for Darling that the motion has been brought forward with a view of disfranchising another section of voters. I have not heard the slightest suggestion of any such desire on the part of members of the Opposition., nor do I believe that such an idea was ever entertained. I can honestly say for myself that my, sole object is to enable as many electors as possible to record their votes, and that I am not swayed. in any way by the political views they hold. I desire to remove the slur which now rests upon the electors of being so apathetic that they will not take the trouble to record their votes. At present we are placing obstacles in the way of a large section of the electors, and are then charging them with indifference. No such charge can be fully sustained until we have afforded the electors the fullest facilities, and have fixed a date upon which they can vote .without serious inconvenience or risk of loss. I was gratified to learn of the measures which are being taken by the Minister and his officers to expedite the work of the Electoral Department, with a view to holding the elections as early as possible. All that the Minister said! as to the completeness of the organization of the Department furnished an argument in favour of the motion. I hope that the arrangements will be pushed forward so that the elections mav be held, if not prior to the date mentioned in the motion, before the harvest is at its height. The honorable members for Kalgoorlie and Darling charged members of the Opposition with seeking to have the elections held at an earlier date than usual, with a view to placing the Labour Party at a disadvantage.

All that is desired is that full expression shall be given to the undoubted opinion of honorable members that the elections shall be held at the earliest possible moment. The honorable member for Hume tried to whip the Labour Party into order by suggesting that this was a no-confidence motion. The Labour Party responded by coming to his assistance, and the honorable member for Melbourne Ports has also stepped into the breach. Notwithstanding all that has been said, it is clear that the election must be held at the earliest practicable date. No reference has been made to the difficult position in which many of our farmers are placed during harvest time. In the western parts of New South Wales and in South Australia there is constant dread on the part of the farmers that their ripening crops will be swept away by bush fires. It is quite a common thing, upon visiting a township, during the month of December, to find that all the men are absent fire-fighting. The farmers are afraid to leave their holdings when there is so much at stake, and I think it is incumbent on our part to make more convenient arrangements than those which have been previously carried out. If it were practicable to allow the election to stand over until 31st December, I should feel it my duty to support such a proposal. Honorable members are elected for three years, and that period is short enough, especially if an honorable member has to travel through an electorate with an area of 20,000 square miles in order to address his constituents. I trust that if the Constitution is altered, the period will be extended to five years. I have no desire to cross swords with honorable members of the Labour Party, because I think that they must desire that as many electors as possible shall go to the poll. If they do .not represent the people they cannot wish to occupy the seats that should foe filled by members of the party to which I belong. We know that only a small percentage of the electors in New South Wales, and in fact throughout Australia, now support the Labour Party as a, party. A number of influences operate to bring about the return of honorable members to this House. For instance, I have no doubt that the honorable member for Grey would be elected, no m'atter how he described himself. I think that the honorable member for Echuca was fully warranted' in bringing forward his motion, and I hope that, after having secured a full and satisfactory discussion, he will withdraw it.","N/A","GENERAL ELECTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[14]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I represent a division which has an area three times as large as that of the State of Victoria. Some of nw constituents have to travel 50, 60. and even 100 miles to a polling place, and vet 57 per cent, of those on the roll recorded their votes at the last election. It is quite inexplicable to me that a larger percentage of votes is not recorded in divisions where the electors are, except in rare instances, within ha.]fanhour's walk of a polling place. I do not think that the poor results are entirely due to the fact that the elections are held at an inconvenient time, because the smallest percentage of votes has been recorded, not in the country districts, but in the towns. It has been suggested by the honorable member for Bland, and several other speakers, that the early part of - the year - about March, for example - would!be a most suitable period at which to hold the general elections. I most strenuously object to any such arrangement, but I have nothing to urge against the polling-day being fixed for some time in May. I need scarcely point out that in Queensland the wet season extends from January to Mardi, and, during those months it, is almost impossible for one to get over the country at all. In the northwest and portions of the south-west of Queensland, at that particular time of the year, I have seen the water stretching across the country for thirty or forty miles. The rivers are flooded in all directions: Under such circumstances, the great bulk of the voters, would be disfranchised if the elections were held at that particular period. As a matter of fact, whilst I was engaged in electioneering, I had an experience of being kept four days in one place, without being able to obtain anything to eat. At the first general election for this Parliament, my opponent, in following me round my constituency, got stuck up between two rivers, and was unable to 'get back to the big centres of population before polling day. I understand that he delivered his final address to the coachman who was driving him, o.ni the banks of the Flinders River.

But I would' point out that at the elections for the State Parliament, despite the fact that some of the constituencies are very compact, we have never secured a better average than 50 per cent., and I find that in several constituencies at: the last elections in Victoria more than 50 per cent, of the electors recorded their votes. In the divisions of Corangamite and Wannon, the percentage was very high indeed. Whatever date may be fixed for the holding of the elections will not make very much difference to South Australia. At the same time, if bv altering that date we can induce more electors to record their votes, I am thoroughly in sympathy with the alteration. The honorable member for Kennedy has suggested that if any change be made, the elections should be held in May. What does that mean? It means that if in Queensland, March is too wet to permit of the elections taking place then, May is certainly too wet in South Australia. In the latter State, many voters have to travel long distances to exercise the franchise. In the electorate of Grey, for example, many voters have to travel twenty or thirty miles to the polling, booth. If the elections were held in wet weather, these persons would be disfranchised. However, there seems to be a consensus of opinion that it is inadvisable to hold the elections in December, and I am quite prepared to fall in with the wish of the majority that) they shall take place in November. I am quite prepared to give the people every opportunity to record their votes. Indeed, I should like to see every elector exercising the franchise. This desirable result can be brought about. I am sorry that the right honorable member for Adelaide is not now able to take the active part in our legislation that he did in State politics, or I am sure he would have moved in this direction. The way to bring about the desired result is to impose a small penalty on those who will not take the trouble to record their votes. I hope that the time is close at hand when we shall take some step of that character. I have no fear of ever being asked to represent a minority, but I should not like to do so, and I am confident that no other honorable member would. If the matter were taken in hand by the Government, we could soon insure that no honorable member would be returned bv a minority vote.","N/A","GENERAL ELECTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[16]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The debate which has taken place this afternoon demonstrates that whatever date is fixed some in convenience will be experienced. But we have to regard this matter, not from, the stand-point of a State, but from that of the Commonwealth. There is a good deal in the contention of the honorable member for Bland that from the present time till the end of the year is a very unsuitable period for the conduct of a general election. In the first instance, we should inconvenience those who are engaged in the sugar-producing industry; in the next, we should affect those who follow the avocation of shearers, and finally, we should interfere with those who will be taking part in harvesting operations, towards the end of the year. I think that Parliament would be well advised if it made some alteration in the direction indicated by the honorable member for Bland, and determined that in future the general elections should take place at the beginning of the year. So far as New South Wales is concerned, I think that March or April would be a very suitable period at which to appeal to the country. There would be difficulties in giving effect to his suggestion, but these would not be nearly so insurmountable as are those which are experienced at the present time. Undoubtedly the last elections were delayed till the very worst period of the year, so far as the farming interests were concerned. In my own electorate the fact that there wa's not a contest for a seat in this House helped to minimize the vote which was cast on that occasion. The farmers' were in the very midst of their harvesting operations, and the period was one at which the greatest amount of damage could be done to the crops by windstorms. About a day or two Prior to the polling-day a severe windstorm passed over a portion of my own constituency, with the result that the standing crops were practically threshed out. The storm did not cover an extensive area, but the country which it affected was severely injured in the matter of its wheat return. This alarmed the farmers in the district who were not touched by the disturbance. They worked all hours in order to get their crops harvested. The result was that a large number of them did not trouble to record their votes, notwithstanding that some of them were working within sight of the polling booth. Upon the other hand, it has been suggested by farmers' representatives in Victoria, supported by the leader of the Opposition;, that the general elections should be held in October. So far as New South Wales is concerned, difficulties would be experienced in October, only in another direction. In December the farming community is, to a large extent, disfranchised, but in October the shearers and those engaged in the pastoral industry would share the same fate. Early in October shearing operations are in full swing, and towards the end of that month the grass seeds begin to ripen, so that one day's! seeding may mean a very, heavy loss in a man's wool returns. Consequently it is the great desire of the pastoralist to get his wool off the sheep's back within that period. What we should aim at is a mean between the period of the completion of the shearing and the heavy time of the harvesting - between, say, the 15th November and the first week of December. After the first week in December the difficulties in connexion with harvesting are accentuated every day till the end of the year. It has been suggested that the Labour Party desire the elections to be held as late in the year as possible, because they fear the farmer's vote. Personally I do not fear that vote. I am a farmer myself, and I have done something to make the farming movement in New South Wales a substantial success. I do not think that the party to which I belong has any cause to fear the farmers' vote. I hold that the elections should be held at a period of the year when the largest number of voters will be able to exercise the franchise, and consequently I urge the Government to fix a date between' the 15th November and the first week in December. Otherwise the difficulties experienced at the last election will be repeated.","N/A","GENERAL ELECTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[17]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

A similar attempt was made in the last Parliament. Owing to the provisions of the Constitution, and notwithstanding that honorable members sacrificed three or four months of their full tenure of office, an attempt w.as made in some of the States to thrust the responsibility for holding the elections at the wrong time of the year upon the Labour Party. But honorable members are aware that they had no more to do with it than had the members of the Opposition. No party and no Government in this Parliament, has had anything to do with it, because, as a matter of fact, the difficulty could not, under the terms of the Constitution, have been avoided. Any attempt to fix the responsibility upon a particular party on this occasion must fail for the same reason. I am sure that every member of the House desires that as full a vote of the electors as possible shall be recorded. The only question is which is the best time of the year to secure it. If an attempt were made to alter the Constitution so that the Federal elections could be held in March, I think that it would be successful, and I have no doubt it would be a desirable course. I intend to vote for the motion, and I have been somewhat surprised that any honorable member should oppose it. I quite expected that the Government would accept it. Its terms are not mandatory. It would be absurd to fix a definite date, and say that the elections shall be held before that date, because circumstances might arise which would render that impossible. But the carrying of this motion would be merely an expression of opinion bv the House that the next elections should be held not later than the 15th November. I believe that the members of the Government and of the Opposition, of the Country Party, and of the Labour Party, are alike anxious that, if possible, the next elections should be held not later than that date. That is not by any means an ideal time of the year for the purpose, but, in the circumstances, it seems about the best we can do. So far as South Australia is concerned, any time from October up to January would be about equally inconvenient for the farmers. From the beginning of November to the end of December would be the most inconvenient time for the fruit-growers. So that the latter end of the year is inconvenient for horticulturists as well as for agriculturists, as the harvesting of the fruit crops, as well as of the grain crops, takes place at that time. I suggest to Ministers that they should accept the motion. Personally, I can see no possible objection to it. The main consideration is that we should endeavour to secure an alteration of the Constitution, so that such a state of things should not happen again.  Mr. KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) £6.20]. - I hope that the Government will not accept this motion. To me, it looks too much like Victoria dictating to the rest of the Commonwealth. It is all nonsense to talk about the difficulty of getting a vote in country districts. I ask the Victorian representatives to look at the vote which the farmers of Darwin put up. If it is found that people will not vote in Victorian constituencies, it is because they have lost confidence in their representatives. It is a proof that the electors say ' We have had these men long enough; it is time to dispense with them, and it is not worth while to go to the polls to vote for them.'","N/A","GENERAL ELECTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[18]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Apparently it is proposed to appoint Government officials to exercise supervision over the butter fac-' tories, at which butter is being produced under the strictest supervision, and under the management of the best men obtainable. The Minister called a Conference in Sydney, to which he invited representatives of the dairying, fruit, and meat industries of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, and Tasmania. The Minister made a very lengthy speech in opening the Conference, and explained that his object in calling the delegates together was to seek their assistance in arriving at means by which he could administer the Commerce Act with as little friction as possible. He could have had no more laudable object than he then indicated. He also pointed out that if butter were graded, and marked under regulations as first class, a guarantee would be afforded to buyers which they could accept with full confidence. I need only refer to the evidence which was given before the Victorian Butter Commission to show that, so far as butter is concerned, the Victorian Government brand affords no guarantee as to the quality of the product. Mr. Sinclair, the Victorian Government expert, told the Commission that, so far, the Victorian Government brand had proved absolutely useless in the London market. Most honorable members who represent constituencies in which dairying is carried on, have received similar information from gentlemen who have visited the old country. The buyers in the London market have their own experts, and pay for the butter according to their judgment as to its quality. It is only natural that this should be so. It is well known that after transit from the Commonwealth to London, which extends over a period of seven or eight weeks, butter branded as second class frequently brings a higher price than that marked first class. This is due to chemical changes which take place during the voyage. The Minister also referred to the fact that butter branded as first class in one State would probably not be equal in quality to butter branded as' first class in another State. Take Queensland and Victoria - two States in which the climatic conditions are very different. The quotations in London indicate plainly that the Queensland butter is not entitled to be placed in the same class as the Victorian product. This difference in quality between the products of the various States will lead to great difficulties in the application of any uniform system of grading. It would be unjust to Queensland to prejudice her products bv marking them as inferior to those of New South Wales.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 1)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[2]/para[5]","N/A","N/A"

The Minister further stated that he failed to understand the arguments of those who were opposed to the grading of butter. He quoted largely from a report upon the New Zealand dairying industry, and also from a report of a Conference which was held at the Hawkesbury Agricultural College. He also read a letter that he had received from the Albury Co-operative Butter Company. That company does not occupy a very prominent position in connexion with the butter industry in New South Wales, and one of the delegates at the Conference interjected that the Albury factory did not turn out more than one ton of butter per week. Yet the Minister quoted a letter from that company as representing the views of a large body of farmers, in favour of grading. The whole of the great cooperative butter companies of New South Wales are entirely against a system of compulsory grading.

Further, I may say that the Queensland Government have taken action in this matter, and instructed Mr. Scriventhe Under-Secretary of the Stock and Agriculture Department, and one of the Queensland delegates to the Conference, to write a letter to the Comptroller-General of Customs in Svdney, objecting to what had been done. A request was made that the letter should be placed before the Minister, and I. have no doubt, that that request has been complied with. In view of the protests made by representatives of this great industry in Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria, and their request for a full and fair opportunity to be heard in connexion with this matter, I respectfully ask the Minister of Trade and Customs even now to consider the protests of these people, and to refrain from imperiously dictating to the men engaged in this industry what they are to do. If it were suggested that the persons engaged in this industry were manufacturing for local consumption or for export, an article unfit for human consumption, I would agree to interference by the Government. However, nothing of the sort is suggested, and it would appear to be the intention merely to place a host of officials upon the backs of the producers of Australia. The honorable and learned member for Darling Downs and the honorable member for Richmond, as members of the Ministry representing constituencies deeply interested, should get the Minister of Trade and Customs to give the representatives of the great dairying industry of Australia an opportunity of being heard in so important a matter. It is said that a system of compulsory grading is to be carried out, because it will be of advantage to the industry. There is to be no such thing as voluntary grading, which has, so far, been carried out in Victoria and South Australia. Some time ago I remember that the honorable member for Boothby, who had considerable experience in South Australia, told the House that voluntary grading in that State had worked very well, and that it had been found to be an advantage to the industry that producers should have the right to export their products without inspection, because that had kept the Government grading officials up to the mark. On behalf of the producers of South Australia, the honorable member strongly resented interference by the Federal Government in the matter.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 1)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[2]/para[16]","N/A","N/A"

Officials were appointed by the United States Government to inspect meat intended for local consumption and for export, and yet shameful frauds and iniquitous practices have prevailed in connexion with the meat business there. That experience does not make us hopeful of the labours of Government officials in the grading and inspection of produce in the Commonwealth. The Lord knows what sort of officials we shall get, and they will be brought into direct opposition with the responsible men connected with the dairies throughout the country. Any one who is cognizant of the history of the dairying industry in New South Wales must be aware that since the co-operative companies came into existence their one object has been to secure the production of a good article. Where the product of any factory, when placed on the market, is found to be not up to the mark, a representative is sent to the factory to find out what is the matter. The result of the system df inspection by the co-operative companies is that in New South Wales to-day, in the dairying industry, we are producing an article which is second to none, and we need not fear the competition of any other country. Another point is that, if we are to have this system of compulsory grading, it is likely that the business will have to be carried on in future in accordance with the Government stroke. We have had enough of the Government stroke in the political history of the States in years gone by, and it is very inadvisable to attempt to introduce it into our Federal system. The old saying that ' distant hills are green ' applies particularly in this connexion, because every one who desires to support the system of compulsory grading at once quotes New Zealand as an example. It is forgotten that New Zealand is peculiarly situated for the production of this article. With a good climate, a magnificent rainfall, and fresh grasses, those engaged in the dairying industry in New Zealand are able to produce an article of first-class quality, and a comparison of a country like New Zealand with Queensland, for instance, with her dry climate, is unworthy of attention. The success of the industry in New Zealand has been due, not to the adoption of a system of compulsory grading, but to the fact that the New Zealand Government, while favouring protective duties, impose no such duties upon implements and articles required by the man on the land. The farmers are able to get the agricultural implements, and everything else they require, at the cheapest possible rate, and with the additional advantage of their climate and rainfall those engaged in the dairying industry have been successful.  Any one who has had any experience of the London market for dairy produce must know that experts take no notice of the New Zealand grading of butter, and that it is on the quality of the article that buyers make their purchases. We are told that the New Zealand butter which is graded brings the highest prices in the English market. That is quite true, but butter which is not graded brings just as high a price. I had the pleasure recently of inspecting the Grassmere factory, in the Warrnambool district, which is one of the finest butter factories I have ever seen, and I am aware that the product of that factory, and of other factories in Victoria, has brought as high prices in the London market as has the best New Zealand butter. It is, therefore, perfectly ridiculous to contend that the high prices received for New Zealand butter in the London market are due to the adoption of the system of compulsory grading, when we know that it is the quality of the article, and not the grading marks on it, which is of interest to the buyer.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 1)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[2]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I wish however, to refer particularly to a matter which was brought under the attention of the Postmaster-General in Melbourne some months ago. He was informed that the state of the Postal Department in Western Australia was not what it should foe, and I think the representatives of that State are agreed that such was the case. As a result, a Board of three members, two of whom were officers in the New South Wales branch of the Postal Department, were appointed to make inquiries. I do not say that these officers are not thoroughly competent! and trustworthy. All I know is that, as the result of their report, the head's of the Postal, Telegraph, and Telephone Departments in Western Australia were removed from their positions, two of them permanently, the Deputy Postmaster-General being given six months' leave of absence. So far everything may have been satisfactory. The investigation may have demonstrated beyond doubt the unfitness of these officers for the positions which they held.

A couple of years ago, when he was Attorney-General in the Barton Government, he was asked a question on the subject, and he replied that this Parliament has no power to nationalize industries. Senator Drake, who succeeded him as Attorney-General, gave a similar opinion. Yet, when Parliament had gone into recess last year, he appointed Royal Commissions to inquire into the feasibility of nationalizing the shipping and tobacco industries, and the members of those Commissions have travelled' throughout Australia, spending public money in the effort to discover whether a case could be made out for nationalization. If the Prime Minister thinks that we have no power to nationalize industries, he should not authorize the expenditure of public money on fruitless inquiries.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 1)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[6]/continue[61]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Of course, the power to nationalize could be obtained by an amendment of the Constitution, and the leader of the Labour Party has challenged the Prime Minister to propose such an amendment. But, apparently, these challenges are merely so much platform rhetoric. As soon as he comes near the Prime Minister, he becomes a consistent, faithful, and complaisant ally.

That is how we differ. I wish to say one or two words with regard to another matter.  There seems to be a disposition to spend a little more public money in making additional appointments before the Government goes to the country. I see that one of the members of the Labour Party has a motion on the business-paper which indicates an anxiety on his part to have a Lieutenant-Governor appointed for Papua. I do not quite understand this, except it is desired to create another appointment for Papua. It is very strange that, after all the great haste that was displayed in passing the Papua Bill through this Chamber, the Government should not have brought the new constitution into operation. We were told last session that it was necessary to pass the Bill in order to provide a system of government for Papua. It was reported that all sorts of clangers were menacing the community there, and on that ground the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, and the honorable member for Cowper, and others who held' very strong opinions with regard to a certain matter, were induced to give way in order that provision might be made for a constitution without further delay. Seven month's have been allowed to pass without any action having been taken to give Papua the constitution for which provision is made bv Statute, and we have a right to some explanation. I venture to say that the Act would not have been passed in its present form had it not been for the appeal made by the Prime Minister upon the ground of urgency. Now, it appears that the Government do not want the constitution for Papua. I should like to know why. There is a vague statement in the Governor-General's speech with reference to the matter, and that is all that we know about it. Now, a private member suggests, even before the constitution is set up, that a Lieutenant-Governor should be appointed. How does that honorable member know that the Government have not already provided 'for a Lieutenant-Governor?","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 1)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[6]/continue[65]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Anybody who believes in electrobiology, who knows the effect of brain upon brain, must know that if, in the past, T erred a little, I did so Because it was not possible for me to remain respectable in the company in which I found myself. If I needed any excuse for what I have done, I should state that I felt then like a lotus in the mud of the Nile. Why, if honorable members socialised me, they would gee more than could be extracted from the whole front bench of the Opposition. Some persons who talk so wildly about Socialism could afford to regard Australia merely as a boardinghouse. They could walk out of it to-morrow, and leave nothing behind them but a dirty shirt. I was a member of the coalition party and I did the best that I could' for it. I was loyal to it, and did as much for it as any honorable member opposite. But when I found myself abandoned. I retained my principles and my electoral obligations. I have heard the leader of the Opposition repeatedly ask the question, ' How can I have been unfair? You see that 1 am out of office.' Need I remind honorable members that they have seen many a man reach for the bridle and fall off over the horse's crupper. When I was a member of the alliance, two Conservative members of the present Opposition came to me - the honorable member for Kooyong and the honorable member for Grampians will know who they were - and said 1 , 'Look at Mr. Reid and Mr. Cook. They are now aristocrats - they are leading the Conservatives. Cannot you rub the dandy brush over the honorable member for. Parramatta and take a few of the labour burrs off him?' Both the present leader of the Opposition and his deputy were covered with burr and straw and cobweb from head to heel - burr and cobweb which had been accumulated in passing along the sinuous and sombre passages that form the back-stairs entrance to the Labour room. Everything which they could offer to the members of the Labour Party to secure their support was offered bv them. Failing to secure an alliance with that Party, they approached the Protectionist Party. The honorable member for Kooyong and the honorable member for Grampians will know .who asked me if I could not put the currycomb over the honorable member for Parramatta, and' make him look a bit conservative. I said that I would do my best if they would deal with the right honorable member for East Sydney. I do not know what happened to the present leader of the Opposition but I saw the honorable member for Grampians and the honorable member for Kooyong walking out on to the lawn taking with them a hay rake and a harvester. I do not know what they wanted with those implements, but I saw them a little later on with a chaffcutter. I wish to show how consistent, how genuine, and how honorable is the deputy leader of the Opposition in his political views, and how trustworthy he is. I am not speaking personally. These political debates should have no individual aspect. I said that I would do my best with him, but did not take anything with me but a piece of chamois and a corn-cob. I found that he shed bts coat very easily. This occurred upon a Sunday. I saw him upon the following morning. He was looking like a Vermont ram - all wrinkles. I took him down to the basement again, and took a skin off him - a fiscal sinker's skin. On Tuesday morning I saw that he still presented a wrinkled appearance, so I set to work upon him, and took a free-trade skin off him. I could! smell the opium on it. Upon Wednesday he was again wrinkled, and accordingly I set to work and got a labour skin off him. I knew that it was a labour skin, because he said he objected specially to it, and the honorable member asked me to take it away quickly.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 1)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[7]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The right honorable gentleman proceeded to England to gain information in connexion with the consolidation of the States debts. Although the ground may to some extent have been cut from under his feet by the report prepared by Mr. Coghlan on the subject, I still think he did much good while in England in advertising Australia, and in correcting many of the false impressions of the Commonwealth that were prevalent there. He had not been a month in the mother country before every one knew that somewhere in these Southern Seas there was a land flowing with milk and honey, and the works of the right honorable gentleman. In advertising Australia the right honorable gentleman did signal service during the recess. Two things which he did in England reflect verv great credit upon him.

Another matter upon which I must congratulate the right honorable gentleman- was his steadfast advocacy of the principle underlying the Naval Agreement. A considerable amount of intriguing was going on for the purpose of representing the whole of the Commonwealth of Australia as being anxious to create an Australian Navy The right honorable gentleman, who was known to every one in England as Treasurer of the Commonwealth, and one of our leading public men, threw himself into the fray in a most courageous spirit, and did such work that the Navy League elected him a vice-president. Addresses were presented to the , right honorable gentleman in which his actions were highly commended, and I am aware from mv own  * knowledge that his action in this regard did more than anything else to counteract the intrigues in favour of an Australian Navy then going on in London. For this the right honorable gentleman deserves the thanks of the House. I believe that the Treasurer will admit the necessity for the presentation of some report on the question of the consolidation of States 'debts, and will give us an opportunity of discussing the question as one which is likely to be of importance at the next election. With, this slight token of my appreciation, I pass from the Treasurer to the Postal Department. Although Federation has been in existence for six years, verv little indeed has been done to co-ordinate the various postal services of the States. We still have in each of the States different stamps and a different system of postage in every way. In addition to that, the postages are not uniform. There are different denominations of stamps in different States. I suggest to the Department that all its efforts should be directed towards co-ordinating these State services and arranging for uniform denominations of stamps so that wherever one goes in Australia one may be able to obtain the stamps that one requires.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 1)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[8]/continue[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In New South Wales we have denominations which Victoria has not, and Victoria has denominations which we have not. I think that the same denominations of stamps should be obtainable in all the States. I must refer to one other point in connexion with the Post Office. We learn from this evening's newspaper that a combination of shipping companies has tendered for the Commonwealth mail contract.

There are one or two further points I propose to deal with in reference to the Defence Department - matters of administration solely, for I would not, of course, touch now on questions of policy. During recess, I understand that one of the days which should have been occupied in training by the field artillery, was occupied in giving a sort of display at a show in Sydney; and I do not think that is right. Artillery work is a highly technical art; and it is our laudable ambition to train up a citizen soldiery to be an absolutely serviceable field artillery. Every day of service should be used in service, and not in mere display. I merely ask the Minister to see that this sort of thing does not occur again, because it is not right, and will undermine the efficiency of the service if it is allowed to go on. I make these suggestions in all friendliness, because - I do not care which Government is in power - I am sure our only desire is to see the Department properly managed; and we hope that this, at any rate, will be one Department free from party influences.

As I have mentioned before, I spent fifteen months at Shoeburyness, twenty-two or twenty-three years ago, in going through a course 'of gunnery instruction, and', although, my education cost the British Government something like £1:60, I found, on visiting the forts at Queenscliff recently, that I knew as little about the manning of the guns' there as the rawest recruit. The honorable member for Wentworth pointed out to-night that the artillery arm is the scientific branch of the service, and I suggest that, in exchanging officers with other parts of the British Dominions, we should insist upon getting artillery and engineer officers. The Australian cavalryman is second to none in the British Dominions. I make that statement on the strength of some notes of a Conference of cavalry officers held in Great Britain, which were lent to me by the Inspector-General. Those officers declared that our cavalryman is perfect, and that they are sorry that the Imperial cavalryman is not equally effective and satisfactory. Then, with regard to the infantry, their evolutions and mode of attack are easily learned in books, or from special service officers. It is, however, useless to appropriate only £600 a year for the training of our officers abroad. However anxious an officer might be to learn, it would be impossible for him to obtain, in the course of a few months, any knowledge likely to be of service to Australia. In place of voting £600, I would vote £6,000 to secure the efficiency of our officers, because therein lies the secret of the successful organization of our forces. As regards the appointment of an Inspector-General, there is no one who values an Australian officer more than I do. I believe in having Australian officers for the Australian Army, because they possess the Australian sentiment; but I am not going to allow that feeling to run away with' my good sense. If we are going to have a Defence Force, we should have the best man possible as Commanding Officer, and pay him a good salary. There is no man in the Commonwealth today occupying a high position in the service who is fit to command the Australian Army. If it were to be called out, we should have to import an Imperial officer from either the old country or India. What officers in high positions here to-day have had the benefit of the experience which Imperial officers have had in India? I would point out to the Minister of Defence that it is of no use to pitch a feather-bed soldier into a position, where we want a man, to whom  Ave can look up, and of whom Ave can say, ' Well, if the time ever does come, there is the man who can command our Army.'

Our defence vote amounts to £700,000 or £800,000 a year, but in a sham affair, only a few miles from Brisbane, they not only had' to borrow the grocer's cart to bring in provisions, but to commandeer his store.

In many instances I have refrained from ventilating personal grievances here, and in each case the Minister has remedied the trouble. On the other hand, if a grievance cannot be remedied in that quarter, Parliament is the proper body to appeal to as the last resort. In the interests of good order and discipline, however, we should keep these grievances out of Parliament as much as possible. I have no more to say about the Defence Force to-night- But I wish to sound this warning note to the Government - that, unless they are careful in the selection of their Inspector-General, they will find that they have raised a house of cards which will fall down, with possibly disastrous results. I wish to say a few words with regard to the pensioning of the gunner or driver mentioned by the honorable member for Wentworth. It is the essence of meanness on the part of the Government if a man is, in the course of duty, disabled for life that they do not look after him. The British Government would not so act to the worst men or the lowest-paid men in the service. If a man gets injured iti the Imperial service, whether in peace time or active service, he gets a pension according to schedule. I believe that there should be drawn up a schedule of pensions to be paid to officers and men in the service who have been maimed or injured. Every one would then know what he was going to get if injured. The idea of turning out a young man with £272 to the mercy nf the world is preposterous. Sixteen years ago, when I was a sub-contractor, one of my men was hurt, and to-day I am keeping him, simply because he got injured in my service. Should not the Government do the same as a private employer is willing to do? I think it should. If no provision is made for this gunner to be pensioned, the regulations should be altered so that a pension may be granted to him. I wish now to speak on the question of trunk telephones, and I hope to have the support of every country member. We heard a great deal the other night about this Government, and I interjected that it was the only Government in Australia which had given the country the square deal that the towns and suburbs got. I am now going to put it to a practical test. In western Queensland many stations are connected with the telephone exchange in the town by some hundreds of miles of telephone. When the regulations were drawn out I had no idea that a line was going to cost the sum which the engineers computed, that is to say, a copper line for telephone use, with return metallic circuit. I have no doubt that the charges are all right. But what I want the Postmaster-General to do is to give the lines which are worked by the condenser system a chance of yielding a fair return. Take, for instance, the line from Gympie to Brisbane. The trunk rates were computed on the assumption that it would cost ^£4,000. Instead of the line costing £4,000, the expenditure amounted to only about £200 or £300. Yet the charges have been based upon the estimate of higher cost. I think that that is unfair. My constituents do not ask to be let off altogether, but they ask for a reduction of the rates. They do not ask that the charges should be reduced on the direct line, but that they should be relieved to an extent corresponding with the low cost of the service. I shall be satisfied if the Minister will give his consideration to this matter, and make some announcement in regard' to it when the Estimates are under consideration. Many of my constituents have written to me, and I have been in communication with the Department for several months on the subject. I should like the Prime Minister to furnish an answer to the question I asked on Friday last in regard to that memorable speech that was made by Colonel Riccardo, in December last.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 1)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[11]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
