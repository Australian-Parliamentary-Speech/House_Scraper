The following cablegram with reference to the Marshall Islands dispute has been received by His Excellency the Governor-General from the Secretary of State for the Colonies : - Referring to your telegram of 22nd July, note received from German Government couched in conciliatory tone, main points as follow : - Acquisition of land from natives in Marshall Islands forbidden since 2888 to all persons, including Jaluit Company. Action of Governor in sanctioning lease of land to company was illegal, and has been declared void. For the present only land that can be bought or leased consists of those areas which, before German occupation, belonged to non-native owners. German Government, however, intend to extend conditions as to acquisition of native land by permitting leases of land for trading stations, so that Burns, Philp, will find it much easier to establish domicile; at the same time, instructions will be sent to Caroline Islands to grant Burns, Philp permission to lease land for trading stations, but owing to difficulty of communication between Germany and South Sea protectorates, firm must wait for permission till October. German Government, while maintaining that action in Mar-' shall Islands has not infringed Declaration of 1886, further state that they are now occupied in revision of fiscal legislation for Marshall Islands, in which guiding principle will be communicated Burns, Philp through German Consul-General at Sydney. Trust your Ministers will agree. German note seems to afford prospect of settling questions at issue with regard to future trading in Islands. Despatch follows by mail. I may say that I have taken the liberty of suggesting a speedy method by which the agents of the Jaluit Company can be reached, in order that trading rights may be granted at the earliest possible date. I have since received a telegram from Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company, Sydney, as follows: - Acting Consul-General Germany definitely informs press has received official information that changes desired by Australia in Marshall Islands will be given effect to by October1st, and instructions that effect now on way to Jaluit.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","24","ROBINSON, Arthur","KZH","Wannon","N/A","N/A","353","I desire to bring under the notice of the House a question affecting its privileges. I refer to the interpretation which may be placed upon two standing orders passed by this Chamber upon the last day of the last session namely, standing orders 214A and 2.T4B, which read: - 214A. If, in any session, the proceedings ou any Bill shall have been interrupted by the prorogation of Parliament, the House may, in the next succeeding session, by resolution, order such proceedings to be resumed at the stage to which the Bill had been advanced in the previous session, provided a periodical election for the House has not taken place between such two sessions. 2 (411. Any such Bill may be sent to the Senate as if it had been introduced and passed bv the House in the second session.  Now it is possible, I believe, under these standing orders for the other Chamber to restore to its business-paper Money Bills in such a way as to seriously limit the privileges and powers of this House in regard to its control of public expenditure. For instance, a Bill appropriating public money might pass this House and be transmitted to another place and. not be finally disposed of in the one session. Then in the next session an attempt might be made - I do not wish to refer to a specific case, because that would be out of order - to revive that Bill, and it might be urged that the only control which this House could exercise over it would be by the discussion of a fresh message from the Governor-General. It is extremely doubtful whether the standing orders referred to can cover Bills which appropriate public revenue. In the Victorian Parliament T may say that similar standing orders obtain,' and last year, when a Bill appropriating public money was before the Legislature of this State- I refer to the Water Bill- it was passed by the Legislative Assembly, it was the intention of the Government, as notified in the press, to take it up in the Legislative Council during the next session. Upon consideration, however, by the President of the Legislative Council, 'the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, and the Law Officers of the Crown, it was] decided that the standing orders in question - which are practically a copy of those to which I have just drawn attention - did not apply to Bills originated by message - that they could not be applied to them in that way. and that the only way in which any Bil 1 appropriating revenue could be dealt with under those circumstances was by introducing it afresh into the lower Chamber. Section 56 of the Commonwealth Constitution Act states that the purpose of the appropriation must, in the same session, have been recommended by message of the Governor-General to the House in' which the proposal originates. I do not think that that section would cover any attempted action under the before mentioned standing orders to which I have referred. Obviously the matter is a very important one, and if the interpretation of the standing orders to which I have alluded can be held to relate to Bills which appropriate public money, it means that the control of expenditure by this House, under the forms which it now possesses, must then vanish, because the only control which we could then exercise over expenditure would be by consideration of a fresh message from the Governor-General, and that message might be submitted at the fag end of the session, and in a thin House.","N/A","LAPSED BILLS: PRIVILEGE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The point I am now raising was brought forward for the first time in the Victorian Parliament this year, when we saw a Government which is supposed to be a conservative one take action for the purpose of conserving the privileges of the lower House. This question is an important one, which should be considered very carefully. I do not raise it in any antagonistic spirit, but I think that it is a matter upon which a special Select Committee, consisting of a few members might reasonably; te appointed to confer with the President and Mr. Speaker, and to report to this House - the main question for consideration being whether it is possible under these Standing Orders to revive in another place in the next session a Bill which appropriates public money in any shape or form.","N/A","LAPSED BILLS: PRIVILEGE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[1]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In making that reply, however, I was referring to the period when the measure was in an incomplete stage in this House. In that case it could be reinstated here only by what might amount to a fourth reading.

If the Standing Orders Committee brought up a report declaring, say, that it was not advisable that the Standing Orders in question should be followed in the case of Bills requiring a message, a difficulty would obviously arise if the Government had at the same time been using them in connexion with such Bills. I would suggest, therefore, that it would be reasonable, for the Government, if they have in contemplation, proceedings of this kind, to stay their hands for the week or more necessary to enable the matter to be considered by the Standing Orders Committees. I would remind him that as leader of the House, he is the custodian of our privileges, and that in any case of doubt as to whether the privileges of this House are being infringed in any way it is his duty to err upon the side of caution. It is upon that ground only that I make this suggestion to him. If confirmation of my view be necessary, it will be found on turning to Hansard, page 1479, Vol. 2, Session 1901, where a distinguished member of this House is reported as follows: -","N/A","LAPSED BILLS: PRIVILEGE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

But what does this position amount to? After having considered a message from the Crown in respect to the Bill about which the present controversy has arisen, we proceed to pass it. It goes through all its stages here, and presumably the House has distinctly made up its mind as to what its attitude is. And it is now seriously suggested that in regard to this class of measure we should insist upon going through the whole process again. That view will not commend itself to the people in the constituencies. Surely they have no reason to complain of any undue speed being exhibited by this Parliament, of any undue haste, or of our rushing business through. For that reason, I trust the sensible rule which is in existence in all the State Parliaments, or in most of them, as far as I am aware, will be given effect to, and will not be emasculated in the fashion suggested by the honorable and learned member for Wannon.

I admit that the matter has been fairly debated, but there are a few questions which deserve the consideration of honorable members and of the country. During this debate there has been a good deal of misrepresentation by some members' of this Chamber, and also' on the part of the press outside. Before proceeding to discuss the general question, I may be permitted to make a few remarks as to the reasons for the coalition which recently eventuated. When the Federal Parliament was first elected the Protectionist Party represented about thirty-two votes of the direct supporters of Sir Edmund Barton and Mr. Deakin, and the Labour Party numbered sixteen, consisting of eight freetraders and eight protectionists; while the free-traders numbered twenty-six. This meant forty-two votes in favour of a protectionist policy as opposed to thirty-five votes on the other side. The Tariff was, therefore, framed by protectionists, although I have heard some people say that the free-traders interfered with the protectionists in their work. It is true that we free-trader's fought as hard as men could in favour of the policy in which we believed, endeavouring to bring about reductions which we thought to be in the interests of the country, and we could not have brought about any reductions had it not been for the occasional support of a. number of protectionists. I wish to show that the Tariff was not framed by the freetraders. No doubt we helped to modify the Tariff, and make it more acceptable to the community, but it was a protectionist Tariff, framed by a protectionist Government, and supported by a majority of protectionists in the House. The Tariff having been adopted, the then honorable and learned member for Hunter, Sir Edmund Barton, and his Government determined to have what they termed a fiscal truce. Mr. Deakin, when Prime Minister, went to Ballarat, and there made a long speech in favour of a truce. The honorable and learned member asked honorable members to leave the Tariff alone. The protectionists had fought for the Tariff, and were satisfied with the result of their labours, and, therefore, they asked the people, not only of Ballarat, but throughout the Commonwealth to return to Parliament a body of men who would be prepared to sink the fiscal issue for the time being - who would be prepared to maintain the Tariff as it then was during this Parliament. Notwithstanding that appeal made by the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, the Deakin party returned to the House with their membership reduced to, I think, twenty-six; while the Labour Party had gained seven votes, which were practically taken from the protectionist side of the House. It will thus be seen that at the opening of this Parliament the protectionist' or Deakin party had only twenty-six votes, as against twenty-six on the side of the free-traders, and twenty-three in the Labour Party.","N/A","MINISTERIAL STATEMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","188","SMITH, Sydney","L2I","N/A","FT","N/A","363","I am not going into that question. I am showing the state of the Labour Party at the time the honorable and learned member for Ballarat met the House. When the Watson Government was formed an alteration took place in the state . ot parties. There were then twenty-seven on the side of the Government, twenty -three representing the Deakin party, and twenty-five of our party, one of our members, the honorable member for Grey, having transferred his allegiance to the Labour Party. When the Watson Government met the House, the Labour Party had a following including the members of the Government, of twenty-seven members. Then we had the combination known as the Watson-Isaacs party; but the honorable and learned member for Ballarat expressed his dissatisfaction at the state of affairs. He pointed out that it was impossible for the business of Parliament to be carried on with three parties. The honorable and learned gentleman made some very strong statements on this subject. I remember reading one which he made, in this House, I believe, in August, 1904, when the Labour Government was in power. He said : -  Those most closely allied with the Labour Party, those who make the greatest sacrifices for them, who stand closest to them, and who most wish to help them, are always, the first to be sacrificed by them. One may help the Labour Party for one month, two months, three months, or four months; but the moment one stops, or makes a single independent step, he is treated as a bitter enemy. That was the honorable and learned gentleman's opinion of the Labour Party in 1904, and I wonder what he proposes to do now. The honorable and learned gentleman has not now a following of thirty-two but only o'f nineteen, including honorable members who are anxious to sit as close as they can to the cross benches. I believe there are only four honorable members who have the courage still to sit directly behind the Government. All the rest I notice get as near as possible to the cross benches. Notwithstanding this the honorable and learned member for Ballarat apparently is now quite prepared to accept the three-party arrangement.-. He further said of the Labour Party : - After having been apparently trusted, he will be treated as if he had been suspected from the first moment; he will be condemned as if he had attacked them from the outset. This is the treatment which follows alliances with political machines. When you come to deal with the machine you are dealing with something which has no loyalty, no conscience, and no judgment. That was the opinion of the honorable and learned member for Ballarat of the party that is now keeping him in power. The honorable 'and learned' gentleman evidently held that opinion for some time, because, when the proposal to include railway servants in the Arbitration Bill was carried he took that as a vote of censure, and retired, and he has pointed out since that it was impossible to carry on the Government in a satisfactory manner, and impossible for a man to exhibit any independence of judgment or action in the House constituted as it then was of three parties. The honorable and learned member for Ballarat and the right honorable member for East Sydney then formed an alliance, and so far as the fiscal issue was concerned,, it was decided' that there should be a. truce. Honorable members supporting the right honorable member for East Sydney were in this matter giving up more than the protectionists, because it must not be forgotten that the protectionists had had the arrangement of the Tariff by reason of the majority they commanded in the first Parliament. They were able practically to pass any Tariff they pleased - of course in a fair way - and a Tariff was framed with which they were satisfied, and which they accepted. Still we were willing to have a fiscal truce, though in New South Wales and some of the other States it was well known that a majority of the people were in favour of a revenue Tariff. In order to carry on fair legislation, without respect to class interests, and in the interests only of the community as a whole, we arranged for the time to give up our fight for freetrade. Although the Tariff was a. protective one, we assented to a fiscal truce, and therefore gave up a good deal more than did the protectionists - in fact they gave up. practically nothing. Honorable members are aware that I was one of the persons who met the right honorable member for East Sydney, the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, and the right honorable member . for Balaclava in connexion with the proposed coalition. A plan of campaign, and the policy it was thought best to adopt, in the event of both parties agreeing to the coalition proposals, were arranged. Every one understood - at all events, I did - at the outset that the honorable and learned member for Ballarat would be a member of the coalition Ministry. I thought that the honorable and learned gentleman would be one of the members of the coalition Government, but after a time I gathered that he would not consent to join the Government.' I do not know what his reasons were, and the honorable and learned gentleman did not state them. We found,, also, that the right honorable member for Balaclava was disinclined to join the Government. We were then in this position: that the two prominent members of the Deakin party who had met us in conference practically decided not to join any coalition Government. Honorable members will understand that it was impossible in such circumstances to arrange any satisfactory coalition.","N/A","MINISTERIAL STATEMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[1]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The word of the right honorable member for Balaclava will be accepted throughout the Commonwealth. Although we had differed with the right honorable member for Balaclava for many years upon the fiscal question, we were able, when the truce had been established, to meet him and other members of his party on common ground, and I may say that my association with the four protectionist members of the late Ministry was of a very pleasant character. We were able to join them in doing work of an administrative character - we had not much time for legislative work - which, I think, will prove to be really helpful to the people of the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister accused the leader of the Opposition of having acted the part of a traitor in regard to the fiscal truce. He asserts that the right honorable gentleman alone is responsible for the present position of affairs. As has previously been stated, however, Ministers were unanimous that the only honorable course open to them was to submit the Governor-General's speech at the opening of Parliament in the form in which if was presented. We have been told that if we had cared to adopt the same course that had previously been followed by the Prime Minister, and had been content to submit to anything that might be demanded of us. we could have carried oh the Government. No Government with which I have been associated has ever resorted to such a course in order to retain office.

That accusation proves that, at all events, we did not cling to office. The honorable member for Bland may laugh, but he cannot deny that we exhibited no desire whatever to remain in office under humiliating circumstances. That fact is evidenced by the accusation that we abandoned Ministerial office without any just cause. That is the charge levelled against us by the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, who declares that had we submitted our policy, he would have supported us, and that we made a mistake in regarding his speech as antagonistic to the Government.

Possibly the honorable and learned member for Ballarat entertained the impression that he would be able to induce the four protectionist members to whom I have referred, and others, who were pledged to a fiscal truce, to go back upon the right honorable member for East Sydney. That is a sufficient answer to those who accuse the right honorable member for East Sydney of having committed an act of treachery. Do honorable members opposite imagine for one moment that if he had been guilty of any such act, the right honorable member for Balaclava would have remained loyal to him?

Not one member of the late Ministry has gone back upon the fiscal truce which was agreed upon, and that fact alone should prove that there is no justification for the contention of the Prime Minister that the compact was broken by us. The protectionist members of the late Ministry are just as true to their fiscal faith as are any honorable members now sitting opposite.' The right honorable member for Balaclava was selected by the honorable and learned member for Ballarat as one with whom he should be associated in the negotiations to bring about the Coalition, and that shows that he felt he was a man upon whom he could rely. The fact that the late Treasurer, together with the honorable member for Gippsland and the honorable and learned member for Corinella, all of whom are well and favorably known throughout Victoria, agree that the action taken by the late Prime Minister, in regard to the GovernorGeneral's speech, was a right and proper one, should be sufficient to show that our party acted straightforwardly in regard to the alliance.

They have made many charges against us, but the best proof that we are on the right side is that no honorable member opposite has been able ' to show that we have misrepresented anything. and honorable members who for many years were strong supporters of the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, associated with him in public life, and to whom in a large degree he owed the position he attained in Victorian politics, admit that the free-traders who were parties to the coalition acted throughout in a straightforward way. The honorable gentlemen to whom I refer have been loyal and true to their compact, and honorable members on this side have no reason whatever to complain of the loyalty of the four protectionists who joined the late coalition Government. It is to be regretted that the honorable and learned member for Ballarat did not acf. with more candour, at all events to honorable members of his own party, when he determined to make the speech which he delivered at Ballarat.

I can quite understand that a great many of them are anxious to put the events of the past week or two as far and as fast behind them as they can. They would like to give the impression to the country that nothing unusual has happened - that what has occurred has been simply the usual turning over that takes place in Parliaments. But so far as Victoria is concerned there is evidence of something so unusual having happened that it will not be forgotten for a very long time. When we see public men who have been associated with each other for a quarter of a century, and some of whom have grown grey in the service of Victoria, flatly contradicting each other, I think it is due t© the public that they should learn something more about the cause of the trouble. I hold that it is more important that the integrity of our public men should be placed above suspicion than that we should pass on to the transaction of business without discussing the situation. Only those who are fully acquainted with the events which have passed are able to communicate the real facts to the electors. Therefore, I feel that it is my duty to speak in the presence of such honorable members as choose to remain, and to put the matter before the country under circumstances which will admit of my being contradicted if I do not adhere to facts. If I were to go to my constituents, I might make statements which could not be very well combated by those who disagreed from me. But here any statements, which are beside the facts, or which overstep the fair bounds of criticism, may be questioned. The friends of the Prime Minister have relied for their justification of his action entirely upon his previous good conduct and reputation. I admit at once that no one had a better record than had the honorable and learned gentleman. At times, however, men of high reputation do things which are not capable of being readily understood, and to my mind the action of the Prime Minister, if it does not lead to his condemnation, will arouse grave suspicion in the minds of many of his old friends. I should prefer to see that feeling removed, if possible. It is stated that all the present trouble has arisen out of the Ballarat speech. All the old friends of the Prime Minister thought that that utterance involved a breaking away from the coalition. I was in a minority practically of one, because I did not derive from it such a strong impression. This may have been due to the fact that, although I did not particularly favour the appointment of the Tariff Commission, I was all along desirous that a board outside of Parliament should be appointed to inquire into the alleged Tariff anomalies, rather than that unauthorized statements should receive public credence. Reading the speech in that light, I did not regard it as .so significant as did some other people. The Prime Minister has stated that when he delivered that speech, he was not disloyal to the coalition, that he had no idea of breaking it up, and that he was entirely misunderstood. I am sorry to say, however, that I cannot lit in his subsequent actions with his words. The part he has played has created a feeling that some explanation is necessary to free him from suspicion. I consider that the late Government placed themselves in a somewhat extraordinary position by bringing down the Governor-General's speech at the opening of Parliament in the form in which they submitted it, and I was not surprised that the present Prime Minister should have moved his amendment upon it. What did occasion me .astonishment, however, was that before moving his amendment he should have made absolutely certain that the adoption of it would have the effect of breaking up the coalition. There is no question about that. There were parties to the coalition other than those who occupied the Government benches. The fact of the GovernorGeneral's speech being prepared, and being unanimously agreed to by Ministers, did not show that any party was breaking away from the coalition. It merely meant that those men who had been- deputed to lead the coalition had decided to take up a position which some people thought was not consistent with their duty as leaders. There were still twenty-nine members of the coalition party who were not in the secret of the GovernorGeneral's speech. Only nine honorable members knew of the decision of the Government, namely, the six Ministers., the Government whip, and the mover and seconder of the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply. There were still twenty-nine honorable members who had done nothing to break up the coalition, and I contend that we were perfectly entitled to some voice in deciding what was to be done. But what did the Prime Minister do? He called together his own immediate supporters, and tried the Government before a packed jury consisting of ten honorable members, including himself. He then decided to move his amendment, and not only so. but to go to the leader of the Labour Party and enter into an arrangement with him which would have the effect of smashing the coalition. I contend that we did not receive fair play.","N/A","MINISTERIAL STATEMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

He induced his old friends to join that Government, and promised them his support. He was to act as- their guardian angel, and he thought that he could render them more assistance by sitting behind them as a private member than he could in the capacity of a Minister. I do not know how long a period was occupied in effecting a change in his opinions, but it seems to me that the position which the honorable and learned gentleman took up when he delivered certain speeches throughout the country was somewhat inconsistent with his attitude towards the gentlemen to whom I have referred. He became, it seems to me, the mouthpiece of parties outside this House who were opposed to the Government, and he attempted to play two roles. That is how he came to break down.

One of the conditions of the colony was that freedom of speech was not only a privilege, but a duty, and the women met, and absolutely refused to wear the prescribed dress. They agreed to 'boycott' - to use a modern word - any women who wore such a dress. In other words, they decided not to speak to a woman so attired, and that was the beginning of the breaking up of the colony.

I personally do not concern myself with these extreme views. My desire is that we should guard ourselves, as far as possible, from the destruction of those characteristics of independence that have made our race what it is. The desire that those characteristics should be preserved is really the foundation of the contest against Socialism. Even the watered-down platform of the Labour Party goes a great deal further in the direction of risk or danger to our. natural characteristics than is desirable; it goes so far in that direction, at all events, that we should enter a very strong protest against it. The leader of the Labour Party says that he desires, in the first place, that the State shall deal only with monopolies.

To show that my view is not solely that of an opponent, I have here a cutting from a newspaper, which I venture to say, is of all the newspapers in the Commonwealth, the most devoted to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Melbourne Herald , which, in season and out of season, has trumpeted his good qualities for the last fifteen or twenty years. The Herald said on 1st July : -  The Ballarat speech provided the last essential factor. Mr. Deakin has since stated that his intention was not to intimate that he, one of the makers of the coalition, had decided to withdraw his support from it, but the Reid-McLean Government interpreted the remarks of its decidedly candid 'supporter' as a plain intimation that it had ceased to possess his confidence, and - notwithstanding Mr. Deakin 's disclaimer - it is not easy to see that the speech could have any other meaning. That is not the judgment of an opponent. It is not the judgment of a hostile critic. It is the judgment of one of the honorable gentleman's most enthusiastic supporters - that it is not easy to see from his speech at Ballarat that he had any intention but to turn out the Reid-McLean Government at the very earliest opportunity. That being so, I do not think that the Prime Minister behaved in a way in which he ought to have behaved to the late coalition Government and to his own) colleagues in it. It is 'all very well to say that he did not mean to turn out the Government. The judgment or the ordinary man in the street is, after all, the judgment that disposes of these questions. The man in the street puts it in a rough-and-ready manner, such as I suppose you, Mr. Speaker, would not permit me to imitate; but, we may say that the man in the street puts it somewhat as follows: - 'Mr. Deakin went to Ballarat and made a speech which every one thought was meant to 'turn the Government out. He afterwards said he did not mean to turn the Government out; and he proved that he did not mean to turn the Government out by moving in the. House a motion which did turn them out.' All the refinings and eloquent perorations of the Prime Minister will not remove from the public mind the impression that he has not behaved in a way that we have been accustomed to from him. I can say, with all earnestness and sincerity, that there was no man in Victorian politics of whom I had a higher opinion than the Prime Minister. That opinion has been very rudely shaken by the events of the past few weeks. It is for this reason that I felt it to 'be my duty to emphasize the remarks made by the honorable member for Grampians. With re gard to the programme of the present Government, I think we can safely say from the papers that have been supplied to us. -from the drafts of Bills and the clauses that they contain - that the influence of their masters is apparent in the most unmistakable way. The pressure from the third party is absolutely apparent in the two papers which have been put into our hands. I venture to say that the larger proportion of the present Government - had the late coalition remained in office, and brought forward such Bills - would have voted against the proposals that are now brought forward in their name. But circumstances alter cases. Ministers hold office with the feeling of insecurity arising from their dependence upon the good will of the Labour Party. Therefore, their legislation is shaped on these extraordinary lines to win the support and admiration of that party. I do not blame honorable members of the Labour Party. There can be no doubt that the triumph is in their hands. They have fairly won it. They have done nothing which can be called dishonorable. In everything they have done they have acted with scrupulous honesty. The position they are now in redounds to their credit. They are in a position to secure - and they have the power to secure - legislation and administration, such as they desire, and they have to take responsibility for neither the legislation nor the administration. We have been informed by the Prime Minister that, amongst the various projects to be put before us, will be proposals in connexion with preferential trade. If that be so I hope that when they are considered by this House, they will be discussed in much better style than was the case last session. Honorable members may recollect that the present Prime Minister made a brilliant speech in favour of his motion, and then buried himself in a room in some other part of the building during the rest of the debate. The attendance rarely exceeded half-a-dozen members during the discussion of the subject. I hope that Ministers, at least, will put in an attendance during the time when the question is debated. I intend to move an addition to any motion that is submitted to the same effect as the addition which I moved on the previous occasion, namely, that the preference that we give to Great Britain should be of such a nature as will lead to an increase in the trade being done between. Gre a t Brit a in a nd Austr a li a . In reg a rd to other propos a ls of the Government, we h a ve been informed th a t the previous Government h a d intended to introduce some Bills upon the s a me subjects. The title of a Bill m a y le a d us to believe th a t we a re a ll in f a vour of it; but the cl a uses of the me a sure m a y m a ke a ll the difference between support a nd opposition. I suppose th a t a m a jority of honor a ble members - perh a ps 95 per cent, of them - were In f a vour of a Concili a tion a nd Arbitr a tion Bill. But very few honor a ble members were in f a vour of th a t me a sure in the form in which it w a s brought in by the right honor a ble member for Adel a ide, whose a bsence on the present occ a sion we so much deplore. I do not think there 'w a s a nything like a m a jority of honor a ble members who were in f a vour of th a t Bill in the sh a pe in which it w a s de a lt with a t the inst a nce of the first De a kin Government.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","715","CONROY, Alfred","K4E","N/A","N/A","N/A","384","That is so, just at present, I admit. I do not know that it is necessary for me to deal with the intrigues which displaced the late Government. It is true there was a coalition formed, which involved the sinking of principle on both sides. Free-trade and protectionist principles had to be sunk on one side and the other, and some sacrifice was certainly made by honorable members. -I was one of those who did not regard with great favour the sinking of the fiscal principles which I support. It seems to me, however, that before we can begin to discuss by what principles a Government should be guided in carrying on the business of the country, we must first take care to preserve the Government itself. If the Government cease to exist there can be no carrying out of principles on one side or the other. It appeared to me, from statements made by many members of the Labour Party, including the leader of that party, that we were face to face with a condition of affairs that would not have allowed of the assertion of any principle whatever. The Labour Party have adopted, or they say they intend to adopt, the new programme of Socialism. I do not know why the word ' labour ' is not good enough to describe the party, because, properly understood, it is wide enough to embrace everything. The word is certainly . wide enough to embrace all that great section of the community whom we in Parliament are chiefly concerned in looking after, namely, the workers of the. community; and by that I mean workers of ail classes. I do not in tend to back up the drone, whether he be of the wealthy class or of the poor class; to fit both there is an apt term - loafer. If a man is a loafer, he ought not to be able to call on Parliament to assist him in any way; there are enough honest men and women in the community who require the whole of our attention. We ought not to stretch our laws for the benefit of a small section; and we cannot but be surprised that, of late, the Labour Party have chosen to think that only those who refuse to work are those to whom we should offer consolation. In fact, the 'bummers' of society are to be most considered - only those who loaf about the parks, crying out for work,- and praying they may never get it, are to have their complaints listened to. It was quite refreshing to hear the Treasurer of the Queensland Government offer some remarks on this subject. He explained that although the members of the Government to which he belonged called themselves a Labour Government, they were not addicted to any platform nonsense, and would try to assist only those who endeavoured to assist themselves; that, in fact, their labour platform was a platform for the benefit of workers, and not of idlers. I could wish that we were animated by the same spirit in our legislation. But we keep trying to stretch our laws so as to include a section of the community whom we cannot and ought not to help. I am afraid that if we did help them we should probably only succeed in taking from them the very small spirit of independence that now exists amongst them. It must be very painful to us all to have to make any strictures on the personal integrity of the Ministerial Party, but in outside life terms would be used, concerning the breaking of his word by the present Prime' Minister, that would be hardly parliamentary. I can only say that personally I felt a great deal of regret that the honorable and learned gentleman should be the one to act as he did. I regret that there is not some party outside of Parliament which would treat the honorable and learned gentleman in the way in which I think he deserves. There can be no doubt that if men generally were to act in the same way, no such thing as social life, as we understand it, would be possible. Men would be absolutely unable to trust one another, in even the smallest concerns of life, and social life, as we understand it, would break down. If the honorable and learned gentleman had a conscience, one might say that it would be better to leave him to its reproach. I hold that he has lowered the standard of our public life as no other person has ever done yet. I cannot call to mind, nor can any other honorable member, any instance in which a man has so deliberately broken away, and, so far as we can see, solely on the ground of some personal gain, from an alliance entered into by himself. I, for one, have always objected to the very small allowance that members of this Parliament receive. I have always said that the discrepancy between the allowance given to honorable members, and that given to Ministers, is too great - not that that given to Ministers is too large, but that that given to honorable members generally, is very much too small. I regret to have to say that as the late conduct of the Prime Minister does not come up to the standard of honour,, which I, for one, think ought to be observed, I am forced to the conclusion that there must have been some special consideration causing the honorable and learned gentleman to act as he did.

Men who, like myself, never cared for the alliance, yet waited on . the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, and asked him whether he intended to give the alliance his full support, and whether He really understood the position he had taken up. 'The answer has already appeared in print, and is known to us all. The honorable and learned gentleman pointed out that, so far as he was concerned, the alliance was for the life-time of the present Parliament. There can be no harm in saying what has already appeared in the press, that the honorable and learned gentleman intended to observe 'the compact for the life-time of the present Parliament. We know how it has been observed, and I say that the House, after the exhibition which we have had, would do well to take into consideration the fact that there should not be room even for a suggestion that honorable members may feel pecuniary pressure to such an extent that it may affect their political conduct. I hope that some effort will be made to increase the allowance paid to honorable members generally. I have always held that the present allowance is much too small, and I am not now, for the first time, advocating that the remuneration made to honorable members should be considerably increased. The Federal Parliament, instead of meeting for two, three, or four months in the year, as was suggested at the first Convention, has so far met for something like seven months in each year. This utterly destroys the possibility of honorable members pursuing any other avocation, or engaging in any other walk in life, and, as the the average parliamentary life of members is something like ten years, during that time they should °t least receive such remuneration as would enable them to carry on their work when they retire from a parliamentary position. Their position as members of Parliament is dependent upon popular favour, and that is such a very erratic thing that one cannot reckon upon the continuance for any definite time of the allowance. I shall not dwell on the subject further; but I point out that, in my opinion, the discrepancy to which I have referred has been an awful misfortune - I fear to be unparliamentary - and I never felt that so keenly as ' since I have observed the conduct of the honorable and learned member for Ballarat. The first measure which the late Government proposed to submit to Parliament was the Redistribution of Seats Bill. I t should be regarded as the first duty of any Ministry to submit a measure of that kind, because we are all aware that the statisticians of the States have demonstrated that New South Wales is entitled to an additional representative. Their calculations have been made on the same basis as those which gave to Victoria its twenty-three representatives. Therefore we cannot in justice deny to New South Wales that which has already been granted to Victoria. I would go the length of saying that the denial of an additional representative to New South Wales, in conjunction with the refusal of this Parliament to settle the Federal Capital question, will probably result in the secession of New South Wales from the Federal union.","N/A","MINISTERIAL STATEMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[4]/continue[12]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Norwegian Parliament carried a resolution in favour of a dissolution of the union between the two countries. It is true that a referendum is now being taken orr the subject, but that does not alter the fact that separation has already been resolved upon by the Parliament. Judging from the feeling exhibited in New South Wales, I venture to say that the State Executive, if supported by the resolution of the State Parliament, would not hesitate to act in the direction I have indicated.

If we are to look forward to the socialistic millennium, which the party to which the honorable member belongs wishes to bring about, the quantity of mail matter carried will be beyond computation. I should think that the complaints alone would represent five or six times the quantity of mail matter which is carried at the present time. The next matter to which I desire to refer is that of the redistribution of seats in this House. Will honorable members seriously argue that it is possible for us to continue our present line of conduct without offending the people of New South Wales? Already they are exceedingly angry about this matter. Rightly or wrongly they look upon the creation of the present Government, headed by the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, asa deliberate attempt to thwart New South Wales in her endeavour to obtain her proper share of representation in this Parliament. Do we find in the Ministerial outline of policy any statement by the Prime Minister, which is likely to disabuse their minds of that notion? Do we not know that if we decline to give New South Wales an additional representative in this House - and the refusal of the Ministry to introduce any Bill dealing with the matter indicates that they intend to deny that State any additional representation - it will constitute another reason why the people of New South Wales should take the action I have referred to through their State Parliament. If they are unable to obtain their proper share of representation here, there is no other course open to them but to ask their own Parliament to take such action as will either break up the union, or, at all events, restrain the Commonwealth from collecting any further Cus to ms revenue until these matters have been set right We know very well that if the New South Wales Parliament carried a resolution to that effect - or even if a referendum of the States were taken upon the matter - there would be an overwhelming majority against the continued existence of the union. This statement may be regarded as a mere matter of speech, but I assure honorable members that they have only to gauge the feeling of the people in their own States to be perfectly satisfied* that if a referendum were taken it is very doubtful whether a vote in the affirmative would be recorded in any State, no matter how large the majority may have been which previously declared for union. It must not be forgotten that in New South Wales 84,000cc or 85,000 votes were cast against Federation, and I know that the conduct of the Commonwealth Government in imposing very heavy taxation upon its people aroused the greatest friction. That friction, however, would have been overcome had the people believed that it was deliberately levied by the representatives of Australia as a whole..  But are we to-day acting as the representatives of Australia, when we d'eny to New South Wales the additional representative to which she is entitled, and when we abso>lutely break the law of the Constitution Act itself?

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","838","CONROY, Alfred","K4E","N/A","N/A","N/A","389","The honorable member's statement is quite incorrect. Queensland is not entitled to another representative, but the statists have declared that New South Wales is. Yet this Parliament refuses to grant that State its proper share of representation. But even if there were no provision made in the Constitution for another representative for New South Wales, the demand for a redistribution of seats ought, at all events, to be irresistible. The inequalities which have been already quoted, are so great that one is staggered to learn that a man in one electorate possesses three times the voting power of a person in another. I leave the members of the Labour Party to answer this question: Assuming that we had a constituency so fashioned that a man of property possessed a vote which had exactly three times the value of the vote enjoyed by a worker in another constituency, what would be said? Would- it not be said that that state of affairs constituted plural voting upon an extremely large scale? I feel sure that under such circumstances there would be no cessation to their endeavours to get such an anomaly corrected. But when we allow the electors in one particular portion of New South Wales to exercise three times the voting power possessed by the electors in another part of that State, no outcry whatever is heard. Unfortunately, the bulk' of honorable members in this House decline to allow New South Wales any rights whatever. If it is thought that a measure would benefit New South Wales honorable members representing other States will at once break the law in every direction; they will at once say. ' We do not intend to carry out the law.' While they profess to be in favour of certain proposals, they refuse to allow the laws that would give effect to (hose proposals to be carried out. Can any one doubt that at least one-half of the opposition to the last Ministry was due 'to the fact that it proposed to at once bring in a Bill for the Redistribution of Seats? The real motive underlying the action taken by the honorable and learned member for  Ballarat was the desire to deprive New South Wales of a vote. I regret that the honorable and learned gentleman should ' have laid himself open to such a charge, lt cannot be denied that that accusation is being made most freely against him, and in order to obviate suspicion in this regard the Prime Minister should have placed a Bill for the redistribution of seats in the very forefront Of his programme. We find him, however, declining to exercise ordinary care in the matter. He will possibly hand over a measure dealing with the question to the tender care of the Minister of Trade and' Customs. We know how a similar measure fared in his hands on a previous occasion. It is true that he is no longer at the head of the Department having the administration of the electoral laws; but no doubt the honorable member will exercise an influence over the Government in regard to the proposed redistribution that will make itself felt. Nearly every honorable member who has spoken during this debate has pointed to the misconduct, shall I say, of the present Ministry, and to all the charges of misconduct that have been made against the Ministry, the Labour Party appear to have given then full assent. They have applauded even allegation. They seem to think that 110 words can be found too strong to describe the conduct of the present Ministry. If that be so, what a melancholy confession 11 is of their own incompetence and weakness. Let me take honorable members back to t he time when the Watson Ministry was formed. The Labour Party were undoubtedly called constitutionally into power, and made great professions. ' They talked of the benefits that would accrue from their administration to the great mass of the people. The honorable member for Bland, who was then Prime Minister, declared that it would be the duty of the Labour Party to secure the repeal of all those laws that allowed the rich to grow richer, or oppressed t'ie poor. They were to do away with the industrial shackles that were binding the community, and in short, to bring about the millennium.","N/A","MINISTERIAL STATEMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[4]/continue[32]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The matter was discussed for a month, and the Government of the day bitterly combatted the opposition raised by some honorable members to the printing qf such a despatch.

Meanwhile, Mr. Speaker, I must draw your attention to the absence of honorable members from their duties. {Quorum formed.} Probably one of the most surprising things in the present situation is the melancholy confession of impotence and incompetence which has been made by the Labour Party. Because, although when the motion which brought the present Ministry into office was carried, the Labour Party comprised twenty-eight members, as against eighteen members of the Deakin party, still they practically confessed by their action in declining Ministerial responsibility that their party included no men with sufficient ability) or intelligence to form a Ministry. This is not singular, when Ave look back upon their past career, and glance at their actions when they occupied the Treasury bench. It is a remarkable thing that after the statement made by the honorable member for Bland as Prime Minister, that the\ would bring in measures which would make the poor better off, and banish sin, misery, and poverty from the land, which, in fact, would make the country flow with milk and honey, their very first proposal was to ask the House to print a despatch announcing that the title of ' honorable ' had been conferred upon the members of the first Federal Parliament.","N/A","MINISTERIAL STATEMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[4]/continue[39]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In that, which is its proper sense, I must say that I should like to be ' without rule ' altogether sooner than have laws passed such as we suffer from in many cases. With regard to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, we are all aware, no matter what we may say to the contrary, that that legislation cannot affect any dispute in any one. State. It is absolutely useless for that purpose.

I felt that I could go to those men, and say to them, 'Stand .out against any law that will compel you to work whether you like it or not: and if they should force you to go to work, whether you like it or not, work in such a manner that they will -never ask you again.'","N/A","MINISTERIAL STATEMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[4]/continue[49]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I never believe in doing work without being paid for it. What was the cause of the defeat of the .Labour Party? I t was their insistence on putting into the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill a clause which absolutely went against their own principles as a Socialist party. I f Socialism means anything it means equal opportunities for all.  Fortunately for the country, they were defeated on a clause in which, so far from keeping to the programme which they had mapped out for themselves, they tried to prevent men from having equal opportunities, and said that unless men belong to a union they should not be allowed to work. If men are not allowed to work, if they are not allowed to earn the means to live, they simply have to starve. The reason why men work is to earn a living. One of the most extraordinary things in connexion with the Labour Party is that, after all their bold professions of equality, they absolutely ventured to try to force upon the people of Australia, a clause which was absolutely a denial of the very justice that they say that they claim for all. When they were defeated on that I believe that it was to the secret delight of some who belong to the caucus party, but who found themselves forced by the vote of the majority to vote for the clause. I have not the slightest doubt in my own mind that the more intelligent and better-read members of the Labour Party must have denounced such an iniquitous idea as that a preference was to be given to any one class of workers over another. It was a new doctrine to put into the laws of a country, and it was an absolute abnegation of the very statements which they made at other times. I am glad to say' that to-day we have from them a confession of how miserably they failed, and how unfit indeed they were to carry on legislation. Although there were twenty-eight members in the Labour Party against only eighteen in the other little party, they practically said, 'We really are conscious that we are unfit to legislate, and that what we introduced before only ended in muddle. We are not suited for carrying on this work. Amongst us there are none who can draw up statutes and interpret them properly, or there are not. sufficient of us. Therefore, we shall have to decline the work. Although we are the largest party, and 'although it will be our votes that will put out a Ministry, we shall have to call upon this other small party to form a Government. We will tell them what legislation we want, and they will have to frame it and carry it out for us.!' When one looks at their position from that point of view, it is a most melancholy confession of incompetence. I am surprised that at least four or five men ' amongst the Labour Party did not 'at once' break away from them. I am amazed that some did not say, ' We, at all events, are 'competent, whatever some of you may be, of our ability -to share in the legislative work of the country, and we will do so.' But I suppose they were conscious of the work of the past. I suppose they recognised that they were able to take no credit whatever to themselves, and manfully confessed their inability to legislate. A more painful spectacle could not, ,1 suppose, have been presented than when the other day Ministers were being criticised as unfit for their work in a Federal Parliament. Nothing could have been more painful than to hear the Labour Party cheering and concurring in the statements that the present Ministers are not fit to be Ministers at all, and yet at the same time having to confess that those Ministers represent more intelligence than they have amongst themselves. They have had to agree that the Ministry should draw up Bills and introduce legislation, because, apparently, they have been unable to find among themselves men capable of performing such work.","N/A","MINISTERIAL STATEMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[4]/continue[50]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Credit is a great thing for any country, and leads to a greater acquisition to wealth than does anything else.

Under our present system of taxation the bulk of the revenue is contributed by the workers; and no Commonwealth or State can allow its citizens to perish in their old age and misfortune. This is a question in which the cost, although an element, is not the primary consideration. If want and misery were caused by the withdrawal of all the old-age pensions, there would be a searing of the heart of the community, and avenues of consolation would be closed up, thus creating greater evil than is caused by the payment of those allowances.

We must remember that in spite of the existence of the Labour Party in the various States,- we have no Agricultural' Tenants' Holdings Act, and there is no tenant right in improvements. An extra duty of;£$ 5s. has been imposed' on harvesters, in addition to the £4 already charged, and that means a serious tax on all farmers who use those machines. If that is the way in which the Government propose to ' encourage rural occupations, the sooner these proposals are given up the better for those whom they affect. It is monstrous that the bulk of the farmers should perpetually have taxation thrust upon them. Then it is proposed that there shall be bounties for new products. That is to say, the Government propose in some way to build up industries which are proved not to be suitable industries, by the fact that they will not pay for themselves. What fund has Parliament on which to draw except the money of the citizens? And what right have we to take money from one set of citizens to give to another? How can we say that we shall create a new industry? A new industry, I take it, is an industry in which after work has been done the product of that work is more valuable than its cost. Consequently if we encourage men to engage in some occupation in which, after work has been done, the result is worth less than the cost of production, so far from having created an industry we have created a parasite. Let me give the simplest illustration of all. Let us suppose that some man said, ' We want to encourage men to work,' and as a result we took a quarter of the community and put them in gaol. If, whilst they remained there they could 'earn only a quarter of the amount necessary for their subsistence, could that undertaking be regarded as a profitable one? Could the men be said to be profitably employed? Certainly not The bigger the gaol the greater would be the misery for US; and so far from calling that gaol a 'factory ' we should designate it an incubus upon the country. When we turn to a benevolent asylum, or a gaol, and point out that their inmates are not earning one-quarter of what is required for their subsistence, it is very strange that some members of the Labour Party immediately exclaim, ' Very well; the community is contributing the other three-fourths, and those men, so far from being engaged in an industry, are really feeding upon the country.' They will admit that at once. But if we change the name of the institution, and, instead of calling it a benevolent asylum, designate it a factory, they refuse to call it a parasite, and prefer to call it an industry.

The natural sequence was that they raised rates of interest to all the workers of the community three, four, and five fold. That is exactly what a lot of us are doing by our wild talk at the present day. But I am thankful to see signs that people are beginning to regard a lot of the statements which are made here merely as wind, and to treat them accordingly. When I hear the honorable member for Bland declare that if the State took over factories it would pay for them, and that if it appropriated land it would pay for it, I cannot understand how he can call himself a Socialist.

While the Government speak in the one breath of encouraging the speedier and cheaper transportion of our products, they propose in the next to give the Minister of Trade and Customs power to declare how our commerce shall be carried on. The matter is not even to be subject to the control of Parliament. It is to be dealt with by regulations drawn up by the Minister, according to his own sweet will. One would think that we were prepared to regard Ministers as being divine when we propose to vest such powers in them. It was the placing of like powers in the hands of Ministers that led to the corruption in New South Wales, of which we have lately heard so much.

Considering the fairly large outflow of population from England at the present time, the Treasurer will surely grant that we are not obtaining our proper share of it. It is highly desirable that we should seek to attract population, provided that we can offer the people land upon which to settle when they come here; but however largely we may talk about the matter, the fact remains that the Commonwealth Parliament has no land to offer immigrants, and therefore the Government, in saying that they propose to make an effort to attract population to our shores, are pretending that they can do something which is not within their power. That is my protest. I do ni-t wish people to be led away by these willo'thewisps. If we can do these things, I should be very glad to know from the honorable member how we can. I can show him one way in which, while he may not be able to attract population, he can prevent rumours getting about that immigrants would not be allowed to land.

It is because of the general ignorance in the House of its ill effect We cannot carry the amendment which is required - we can only point out the evil which has arisen. The next item on the Government programme is a proposal for the appointment of a High Commissioner. While I am not altogether averse to the appointment of a High Commissioner, still I must first see that some arrangement is made with the various States to have one office instead of six offices in London. Unless there is some likelihood of that result being achieved, unless the States are more willing to intrust their affairs to our hands than they appear to be, I can see no reason for supporting such legislation at the present time. While this want of confidence exists between the States and the Commonwealth, I cannot see my way clear to sanction a proposal, not to limit, but to increase expenditure. The next measure on the Government programme is one relating to navigation and shipping. If the Government keeps on interfering with navigation and shipping, and the legislation is framed on the lines of the Bill which the honorable and learned member for Ballarat introduced, and he has the support of the Labour Party, we shall probably find that this restrictive legislation will have the effect, not of increasing, but of seriously diminishing, the number of men engaged in navigation and shipping, and that, so far from being a boon and a blessing to the class they profess to help, it will operate to their injury. It is clear that if the policy of restriction be pursued much further, we shall have all these companies combining. We shall, in fact, compel men to go into a trust a generation before they otherwise would do. Possibly the necessity for a combination might never arise here, but by our legislation we are absolutely forcing employers to combine.","N/A","MINISTERIAL STATEMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[4]/continue[95]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We have this simple fact to contemplate - that the owners of the richest lands in Australia are allowed to tax people living on other lands to the extent of nearly £10 an acre. Let us test that statement. I think the honorable member for Maranoa will agree with me that at least 20 tons of cane is a fair average yield for an acre of land in Queensland. That represents a little over 2 tons of sugar - roughly, 2 J tons; but we will take it at 2 tons of sugar to the acre.","N/A","MINISTERIAL STATEMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[4]/continue[105]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In other words, for cultivating an acre of land to produce sugar, we give a man £10. . Of course the man says that he receives this bonus for cultivating with white labour. I do not care what labour he employs.

I have no wish to repeat all' the hard things that have been said by certain honorable members, may be because I am not affected so acutely as they are by the change, and consequently cannot feel as keenly as they do. After reading the speech delivered by the Prime Minister at Ballarat I came to the conclusion that he should have made his position clear at a much .earlier period. It appears that the coalition came into existence subject to the understanding that if a premature 'dissolution should take place, those who were in coalition should go to the country as a united party. Owing to the pressure brought to bear upon the Government by the honorable members led by the present Attorney-General, the late Government, in a weak moment, consented to appoint a  Royal Commission to inquire into the Tariff. I had no sympathy whatever with that proposal, because I felt that when the time came for dealing with the report of the Commission there must be a break-up of the Coalition Government. I realized that if it were necessary to bring about a coalition in order to restore stable administration, and to present a solid front to the solid Labour Party, the destruction of that Government would be a calamity. It has been stated in this House that the appointment of the Commission was a farce. I should be no party to any such transaction. Whilst I had no sympathy with the appointment of the Commission, I realized that once that body was appointed the public must not be fooled. Therefore, I was greatly relieved when the leader of the Opposition announced the other evening that he had appointed the Commission in perfect good faith, and that he was prepared to stand or fall by the principles for which he had fought for so many years.","N/A","MINISTERIAL STATEMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Prime Minister stated at Ballarat that when the Commission was appointed, he felt that the step was a fatal one, because the fiscal issue would have to be dealt with, and the Government would fall to pieces. He should have made that announcement when the proposal to appoint the Commission was first mooted. He should have said, ' I have no sympathy with this proposal,' and should have pointed out to the right honorable and learned member for East Sydney, ' This is the rock upon which you will split.' At Ballarat, however, he stated that he had the fullest sympathy with the appointment of the Commission. He had previously made a similar announcement in this House. That was the time at which he should have pointed out the danger of complying- with the request of the Isaacs party. Ministers would then have stiffened their backs against those who were asking for the Commission, and would have strengthened their position. If they had shown a bold front, they would have added to the number of their supporters. The Prime Minister, when speaking at Ballarat, stated that if his party went to the country at the period of dissolution which the then Prime Minister was foretelling, they would bc placed at a disadvantage, because the Anti-Socialistic League in New South Wales was being joined by many persons who professed protectionist principles, as well as by free-traders, but the former were being deceived. I was a member of that league, and I heard no whisper ot anything in the form of treachery or deceit on the part of any member of that league. I should be no party to anything of the kind.

There was no need whatever for 'the honorable and learned member for Ballarat to. break away from the coalition of which I was a humble member, and I hope the time is not far distant when, as a solid democratic party, we shall be able to face the united Labour Party. The Prime Minister was most desirous of showing his constituents where he stood; and this point I desire to emphasize. His declaration will stand for all time - or, at any rate, for the time of this Parliament - as his views on Socialism.

The honorable and learned member proceeded to say,  I repeat that the real crux of State Socialism lies in the question, 'Who is to pay? It all comes to £ s. d.' That is the difference between myself and the members of the Labour Party. Is Socialism expedient? Will it pay? If it will not pay, then the State should have nothing to do with it; but if it will pay, and it is expedient in the interests of the people and of the country, then it may be undertaken, provided that private enterprise is not interfered with to the disadvantage of the people. These are a few of the conclusions at which I arrived on reading the speech made bv the honorable and learned member for Ballarat. A platform might have been prepared by him and the right honorable member for East Sydney in consultation, and on that platform we could have gone to the country as an Australian Liberal League. It was repeatedly stated by the right honorable member for East Sydney, when Prime Minister, that when he went to the country he would have something definite to place before the electors. It is most deplorable there should be a crisis at a time when we might have been united, and when there could have been placed before the people a straight out issue, as to the decision of which I had no fear. However, we have in power a Government - a democratic Government - who will bring forward non-contentious measures. If the Government introduce measures which are for the good of the people - measures which could have been brought forward by the coalition Government - I shall support them, just as the Labour Party will. Instead of the Labour Party having the Government under their thumb, it seems to me that the Government have the Labour Party under their thumb. The Government know very well that the Labour Party do not want a dissolution, otherwise they would have opposed the crisis motion : and the Government may bring forward measures of which they are thoroughly in favour, and none that the Labour Party specially desire. If the Government introduce measures of that character. I cannot see how it is possible for members of the Opposition to vote against legislation in favour of which they have a moral conviction. I feel pretty certain the Opposition will support measures they are in favour of. and will not merely oppose for the sake of harassing the Government. Under such circumstances, the Government will live on their measures, and not on the sufferance of the Labour Party. But the Labour Party are ' playing the game ' very much in the interests of the party who are opposed to them, though not so intentionally. The Labour Party have taken time by the forelock, and have expressed themselves in favour of taking a referendum on the Tariff Commission's report, and passing into law the mandate of that referendum. The right honorable member for East Sydney made a public announcement to the same effect some months ago, considering that a referendum would be a capital way of settling the question. If the question is settled in that way, I, as a free-trader, will fight in the constituencies in favour of free-trade. I want nothing from this House; I only ask to be given a free hand in advocating free-trade in the country. When the referendum is proposed, if I am returned again, I hope I may be a member of this party, namely, the Freetrade Party, fighting in favour of the revenue Tariff. If the country decides that there must be protection, then the spoils of the victors shall not go to Victorian manufacturers only, but all the manufacturers throughout the Commonwealth shall share in the plunder, for, at the very best, protection is nothing but robbery. I hope I shall see the duties reduced as low as possible, so as to have a revenue-producing Tariff in the interests of the impecunious States, and in the interests of the great State of New South Wales, of which I have the honour to be one of the representatives. The latter State is spending one million pounds a year more than the people had to provide before there was Federation - a million more than is necessary for the government of that State.","N/A","MINISTERIAL STATEMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[5]/para[9]","N/A","N/A"

I feel that it is my duty, on behalf of the electors of the Hunter, to give expression to my opinions in reference to the present political situation. I do not think that this discussion can be seriously regarded as a debate, hut, nevertheless, I cannot say that it has involved a waste of public time. The Attorney-General reminds me of the man who has taken his seat in the first-class carriage of the Ministerial train. He has got there all right, his luggage is in the van, and he wants to be off. He does not care about anybody else's feelings, and consequently he takes up a very high stand, and directs us to do the work of men. I think that we are doing the work of men, and part of that work consists of protesting' against the conduct of certain honorable members of this House. If anybody should protest against that conduct, certainly the electors of the Hunter should do so. ' In the first Parliament we elected a gentleman in whom we believed, and who promised to give us a revenue Tariff. When he became a member of the first Cabinet his ideas changed. He came back to the electors, and said he had thought better of his original proposal, and that the only course open to the Commonwealth Parliament was to pass the heavy protective Tariff that is now in operation.","N/A","MINISTERIAL STATEMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I only wish to say that the free-traders or revenue tariffists of New South Wales sank the fiscal issue. We were perfectly prepared to support a Government consisting equally of protectionists and free-traders, and fully expected in those circumstances that we should have the loyal support of the present Prime Minister. Instead of that however the honorable and learned gentleman, the moment that he joined the coalition instead of taking his seat immediately behind the Government, retired to the most remote corner of the back bench. Was not that in itself an indication of want of loyalty on his part? When the first opportunity occurred to thrust the late Ministry out of office he took advantage of it. I would remind him that the House is in exactly the same position that it occupied when the first Deakin Administration was in office.

In such circumstances, it is not strange that, called upon for the first time to face the allegations then made, and those that followed outside the House, I was obliged to supplement that speech by statements to the representative of the public press that have not appeared in Hansard.. Those remarks have appeared' only in part of the public press, having been mutilated in the greater section of it, so that the sequence of events which was the necessary condition to a comprehension of the present situation was utterly destroyed. But I do not, for that reason, propose to inflict upon the House a repetition of those statements. At this hour of the night, and at this stage of the debate, it would be unwise, and also, I believe, unnecessary, to do so. What I shall' have to say will be directed not - as I should have wished - to the task of dealing with those criticisms and suggestions upon the policy of the Government that under ordinary circumstances would form the chief feature of a reply of this nature, but to a few salient features of the situation from which we are about to pass. It seems to be forgotten that both in the action taken, and the words spoken with regard to the late Government, I had any obligations, except those that are declared to have existed between honorable members now opposite - and particularly the leader of. the Opposition who now enters the Chamber - and myself. I have neither denied nor sought to diminish those obligations.  I have said, and venture to repeat, however, that they were but some of the many obligations imposed upon honorable members of this House, and upon myself in particular during the late crisis. In addition to anything I owed to the late Government, and felt to be due to its leader, I owed much to the men with whom I have been associated in this House, who sat with me; to the party, though divided, which sat on both sides of the Chamber, and to the general public. I was as much bound to discharge these obligations in the order of their claims as I was any others of a personal or directly Ministerial character. And, sir, standing here after a debate extending over several days, during which abuse based upon false, unjustifiable, ruthless, suspicion has been showered upon my every action, let me say that I have passed through it with less disturbance and less sensitiveness than through any assaults that have been made upon me during my political career.","N/A","MINISTERIAL STATEMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Nothing was to be done to fulfil that pledge. Not one measure was offered of all those which were set out and promised to be done as a justification of the coalition, as a justification for sinking the fiscal question.

He resolved us at once into our original parties. There was the Free-trade Party which supported the right honorable member, there was the Protectionist Party which I had the honour to lead, and there was the third party fiscally indifferent, and putting forward its own policy. It was, I say, this act of the right honorable member, and this alone, that re-created the three-party situation which unfortunately we have now inherited. I have not altered one opinion that I have ever expressed as to the inconvenience, danger, and prejudice to constitutional government that the three-party system occasions. I say that our present system makes the working of constitutional government, as we know it, impossible upon established lines. But the right honorable member having re-created the three-party system, we had to face it.  We had to admit it, and' take the best possible course. He left us only a choice of evils, of difficulties. Either we could go to the country, and obtain a verdict which would settle nothing, which would leave us where we were, and would 'entail the expenditure of £50,000; or if we did not go to the country we could try to carry on this Parliament under the three-party system. Of those two evils we preferred to save the country£50,000, and to carry on the business for which we were sent here; and we hope to give the country time to reconsider the situation so as ultimately to come to a more intelligent decision than we should have done had we rushed to the electorates in confusion as the right honorable member desired.","N/A","MINISTERIAL STATEMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[8]/continue[33]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Prime Minister has always expressed his sympathy with the representations made to him, and promised that for the future the Act would be more carefully administered. I am now credibly informed that there are in the Cairns district for Queensland a number of Chinamen - new chum Chinamen - who have not previously been in the country, and have, therefore, not arrived under permit. I do not know whether it is a fact; but it has been suggested that these men take passages at Hong Kong or travel as stowaways. When the steamer is off Cairns, Port Douglas, or Cooktown, it is said that beche-de-mer boats, or other boats which are hovering about, ostensibly on business, but really for the purpose of landing Chinamen, come alongside in the small hours of the morning, when the. passengers are in their bunks, and very few people about the decks, and the Chinese are then transferred to these small boats. I do not know whether there is any connivance on the part of those on the ship, possibly there is; but. at any rate, I am informed that these Chinamen arc landed at Cairns, also in the small hours, without any difficulty. The men can be taken up the inlet, or landed at the north side of the inlet, where there are plenty of Chinese. In any case, Chinamen are entering the country in this illegal way,, and I ask the Prime Minister what steps he intends to take to prevent these breaches of the law. I admit there may be some difficulty in preventing the landing of these men; but the difficulty ought not to be insurmountable. These men are being landed, not only at Cairns, but at Port Douglas, Cooktown, and other places along this extensive coast. There are no police or police boats to watch vessels which arrive; but I am sure some satisfactory method could be devised by the Department to prevent this evasion of the Act.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

During my recent trip to Queensland I found a very general impression, not only amongst the townspeople, but amongst the planters, that there was some back-door passage for Chinese. In view of the strenuous White Australia policy which the Prime Minister has just indicated, I direct his attention to the Alien Immigration Act of Cape Colony, which has received the assent of the London Colonial Office. In that Act there is a provision under which every Chinaman in the Colony has to possess a yearly registration ticket, and that has to be produced when called for, showing last year's signature of a resident magistrate. This is not a matter' of taxation; but a means of preventing a dangerous influx of Chinese to Cape Colony, in view of the importation of Chinese to the Transvaal. I have had a copy of this Act, with its regulations, sent to me, and I shall be pleased if the Prime Minister can see his way to adopt a similar means of preventing the influx of Chinese to the Commonwealth.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I refer to the continuation or otherwise of the book-keeping system at the expiration of the period of five years. This is a matter of great importance to Western Australia. I have on more than one occasion quoted figures showing how the abolition of this system would affect the finances of the State which I represent. During the four years of Federation, the absence of this book-keeping provision would have penalized the State Treasury of Western Australia to the extent of £2,160,000. The tendency is for the revenue of Western Australia to approximate more and more to the -per capita revenue of the other States, and I want the Government to say that they will give the House an opportunity to discuss the question, if possible, this session. If the Treasurer can give an undertaking that the matter will form a subject in his financial statement, that will be some assurance to the Treasurer of Western Australia. If the matter 5s not dealt with this session, we shall not be able to reach ''it until pretty late next session, and the Western Australian Treasurer, not knowing what his income will be from Customs, will not be able to prepare his Estimates. I want the Government to indicate what they intend to do when the present five years' period has expired, which it does in October, 1906. The 'Government of Western Australia ought to know what the new system is to be if a new system is to be introduced, and they ought to be informed whether the present system is to be continued. I ask the Treasurer to give this matter his earnest attention, as it is one of very great importance to the finances of Western Australia.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Last session it' was my intention, if it had been constitutional, to submit a Bill dealing with the subject of deserted wives and families. Unfortunately,. I found, after consulting the late Attorney-General, that it would not be constitutional' for me to d'o so. This is a verv important matter, at any rate, in regard to South* Australia. I had the honour of a seat upon the council of the State Children's; Department of that State for some years, and we found that families were constantly being deserted by men who went to the other States, who were well able to contribute to the support of their families, but refused to do so. At the present moment there is a man living with another woman in Melbourne who has deserted his wife and family in South Australia. He is earning a good salary every week, but refuses to contribute is. towards their support, and there is no power to> compel him to do so. I ask the Prime Minister to consider the advisability of communicating with the whole of the States Governments with a view to inducing them to hand over to the Commonwealth Government the power to deal with this matter. It is obviously a matter upon which Federal' action requires to be taken, for the reason that it would be idle for four or five States to agree to legislate in regard to it, because deserters would then go to the fifth State where there would be no power to deal' with them.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
