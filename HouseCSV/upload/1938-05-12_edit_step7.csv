It was only a matter of minutes before the cruiser was brought to andRearAdmiral Lane-Poole was on the bridge with the commander of the vessel, Captain Wilson. The evidence shows clearly that a considerable number of buoys and, later, lifelines were thrown overboard, but the sea was so rough that it was not considered advisable to lower a boat. The reason why the destroyers were ordered to proceed was because it was impossible for the Canberra to alter its course and cross the track of the light cruisers. To enable the Canberra to get on the lee side in order to lower a boat, it was essential that the other vessels be ordered out of the line. It was inadvisable to order the smaller craft to lower boats because there was too great a risk of many more men being lost. With all sincerity I say that everything possible was done. That is the opinion of naval men who were not associated with the accident but who at the inquiry gave careful scrutiny to the whole of the evidence of the men concerned.","N/A","DEATH OF LEADING SEAMAN STORER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I -wish to reply to some observations that have been made concerning the cause of the loss of markets. The tariff schedule that was brought down by the Scullin Government was introduced, unfortunately, just before a depression such as Australia had not known before, but I doubt whether the policy it embodied could have been carried out with any success to Australia even had conditions been most prosperous. The intention of the Scullin tariff was to emulate certain countries overseas by adopting a policy of self-sufficiency. Such a policy is all right for countries which use most of their production, but not for a country like Australia which exports about 80% of its wool and wheat and other produce. I fear that only disaster could have attended it had it been persevered with. I appreciate the spirit that animated the member for Capricornia (Mr. Forde) who was then Minister for Trade and Customs in his endeavour to introduce it, but Australia, which must depend on the overseas markets for the sale of its exportable products, is in a vastly different position from those countries which consume most of their own products. No doubt the honorable member visualized a great expansion of our secondary industries, the establishment of newfactories and the employment of thousands more of our own population, but our experience of the policy he tried to apply shows that there must be reciprocal trade between nations. Honorable members opposite made the inaccurate assertion that the tariff policy of the present Government amounts practically to one of freetrade, but that is not correct. It is necessary to adjust the tariff to provide an opportunity for the employees in Australian secondary in dustries to compete with the manufacturers of .other countries.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS 193:7-38","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

What happened when the Scullin Government told the other peoples of the world that this country could live without them? Of course, we could manufacture in Australia the vast majority of the goods that we require, and the Government at that time certainly adjusted the trade balance, but only at the expense of thousands of workers in our primary industries. For example, Australia till then -had a favorable trade balance with Belgium, which specializes in glass manufactures, and we had been purchasing most of our glass requirements from Belgium; and in return, that country bought from us raw materials such as wool, wheat, barley and other primary products. But, when we told Belgium that we did not require its glass, it replied, c: Very well. We can do without your primary products'. Belgium had been purchasing from Australia about £7,000,000 worth of commodities annually, whereas Australia had at no time purchased from Belgium more than £1,000,000 worth of goods per annum. Belgium, therefore, discarded our products, and in giving effect to its new policy of retaliation when it was calling for tenders for the supply of meat for its army, it stipulated that every country in the world except Australia could compete for the business. As the result of that, many hundreds, and. possibly thousands, of employees in Australia were thrown out of work. Another example is that of our trade with France. France had been buying from- Australia up to £17,000.000 worth annually of our raw materials, and we were purchasing from that country only from £4.000.000 to £5,000,000 worth of' goods, such as superfine silks, face powders, perfumes, and cosmetics, in which that country specialized. After the Scullin tariff, France purchased from us only the goods that it could not obtain elsewhere, and Australia lost millions of pounds on the transaction. Again. Japan was our second best customer for wool, and had been purchasing from us about £15,000,000 worth of that commodity every year, whilst our purchases from Japan of manufactured goods were of the value of from £5,000,000 to £6,000,000 a year. That position continued without interruption until the trade diversion policy was introduced. As the result of the Scullin tariff, however, our overseas trade, both exports and imports, was paralysed. We recall that, when the wheat and wool markets collapsed, every State, except Queensland, sent deputations to the Government seeking relief for the primary producers, who ha.d to be assisted by bounties- and in other ways. We have all heard 'what the- present Government has not done for the primary producers '! I shall attempt to show something of what it. 'has done for them.' The sum of £12,000,000 has been made available by this Government to the governments of the States to enable distressed farmers to retain their holdings. The representatives of some constituencies are apt to overlook this fact. We sometimes hear certain honorable members complain that the Government of New South Wales has failed to carry out a closer settlement policy. I consider that that Government did much to promote closer settlement when it distributed the money made available by the Commonwealth to enable farmers to remain solvent during the depression and to retain their properties. I am a member of the party which the honorable member for Wimmera (Mr. Wilson) referred to last night as the ' supposed ' Country party. The honorable, member reminds me of a remark made by the mother of. a soldier, who, when the regiment to which her boy belonged was. marching by, called out, ' They are all out of step except my Jimmy '. During the course of the honorable member's remarks- last evening, he accused the present Government of having placed a levy on wool, and for the purpose of advising him I informed him bv interjection that the Government had not imposed the levy. It was introduced at the request of every producers' organization in Australia, with the exception of one in Queensland.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS 193:7-38","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[1]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The various branches of that organization send delegates to a conference at which the resolutions of the various branches are placed before the conference, and, as the result of the decisions of the conference, the policy of the organization is determined. That is exactly what happened in connexion with the wool levy. The Farmers' and Settlers' Association, and the Graziers' Associations of New South Wales and Victoria and the southern Riverina, through their delegates, approved of the request submitted to the Commonwealth Government to frame legislation making the levy compulsory. I heard that graziers throughout New South Wales, in isolated cases, said that their branches had not approved of the impost. Probably those men were unable to say whether certain branches had. or had not approved of the levy, because they were not members of the association.  Men of that type measure plans calculated to benefit Australia as a whole by considering to what extent the proposals will affect their own pockets, lt was necessary to make the levy compulsory, just as the Labour party considers it necessary to compel workmen to buy union tickets. In every community we find a number of men on the land who are ready to take advantage of benefits brought about by the action of their fellow producers, provided it costs them nothing. The impost of 6d. a bale on wool was made to prevent such men from 'scabbing' on their fellow producers. What caused the trouble with our friends the Japanese was the trade diversion policy, and the restrictions placed on imports from Japan by the Minister then directing the negotiations for trade treaties, the honorable member for Henty (Sir Henry Gullett). That was how the .trouble came about. Not until the last day of the sittings of the House was the policy announced; honorable members were given no opportunity to discuss it, and had to return to their constituencies as it were blindfolded. Honorable members opposite tried to make political capital out of the situation by saying that the importation of substitute material should not be permitted, and that the Government in formulating its trade policy had not acted in the best interests of the wool-growers. They suggested, in fact, that this Government should do the very thing which they would not have been prepared to do if they had been given the opportunity. When Labour was in power it permitted cheaply manufactured artificial silk piece goods to come into this country from Japan in such unlimited quantities that our textile trade with Great Britain Was threatened. Japanese exporters were permitted to flood the country with cheaply manufactured artificial silk materials which would have resulted in throwing all our textile workers out of employment.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS 193:7-38","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[1]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Had that been allowed to continue, Australia would have been flooded with cheaply manufactured goods until we would have been able to purchase those same garments at from 2d. to 3d. each. The Australian woollen textile industry would have been completely undermined and wages generally would have been reduced. Girls employed as domestics would have been forced to purchase only those goods which their paltry wages would afford. The only way to protect the woollen industry is to place restrictions on the importation of cheaply manufactured goods from countries whose costs of manufacture are far below those of this country, and to provide for the payment of a scale of wages that will permit the purchase of Australian goods. Those who wish to buy woollen goods will then be compelled to purchase goods manufactured in this country from Australian wool.  In reply to those honorable members who contend that the Japanese exporters should be placated because Japan is a great customer of this country, I say that, when the Goodwill Mission led by Mr. Latham, now Sir John Latham, visited Japan an intimation was given to the Japanese manufacturers that tariff adjustments of the kind subsequently made would take place. That intimation inspired our Eastern friends to purchase more than double their requirements of wool. As a matter of fact they purchased about 800,000 bales of wool, a quantity sufficient to meet their requirements for the following year when . they knew that these restrictions would be in operation. Consequently they were able for a time to boycott the Australian wool market by standing with their backs to the wall and declaring that they would not purchase any Australian wool. Every organization throughout Australia that took exception to what the Government had done in its effort to preserve our great market in Great Britain for our surplus commodities proclaimed itself an ally of the people with whom we were endeavouring to correct our trade relations. When the honorable member for Henty was engaged in an endeavour to make a trade agreement with Japan, every effort was made to induce the representatives of that country to re-enter the market for Australian wool. Even representatives of the graziers' associations were called into conference, but the Japanese representatives remained adamant. Their sole thought was to win, and they would not entertain the thought of compromise. However, the time arrived when it became necessary for Japan to purchase supplies of wool, and Japanese buyers again entered into competition with tha buyers of other countries in the Australian wool market.' In the meantime, however, the market had recovered to such an extent that the Japanese competition brought about only a temporary sharp rise of 2d. per lb.; within a few days prices receded to their former leveL The striking feature of the increasing value to Australia of the United Kingdom market which the Government was so anxious to foster is apparent from a review of the following figures relating to Australia's exports to the United Kingdom : - The importance of the British market is appreciated when we realize that for the year ended 1934-35 Great Britain took more than 50 per cent, of our total exports valued at approximately £54,000,000, or four times more than that taken by any other individual country. Since 1929, the United Kingdom market has become increasingly more important to Australia owing to the contraction of foreign markets. During the last ten years, Australian exports to the United Kingdom amounted to approximately £600,000,000. Because of the immense value to Australia of the British market, the Government found it necessary to take drastic steps to protect the trade relations between Australia and Great Britain, the very existence of which was threatened by interference by a foreign country. At a time when the industries of this country were on the verge of collapse owing, amongst other things, to the depression, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition who was then Minister for Trade and Customs in the Labour Government, with great optimism, was looking forward to the establishment of new fac tories which he said would employ 100,000 Australian workers. I point out, however, that the output of those factories could not have been absorbed in this country. 'Nor could they have been exported because we were unable to manufacture as cheaply as other countries. The Government of the day by curtailing imports offended other nations which retaliated by saying that they would purchase their primary products elsewhere. Even Switzerland, which specializes in the manufacture of clocks, watches, and electrical instruments, said that it would buy its wheat elsewhere rather than submit to such a policy, with the result that its people even attempted to grow their own wheat on hillsides at a cost of about 15s. 4§d. a bushel. The people of that country took exception to Australia, the United State* of America, and Canada following the same policy, and said, ' We shall grow our own wheat just as Germany ana France have done. We shall accept the challenge of these primary-producing countries.' To see the repercussions of a policy such as this, one can view it from the more parochial aspect of the trade relations that exist between the local butcher and the baker. The butcher may say to the baker, ' You must take my beef, but I do not want your bread.' Must the baker accept that position? He would say ' Definitely not ' and would go to ' Woop Woop ' for .his supplies rather than submit to that sort of thing. However, :the whole system broke down. Instead of the flourishing factories which the then Minister for Trade and Customs expected to see, we witnessed the collapse of a large number of secondary industries - big factories closing their doors or being carried on with skeleton staffs, and their employees walking the streets looking for (employment, many of them going to police stations with a ticket for rations like a tribe of aborigines, because the Government was at a loss to know what best to do on account of the economic conditions that existed at the time. The falling off of exports and imports led to wharf labourers and railway 'nen being thrown idle, while those rail way men whose services were retained had their employment rationed because ('here was not .sufficient work to keep them -fully engaged. All this was brought about by a stupid tariff policy, aided and abetted by the -collapse of markets overseas and the depression which then overtook the world. J..have made these few remarks particularly with a view to assisting my friend on my right, the honorable member for Wimmera (Mr. Wilson). I wished to make it plain to him that he should not, as a new member, come into this chamber and refer to honorable gentlemen who have been here for twenty years as .members of a ' so-called Country party'. Mr. JENNINGS (Watson) [11.48 jj. - I desire to make some observations in regard to the .tariff schedule. What I have to say will have general application to some of the items which later will come up for discussion. I would say at the outset that a vote given against any item of the schedule by an honorable member on this side of the House cannot be regarded as a vote against the Government. In tariff matters there has never been any party alignment in the ranks of the party of which I am a member. That is the principle which I and many other honorable members adopt in connexion with the tariff. I think it is well to remind the committee that since federation the fiscal policy of Australia has been one of adequate protection -for local industries. 1 do not know of -any party that has appealed for the suffrages of the electors which desired to alter that policy. As a matter of fact, the trend throughout Australia to-day is towards the amplification of that policy. Particularly is this noticeable among the younger generation. We must remember that three vital questions are involved in it, the first being population, the second the maintenance of the population by the provision of employment, and the third national security. Australia is a young, virile country. It possesses a vast quantity of raw material, and consequently it is only natural that it should desire to go in for industrial development. This Parliament is the place in which encouragement can be given in that direction. We have recently passed through a severe depression, from which the important fart emerged, that every unemployed man cost the State £100 per annum. It is better that all should be kept in employment than be a charge on the State. The tendency in this chamber has been to lay 'greater stress on the importance of the primary industries than on that of the secondary industries. I believe that there should be the fullest cooperation between the primary and secondary industries of Australia. I realize the great national importance of our primary industries. It may be an old platitude that the home market is the best market, but the fact must be emphasized that the home market is easily secured and at greatly enhanced prices. I want honorable members to bear that in mind, because it is of paramount importance to the primary industries of this country. I believe, too, that the overseas market can be maintained better by the regular development of the home market. I have had experience in both the importing and the manufacturing branches of industry in Australia, and hope that I am able to give a balanced opinion on the intricate tariff question. In past years I have had occasion to refer to important items in the tariff schedule. On one occasion the Tariff Board presented a report in connexion with the dry battery industry. Other honorable members and I -took the stand that some protection should be given to that particular industry; and as the result of the encouragement which it received from the Government of the day, it developed into one of the most important industries in Australia. A very large establishment in the electorate of the honorable member for Cook (Mr. Sheehan) was recently opened by the Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons). It is supplying .a national requirement, but, what is more important to the consuming public, it is supplying that product at greatly reduced prices. The industry lias been developed and our faith in it was justified; today lt is one of the most successful in Australia. It furnishes an example of what can be done in many other directions. The pottery industry, one of the oldest industries in Australia, I shall refer to in greater detail .when the particular item comes up for discussion. The Tariff Board has made some comment in the matter of the prices charged by that particular industry. The Tariff Board, is necessary to have a balanced opinion in regard to the tariff but I would say that if it is to become a price-fixing agency, and if it is necessary to inquire closely into the production costs of local industries, we should insist on the production of audited statements setting out the production costs of overseas industries which seek lower rates of duty. If the practice is fair in regard to Australia it should also be fair in regard to any overseas industry. The honorable member for Hume (Mr. Collins) has referred to Japanese competition. I would say to the Minister and the Government that great concern exists among Australian manufacturers in this connexion. We do not want industries in Australia threatened with ruin because of the importation of cheap products. One must speak frankly in this matter. I ask the Minister to pay particular attention to this important phase. I have no com[ment to make about the progress of industrial development in Japan, except to say that the people of that country are to be commended for it. Previously an agricultural country, Japan to-day is advancing in industrial development. I would say, however, that if a debate were to take place in the parliament of Japan similar to that in which we are engaged to-day, there would be an insistence upon the adequate protection of local industries. The people of Japan can have no objection to the Australlian Parliament protecting the industries of this .country. We admire the progress .thai Japan has made, but because of our comparatively high production costs, due to higher wages and arbitration conditions, we must insist or. our industries being given fair protection when faced with cheap products from overseas. While in Great Britain last year, I was interested to see the development that has taken place in industry there. I noticed that large industries had been established by overseas countries. Great Britain found that, just as the policy of disarmament had failed in regard to world p;ace, so also the long established policy of freetrade had failed in recent years in regard to the development of secondary industries, because of altered world conditions. To-day the protection afforded by Great Britain to many of its industries is on the same basis as is afforded in Australia. Consequently, overseas manufacturers found that they could do better 'by opening up establishments in Great Britain. Years ago there was in Great Britain a strong body of opinion which was adverse to the development of Australian industries. Informative, and shall I say official, opinion in Great Britain to-day is that, in taking advantage of the large quantity of raw materials that we possess, we are efficiently developing our secondary industries, maintaining our population, and inspiring confidence not only in Australia but also in Great Britain itself. Because wc have efficiently developed our industries in this way, additional British capital has been sent to Australia for the (purpose, and more is available. Because of changing world conditions w-s are encouraged to do this. We must remember that the economical development of industries in this country is of paramount importance to our people, particularly in the event of national emergency.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS 193:7-38","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[1]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","115","ROSEVEAR, John","L08","Dalley","N/A","N/A","1168","I should not have bothered to engage in this debate but for the rather remarkable statements of the honorable member for Hume (Mr. Collins) on tariff policy generally, and on the policy of the Labour party, of which he appears to know more than he knows about the policy of his own party. His remarks may be divided into three sections. He attacked the honorable member for Wimmera (Mr. Wilson), first because of his infancy in this chamber, and secondly, apparently because that honorable member is one member of the Country party which does not intend to be trailed at the coattails of the United Australia party. The honorable member for Hume then proceeded to defend, as best he could, the policy of the Government in regard to tariff matters, and wound up by chastising the Labour party because of its attitude towards the Government's trade diversion policy in relation to Japan. First of all, I want to make it clear that this party has never claimed that the Country party was in favour of freetrade. As a matter of fact, we have always held that the Country party believes in free trade only in respect of those commodities which its supporters use on their farms, but that in respect of everything that they produce they are rabid protectionists. They are in favour of a dear loaf of bread and dear butter, but they insist on having cheap Japanese knives and forks on their tables. Thus we should be flying in the face of all political experience if we accused the Country party of being freetraders. They are, of course, a party of political opportunists who use their votes to protect their own industries and to reduce whenever possible the protective duties on cheap goods manufactured in other countries.  The honorable member for Hume took upon himself the difficult task of proving that the Scullin Government was not only responsible for the depression, hut was also responsible for the development throughout the world of the policy of economic nationalism. He entirely overlooked the fact that the Scullin Government was not responsible for the conditions that prevailed at the time that it * came into office, those conditions being a legacy from the previous anti-Labour Government. He. omitted to mention that, even before the Scullin Government came into office, overseas prices for primary products had begun to collapse. He also ignored the fact that, due to the policy of tue Bruce-Page Government, a huge adverse trade balance has been accumulating overseas against Australia. Whether the honorable member for Hume cares to admit or not, I believe that had the Scullin Government not taken the tariff measures it did to correct our adverse trade balance, the economic position of Australia would have become worse than it actually did. The honorable member for Hume referred to the loss of our trade with Belgium and France, and for this he blamed the Scullin Government's tariff measures. 1 remind him, however, that, even before the Scullin Government came into office, the policy of economic nationalism was spreading throughout Europe like a bushfire. This was due to the desire of the nations to be economically self-contained, and particulary to their fear of war. They had a vivid recollection of what had occurred during the Great War. Prior to that the nations of Europe had been competing so ' keenly for world markets for manufactured goods that they had, almost without exception, entirely neglected their primary industries, with the result that, when war came, not one of them was able to feed its civil population, let. alone its- army. Thus, whether or not the Scullin Government had brought about any violent change of tariff policy, those factors would still have induced European countries to attempt to make themselves independent of Australian primary products. As a matter of fact, the Scullin tariff did not discriminate between foreign countries; all were treated alike. Moreover, the greater part of our trade with France was in luxury items that could be produced quite well in Australia. By interjection I induced the honorable member for Hume to refer to the Japanese fiasco, as I describe this country's trade diversion policy, in bo far as it affected that country. The honor- able member declared that he would debate the matter, but he skated away from it very rapidly after trying to blame the honorable member for Henty (Sir Henry Gullett), for all the troubles arising out of the diversion policy. He said that the honorable member for Henty, as Minister in charge for negotiations for trade treaties, had rushed his trade diversion proposals through at the House at the end of the session without giving members of the Country party an opportunity to discuss them. It might be good policy to-day for the honorable member to send copies of his speech into the Hume electorate in an attempt to make his constituents believe that ha should not be held responsible for supporting the Government's trade diversion policy, but I say to him that had he not followed so slavishly at the heels of the Government, no trade diversion policy would ever have been put into operation. There were sufficient mem'b'ers in the House opposed to the policy to have defeated it had the Country party been really determined to prevent the honorable member for Henty from putting it into operation. It is a 'bit late in the day now for the honorable member to criticize what was done by the honorable member for Henty, who is no longer in the Government. It is easy to kick a man who is down- and out, but the honorable member did not kick him when he was a member of the Cabinet and had the support of the other members of the Government. Now, however, that the honorable member for Henty sits among the ministerial wreckage on the back benches, the honorable member is courageous enough. At the time, of course, he subserviently supported the policy submitted by the honorable member for Henty, but when he discovered that it turned out so disastrously for the primary producers, and particularly for the wool-growers, he did not hesitate to turn upon and rend the man he followed only a little while before.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS 193:7-38","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I do not dispute that.

A compulsory levy was placed on them at the request of the big grazing interests, and despite the fact that £60,000 has been collected, for advertising purposes, less wool was sold, and at lower prices, this year than- in any year before the levy was imposed.

But what has been the attitude of the Country party in the past to the importation of cheap goods from Japan and elsewhere? Can the honorable member point to one occasion when the Labour party, fighting against the importation of cheap goods, has received the support of the Country party? As a matter of fact, the Country party has always led the attack on every attempt by the Labour party to raise duties sufficiently to prevent the entry of cheap garments. In the past the honorable member has not been concerned about cheap garments competing with wool, but now, apparently, he has experienced a change of heart.

There was no party in this country more responsible than the Country party for the collapse of the living standards of the workers of this country. Members of that party and the interests whom they represent were the first people to go to the Arbitration Courts to have wages and conditions slashed. They had rural awards in New South Wales suspended long before the depression. They have always supported cuts of wages and living standards. In the tariff debates that have occurred in this Parliament they have made it clear that they believe that Australia has established a standard of living that cannot be maintained.  Again on the question of trade diversion before I depart from it, the same interests were responsible for the introduction of the levy on wool, and during the trade dispute with Japan, when wool prices collapsed, they held their wool back from the market and the honorable member for Hume was one of them.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS 193:7-38","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Yet the honorable member for Henty held Parliament up for two days on this policy and when, during the debate on the second reading, I interjected that the proposal to build motor cars in Australia was so much political ' hooey ' designed to cover up the other matters contained in the new policy, the honorable member denounced me and asked would I not like to see the industry established in my electorate and was I opposed to the idea of building motor car engines in Australia. One of the bitterest pills which the honorable gentleman has had to swallow is the fact that the Government, instead of putting this money into a special fund to pay bounties to enable local manufacturers to make engines for motor cars, has diverted into other channels, like the Stevens Government in New South Wale3 has done with the proceeds of unemployed relief taxes. It was never within the purview of the Minister or the Government that a motor car manufacturing industry should be set up in Australia. This was merely a ruse to make the policy of trade diversion acceptable to the people.  This Government sent to Japan a delegation consisting of Sir John Latham and a retinue of public servants. The object of thi3 costly goodwill mission was to promote trade between Australia and Japan, but, within twelve months of this expenditure, the honorable member for Henty provoked a trade war with Japan, and the result has been calamitous to the primary producers of Australia. The Government prates about its balanced trade policy, yet it follows up a goodwill mission for the purpose of improving trade relations with another country by precipitating a trade war with that country! We are urged to accept the decisions of the Tariff Board without question. The board is required to work within severely restricted limits. If it had merely to implement a straightout tariff policy, I believe that it could carry out its job more satisfactorily than it is able to do under present circumstances. The powers of the board are seriously restricted by articles 10, 11 and 12 of the Ottawa Agreement. [Leave to continue given.] That agreement unquestionably restricts the work of the board in endeavouring to protect Australian industries. In addition to that, the Government enters into trade agreements with foreign countries such as that made with Czechoslovakia. This again hampers the operations of the hoard, and it is not surprising that that body submits some recommendations which honorable members generally do not find acceptable. This is not the fault of the board, but is due to the uncertain political atmosphere in which it works, not knowing from day to day what further restrictions may be imposed upon it. The system of Tariff Board inquiries has no inherent fault; the causes of the dissatisfaction are the restrictions imposed and the vacillating policy of the Government. The Labour party makes no bones about the fact that it favours the building up of Australia's secondary industries, and, as far as primary industries are concerned, no Ministry in Australia has given them greater consideration than have Labour governments. In the depths of the crisis, when the wheat men were in difficulties, a Labour Minister sought to come to their assistance; but the anti-Labour majority in the Senate, mostly members of the Country party, were responsible for the defeat of the proposals then submitted. If the Scullin tariff had not been introduced to check the flood of imports, it is difficult to estimate to what depths of depression and disaster this country might have fallen. The tariff alterations then made were necessary because of the policy of previous anti-Labour governments. There were heavy commitments to meet overseas, prices on the overseas markets had collapsed, and there was the growth of economic nationalism in foreign countries. These disabilities were inherited, not created, by the Scullin Government. Lt is cowardly for honorable members opposite, who took part in the discussions in those days, and who supported the financial proposals of the Scullin Administration, to complain about the policy to which it gave effect. The present Ministry is raking off the benefits accruing from the Scullin tariff policy under the guise of being a ' prosperity ' government. The workers in our secondary industries have a more uncertain tenure under the present Government, because of its vacillating tariff policy, than they have ever had before.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS 193:7-38","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[4]/continue[11]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I should like to take a broad view of the tariff problem. The Scullin Government came into power by frightening the manufacturers of Australia into the belief that the Bruce-Page Government would destroy their industries, because Mr. Bruce had promised a scientific investigation to ascertain whether Australia was carrying any inefficient industries. He bad also said that there was to be one Arbitration Court. The Opposition then informed the people that Mr. Bruce would do away with the tariff, and that it would abolish arbitration, which had proved a great bulwark in the past. [Quorum formed.]  Hitting suspended from 12.^3 to 2.15 p.m. Prior to the luncheon adjournment I was proceeding to show that the Scullin Government came into power by taking up the elements of the speech of the right honorable S. M. Bruce, before the Premiers Conference in 1929, when he pointed out that we were about to enter the greatest depression that Australia would ever know, and that, unlike previous depressions, which were caused possibly by drought and remedied by good seasons, the coming depression would take much more than a good season to remedy. He said that this country could not afford the duplication of Arbitration Courts; we muse choose between a court controlled by the Commonwealth or courts controlled by the States-; we must have one, and one only. However, he also said, ' We must have a more scientific tariff; we must cause an expert examination to be made into these matters.' Well, the Opposition took up those statements, which, to my mind, were sound and sane, and eventually proved to be true. Great support was given to Opposition candidates by civil servants and other workers a3 the result of a statement issued by the Labour party during the election campaign that the Bruce Page Government proposed to destroy our great Arbitration Court, for which we had so strenuously fought. To the manufacturers that party said, ' The Bruce Page Government proposes to do away with the protective tariff which has built up our great national industries.' Each of those two great sections of the people hearkened to these statements with the result that the Bruce-Page Government was badly defeated and Labour, particularly because of the support given by the manufacturers of this country, came into power in Australia. The honorable member for Denison (Mr. Mahoney) has denied that the Labour party received great assistance from the manufacturers in the elections at which the Scullin Government was elected to office. I have good evidence that that must have been so, however, because just prior to the last federal elections, the Labour party issued to the capitalistic manufacturers of Australia a confidential circular signed by the honorable member for Lang (Mr. Mulcahy) as secretary of the finance committee of the party. I am sorry that the honorable member for Wimmera (Mr. Wilson) is not present in the chamber, because he would find the quotation which I am a'bout to make informative. The circular, which was issued to Australian manufacturers from the federal members' rooms, Sydney, and dated August, 1937, contained the following paragraph: -","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS 193:7-38","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If I had time I could refer similarly to the profits of the glass companies, and those of many other highly protected concerns in this country could be so cited. It is from such companies that the Federal Labour party cadged money to fight the representatives of the men on the land in this Parliament. For tunately, while I presume the manufacturers gave the Labour party great assistance to defeat the Bruce-Page Government, ' Once caught, twice shy.' I do not think the Labour party got to o much out of these concerns because it gained little or no ground. However, Mr. Bruce's prophecy pr.ov.ed to be true, and the Scullin Government came in to power, and, to keep faith with the capitalistic manufacturers, it imposed embargoes and, in some cases, tabled tariff duties without reference to the Tariff Board. Presumably, as has been claimed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Forde) and others, that was done to regulate the balance of trade. I have heard speeches here, notably from the honorable member for Lang (Mr. Mulcahy), who signed the circular to the manufacturers, that we should get back to the Scullin Government's tariff; yet, according to the protestations of honorable members opposite, the imposition of embargoes was only a temporary measure to rectify the balance of trade and that subsequently embargoes would have been removed. Yet when the present Government does what Labour said it intended to do, abolishes embargoes and reduces the duties on 2,000 items of the tariff, honorable members opposite keep on saying that secondary industries are being ruined. Did they listen to .the figures supplied by the Minister for Trade and Cus to ms showing that, as the result of this Government's policy, 104,000 more men are employed in secondary industries than ever before; more fac to ries exist in Australia than before; and more general prosperity exists among the people generally? It cannot be denied that every increase of the tariff has been accompanied by' an increase of unemployment in this country. That statement can be statistically proved. The Scullin Government :amE in to power, and, consistent with its promise, placed heavy embargoes on the importation of certain goods in to this country and increased the tariff to a prohibitive level. The now Deputy Leader of the Opposition, then Minister for Trade and Cus to ms, in tabling new schedules, said to the House that they would result in 1,500 more men being employed in this class of employment, 500 more in that, and so on. -If his prognostications had proved to be true, there would have been no unemployment in this country. But what are the actual facts? For every four minutes he was in office a man lost his joh, and by the time his own party - not the then Opposition - put him out of office, unemployment had reached the highest level at which it had ever s to od, the credit of this country wa3 at its lowest ebb, and in order to bridge the gap caused by the loss of cus to ms revenue, amounting to nearly £20,000,000, as the result of the imposition of embargoes and prohibitions, his Government had found it necessary to send to Canada for an expert to explain how sales tax and primage duty might be imposed. The price of Australian bonds had dropped to £67, taxation was increased, and it was not known whether the Public Service could be paid.

When the Lyons Government came into power, the reverse policy was introduced.

Those that had been increased without reference to the Tariff Board were restored to their former level, a little competition was brought into trade in Australia, our bonds rose until they were returning a premium, and customs revenue flowed into the national exchequer, enabling the Government greatly to reduce the sales tax, primage duty, income tax, and all other forms of taxation.

The Deputy  Leader of the Opposition thought that, if goods were not imported, local manufacturers would be bound to get the additional trade; but he left out of consideration one factor, namely, that the primary producers of Australia were about £100,000.000 -short in their exports by reason of the fall of commodity prices. It is all very well to say that the primary and secondary industries should operate side by side. By means of legislation, the secondary industries have been pushed far ahead, and have swamped the primary industries. I say emphatically that there would have been no depression in Australia to-day but for the fall which took place in our export commodity prices. Only when there is a revival of prices is the politician able to tell the people that we are turning the corner. The right honorable member for Yarra (Mr. Scullin), when Prime Minister of this country, did not appeal to the secondary industries to produce more goods so as to increase the national income and establish credits abroad. On every envelope that passed through the post, the wheatgrowers were urged to grow more wheat. When pushed into a corner, the government of the day recognized the paramount advantage of the primary industries and their value to this country.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS 193:7-38","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[5]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Some of the States said that it was impossible for them to agree to that proposal. Mr. Parker Moloney wa3 then asked whether, if a State, could not pay its 'half, the Commonwealth would pay its own half, but we were not able to get any satisfaction on that point. Subsequently, a measure was brought, down guaranteeing a payment of 3s. n bushel to the wheat-growers of Australia. 1 hat measure passed both houses of this Parliament and was approved by His Majesty's representative, but not one shilling was ever paid to the wheatgrowers under it.  A good deal has been said about trade diversion. The honorable member for Wimmera does not seem to remember that the honorable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory) and 1 did not approve of that policy. Had I, or indeed my friend from Swan, made the remarks that have been made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honorable member for Kennedy (Mr. Riordan), or the honorable member for Darling (Mr. Clark), we should at least have been consistent, but coming from those who imposed embargoes not only against Japan, but also against every other country, they are certainly inconsistent.

Honorable members of the Opposition are the highest tariffists with whom I am acquainted, and must, therefore, accept, the position that they incite war and unfriendliness with other countries.  Prior to the imposition of embargoes by the Scullin Government, this country had a favorable trade balance with five countries, namely, Italy, France, Belgium, Germany and Japan, aggregating over £41,000,000 a year. The honorable member for Hume (Mr. Collins) has mentioned that, at that time, Belgium took from us goods to the value of £9,000,000, and Australia took from Belgium goods to the value of a little less than £1.000,000. But Australia was not satisfied with that favorable position. A glass company was established in Sydney, and embargoes and high tariffs were imposed on Belgian glass imported into this country. That action, naturally,, offended Belgium. Had I been a. Belgian, I should have said that it was most contemptible. Of what benefit has the glass company been to Australia? Its dividends have hardly been as substantial as those of General Motors-Holden's Limited, but an insufficient quantity of glass has been produced, and the requirements of the community have not been met. That has been the case also in connexion with galvanized iron. None of these industries could survive if it were not for the credit established abroad by our export industries, 97£ per cent, of which are primary industries. It is all very well to say that primary and secondary industries should go hand in hand. Too great a fillip has been given to the secondary industries, and that has had a deleterious effect in many ways. The result of a high tariff policy is to raise the cost of production to such a degree that the goods which are produced under it cannot be sold outside of Australia, consequently expansion is limited to the demands of our own country. Itwould be an excellent thing if the commodities produced by secondary industries in Australia could be sold abroad, as are the commodities produced by the primary industries. Why did not the right honorable member for Yarra say to the boot manufacturers, ' Produce more boots and sell some of them abroad. I want money brought into this country, and credits established overseas.' Why did he not say to the shirt manufacturers, the collar manufacturers, and others, ' Why do you not endeavour to sell some of your goods abroad, and thus establish credit which will enable us to meet the cost of what cannot be produced in Australia'?

Some of them have seen fit to criticize the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Forde), but the honorable gentleman has been consistent in his endeavours to protect the workers of this country from unfair competition.  I appeal to the Government to accord a greater degree of protection to the fishing industry. I have in mind, particularly, the fishing industry of Tasmania. Promises have been made at various times that adequate protection would be given to this industry to stabilize it, but up to the present very little has been done to fulfil the promise. I understand that an officer of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research ha3 reported favorably upon the possibilities of establishing a lucrative fishing industry in Tasmania. A new vessel has been built to assist in the fishing investigations, and it will probably cruise around the coasts of the Commonwealth of Australia to make further investigations. Seeing that fish of one kind and another is imported into Australia to a value of £1,459,724 annually, scope undoubtedly exists for developing our own fishing resources. It should not be necessary for the Australian people to buy imported fish. If adequate protection were provided for the industry they would not need to do so. Australian fish is of excellent quality, and it should be made available to our people at reasonable prices. I regret that the Government saw fit three years ago to lift the primage duty from imported fish. That was a blow to the Australian industry. It is regrettable that honorable members from the smaller States have to make so many appeals to the Government to give adequate consideration to the industries that have been established within those States. It seems to me that the representatives of large States are able to obtain almost anything they ask for from the Government. I protest against this obvious preference to the larger and more popular States. If the Tasmanian fishing industry were adequately encouraged, additional employment would be provided for many of our people and they would not need to remain on the dole. Unfortunately the Government intends to continue its lenient treatment to importers. That can be understood, of course, for the importing interests made substantial contributions to the funds of the Government parties prior to the last election campaign. I heartily support the eloquent plea of the honorable member for Franklin (Mr. Frost) for additional protection for the Australian paper making industry. The Tariff Board is making an investigation into this subject, and I hope that it will issue a favourable report. The paper-manufacturing industry could be developed in Tasmania to such an extent that employment could he provided there for thousands more men. Australia imports annually 241,199 tons of newsprint, valued at £2,593,305. The development of this industry in Tasmania would therefore clearly be beneficial to the whole community.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS 193:7-38","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I congratulate the honorable member for Franklin also on his remarks concerning the need for assistance to be given to the tobacco industry in Tasmania, which has the climate and every other attribute necessary for the production of the finest tobacco leaf in the world. Tobacco experts with world experience have told me that the Tasmanian leaf manufactures into the best cigars. I commend to the Government the need to protect the Australian tobacco industry to the full because I think that the day is not far distant when locally-grown tobacco will be better than any other tobacco in the world. .Tasmania is taking the lead in producing high-quality leaf, but it is necessary that the industry be given some financial assistance. If the Government has its way and continues to remove the tariff on imported leaf, however, the American interests will capture the whole of the trade in Australia and the Australian growers will be forced off their plantations on to the dole. If heed were given to what the honorable member for Franklin suggested to-day, Tasmanian tobacco would gain a reputation equal to that which is held to-day by Tasmanian apples which are the best in the world. All that Tasmanian apple-growers need is a market and they fear no competitor. I have the greatest admiration for the Scullin Government, which introduced a tariff designed to protect Australian industries.

Ever since I have been in this Parliament I have heard the honorable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory) sermonize about freetrade. I advise the honorable member to pack up and get out of this country to a country where there is such a thing as freetrade. He will not do so however, because he knows that this country is the best country in the world for primary producers. Some primary producers are a failure, and then the other farmers, sympathizing with them, send them to this Parliament to misrepresent them. My purpose as a member of this Parliament is to do my best to protect the Australian workers, and this brings me to another most important aspect of the tariff. Some companies are making enormous profits, and T believe that the workers that they employ should share in. those profits and get higher wages. A motor body-building works in South Australia made a profit of about £1,000,000 last year. That company, I should say, has adequate protection, but I doubt whether it would have made such enormous profits but for the fact that every farmer purchased a motor car out of the money voted by this Parliament for rural rehabilitation and wheat bounties. Having enjoyed the bounty of the Commonwealth Government the farmers should not turn around and advocate a lowering of the Australian standard of living. If we were able to put every boy and girl who left school into industry and to banish unemployment, the great bulk of the food and other produce grown in Australia to-day would be absorbed in this country. I congratulate the honorable member for Wimmera on his having revealed to the committee the intriguing and price-fixing that goes on between the producer and the middleman. I should be glad to 3ee the middlemen eliminated from trade, for they pay the producers very little for their goods and then sell to the public at big profits.  From day to day events tend to strengthen my belief that the writing is on the wall and that this Government will, at the first opportunity, be dismissed from office by the people of Australia. The voting for the Senate at the last general elections was sufficient indication of the turn of the people against this Government. The Labour party then had sixteen of its nominees elected to the Senate, and when they take their seats in July some of the old conservatives will go down the road from which there will he no return. Next time the Australian people will not be swayed by the poisonous propaganda of the press and the broadcasting stations, and will throw this Government from office. The United Australia party represents the big importers and other merchants, but the Country party j acting for the time being, holds the power. I appeal to the Minister for Trade and Customs to make a visit to the wonderful island of Tasmania and see for himself the great possibilities for development that exist there. For this development, however, financial assistance is necessary. If the fishing industry, the tobacco industry and the paper-pulp industry in Tasmania could be placed on a proper basis, that State would be prosperous. Some honorable members opposite favour the protection of Australian industries, irrespective of the States in which they are established, and I hope that all representatives of the larger States will be prepared to help Tasmania in this respect. I heartily support the remarks of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who pointed out the value of our secondary industries, and the danger to our own people in allowing the importation of goods produced overseas by cheap labour. The success of the sugar-growers of Queensland furnishes a striking example of the value of adequate protection of local industries.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS 193:7-38","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[6]/continue[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

So many young people are now looking for work that they cannot all be placed on the land. Many of them will have to be equipped for service in secondary industries. No country has ever been built up under a policy of freetrade. It may be remarked that Great Britain was formerly a freetrade country. 1 remind the committee that it was also the principal manufacturing centre of the world. The policy of national self sufficiency, which has been adopted by many countries, has enabled them to become self-contained. About 96 per cent, of our exports are products of primary industries, but, by encouraging secondary industries, we could provide a valuable home market for our primary producers. I regret, Mr. Chairman, that you, in your speech, blamed the Scullin Government somewhat for the position in which Australia found itself when that Ministry was in office. I think you said that there would have been no depression, had it not been for the reduction of commodity prices. I have opposed the Scullin Government, and members of the Opposition generally, because of their political views, but we should be fair to our political opponents. I have never heard any member on this side attribute the depression to the Scullin Government. The depression was world-wide, and that Government could not have done other than prevent the importation of goods from overseas by the imposition of tariff restrictions and embargoes. We had all stated on the public platforms that budgets had to be balanced. The Scullin Government brought experts from Great Britain to give advice as to how best to deal with the chaotic conditions prevailing here. The Bruce-Page Government, of which I was a member, was accused of spendthrift habits; but honorable members on all sides, and, in fact, the people generally, have been spendthrift. This accentuated the difficulties experienced when the depression overtook us.  Whilst I give credit to the present Government for the relief which has followed the lifting of tariff restrictions, and favour the development of our trade with other nations, our first duty is to build tip Australian industries, in order that we may have a virile and contented people. Even if exorbitant profits have been made by the Australian manufacturers of motor-car bodies, is it not worth while encouraging an industry that gives employment to 20,000 workers? Surely we are glad to have the great iron and steel industry established in this country. Are not the works at Port Kembla worth while? These industries are the very basis of our prosperity. If, occasionally, some of them make more profit than we think they should have, it is within the power of this Parliament to rectify the position. The people are entitled to the products of secondary industries at reasonable prices. Within the last fifteen years, the electric meter manufacturing industry has been established in Australia, and to-day it employs 1,000 technicians. Is that industry not of value to this country? The goods which it produces meet the requirements, not only of Australia, but also of New Zealand. One cannot help being convinced as to the progress made by the primary industries of Australia, but I would remind members of the Country party that those industries have not developed so rapidly as have the secondary industries1.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS 193:7-38","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I give my political opponents credit for having endeavoured to promote the development of both primary and secondary industries, and I suggest that it should be recognized by the Opposition that the present Government has made a genuine attempt to place the secondary industries on a competitive basis. Occasionally, I have disagreed with recommendations made by the Tariff Board, and, no doubt, I shall do so again. Every member, irrespective of the party to which he belongs, is entitled to his personal views on tariff matters. The Bruce-Page Government adopted a policy which represented a compromise between the opinions of the two parties which combined to form that ministry, and surely it should now be possible to evolve a policy which will meet the needs of the people generally.  Reference has been made to the claim? of Tasmania for assistance in establishing secondary industries in that State. No member from New South Wales has done anything to injure the smaller States. I have been accused in my own State of voting too much money to the smaller States, but I have always pointed out that they are entitled to all the assistance that can be given to them. Western Australia, which is sparsely populated, would benefit from the building up in that State of secondary industries. It is claimed that the eastern .States are getting the bulk of the trade, because the tariff helps the secondary industries which are carried on mainly in the larger States. Why do not the manufacturers of the eastern States go to Western Australia and endeavour to develop the secondary industries of that State? Western Australia has great possibilities, not only for the development of primary production, but also for the investment of the capital in secondary industries. The expansion of secondary industries creates an increasing market for the Supply of both primary and secondary products; there are so many extra mouths to feed, so many more boots and shoes to be made for the workers and their children, and so much clothing to he manufactured to meet their requirements. Australia undoubtedly provides the best market for our primary producers and secondary industries alike.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS 193:7-38","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[7]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Why have we had to bring tradesmen from the Old Country to fill jobs which should be occupied by Australians if this is not so? The wisest course is to give all fathers employed in industry an opportunity to get their boys into decent jobs.  I have always tried to be fair in my criticism of the Scullin Government and of the Labour party as a whole. I have always admitted frankly that the aim of the Labour party in the Australian political field is to develop all industries, and I expect the members of that party to concede to me the right to have the same objective. By joint efforts I feel sure that we could do much to develop the industries of Australia as a whole. At any rate we should make every attempt to get away from the sectional idea of helping only one class of people or one industry at the expense of others. Opportunities for all should be our aim. An embargo was placed upon the importation of potatoes into this country from New Zealand. Why have we not been honest with the New Zealand Government in connexion with this matter? Indeed we have not even been honest with ourselves. It is all very well to say that the prohibition of the importation of potatoes from.

Last Saturday morning I was taken over a tour of inspection of the properties of a number of tomatogrowers in the Mona Vale district of New South Wales, and was shown many diseases which are prevalent in that district. The growers claimed that if '' proper care had been taken by the quarantine authorities ' those diseases would not. have appeared in their area. 'While I was in New Zealand I toured 3,000 miles around the North Island and gained some first-hand information in regard to farming operations in that part of the dominion. The farmers there are very progressive, and our farmers might do very well to apply their methods. I should like to see the two sister dominions brought more closely together, instead of dragged further apart. What was the result of the embargo on the importation of the potatoes from New Zealand?

We cannot have protection for all primary industries and freetrade for all the things the farmers have to buy. The time must come when men working in primary industries must be given a fair return for their labour, just as are the employees in secondary industries. While visiting a large estate at Bodalla, about ten years ago, I was informed by the trustee that he could never get men to stay there and do a decent day's work. He raised cows, calves and pigs. He did not know what the trouble was, and I suggested to him that he should get his employees together and have a talk with them, because they evidently had a grouch of which he knew nothing. He did so and asked the men what the trouble was. After hearing their complaints, he said to his employees, 'For every nine pigs born on the estate, I shall give you one-ninth, and for every five calves I shall give you one.' From that date he could not get rid of a man. Employees must be given some of the profits derived by industry,, whether it be primary or secondary. 1 do not suggest that we should say to the primary producers of Australia ' You must pay the basic wage.' I know the difficulties associated with primary industries which have to sell their products at. world parity prices. In their present position, many sections of our primary producers could not afford to pay the basic wage. Having in mind the difficulties which confront the primary industries, I have always given my support to any subsidy granted to assist them, either in a direct way, or for fertilizers, wire netting, galvanized iron and the like. My friend the honorable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory) has often told us a long story about the price of galvanized iron. A country which depends for. its very existence- on what it can produce from the soil must pay heed to the requirements of its producers! Iron and steel production is a very vital matter. In Australia, iron and steel are produced more cheaply than in any other country in the world.","N/A","TARIFF PROPOSALS 193:7-38","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[7]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

For an industry to be entirely successful, employees must be taken into partnership with their employers. The two must work in harmony. Only if an industry is worth while, should it be given every assistance, because it provides avenues for the employment of our young people; if it is not worth while, let us face up to the position and scrap it. I repeat that if the primary producers of this country can look forward, not to competing with cheap countries for the sale of their products, but to their sale in this country, they will prosper. When I was in London in 1929, the Labour Government led by Mr. Ramsay MacDonald had just been elected. At a luncheon party at which I was present with Ministers of the Cabinet, I said to the assembled gathering ' It i3 extraordinary to me that you Labour men have been returned on a policy of a cheap breakfast table for the working man. That means that you are in favour of free trade and the importation from cheap producing countries of everything needed in England. You should see what the Australian Labour party is attempting to do for the development of Australian industries. How will you expect the working man in England to buy a cheap breakfast when he no longer has a job to provide him with the wherewithal to purchase it?' England had to alter its policy, and has had to become a more or less protectionist country. I regret that we occasionally allow our minds to drift into parochial thoughts. I shall give every support to the Country party to help the man on the land just as I shall support the representatives of city electorates in this Parliament in their efforts to develop the great secondary industries of Australia. I hope at a later stage to have an opportunity with other honorable members to rectify what we consider to be faults in the present tariff schedule.

I have received numerous letters from the employees who are left in the cutglass industry in my electorate, relative to this tariff schedule. A few years ago, when there was fairly reasonable tariff protection, the number of employees in these works was in the vicinity of 600 or 700. To-day, there are not 100, and they realize that if this tariff schedule is put into operation they will lose their employment, because the company cannot compete against the products of overseas manufacturers, which are being dumped in Australia. Men were brought out from Czechoslovakia and Belgium to develop the industry and to teach the Australian workmen.

This afternoon, I wish to place before honorable members other phases of the situation which I think demand that this House should give further consideration to the matter. In making any suggestion in regard to matters connected with Commonwealth railway administration, my sole desire is to be helpful - to bring about harmony and a better understanding between those who are required to manage the railway service and those who are employed by it. When at Port Augusta recently, I was surprised at the number of people who placed before me grievances under which they felt they were suffering in connexion with the working of the service. I have no wish to embarrass those on whom rests the responsibility of administering the service, but merely wish to offer whatever help I am capable of giving in order that difficulties may be straightened out and the service made more efficient. When I previously raised the matter, I mentioned that there is a medical fund associated with the Commonwealth Railway service. This fund has been in operation for a considerable number of years. The obligation rests on the employee- to make a contribution to the fund, and it has been subsidized by the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner. I understand that a very satisfactory arrangement was made between the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner and the employees. Later an award made by the Public Service Arbitrator provided that certain sick leave benefits should accrue to the employees. The Public Service Arbitrator inserted that provision in his award having full cognizance of the benefits conferred by the medical fund. For some unknown reason, the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner notified his intention to discontinue the subsidy which the department was paying. This aroused a good deal of feeling among the members of the railway service. They felt that this action sought to defeat the determination of the Public Service Arbitrator. Since I raised the matter during the last period of the session, the Commissioner has been to Port Augusta and lias conferred with the board which is managing this particular fund. An agreement was arrived at, the representatives of the Local Trades' Council accepting the suggestion of the Commissioner that the fund should be continued provided that he should not be required to subsidize it, and that the department should be responsible for its administration. I am informed that those who consented to this agreement represented only the depot section of the employees, not the whole of the Commonwealth railway service; the one exception was the Australian Workers Union representative. The men who are most vitally concerned are those who are in the line section and live a long distance from the principal centres such as Port Augusta and Quorn. It is quite true that those who represented the depot section agreed to the proposal of the Commissioner, but the Australian Workers Union repudiates the action of its representative in agreeing to what was proposed. That organization has a very large number of members who are employed in the line section of the Commonwealth railway service. I have received a communication from Mr. Musgrave, the secretary of the Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen, which was not consulted in any way in regard to the new basis on which the fund should operate, although it is substantially representative of the men who -are covered by it. Those who actually determined the matter and accepted the new agreement were the section, who had less necessity to rely on the services of the medical fund and to whom the subsidy by the Commissioner was of much less consequence. According to Mr. Musgrave's letter to me, the employees in the depot section made a contribution of ls. a week to the fund, but I understand that that was not subsidized in the same way as was the amount paid by those who are employed in the line section, which was ls. 8d. a week. It is quite easy for every member of the depot section to see that his interests in regard to medical care are conserved, but the men on the line section, because of the distance and isolation, are not in the same happy « position and consequently suffer a disability. Surely it is only reasonable and fair that those engaged in this occupation should be consulted in a matter of this kind, to assure that uniform conditions will apply and that they will not be deprived of acknowledged advantages that the medical fund has made possible. I should think that this matter requires only the application of grace and common sense in order to reach a satisfactory decision.  I wish to refer briefly to another phase of railway employment. The officers of the Commonwealth railway service have no tribunal to which they may appeal against decisions of the Commissioner affecting their salaries and their status. In every other department of the Commonwealth Service a tribunal of this kinds exists, so that officers who are aggrieved for any purpose may have their grievances investigated. It seems to me, therefore, that a similar tribunal should exist in the railway service. I was astounded recently to learn that trusted .and most valuable officers of the railway service who had applied for leave obtained leave, but simultaneously received an intimation that upon resuming work subsequently, they would suffer a reduction of pay even by the substantia] amount of £35 a year. Several officers have been treated in this way. Surely an officer placed in such a position should 'be entitled to have the facts investigated by an appeal tribunal. If this had been an isolated case I should have taken it direct to the Commissioner, but as it is not I feel that it is a matter which should be brought under the notice of the Government. An appeal tribunal should be available to the officers of the railway service so that whenever any question relating to their salary or conditions or their status is decided to their detriment, they may have the whole matter investigated.","Commonwealth Railway Employees","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I cannot expect more from the Treasurer (Mr. Casey), who is in charge of the House, than an undertaking that he will bring the matter under the attention of his colleague.  On the loth February last, a nonnaturalized Italian named Orlando, who was visiting a battleship lying in the port of Melbourne, was assaulted and maltreated. It has not been denied, and it seems to be very well established, that a serious and unprovoked assault was committed. It is also well established that Orlando was at that time, and had been for some years, a resident of Australia, obedient to Australian laws, and entitled, as he thought, to the protection of the Australian law. It has been suggested, although it seems to me to be entirely irrelevant, that he was what is known as a Communist. As a matter of fact he has denied that statement and no proof of it has been submitted. In any case, it appears to me to be irrelevant and immaterial. It has also been suggested that during the visit of this particular battleship some -feeling developed in certain clubs and among certain Italian communities in Melbourne. But that, in my opinion, has nothing to do with this assault. The material fact is that, Orlando, who, like others, was invited to go aboard this battleship as the guest of the Italian commander was, while he was aboard the ship, I am very sorry to say, assaulted and maltreated in a cowardly and brutal manner by certain ratings of the ship. Although Orlando is not a naturalized Australian, he married an Australian gi'rl, and is the father of children born in Australia. All the evidence that I have been able to gather - and there is nothing to contradict it - is that he is a desirable and law-abiding person. A peculiar thing followed this assault. The victim was treated by a medical officer on the warship and, as far as I know, properly treated; but he was afterwards submitted to a searching examination as to his political views and activities in this country.

The honorable member for Bourke joined with me in the view that it was not a serious international matter, and, indeed, I said that it was not. Nevertheless, it is an important 'matter, because there are important matters of principle involved in it. As indicating the consequences of the occurrence, I said -","Commonwealth Railway Employees","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[2]/para[4]","N/A","N/A"

If, all these facts having been put before the Italian Government, no redress or compensation is offered to the party who was wronged, I certainly say that a polite intimation should be made to the authorities of that country that neither that particular ship nor her commander would be welcome again in Australian waters. That would be the very least that we should do.  The Minister for External Affairs, in answer to a question, said that he had approached the Italian Acting Consul-General in connexion with this matter, and that that gentleman had said that, as he was relinquishing office, he should discuss it with his successor. I dissent from the view that an Australian Minister of the Crown is required on any basis of propriety to go running after a consul in this country to make representations. On another occasion during the war I said that consuls had no diplomatic standing, that they were not diplomatic agents but trade agents, and, if they were granted certain specific diplomatic qualities, those should not be exceeded in any particular. I dissent entirely from the view that this is a matter for conversations between a consul and a Minister of the Crown in Australia. In saying that, I say it to uphold the status of Australian Ministers of the Crown in their own country. I do not think that a great deal should be made out of this matter, but I think that the man who was injured should have redress from the people who injured him. I think that a nation of the politeness and sense of justice of the people to whom I have referred, and with whom we are on friendly terms and for whom I have admiration, would seek to do. the right thing in the circumstances. I conclude by saying that we will not let this matter rest until we have had a firm answer from the Government.","Commonwealth Railway Employees","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[2]/para[5]","N/A","N/A"

I regret that it is necessary to bring this matter before Parliament, because I realize that it is not of the wide importance that should characterize matters dealt with by this national assembly, but this is the only opportunity to bring the position of the men concerned before the Government. For that reason, and because I am honorary federal president of one of the unions most affected, the locomotive running men, I speak in support of the honorable member for Hindmarsh. I do not desire to traverse the field already covered by that honorable gentleman, but feel that I should say that the men fail to see what justification the Commissioner had in withdrawing the subsidy. 'When the Commonwealth Public Service Arbitrator made an award for the Commonwealth railways which made provision for the payment of sick pay, the Commis sioner took the view that there was no longer any need to subsidize the fund which up till then had been carried on very successfully. Men engaged on parts of the line removed from the depots where there are hospitals are called upon to make a contribution of ls. 8d. to the benefit fund as against the amount of ls. contributed by other employees. When the new award was made, the Commissioner sent out a notification that he proposed to withdraw the subsidy that was made under Rule 11 of the fund, which reads -","Commonwealth Railway Employees","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Commissioner paid a visit to the line and apparently had a conference with men representing the organizations and, following that conference, withdrew the subsidy, apparently by agreement, but I am informed that the men away from the depot were not represented. About 150 members of my organization work in districts far removed from the depots and have no hospitals or medical facilities and they were adversely affected as the result of the withdrawal. It is for the Government to consider whether the Commissioner has done the fair thing. As a matter of fact, it seems that the Commissioner's action was rather in the nature of a reprisal for advantages obtained under the new award. He had his representative at the arbitration inquiry and there is no doubt that the fact that a subsidized fund was in operation was capably put by that representative and taken into consideration by the arbitrator. We feel very strongly about this matter and consider that the subsidy should be retained for the men away from the depot because they are not in the bases where there is hospital and medical treatment for them. Much more could he said in order to indicate that the men have just grounds for asking the Government to inquire into this matter, but I shall content myself with the representations that have been made by the honorable mem- ber for Hindmarsh and myself in the hope that the Government will institute an inquiry, make it clear that the men are not to be dealt with unfairly, and that after further consideration the department will restore the subsidy.","Contributions - Line Section","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1[2]/para[2]","N/A","N/A"

During the recess, I was in close consultation over a long period with the Commissioner on this subject. The honorable member for Maribyrnong asked for an assurance by the Government that an inquiry would be made into this matter so that the men would feel that they would not be unfairly treated.

That was quite a new thing and it virtually duplicated the provisions which were made in the voluntary medical and sick fund.

The Commissioner was in correspondence and personal conference with the managers of the fund and the representatives of the unions. The matter was not concluded by the writing of one or two letters, nor by one interview.

These officials have displayed a great deal of patience in outback centres over a long period of years. When they are on leave they have to pay some one to act for them, and they also have to ibo responsible for the cash and documents over which they have control in ordinary circumstances. This seems to me to be unfair to these officers. When they are on leave, the persons relieving them should accept responsibility for the safe custody of the money and materials over which they have temporary control. The Deputy Postmaster-General in Hobart, has informed me that, under the present regulations, and owing to the policy of the department, those in charge of non-official post offices must accept that responsibility. I suggest that the matter should be further investigated. In' view of the large profits made by the department, these officials should be more generously treated in this direction as well as in others.  I have previously drawn attention to the claim to the old-age pension of Chinese who have been resident in Australia for many years. This matter has also been mentioned by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr. Holloway), who has referred to Chinese who have lived in Australia for many years, and have Droved to bc good citizens, but, because of certain provisions in the law relating to old-age pensions, they are ineligible to receive the pension. A number of Chinese in my electorate are similarly placed. I arn personally acquainted with an Assyrian who has been in Australia, to my knowledge, for over 30 years. He tells me that he came here when he was sixteen years of age. He has reared a family, and at times when he was more prosperous than he is to-day, he contributed considerably to the revenue of this country. I urge the Government to consider the amendment of the act to enable such persons, who have resided in Australia for a long time, and have proved themselves to be good citizens, to receive the pension. I hope that the Treasurer (Mr. Casey) will consider the claims of these persons, and endeavour to make their lot in their old age a little more comfortable than it now is.","Contributions - Line Section","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

On. the adjournment on the 10th May, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) and the honorable member for Hindmarsh (Mr. Makin) brought up the question of the appointment of a committee to inquire into certain alleged moral claims against the Commonwealth Government by Mr. G. K. McPhail in respect of the establishment of the alkali industry at Port Adelaide. In reply, I desire to state that, in accordance with instructions, the Crown Law Office of the Commonwealth has considered the claims put forward by Mr. McPhail - not on the basis of law, but on the basis of his contention that he has a moral claim against the Commonwealth. The Government has given careful consideration to the advice tendered by the Crown Law Office, and to the various contentions put forward by and on behalf of Mr. McPhail , and has endeavoured to arrive at the true facts of the case. It appears that Mr. McPhail bases his claims against the Commonwealth on two grounds. In the first place, he alleges that certain information supplied by him on a confidential basis to a committee appointed by the Commonwealth Government was disclosed to Imperial Chemical Industries Limited, with the result that this Company obtained the benefit of, and put into operation, his scheme for the establishment of the alkali industry. Mr. McPhail 's second ground of complaint is that in August, 1933, Senator A. J. McLachlan. broadcast a statement the effect of which was to frustrate Mr. McPhail 's plans to establish the industry. As to the first ground, the Government is satisfied that no disclosure to Imperial Chemical Industries Limited of confidential information supplied by Mr. McPhail to the committee took place. As a matter of fact - as appears from a letter dated the 2nd May, 1932, which he wrote to the Secretary of the Prime Minister's Department - Mr. McPhail himself had communicated to the company as early as September, 1931, such information as he then had at his disposal. The Government is satisfied, therefore, that Mr. McPhail has no moral claim against the Commonwealth on the ground that information supplied confidentially to the committee was disclosed to Imperial Chemical Industries Limited. With regard to the second ground, there is no evidence to support the belief that the statement broadcast by Senator A. J. McLachlan had any prejudicial effect upon Mr. McPhail 's attempts to form a company for the establishment of the alkali industry. The Government has looked very carefully into this aspect of the case, but there is nothing to show that, when the statement was broadcast, Mr. McPhail was either in the process of forming a company, or had any promise of the substantial capital support required to establish the enterprise. In view of the foregoing, the Government has come to the conclusion that the circumstances do not justify the appointment of a committee as proposed in the letter of the 28th August last, to which the Leader of the Opposition has referred.","Contributions - Line Section","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[4]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
