The honorable member criticised adversely Captain Glossop's handling of H.M.A.S. Sydney in the duel with the German light cruiser Emden . In the first place, I would point out that the loss of life on the Sydney was small. Out of a complement of 400, three men were killed and fifteen wounded. The best Naval opinion is that the action against the Emden was ably and skilfully fought. The officer most exposed to the enemy's fire was Captain Glossop himself, as shown by the fact that the first casualty occurred beside him on the bridge. The Admiralty's ' appreciation of his work was shown by the conferring on him, of the Most Honorable Order of the Companion of the Bath. I trust that no more of these unwarranted attacks will be made upon a distinguished officer, who by his prompt and efficient action made the name of Australia ring throughout the civilized world by ridding the Empire of a raider which had done millions of pounds worth of damage.","Criticism of Captain Glossop","SINKING OF THE EMDEN","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We do not enjoy a reciprocal transfer of men from Western Australia to the eastern States, and I think the position of returned soldiers in the West, who desire to qualify for the Service, is being unjustly prejudiced by the sending over of men from the eastern States. I ask for some definite pronouncement on this matter from the Acting Prime Minister, because, when in the past, we have protested against Defence Department appointments of this kind, we have been informed that for the purposes of the Public Service the Government regard the Commonwealth as a whole, and take no notice of State boundaries. However, this practice operates unjustly against the returned soldiers in a State which did its part in the war extremely well.

I do not know whether or not the allegations made in the telegram are substantially correct, or whether, if they are, the practice referred to is followed at the instance of the Commissioner of Taxation, or is inter-departmental. All I can say at this stage is that the Government has laid down no policy of the kind indicated. The sending of officers to Western Australia appears to be an automatic operation of the Commonwealth Public Service machine. But if I were a resident of the West, and saw a drift of officers from the eastern States to the disadvantage of Western men, whether returned soldiers or not, I should be inclined to voice the indignation of the Western State. Of course, the theory is generally held that the Commonwealth Service is one body throughout Australia, and many transfers to Defence Department positions and others have teen made that are of a thoroughly reciprocal nature. That is the only way in which promotion can be gained in certain branches of the Service. However, if the honorable member for Swan will be content with this answer for to-day, I shall inquire into the matter and furnish him, as early as possible next week, with a more definite reply. If he is not then satisfied, he will be able to take further action.

It has been the practice in the past or men returning to Australia to be required to furnish a certificate that they would return the Military greatcoat on issue to them immediately after discharge, unless they joined the Army Reserve, in which case the retention of the greatcoat was permitted. Failing fulfilment of this undertaking men were charged with the value of the overcoat. The return of the greatcoat was considered necessary in order to maintain adequate supplies for A.I.F. requirements, including re-issues to troops overseas. The cessation of hostilities, and the rapidity with which our troops are returning has, however, enabled a stock to be accumulated in Australia, and it is no longer necessary to insist on the return of the articles in question; consequently, instructions have been given that all returning members of the A.I.F. may retain, without payment, the greatcoats on issue to them. It is the intention that men already demobilized shall be re-issued with greatcoats in cases in which coats have been withdrawn on discharge.

It was approved by the Cabinet that the pay of the Royal Australian Garrison Artillery be equalized to that of mobilized Australian Garrison Artillery (Militia) rates by the payment of a war allowance for the period of the war, to date from 1st July, 1917. This concession was also extended to certain other units of the Permanent Forces. As the highest rank below ' Commissioned ' officer in the A.G.A. (Militia) is Company Sergeant-Major - pay,11s. per diem - no provision was made for the payment of war allowance to ranks of Permanent Forces in receipt of pay higher than that of C.S.M. Warrant Officers and Noncommissioned Officers of the Instructional Staff, who were practically employed seven days per week in Australian Imperial Force Camps and Schools of Instruction, were paid extra duty pay, at the rate of1s. 6d. per diem, whilst so employed. This payment was reviewed in 1917; and, in view of the fact that the work had somewhat eased down, the payment of extra duty pay was superseded by the granting of a daily allowance of 9d. to all Warrant and Noncommissioned Officers of the Instructional Staff, and was likewise extended to members of the Survey Corps and Provost Staff. It was never intended that any member of the Permanent Forces should be adversely affected, but that they should be placed on at least an equal footing to mobilized members of the A.G.A. At the same time, it was not intended that any member of the Permanent Forces already in receipt of pay and allowances greater in total than was payable to members of the A.G.A., of corresponding rank, should receive any additional payment.","WAR ALLOWANCE FOR GARRISON WARRANT OFFICERS","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[18]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The reasons for cancellation and payments were that the Government considered it sound policy, after the conclusion of the war, not to complete the contracts for wooden ships; and the payments made included progress payments and covered contractors' liabilities, as well as some measure of compensation. Advice has been received from the Commissioner for Australia in the United States, indicating that contracts for building 385 wooden vessels were cancelled by the American' Government, at an average cost of £13 5s. 4d. per ton, or a total cost of £14,942,877; and that they further cancelled the building of fifty-two ships, at a cost rather more than that involved in the cancellation of the 385 ships.

The answers to the honorable member's questions are as follow : - 1.The present system of medically examining members of the Australian Imperial Force on disembarkation is not cursory, and is considered more satisfactory than any alternative method. Men arriving from overseas are anxious to have their cases dealt with by a Medical Board as soon as possible, and this is achieved after scrutiny by a Board of experienced Medical Officers. Delay is not only unpopular with the men, but allows injuries and illnesses to become aggravated in the interval, while useless expense to the Commonwealth is caused. 2.Only a very few complaints are known to this Department, and of these several were unjustifiable. 3.The previous medical history, if available, is invariably considered at the time of examination. The instructions issued to the Commandant, Australian Imperial Force, Headquarters, London, provide that all medical history papers shall be placed on the same transport as the men embark on. A full medical examination is also made of the men while on the transports, and this is in the hands of the Examining Board.

My mind goes back to the first case taken under the price-fixing regulations, that of Burvett v. Farey . Burvett was the detective employed by the Department, and Farey was a baker in Kew or Hawthorn. I was a member of the Government at the time that case came before the High Court, and was very much interested to know whether we had the power to deal with price-fixing. The Crown Law Department had up to that date contended that we had no such power. Early in June, 1916, two or three months before I left the Government, a decision on the question was given in the High Court. Chief Justice Griffith said that the case of Burvett v. Farey raised a Defence matter, and that the action of the defendant affected recruiting in the Commonwealth. The question whether the money allotted by a soldier to his dependants was sufficient to buy bread and other commodities depended on their price, and he held that the fixing of the price of bread was within the Defence powers of the Commonwealth.  Mr.Fenton. - Did he not say that the action of the defendant interfered with the conduct of the war, and that the only people who were judges of what was necessary for the conduct of the war were the members of the Executive? I believe that he said something to that effect.

I have not had the time to look up this question and read the judgments which have been delivered in connexion with it. I can only speak of them from memory. Mr. Justice Higgins and Mr. Justice Isaacs gave judgments which were in accord with the decisions they have given throughout, backing up the Federal powers and giving them the widest interpretation. Speaking from, memory, in the cases to which I have referred four of the Judges of the High Court said that we have the power to deal with the fixing of prices. I think that Mr. Justice Duffy and Mr. Justice Rich said that we have not that power.  The gentlemen who have given their certificate in connexion with this measure say that we have the power . The New South Wales members of the Committee supplied the following certificate: - We have carefully considered this Bill, and are of opinion that it is within the competence of the Commonwealth Parliament, subject,, as regards. Part IV. (Sugar)., to the proviso that the Bill becomes law before the termination of the war. I may mention that the part dealing with sugar is the only part of the Bill in which specific reference is made to price fixing, although there is a reference to it in one of the butter regulations. The proviso which the Sydney members of the Committee consider necessary means that any Bill which we desire to pass dealing, with price fixing, must be passed before the termination of the war and Mr. Hemsley telegraphed to say - Knox and I understand 'termination of war' to be 'exchange of ratifications.' According to these gentlemen, who take the most circumscribed view of the matter, to be valid this. Bill, or any part dealing with price fixing and any provision of the kind introduced into it, must be passed before the exchange of ratification's.","Second Reading","COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Acting Attorney-General (Mr. Groom), in dealing with the dairy produce regulations, said, in reference to the dairy season - This season will terminate on the 31st August, 1920, and the Bill provides for the extension of the regulations up to that date. If honorable members will look at the regulations dealing with dairy produce set out in the schedule they will find that they cover six or seven pages of the measure, though there is only one line dealing with the subject in the Bill itself. There are some amendments that I desire to move in the Dairy Produce Regulations when we reach the Committee stage. In reference to. the Dairy Produce Control Committee, the Acting Attorney-General (Mr. Groom), when introducing the Bill, said - It was decided, therefore, to form a Pool to provide against this expected shortage. Committees chosen by the dairying and commercial interests concerned were set up in the various States, with a central committee, of which the Chief Prices Commissioner in Melbourne was the chairman. A conference was held in Melbourne, and another, later on, in Sydney, at which certain recommendations were made and approved by the Government. The honorable gentleman then referred to the amount of butter dealt with, and went on to say - The Committee consisted of the Minister - who is chairman - a deputy chairman appointed by the Minister, three nominees of the Commonwealth Government, the Commonwealth Dairy Expert, two representatives for each of the States of New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland in respect of the butter factories in those States, one representative for each of the States of South Australia and Tasmania in respect of the butter factories in those States, and one representative for each of the States of New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland in respect of the cheese factories, in those States. The representatives of the producers in the various States were elected' by ballot held on 14th October, 1918. Immediately upon the ballot being taken the Committee formerly in existence voluntarily retired and handed over to the newly-elected body...... It will be observed that the Commonwealth Dairy Expert is. to have no vote; that is, the only employee of the Commonwealth Government who is on the Committee is not allowed to vote, although the employees of the State Governments are. As I pointed out the other evening, there are fifteen persons on this Committee, and, although the producers, the manufacturers' agents, and others are represented, there is no representative of the consumers. If I, when Minister of Customs, had appointed a committee consisting of fifteen consumers only, without any representation for producers or agents, what would have been said? I trust that, in Committee, honorable members will see the advisability of providing for at least some representation of the consumers, who are certainly as important and as much entitled to it as. are producers and agents. The Acting Attorney- General will, I hope, agree that on all committees of the kind, not only employers, buyers and sellers - the latter of whom produce nothing, being merely agents or brokers - but also consumers, shall be represented. Speaking of brokers, I remember ex-Senator Trenwith, at the time of the Kyabram movement, some years ago, saying that it was worked by ' sharebrokers, pawnbrokers, and stony-brokers ' '; and I certainly think the consumers will be the ' stony- brokers ' ' if they are not allowed to have some say in the fixing of prices. We require information in regard to some of the regulations, which are certainly the most important part of the Bill - indeed, one regulation is more important than the whole of the fourteen clauses. No. 5 of the Dairy Produce Regulations is as follows: - Members of the Committee, other than the Minister, may be paid, from moneys held by the Committee, such sums as remuneration or expenses as the Minister may from time to time authorize; The Government, of course, are all. powerful, and may appoint whom they like, and pay the members of the Committee as they choose; and it is in regard to this that information is necessary. We know the personnel of various Pools, and are told that in connexion therewith certain gentlemen give their services free.","Second Reading","COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Government propose in this Bill to deal with only four or five commodities. They have already fixed the price of sugar. Under this measure they desire to fix the price of every commodity exported overseas. But, while we send only about one-fifth of our butter production (overseas, it must be remembered that the whole of the sugar manufactured in Australia is consumed locally, and that we are obliged to import more. It is now proposed to fix the price of this article, not only at the mill, but also the price at which it shall be retailed. Consequently the Legal Committee, by their opinion, affirmed that this Parliament possesses the power to fix the wholesale and retail price of sugar until September,1920. While the present juncture practically marks the termination of the War Precautions Act and of the regulations framed under it, it is significant that the 'Government are anxious to abandon -their power ito. control prices. They have accordingly (banded this power over to the States, saying, ' We must nc longer deal with this matter.' Yet, according to the opinion which I have quoted, they 'possess the power to deal with it. eternally, so long as we pass the Bill before the ' exchange of ratifications.'  It is interesting to look back upon the history of this sugar business. Within four or five weeks of the outbreak of war, the party which I have the honour to lead was returned 'by the electors of this country with a majority. Within a period of twenty-four hours after the Labour Ministry was sworn in, it prohibited the export of sugar, which had reached a very high price overseas. Wo thus saved the local consumer many thousands of pounds. If we possess the power to fix the price of sugar until the 30th 'September, 1920, I unhesitatingly say that we possess -the power to fix the price of any other commodity. To-day we are not sending a pound of sugar outside of Australia. The -position which it occupies is quite! different from -that of wool or butter, which :we are exporting. But why does not the Bill extend to shipping? When the War Precautions Act was before this Parliament, and many of us protested against its extension, we were assured that if shipping were re0leased the ship-owners would immediately increase freights and fares. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt), stated that if shipping were released, and if we did not allow the ship-owners to increase freights and fares, they would withdraw their vessels from Australian waters. But I contend that if the Government can' control sugar they can also control shipping. Wo were told not long ago that ship-owners would be able to sell their ships for double the price at which they stood in their books -at that time. During the first twelve months of the war \ustrailiion ship-owners were 'anxious to sell their vessels outside of the Commonwealth. The honorable' member for Henty (Mr. Boyd) knows that perfectly well. A number of those ships were somewhat out of date, but nobody then imagined that the war would be such a protracted one. The ship-owners at that time were under the impression that -they would- 'be able to replace their vessels with new and up-to-date ships at a less price than they would get for their own out-of-date vessels. In all probability, had they been as wise then as they are to-day, they would not have been anxious to dispose of them. We know that shipping is essential to Australia, since it is impossible to reach some parts of the Commonwealth except by steam. At an early hour this morning the honorable member for Franklin (Mr. McWilliams) called attention to the isolation of Tasmania, and I certainly think that if the Government have power to deal with sugar in this way they have power to deal with shipping. Since the Legal Committee, to whom this measure was referred, say that it is within the competence of the Parliament to pass it, it must be admitted that the Government have just as much power to deal with the shipping industry as they have to control sugar. With the exception of the sugar industry, none of the interests covered by this Bill will be likely to contest it, inasmuch as they will be better off under it than they would be without it.","Second Reading","COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[39]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In the early days of the war the Queensland Parliament passed a Sugar Acquisition Bill, under which the State Government have since dealt with many other commodities. Indeed, it may be said that the whole of the commercial activities of the Queensland State Government have been carried out under it. Meat was acquired under it to enable the contract which the Denham Government entered into with the Imperial authorities to be carried out. Beef and mutton, under that contract, were to be supplied at fixed prices, which have been varied from time to time, and in all probability, notwithstanding that the war is over, that contract will continue to operate. The position is, therefore, that beef and mutton will continue to be controlled under the Queensland State legislation, and wool will be controlled under this Bill, whereas hides will not be dealt with.

Reid,' tanner, stated that under normal conditions Australian tanners readily obtained all the hides they required, and turned out a big quantity of leather, which gave an exportable surplus of 25 per cent. On the declaration of war, the Australian hide and leather markets were greatly upset, and hides fell considerably in value, as there was no opportunity to export. Subsequently, British tanners wanted Australian hides, and opportunities were afforded for shipments to Great Britain. The prices of hides then gradually rose, until, early in February last, light hides were up 60 per cent., medium hides from 43 per cent., and heavy hides from 54 per cent.

A point that needs to be emphasized is that the advantage of this great increase in the price of hides has not been reaped by the producer. I make bold to say that hundreds of thousands of hides were held by the big meat companies. They purchased their beef on the hoof at from 40s. to' 60a. per cwt., and would estimate to receive about 55s. for a heavy hide, or, at 13d. per lb., about 60s. ' Since then, as I have said,, the price of hides has gone up to ls. 8d. per lb., so that the meat companies are reaping the advantage of the enormous increase. Those who have leather stocks are also reaping the advantage of the increase in leather values. The Government, however, say that they will leave the State Governments to deal with the price of meat, that they themselves will control the wool, but that the hides and pelts shall be free from governmental control. Every person in the community is being called upon to pay higher prices for his boots because of the failure of the Government to control the hides. The Acting Attorney-General (Mr. Groom) should tell us at once whether the Government have power to deal with hides and pelts. According to' a report of the InterState Commission, if a man goes to a timber merchant for building material he is told that he -must buy from that firm everything he wants for his building, otherwise he will not be supplied.

On the question of the examination of the lighthouses of Australia, upon which the Commonwealth proposed to spend a considerable sum of money in order to bring them up to date, I called into consultation in my office the chairman of the Steam-ship Owners Federation and the secretary of the Merchant Service Guild, although they were having a controversy in the newspapers at the time, and, apparently, were not friendly. I asked for their assistance in making a choice from among the persons who had tendered their services to do the work. Both gentlemen readily acceded to my request.

I should like to compliment the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Tudor) upon his marvellous industry. He must have spent many hours going into all the details of this measure, but, notwithstanding his industry, his speech will land him nowhere. He reminds me very much of an occasion when he introduced a Bill on the subject of navigation in this House. He sat at the table with nobody behind him, as all the members of his party were upstairs. They had gone through the Bill and left it to the Minister. He sat at the table while I made a speech from the opposite side of the House, occupying about an hour and a half, in which I brought to bear all the knowledge I possessed, covering many years of experience of shipping and the law, and simply nodded his head at me very much like a Chinese toy. In the end he did not make one single amendment. I am afraid he has been beating the wind this afternoon, and that the Minister will probably not make one alteration in the Bill as the result of the many suggestions he has made.  I take an interest in this measure, because I think I was the leading spirit in opposing an indiscriminate extension for six months of the War Precautions Act last session. It was proposed then to extend the Act with regard to all the activities at that time controlled by the Government. I pointed out that as the war was practically over, we ought, as soon as possible, to return to government by Parliament. I consider that during the last three or four years I have been paid £600 a year for doing nothing because the whole power of Parliament has been vested in heads of Departments. We have been governed by heads of Departments. None of us have had the advantage of knowing what the Ministerial intentions were, as they will be in future explained in Bills to be placed before us for consideration and criticisms. When . the Minister brought forward the Bill for the indiscriminate extension of the War Precautions Act for six months, I contended that it was altogether too general; that, as the Avar was over, he might pay us the compliment of allowing us to return to parliamentary practice, and have some opportunity of criticising Government activities. With five or six other honorable members I voted against the Bill, and as a consequence of a reduction in the Government majority the Ministry thought it wise to extend the powers for three months only instead of enacting an indiscriminate extension of war powers . for six months. I want to see a' return to parliamentary government to-day. We are a democratic community, and whether we believe that the man in the street knows as much as we do about politics, we are quite satisfied to regard this House as representing the country and to criticise measures on their merits. I urged at that time that, because of the termina-tion of the war, there was an obligation on the Government to demonstrate the necessity for an extension of any War Precautions Act powers, and that they ought to bring down a Bill at the end of three months indicating what activities it might be thought advisable to still further control. The Government have done that, and I am perfectly satisfied to leave the matter in their hands. In this measure the Government have enumerated daily produce, wool, sugar, flax, and wheat, which it is desirable further to control. Shipping is not mentioned, and in connexion with that matter I remind the Leader of the Opposition that when he is talking about shipping he always appears to be talking at me, and points his finger at me. One would think, from his general attitude, that I was fortunate enough to possess all the shipping of Australia. Perhaps he would be very much surprised to know that, although I had the honour to manage a very big company for three years, as a ship owner I now take no more interest in shipping except so far as it affects the dividends I receive. I know nothing of the details of purchase, freights, or arrangements, and therefore I would have the honorable member to- understand that, he should shake his finger at some other member, remembering that I know no more about the subject than he 'does. Asa professional man, I have learned not to use my head for nothing, unless it be foi my own edification and amusement, and ] can assure him that I am just as innocent of all these wicked practices of the snipping rings as he is. I suppose I know about as much of the shipping rings as he does of the rings in the Trades Halls of this country. The Government have done as I suggested, though I do not say it is in consequence of my observations. They have taken upon themselves the responsibility of stating in . regard to what particular subjects they desire an extension of powers, and, as the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, they have obtained the best legal talent to advise them as to the effect of existing law and laws which they propose for the future. I am perfectly satisfied, as i. private member, while we are living under the War Precautions Act, to accept the suggestion of the Government as to the necessity for extending the law in regard to those particular activities. 3 understood the Minister to say that if, as time goes on, 'they find it necessary to extend powers affecting 'other activities, they will bring down Bills and consult. Parliament. That being the case, I think the Leader of the Opposition is only beating the wind, and that when the Bill comes out of Committee he will find it has been but little altered in consequence oi' his observations this afternoon.","Second Reading","COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The honorable gentleman i; quite prepared to accept the decision oi the legal authorities consulted by the Government. ' I .do not question that decision, but it appears to me, as a layman, that there is need for some further explanation of the legal decision, because, if, as the Minister (Mr. Groom) stated, the Government must have power under the Constitution to extend the control of some commodities till 1920, and others to an earlier date, there is no reason why. the control should not be extended in regard to all commodities. If that is so, why do the Government tell us that, peace having been restored, certain commodities, the price of which was formerly controlled by the Commonwealth, must now, in accord'ance with the powers of the Constitution' revert to the control of the States? There must be something wrong in that con7tradictory statement. . If the Government can continue to regulate the prices of sugar, butter, cheese, wheat, and other commodities, surely they can do the same in regard to every commodity; no line of demarcation can be drawn between one set of articles and another. What is legal in respect of one commodity must be legal in respect of others. I find the Minister's statement a little perplexing. Frequently legislation which has passed this Parliament has been found, when tested in the Courts, to be ultra vires, ind we ought, therefore, to be very careful not to pass legislation that is possibly beyond the province of the Commonwealth.

There is considerable- danger in this Bill. If the contention of the Minister is correct, what are we to say t'o. the people when it appears that we have extended the control of certain commodities under this measure, whilst we have permitted to continue unchecked the profiteering in other commodities? We must be logical. Either we can control all commodities, or we can control none. The honorable member for Parkes (Mr. Bruce Smith) said that the Minister will have power to add from time to time to the commodities 'mentioned in the Bill. If that is so, the Parliament must have power to bring within the scope of the measure all the necessaries of life', and there can be no justification for permitting profiteering to continue one minute longer. How can we shelter ourselves behind the people by saying that before we can act we must have an amendment of the Constitution? If the opinion upon which the Minister is acting be sound, no amendment of the Constitution is necessary,. I admit that when the Fisher Government were in power we were advised that an amendment of the Constitution was necessary before the Federal Parliament could legally deal with trade and commerce and monopolies. We appealed to the people, and they rejected our proposal. But in the light of the latest legal opinion, it appears as if there is no longer any necessity to take a referendum of the electors; we have the constitutional power to deal with trade if we only care to exercise it. If it be true that we can legally do the things which this Bill seeks to do, I shall not go before the people and shelter myself and Parliament behind the plea that we have no constitutional power. That is a position which the Government will be obliged to face, During the recent debate, whenever any one on this side mentioned the cost of living and pointed out the necessity of this Parliament doing something to regulate it, there was a chorus from the other side to this effect : ' Oh, we cannot do anything; we have not the power. The war is over; it is now a matter for the States.' Even the Minister now sitting at the table said it was. Now we find it is a matter not for the States, but for this Parliament. Why, then, are we shirking our responsibilities? There seems to be no room for argument if that legal opinion is correct. I believe it will be found that this Parliament has not the power that it should have to deal with these matters, but I am not a legal man, and my opinion does not justify the Government, who believe they have the power, in permitting certain things to go from their control, and certain individuals to charge exorbitant prices. R&cently the Leader of the Opposition and myself asked what justification there was for this Parliament permitting the price of boots to rise as it is doing. It can be raised now week after week if those interested wish it. The Minister says that . the reason they allow it is that they no longer have control over them.","Second Reading","COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This measure not only covers those commodities where they are contracted for, but also where there is no contract in existence. Yet the Government intend to allow some things to go unchecked, and people handling certain lines to make additional profits, because increases' are taking place every day. Those interested are not satisfied for one week. Directly they get an increase, up goes the price again, and we are allowing this fo go on. The honorable member for Wilmot (Mr. Atkinson) says the Constitution will not permit us to interfere, but the Constitution will permit the Government to regulate the price of butter, cheese, sugar, and wool to the people of Australia. If the Constitution permits the Government to do that up to the end of 1920 for certain specified articles, it will permit them to do it for everything that they care to specify in this Bill. This measure, therefore, will not give the satisfaction which the public expect. I question very much whether it will stand the test of an appeal to the High Court. The Government ought to be sure about the constitutionality of any measure that they bring forth, and get the best legal advice to guide them. We should not be doing certain things, and setting up new Departments, in the dark.  The honorable member for Parkes (Mr. Bruce Smith') rightly pointed out that we have been governed by Departments for a long time past. I have said the same thing myself here, and many of those Departments have not given the satisfaction that the public expected. Having established that system of government, however, we cannot abandon it all at once. It must be a matter of gradual evolution, and during that evolution the people should be protected in regard to all commodities, and not only in relation to certain specified articles. The dairy farmer has no greater sympathizer in .this House than myself. I know how he and his family have to toil. He has a perfect right to get a fair price for his commodities, and I do not think he is getting more than a fair price now. But what happens between the man that produces and the man who retails the stuff to the consumer? That is where the leakage takes place, and we are making no endeavour to control it. We are allowing those interested a free hand. If, later on, we ask the people to give us greater powers to control these things, Ave shall lay ourselves open to the charge of hypocrisy, because, when we had the power, we would not attempt to exercise it. How is the public protected on the Boards enumerated in the schedules? See Who are on those Boards, and you will find that the consumers have no representatives. If we seriously intend to try to keep down the cost of living, 'and to do what is right between man and man - out guiding principle in fixing prices should be to see that the man who produces gets a fair return to enable him to keep his family in decent comfort and provide for old age, and also that the consumer gets a fair deal - we should give both sides representation on these controlling Boards. Whoever represents the general public on the Boards will be able, to put the point of view of the consumer. Surely he will carry some weight, and he may be able to prevent exorbitant charges being made to the people of Australia. The Minister says we have contracts for certain things entered into by these Boards. The Boards seem always to take the ruling price abroad as the guiding principle, and then expect the people here, in a country which produces in abundance, to pay exactly the same as they would have to pay in other parts of the world which depend on us for supplies; although so many miles of sea roll between us and them that the cost in freight alone to carry our commodities to them represents a good deal of money. Even then tremendous profits are made out of our produce. The Boards persist in regarding the needs of our own people from the stand-point of the demands of the people abroad, and this is due to the fact that only one class is represented on them - that is, those directly concerned in the commodities which are dealt with. That sort of thing should not continue. Now that the Minister proposes to prolong these controls until the and of 1920, why does he not invite the House to alter the composition of the Boards? Why does he not provide for representatives of the consumers to have seats on those bodies during the remainder of the term? The honorable member for Grampians (Mr. Jowett) told us the other night that his Board did not charge the same for wool here as they exported it for.

We regulate the price of sugar, for instance, through the Customs Department. A few months ago the honorable member for Newcastle (Mr. Watkins) and myself got a surprise. The co-operative people asked us to meet them at Newcastle, and pointed out what the wholesale merchants were doing. When I speak of the wholesale merchants, I invite honorable members to look at the Inter-State Commission's report on groceries, and see who they are. They are called the Co-operative Distribution Company, and certain wholesale firms are members. They fix the prices. Manufacturers have to supply them, and they distribute to the retailers. It is claimed that they are fixing exorbitant prices. This wholesale Co-operative Distribution Company evidently had sufficient influence to deal with the Government in regard to sugar. A certain rebate was given to all who bought sugar from that source. But it is strange that the various co-operative societies, which belong to the consumers themselves, and are not capitalistic concerns, did. not secure the rebate which was allowed to other storekeepers. The co-operative societies in my district, where they are strongly established and have their own wholesale society, could not get sugar on the same terms as other retailers, although it is a commodity which the Government are regulating.","Second Reading","COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/continue[11]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

He may think that it is entirely wrong, but he will not come out and stand on his own and make a fuss about it. The great majority of the persons who compose these Boards are interested in the commodities with which they deal, and they fix the prices in their own interests. I ask the Acting Attorney-General (Mr. Groom) to say that something will be done to give the public a say in these matters, by securing their representation on these Boards.  If the Minister has the power he thinks he has, though I doubt it, there is no reason, why he should not bring other commodities under the Bill; there is no reason, for instance, why leather should not be included, and thus bring about a reduction in the price of boots, instead of the constant inflation we have experienced. This is a matter entirely in our own hands; and I ask the Minister to consider what I have said with a view of doing something which will give a little meed of satisfaction to .the general public. Unless something is done in regard to the fixing of prices in the near future, and thus some relief given in connexion with the cost of living, I see nothing but trouble ahead. People cannot be kept in submission all the time. It redounds to the credit of the people of this community .that, although they were hard pressed during the -war, .and had to go short of many things, they felt that a patriotic duty devolved on them to make sacrifices. Many, owing to their age, were not able to go to the Front, but they made what sacrifices lay within their power. Now, however, they cannot continue to make those sacrifices; their stocks of clothing have worn out, and their purchasing power is not sufficient to secure more; and they anticipate that, now Peace has been signed, some effort will be made to quickly return to normal conditions. As I say, unless some relief is afforded, I see nothing before us but chaos, leading we know not where. I am one who believes, and always have believed, that whatever we do should be done in a constitutional way, because with adult suffrage all the power is in our hands..

I was one who urged as strongly as possible that, when the war ceased, the unconstitutional method of Government control under this Act should cease with it. Although we were unable when we last met, at the end of 1918, to get our own way in the matter, we got a promise from the Government that the operation of this Act would be curtailed as far as possible, and at the earliest possible moment; and this Bill, T take it, is the fulfilment of that promise. Whether it will prove of any value lies in the wom!b of the future. A certificate has been given by some very eminent legal gentlemen regarding the constitutionality of the Bill, and, naturally, a layman ought to hold his breath 'before expressing an opinion adverse to theirs. But what was submitted to those gentlemen for decision?","Second Reading","COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If to-morrow we learned that they have already done this, clearly a doubt would exist in the minds of Messrs. Knox and Hemsley, two of the Sydney members of the Committee who have given their opinion on the question of the constitutionality of this Bill, so far as sugar is concerned. If the measure would not be legal in the case of sugar, how could it be legal in the case of other commodities? If we desire to get this matter in proper perspective, we must view it from the stand-point of the conditions which existed prior to the war. If we had no power to deal with these matters then, I venture to say that we shall have no power to deal with them after the war. If the validity of the Bill be contested before the Court it is quite possible that it will be held to be ultra vires of our Constitution. If that result were achieved many matters would be materially complicated. But quite apart from sugar, other commodities which the Government desire to bring within the scope of this measure would affect a number of producers, who will probably realize higher prices for their products under Government control than they could otherwise do. That being the case, it is more than unlikely that a test case would be put up. On the other hand, I am assured that the jam manufacturers of the Commonwealth intend to contest the Commonwealth power in regard to fixing the price of sugar.","Second Reading","COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/para[4]","N/A","N/A"

In connexion with repatriation work, and the welcoming home of our returned soldiers, we have, in many centres, associations and societies which, by means of concerts and other entertainments, raise funds to enable the returning men to be entertained. The officer administering the entertainments tax holds, that such entertainments are subject to the (tax if the expenses of conducting them amount to 50 per cent, of the gross proceeds. As the number of returning men increases, with a consequent increase in the ' welcome home ' functions, more and more difficulty is being experienced in securing a full attendance at these gatherings. A charge is -made for admission merely to recoup the societies the expense incurred. They very often find nowadays that, instead of having a surplus, they have a deficit, and the taxing officer thereupon demands that the tax shall be paid on admission tickets. This is a rather serious matter for the people concerned, many of whom are not in affluent circumstances, and have to provide the tax out of their own pockets. It seems to me that if the officer were to ' turn a blind eye ' on such cases, he would do more good to the community than he does by taking a strictly technical view of the wording of the Act.  In another case, to which I shall refer in detail later on, the power of the Department has been used in a most extraordinary way because of the inexperience of the man concerned. This man, who is a miner, failed to secure the authority which he could have secured from the Department, exempting from the provisions of the Entertainments Tax Act the patriotic entertainment for which he was responsible. Notwithstanding that his mistake was due to inexperience, the Department put him to the expense of a trial, sent counsel to the town where the trial took place, and compelled him to pay the costs of the prosecution. And all this because of his failure to pay the tax on tickets of admission to a patriotic entertainment which was conducted by him without any object of personal gain. So far as I can see, there was not the slightest justification for the action of the Department, which refuses to grant any redress. I hope the Treasurer will look into these cases, and see whether the strict letter of the law should be enforced in respect of patriotic and charitable entertainments that are not a source of profit, but, on the contrary, an actual loss to the promoters.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I am not able to say whether the cases cited by the honorable member are within or outside the Act, but my own view is that the law was never intended to burden gatherings of the kind described by him. I shall take an early opportunity of ascertaining exactly the purport of the law with respect to such entertainments, and, should it be necessary, in the judgment of the Government, to amend that law, 1 shall not hesitate to ask Parliament to alter it.  The honorable; member for Barrier (Mr. Considine) has referred to the case, of Paul Freeman.

I do not love punishment, but if the men who take responsibility for dealing with cases of this, kind are unable to do the job, they should relinquish it. If they undertake the work, they should deal with it in the spirit in which the Parliament hoped and intended that it should be carried out.  On Wednesday next, either one or both of the Bills relating to the War Precautions Regulations will be advanced to the stage which the Commercial Activities Bill has reached. We shall then go on with the Commercial Activities Bill until it is passed. On Wednesday we shall meet at the usual hour and sit in the afternoon and evening. If it will suit the convenience of honorable members, we shall meet on Thursday at 11 o'clock in the morning, and if we make reasonable progress, Inter-State members who desire to do so may catch the Inter-State expresses. This will enable them to reach their respective States in order to take part in the Peace celebrations. If it can be arranged with the concurrence of honorable members on both sides, I hope it will be possible to have a similar sitting on Friday. However, we can settle that point on Wednesday next. Question resolved in the affirmative.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[5]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
